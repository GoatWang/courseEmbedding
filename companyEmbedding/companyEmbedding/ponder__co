The service is free to try and subscription based for teachers and schools.
GOALS
	Ponder is a digital “micro-reading response” tool that facilitates analysis of a text and collaboration with other students and teachers while reading. The product was created with the goal of encouraging students to think deeply about their reading assignments and research.
APPROACH
	Students can use Ponder to extract key pieces of information from their reading by “flagging” excerpts. Using the tags developed by their teacher, students tie these excerpts and reflections to the concepts they are studying or discussing in class. Students can see what their classmates are reading and what they are saying about those articles. When watching video, students can attach their micro-responses to points along the video timeline.
	In addition to its literacy content offerings, Ponder also provides teachers and students with constant and concise data reports covering rate of completion, depth and breadth of reading across topic areas, etc. The platform presents this data to students in visual chunks based on the amount of reading activity of each student. Ponder presents teachers with a “class feed” that aggregates all of their students’ activity and responses.  Ponder also tracks student activity day-to-day, allowing teachers to identify students who are not completing work and falling behind.
IMPLEMENTATION
	 Ponder can be accessed at schools by teachers and students alike through whatever browser they use. Students can also use Ponder on their own at home, tagging excerpts and reflecting on any articles or videos on the internet.
PRICING
	Ponder is available with all of its core features for free. For additional features, teachers can purchase a subscription for $195/year, with a free trial for their first semester. District or site licenses are also available for $2/student/year. More information is available on the company’s website.
WHO IS USING IT
	As of June 2015, Ponder was used by over 5,000 students and teachers in dozens of schools.READ MOREEDUCATOR REVIEWSCase Studies+Write a Case StudyAre you a teacher or administrator who has used this product?

About Bioverse, Inc.





Bioverse's Operating Philosophy is Founded on Four Guiding Principles:

1. Natural products are a better alternative to chemicals. Bioverse's products contain bacteria and enzymes found in nature. We feature biodegradable and reusable products that cost no more than chemicals and actually save our customers money over time.
2. We offer solutions for water problems big and small. For applications of all kinds, Bioverse has an all natural solution to improve water quality, clarity and algae removal. Bioverse's products are used at Camp David, in the reflecting ponds in our nation's capital, and at golf courses, municipal sites, cranberry bogs, backyard fountains, ponds, and in fish tanks throughout the U.S.
3. Bioverse pond cleaning products are easy to use. All of our solutions have been designed with ease in mind. Most products are simply applied to the water and replaced monthly. Bioverse provides a patented delivery system for 24 hour a day, 7 day a week, 30 day per month treatment programs. Our biodegradable products dissolve over time for more effective application and more environmental compatibility.
4. Bioverse can improve your water. We have an exceptional track record of improving water quality for more than a decade. Bioverse was founded with the mission of creating all natural solutions for common water problems. Our products help people, animals, and the environment. Today, Bioverse's products are available across the US and are being used successfully to improve water quality in an increasing number of ways and locations.

Our History
Bioverse was founded in 1995 as a research and development company. After four years of formulation, testing, and approvals, Bioverse introduced its first line of commercial products in 1999.
From its inception, Bioverse has created innovative ways to enhance water quality, such as the development of the patented AquaSpherePRO and Pond Water Cleaner dispenser. These dispensers, combined with state of the art Continuous Release Technology, consume excess nutrients in ponds and lakes. Once submerged, the dispenser becomes an on-site bacteria factory, by incubating, growing, and dispensing beneficial bacteria 24/7 for up to 30 days. The AquaSpherePRO, Pond Water Cleaner, and AquaLily enjoy high success rates in ponds and larger bodies of water which are ecologically balanced.
In 2008, the company was purchased by a committed group of long-time investors. This investor group believes in the long-term benefits of all natural products that assist bioremediation in ponds, lakes, and other types of water both large and small.

About Us

We have been providing financial services for not-for-profit hospitals and healthcare systems for more than 40 years. With complete objectivity, we advise clients on the most suitable and prudent way to access capital.In addition, we provide unsurpassed market expertise in the analysis and application of interest rate swaps and other derivative products. We also provide Mergers & Acquisitions advisory services and we manage cash and fixed income investments.Our ultimate goal is to empower our clients with the information they need to make the most informed decisions.Our sole focus is to serve as a financial advisor to not-for-profit hospitals and healthcare systems.  We have refined our services to concentrate on three critical areas: Capital Advisory & Derivatives, Mergers & Acquisitions and Investment Management.Our ExpertiseCapital Advisory & DerivativesMergers & AcquisitionsInvestment ManagementCapital Advisory & DerivativesPonder & Co. is the leading U.S. independent financial advisor to healthcare organizations seeking access to the bond markets. Our expertise includes credit and debt capacity analysis as well as detailed knowledge of financial products such as bonds, interest rate swaps, other derivatives and guaranteed investment contracts. Learn more >Mergers & AcquisitionsBuying and selling operating assets are infrequent activities for most healthcare providers. Certainly, these activities occur less often than accessing the capital markets. Consequently, healthcare providers can benefit from the active involvement of an independent financial advisor with experience in valuing healthcare assets and negotiating the terms and conditions of buying or selling those businesses or engaging in other forms of change of control transactions.Learn more >Investment ManagementPonder Investment Co. (PIC) provides fixed income investment management solutions for healthcare institutions, universities and other not-for-profit institutions. We manage  $2+ billion in assets including bond proceeds, self-insurance funds, funded depreciation accounts, board designated funds and excess working capital funds.Learn more >Our TeamWe believe no single professional can possess all of the knowledge and experience clients require. That is why we believe in the team-of-experts concept. A senior officer is in charge of each client relationship. As unique needs arise, other specialists in our company can be called upon to provide clients with the benefit of their expertise.For example, during a client engagement with a healthcare system that was developing its plan for the future, we drew upon one expert to create a financial model and assess the system's credit, while three additional executives utilized their expertise to design an interest rate swap, price its bonds and invest the funds it raised.Our people offer three key advantages:Senior-level executives are strategically paired with clients.  Each relationship manager has a minimum 20 years of experience.We focus exclusively on financial services for the healthcare industry. This gives our staff a rare level of expertise, which they devote full-time to clients — free of conflicts of interests.Each of our staff specializes in one product or service: capital advisory work, derivatives, Mergers & Acquisitions or investment management. As experts in their areas, they save our clients time and money while adding value to the process.We invite you to get to know us, Meet Our Team.Latest News
