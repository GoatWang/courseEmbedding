Product details[edit]
The Coravin System uses a medical grade needle and a capsule of Argon gas to pour a bottle of wine through the cork. The cork is never removed. This helps prevent oxidation, increasing the longevity of the wine. It accomplishes this by first inserting a hollow needle through the cork. The user then presses a trigger to pressurize the bottle with argon gas. When the user releases the trigger, the wine pours into the glass. The needle is removed from the cork, a naturally elastic and porous material, which then reseals, protecting the wine from oxidation and leaving the remaining wine unaffected.[10]
Reception[edit]
When it launched in July 2013, the Coravin System garnered attention from both media and wine professionals, described by some as “transformational,” and a “game changer” due to the potential to change wine consumption habits.

Jancis Robinson, Financial Times, "Nothing I know of preserves wine in an opened or 'accessed' bottle for years as this system does."[11]
Joe Bastianich, restaurateur, wine expert, and Coravin Investor, “This product is nothing short of amazing for both restaurateurs and wine lovers alike."[12]
Jennifer Jolly, USA Today, “Wine lovers rejoice! The ridiculously cool Coravin System can provide a glass of wine from a bottle without ever actually popping the cork, preserving the freshness of the vessel with zero hassle.”[13]
Alder Yarrow, Founder and Editor of Vinography, “I’ve never written a product review on Vinography because I’ve never met a wine accessory that was worth writing about. But there’s a first time for everything, apparently.”[14]
Cook's Illustrated, “The results were indisputable: Tasters found the wines we poured from Coravin, which had been open for a month, just as good as wine from freshly opened bottles.”
Gear Patrol “The Coravin wine system ($299) is to wine what the black hat is to the white rabbit: a magician’s portal. Without removing the cork (which would aerate the wine and disrupt the rest of the bottle), it takes the wine inside the bottle and allows you to pour it outside the bottle. How it works is relevant and interesting on the level that all small engineering marvels are interesting, but the big reveal is the fact that it actually does work.”[15]

By June 2014, 13 complaints had been made of broken bottles following use of the Coravin. Coravin's founder estimates that only 1 in 70,000 bottles will break and he attributes the issue to bottles that have been previously dropped and cracked. In response to the complaints, Coravin sent purchasers a neoprene protective sock to cover the bottles.[16]
Awards[edit]
The Coravin System has been nominated and won several awards for recognition in innovation or technology.

November 2013 – Popular Science “Best of What’s New” in the Home category.[17]
December 2013 – La Revue du vin de France “the most innovative product in the world of wine” for 2013.[18]
May 2014, The Drinks Business (magazine) “Best Product Launch.”[19]
April 2014, Edison Awards – Gold in the “Consumer Products” Category
June 2015, The American Business Awards – Silver Stevie Award in “Startup of the Year” Category
July 2015, International Design Excellence Awards – Finalist in “Kitchen Accessories” Category

Product details[edit]
The Coravin System uses a medical grade needle and a capsule of Argon gas to pour a bottle of wine through the cork. The cork is never removed. This helps prevent oxidation, increasing the longevity of the wine. It accomplishes this by first inserting a hollow needle through the cork. The user then presses a trigger to pressurize the bottle with argon gas. When the user releases the trigger, the wine pours into the glass. The needle is removed from the cork, a naturally elastic and porous material, which then reseals, protecting the wine from oxidation and leaving the remaining wine unaffected.[10]
Reception[edit]
When it launched in July 2013, the Coravin System garnered attention from both media and wine professionals, described by some as “transformational,” and a “game changer” due to the potential to change wine consumption habits.

Jancis Robinson, Financial Times, "Nothing I know of preserves wine in an opened or 'accessed' bottle for years as this system does."[11]
Joe Bastianich, restaurateur, wine expert, and Coravin Investor, “This product is nothing short of amazing for both restaurateurs and wine lovers alike."[12]
Jennifer Jolly, USA Today, “Wine lovers rejoice! The ridiculously cool Coravin System can provide a glass of wine from a bottle without ever actually popping the cork, preserving the freshness of the vessel with zero hassle.”[13]
Alder Yarrow, Founder and Editor of Vinography, “I’ve never written a product review on Vinography because I’ve never met a wine accessory that was worth writing about. But there’s a first time for everything, apparently.”[14]
Cook's Illustrated, “The results were indisputable: Tasters found the wines we poured from Coravin, which had been open for a month, just as good as wine from freshly opened bottles.”
Gear Patrol “The Coravin wine system ($299) is to wine what the black hat is to the white rabbit: a magician’s portal. Without removing the cork (which would aerate the wine and disrupt the rest of the bottle), it takes the wine inside the bottle and allows you to pour it outside the bottle. How it works is relevant and interesting on the level that all small engineering marvels are interesting, but the big reveal is the fact that it actually does work.”[15]

By June 2014, 13 complaints had been made of broken bottles following use of the Coravin. Coravin's founder estimates that only 1 in 70,000 bottles will break and he attributes the issue to bottles that have been previously dropped and cracked. In response to the complaints, Coravin sent purchasers a neoprene protective sock to cover the bottles.[16]
Awards[edit]
The Coravin System has been nominated and won several awards for recognition in innovation or technology.

November 2013 – Popular Science “Best of What’s New” in the Home category.[17]
December 2013 – La Revue du vin de France “the most innovative product in the world of wine” for 2013.[18]
May 2014, The Drinks Business (magazine) “Best Product Launch.”[19]
April 2014, Edison Awards – Gold in the “Consumer Products” Category
June 2015, The American Business Awards – Silver Stevie Award in “Startup of the Year” Category
July 2015, International Design Excellence Awards – Finalist in “Kitchen Accessories” Category

Jennifer Jolly, USA Today, “Wine lovers rejoice! The ridiculously cool Coravin System can provide a glass of wine from a bottle without ever actually popping the cork, preserving the freshness of the vessel with zero hassle.”[13]
Alder Yarrow, Founder and Editor of Vinography, “I’ve never written a product review on Vinography because I’ve never met a wine accessory that was worth writing about. But there’s a first time for everything, apparently.”[14]
Cook's Illustrated, “The results were indisputable: Tasters found the wines we poured from Coravin, which had been open for a month, just as good as wine from freshly opened bottles.”
Gear Patrol “The Coravin wine system ($299) is to wine what the black hat is to the white rabbit: a magician’s portal. Without removing the cork (which would aerate the wine and disrupt the rest of the bottle), it takes the wine inside the bottle and allows you to pour it outside the bottle. How it works is relevant and interesting on the level that all small engineering marvels are interesting, but the big reveal is the fact that it actually does work.”[15]

By June 2014, 13 complaints had been made of broken bottles following use of the Coravin. Coravin's founder estimates that only 1 in 70,000 bottles will break and he attributes the issue to bottles that have been previously dropped and cracked. In response to the complaints, Coravin sent purchasers a neoprene protective sock to cover the bottles.[16]
Awards[edit]
The Coravin System has been nominated and won several awards for recognition in innovation or technology.

November 2013 – Popular Science “Best of What’s New” in the Home category.[17]
December 2013 – La Revue du vin de France “the most innovative product in the world of wine” for 2013.[18]
May 2014, The Drinks Business (magazine) “Best Product Launch.”[19]
April 2014, Edison Awards – Gold in the “Consumer Products” Category
June 2015, The American Business Awards – Silver Stevie Award in “Startup of the Year” Category
July 2015, International Design Excellence Awards – Finalist in “Kitchen Accessories” Category

Discover Why Coravin Capsules Are a Cut Above the Rest.




Can I use alternative argon capsules with my Coravin System? NO. It is important to ONLY use authentic Coravin Capsules with your Coravin System. Coravin Capsules are specially designed to work with the Coravin System. Alternative argon capsules will not seal correctly, will leak, and may result in injury to the user or others nearby. Do not attempt to refill the capsules yourself, as only the unique Coravin Capsules guarantee the flavor and lifespan of your wine.
What is in the Coravin Capsule? The Coravin Capsule contains pure argon, a naturally occurring inert gas that winemakers have been using for years to protect their fine wines during the winemaking process. So savor that glass, knowing it’s non-toxic and perfectly safe to use with wine.
How many glasses can I access with each Coravin Capsule? Each Coravin Capsule will allow you to pour up to 15 glasses of wine. Capsule longevity will vary, depending on how you use the Coravin System, as well as how often and how much you pressurize each bottle.
How should I store my Coravin Capsules? Coravin Capsules can be stored anywhere from a kitchen cabinet to wine cellar, just be sure the temperature is between -22° and 149° F, (-30° to +65° C). Feel free to stock up, Coravin Capsules have a long shelf life.
How do I dispose of empty Coravin Capsules? Coravin Capsules are made of recyclable steel. Prior to recycling, please contact your local city or town waste management facility for instructions concerning the disposal of empty compressed gas cylinders. Please do not dispose of unopened capsules.

ABOUT CORAVIN


Coravin is changing the way the world drinks wine
Coravin, Inc. is a privately held company located in Burlington, Massachusetts focused on transforming the way wine is served, sold and enjoyed. Coravin designs and markets the Coravin Systems for wine enthusiasts, restaurants, wine stores and wineries. Unparalleled in craftsmanship and design, Coravin uses proprietary patented technology to access and pour wine from a bottle without pulling the cork. Wine enthusiasts can now enjoy wine sealed with corks without feeling the need to commit to the whole bottle, allowing them to explore wines of any vintage, varietal or region, one taste at a time.
Coravin was founded by Greg Lambrecht, a medical device inventor and executive with a passion for wine and innovative technology. He was inspired to bring the two worlds together to solve and create a product that allowed him to enjoy glasses of wine without committing to the whole bottle. Greg spent years testing and improving upon his original design until the Coravin System became what it is today. Greg was approached by his friend, successful entrepreneur and wine enthusiast Josh Makower, and together they began to build a world-class company.

          Commission.

Company Summary


Coravin, LLC is a privately held company located in Burlington, Mass. focused on transforming the way wine is served, sold and enjoyed. Coravin designs and markets the Coravin Wine Access System for wine enthusiasts, restaurants, wine stores and wineries. Unparalleled in craftsmanship and design, Coravin uses proprietary patented technology to access and pour wine from a bottle without pulling the cork. Wine enthusiasts can now enjoy fine wines sealed with corks without feeling the need to commit to the whole bottle, allowing them to explore wines of any vintage, varietal or region, one taste at a time. With Coravin, the world's first product of its kind, after accessing the remaining wine in the bottle continues to evolve naturally and can be enjoyed later since the wine was never exposed to oxygen. 

Coravin was founded by Greg Lambrecht, a medical device inventor and executive with a passion for wine and innovative technology who was inspired to bring the two worlds together in order to solve an age old problem -- tasting fine wine without committing to the bottle. Greg persevered for years in order to perfect the design of the Coravin. He brought on successful serial entrepreneur and wine aficionado Josh Makower to build the company. Together they attracted accomplished CEO Nick Lazaris, formerly the CEO of Keurig, to join the team to help build a world-class company and product line. Coravin's long anticipated premiere product, the Coravin 1000, is now available for purchase at Coravin.com

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Joint recall with Health Canada, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (US CPSC) and Coravin, Inc.


Affected products


 Wine Access System 

Product description 
 This recall involves the CoravinTM 1000 Wine Access Systems.  The system uses a hollow needle to penetrate a wine bottle cork and allow wine to be dispensed without removing the cork.

 The system is approximately 23 centimetres tall and has a silver-coloured, metallic tubular body with a detachable black plastic capsule cup attached to the bottom and trigger on the top. A black metal handle is attached at the top of the tube and a black metal, moveable bottle clamp is attached to the front side of the tube. A long, metallic needle protrudes from the underside of the handle.

 The Coravin name and logo appears on the front side of the tube. The system comes with a silver-coloured storage base and two argon gas capsules.
Hazard identified 
 The system can cause wine bottles to break during pressurization, posing a risk of lacerations.

 Coravin has received 13 reports of the bottles breaking, including four in which the bottles cracked and leaked, eight in which the bottles broke into pieces, and one in which the bottle burst into four pieces and resulted in injury involving two chipped teeth and laceration that required stitches.  No reports of incidents or injuries have been reported in Canada.

 Health Canada has not received any reports of consumer incidents or injuries related to the use of these products.
Number sold 
 Approximately 639 units of the recalled products were sold in Canada and 32,960 in the United States through on-line sales and internet resellers.
Time period sold 
 The recalled products were sold from July 2013 to June 2014 in Canada and the United States.
Place of origin 
 Manufactured in China.

Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled wine access system and contact Coravin for a free repair kit that includes a Coravin wine bottle sleeve to contain broken glass when a bottle breaks with updated instructions and warnings. The wine access system should not be used on wine bottles with damages or flaws.

 For more information, consumers may contact Coravin, Inc. by telephone at 1-844-267-2846 from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET Monday through Friday, or via email.

 Consumers may view the release by the US CPSC on the Commission's website.

 Please note that the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act prohibits recalled products from being redistributed, sold or even given away in Canada.

 Health Canada would like to remind Canadians to report any health or safety incidents related to the use of this product or any other consumer product or cosmetic by filling out the Consumer Product Incident Report Form.

Recall Details

Description:
This recall involves all Coravin 1000 Wine Access Systems. The system uses a hollow needle to penetrate a wine bottle cork and allow wine to be dispensed without removing the cork. The system is about nine inches tall and has a silver-colored, metallic tubular body with a detachable black plastic capsule cup attached to the bottom and trigger on the top. A black metal handle is attached at the top of the tube and a black metal, moveable bottle clamp is attached to the front side of the tube. A long, metallic needle protrudes from the underside of the handle. The Coravin name and logo appear on the front side of the tube. The system comes with a silver-colored storage base and two argon gas capsules.

 

Remedy: 
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled wine access system and contact Coravin for a free repair kit that includes a neoprene wine bottle sleeve to contain broken glass when a bottle breaks and updated instructions and warnings. The wine access system should not be used on wine bottles with damages or flaws.


Incidents/Injuries: 
Coravin has received 13 reports of bottles breaking, including one in which a bottle burst into four pieces and resulted in an injury involving two chipped teeth and a laceration that required stitches, four in which the bottles cracked and leaked, and eight in which bottles broke into two pieces.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
