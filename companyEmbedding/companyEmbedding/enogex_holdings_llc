	
IV.	FACTUAL BACKGROUND

12.	On December 8, 2010, an explosion and fire ("The Incident") occurred at one of Enogex's natural gas cryogenic processing facilities located at 1747 County Road 1530, Rush Springs, Oklahoma ("Cox City Facility"). Enogex acquired the Cox City Facility from Transok, Inc. ("Transok") as a result of an acquisition and merger.
13.	The Cox City Facility includes four separate gas processing plants consisting of various skids containing different components as well as other piping and equipment. The Incident originated in what is referred to as Plant 4.
14.	Plant 4 was designed, specified, assembled, installed, and sold by Pro-Quip to Transok in 1995.
15.	The fire and explosion originated in the E400/420 heat exchanger ("Chart Exchanger") that was a part of and located in Plant 4. This exchanger was approximately 20 feet tall and almost four feet wide, standing vertically. Although a separate piece of equipment designed to carry out a separate function of taking heat from some gas and transferring it to other gas, the Chart Exchanger worked in conjunction with other pieces of equipment and piping to process natural gas.
16.	The Chart Exchanger was designed and manufactured by Altec (then a wholly- owned subsidiary of Chart) and delivered to Pro-Quip in 1995. Defendant William J. Leathen acted as an engineer or engineering-related professional, approving and signing the as-built engineering drawing for Altec, certifying the Chart Exchanger for production.
17.	Pro-Quip installed the Chart Exchanger in Plant 4. The Chart Exchanger was installed as a piece of equipment that was distinguishable from the rest of the equipment installed in Plant 4.


4
739821


18.	Defendant Donald R. Allen was Pro-Quip's Project Manager and engineer for the specification, approval, assembly, and installation of Plant 4 and the Chart Exchanger. He  approved the Chart Exchanger  for construction.
19.	The Incident resulted from the catastrophic rupture of the Chart Exchanger, which occurred when highly pressurized hydrocarbons leaked into an inactive zone located between two halves of the Chart Exchanger that had been welded together ("Inactive Zone") by Altec. The Inactive Zone served no useful function for the processing of natural gas. It was not accessible from outside the Chart Exchanger so the end user (in this case Enogex) had no way of understanding its defective and unreasonably dangerous nature. This design was defective because the streams on either side of the Inactive Zone were designed to contain between 450 PSIG and 1100 PSIG of pressure, yet the Inactive Zone was designed to withstand only 15 PSIG of pressure. When the highly pressurized hydrocarbons entered the Inactive Zone, the Chart Exchanger was violently ripped apart, without any warning. As a result, large amounts of pressurized hydrocarbon gas escaped causing a large explosion and fire.
20.	The Incident resulted in damage to the Chart Exchanger, the other equipment of Plant 4, and other parts of the Cox City Facility (outside of Plant   4).
21.	The Incident resulted in significant damages to Enogex in excess of the amount required  for diversity jurisdiction  pursuant to 28 USC  § 1332.
V.	CAUSES OF ACTION COUNT I
(STRICT LIABILITY - DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING DEFECTS AGAINST ALTEC AND CHART)

22.	Plaintiffs  incorporate by reference  Paragraphs  1 through  21 as though fully   pied

herein.


5
739821

	
23.	Altec designed and sold the Chart Exchanger.

24.	At the time of the design, manufacture, and sale of the Chart Exchanger, Altec was in the business of manufacturing and selling heat exchangers.
25.	The Chart Exchanger was defective because the Inactive Zone was not designed to withstand the normal operating pressures of the Chart Exchanger. Altec should have either designed the Inactive Zone to withstand the normal operating pressures of the Chart Exchanger, properly vented the Inactive Zone, or eliminated the Inactive Zone altogether.
26.	The Chart Exchanger failed certain hydrotests prior to its sale and installation, indicating a manufacturing defect with certain portions of the exchanger, creating the potential for internal leaks that could reasonably be expected to release pressure into the Inactive Zone, and lead to catastrophic failure.
27.	The Chart Exchanger was defective at the time it was designed, manufactured, and left the control of Altec.
28.	The Chart Exchanger was expected to and did reach Enogex without substantial change in the condition in which it left the control of Altec.
29.	The Chart Exchanger was unreasonably dangerous to an extent not contemplated by Enogex in that it was defective in a number of ways, including but not limited to design, workmanship, construction, manufacture, marketing, and testing.
30.	Enogex used the Chart Exchanger as intended, and as a result of these design defects, the Chart Exchanger was not reasonably fit for the ordinary purposes for which it was intended to be used by, or could have reasonably been expected to be used by, Enogex.
31.	The defect in the Chart Exchanger was a direct and proximate cause of the Incident.


6
739821


32.	Without the design defect described above, any failure of the Chart Exchanger would likely have been non-catastrophic. That is, a leak in a heat exchanger without this particular design defect would not result in a violent fire and explosion. It was the particular characteristics of this design defect in the Chart Exchanger that caused the catastrophic fire and explosion.
33.	The Incident resulted in significant damages to Enogex.

34.	Chart is liable for the acts and omissions of Altec.

COUNT II

(STRICT LIABILITY- DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING DEFECTS AGAINST PRO­ QUIP AND LINDE)

35.	Plaintiffs incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 34 as though fully  pled

herein.

36.	Pro-Quip sold and installed the Chart Exchanger.

37.	At the time of the installation and sale of the Chart Exchanger, Pro-Quip was in the business of specifying, installing, and selling these types of heat exchangers.
38.	The Chart Exchanger was defectively designed because the Inactive Zone was not designed to withstand the normal operating pressures of the Chart Exchanger. The Inactive Zone should have been designed to withstand the normal operating pressures of the Chart Exchanger, been properly vented, or eliminated altogether.
39.	The Chart Exchanger failed certain hydrotests prior to its sale and installation, indicating a manufacturing defect with certain portions of the exchanger, creating the potential for internal leaks that could reasonably be expected to release pressure into the Inactive Zone, and lead to catastrophic failure.



7
739821

ˇ.



40.	The Chart Exchanger was defective at the time it was specified, installed, and sold by Pro-Quip.
41.	Enogex used the Chart Exchanger as intended, and as a result of these design defects, the Chart Exchanger was not reasonably fit for the ordinary purposes for which it was intended or could have reasonably been expected to be used by Enogex.
42.	The defectively designed Chart Exchanger was dangerous to an extent not contemplated by Enogex.
43.	The defect in the Chart Exchanger was a direct and proximate cause of the Incident.
44.	The Incident resulted in significant damages to Enogex.

45.	Linde is liable for the acts and omissions of Pro-Quip.

COUNT III

(STRICT LIABILITY  - FAILURE TO WARN AGAINST  ALTEC AND  CHART)

46.	Plaintiffs incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 45 as though fully  pled

herein.

47.	Altec knew or should have known of the unreasonably dangerous condition of the Chart Exchanger resulting from its defective design.
48.	The unreasonable risk of harm was not one that an ordinary user, such as Enogex, would reasonably expect from the intended use of the Chart Exchanger.
49.	Altec did not provide adequate warnings of the Chart Exchanger's dangerous condition or instructions for the safe use of the Chart Exchanger.
50.	The inadequate instructions that were provided did not describe the danger created by the design defect so the end user would understand and appreciate the danger.


8
739821


51.	The inadequate instructions contained in the Chart Exchanger's user manual did not provide any method for avoiding or mitigating the danger created by the design defect.
52.	When Chart revised the user manual that applied to the Chart Exchanger in 2009, it knew or should have known of the unreasonably dangerous condition of the Chart Exchanger. Despite this knowledge, whether actual or constructive, Chart failed to revise the user manual to adequately warn or instruct end users such as Enogex regarding the safe use of the Chart Exchanger in the new manual or take any other steps to warn Enogex regarding this dangerous condition. Further, Chart knew or should have known that Enogex was an end user of its exchangers and that Enogex was unaware of the nature of this danger. Chart should have taken appropriate measures to warn Enogex of the danger and instruct it on how to mitigate the danger.
53.	Had adequate warnings and/or instructions for the safe use of the Chart Exchanger been provided by Altec or Chart, or both, those warnings and/or instructions would have been heeded and followed by Enogex.
54.	The failure to provide adequate warnings and instructions with the Chart Exchanger or afterward with the updated manual was a direct and proximate cause of the Incident.
55.	The Incident resulted in significant damages to Enogex.

56.	Chart is liable for the acts and omissions of Altec.

COUNT IV

(POST-SALE  FAILURE  TO WARN AGAINST  ALTEC AND CHART)

57.	Plaintiffs incorporate by reference Paragraphs  1 through 56 as though fully  pled

herein.





9
739821

58.	After the original sale of the Chart Exchanger, Altec knew or should have known of the unreasonably dangerous condition of the Chart Exchanger resulting from its defective design. The Chart Exchanger failed certain hydrotests prior to its sale and installation, indicating a manufacturing defect with certain portions of the exchanger, creating the potential for internal leaks that could reasonably be expected to release pressure into the Inactive Zone, leading to catastrophic failure.
59.	The unreasonable risk of harm was not one that an ordinary user, such as Enogex, would reasonably expect from the intended use of the Chart Exchanger.
60.	Altec did not provide adequate warnings of the Chart Exchanger's dangerous condition or instructions for the safe use of the Chart Exchanger.
61.	The inadequate instructions that were provided did not describe the danger created by the design defect so the end user would understand and appreciate the danger.

Also, Altec and Chart knew that the Chart Exchanger had failed certain hydrotests prior to its sale and installation, so they were aware that the Chart Exchanger had a potential for internal leaks that could reasonably be expected to release pressure into the Inactive Zone, leading to catastrophic failure.
69.	In 2009, the user manual that applied to both the Chart Exchanger and the Chart E430 Exchanger was revised.

This revised user manual was provided to Enogex along with the replacement E430 exchanger in 2010.
70.	The inadequate instructions that were given in the revised version of the Chart Exchanger's user manual did not provide adequate warnings of the Chart Exchanger's dangerous condition or instructions for the safe use of the Chart Exchanger.
