“Our disposal costs have dropped which at least covers the cost of the compactors. Aside from the monetary aspect, the compactors allow the stores to be considerably cleaner.Clean-up at night is much easier because we have no trash cluttering up the back room of the store. All in all, we are very pleased with the compactors.”
Doug GehrigMcDonalds

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”

(LFAP) (LifeApps), an emerging growth company and developer of m-health and wellness applications is looking to shift operations to focus the company's attention to women's health initiatives and personal care products.LifeApps recently entered into an LOI with FemCap Inc. to bring the FemCap and FemmyCycle feminine health and hygiene brands under LifeApps.FemCap products include the FemCap contraceptive device and the FemmyCycle menstrual cup. These feminine contraceptive and hygiene products are clinically tested and FDA approved. The products have health and wellness benefits over traditionally used contraceptive and feminine hygiene products. Additionally, they are more environmentally friendly (reusable), safe, and easy to use while providing cost savings over traditional products in their markets. In 2015 over 1200 clinicians and clinics were on FemCaps customer list.FemCap products have both U.S. and international distribution. FemCap requires a prescription in the United States and is currently distributed via medical practices and is available without prescription internationally. FemmyCycle is a consumer product and is currently distributed online via Amazon.com, FemCap's website and select retailers. We see great growth potential for both products by expanding the awareness of the health benefits of these innovative products through aggressive marketing and expanded distribution options.LifeApps board and management continue to pursue its 90 day LOI with Femcap."LifeApps recognizes the tremendous importance that women represent in today's healthcare and digital economies," states, Robert Gayman, CEO of LifeApps. Women make up 80% of all healthcare consumer purchases and 93% of Over-The-Counter pharmaceuticals, additionally 92% pass along information about online deals or finds to others (Source, The She-conomy Marketing to Women Quick Facts).LifeApps, as a part of its overall strategy, will begin streamlining its existing digital apps, including MDWorkout, its MD based fitness applications and its yoga apps to forums for women's health and wellness communities. LifeApps will be evaluating how best to utilize its current health and wellness content as it moves towards new business models including personal care products.LifeApps recently contracted with First Cornerstone, based in Del Mar, California, to provide advisory and relationship services on business matters including financing strategies, business development, negotiations, and accounting and financial reporting.

Confirms Letter of Intent with Medical Device Company FemCap Inc.AccesswireJune 8, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareSAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June, 8 2016 / LifeApps Brands Inc. (LFAP) (LifeApps), an emerging growth company, and designer of m-health and wellness applications has entered into an agreement with medical device company FemCap Inc. LifeApps previously released Letter of Intent with Femcap May, 26 2016 in conjunction with an 8-K.FemCap Inc. provides innovative FDA approved contraceptive and feminine hygiene medical device products designed for today's healthy lifestyles of engaged women.Under the agreement LifeApps has a 90-day exclusive right to purchase FemCaps operating assets used to market and sell FemCap and FemmyCycle feminine hygiene products. The LOI also includes utilizing the expertise and experience of FemCap founder Dr. Alfred Shihata. Dr. Shihata brings to the team a wealth of experience in research and development of contraceptive and feminine hygiene medical devices as well as being affiliated with Scripps Institutions of Medicine and Science in San Diego, CA and holding 6 U.S. Patents and numerous international patents, including FemCap and FemmyCycle.FemCap products include the FemCap contraceptive device and the FemmyCycle menstrual cup. These feminine contraceptive and hygiene products are clinically tested and FDA approved. The products have health and wellness benefits over traditionally used contraceptive and feminine hygiene products. Additionally, they are more environmentally friendly (reusable), safe, and easy to use while providing cost savings over traditional products in their markets. In 2015 over 1200 clinicians and clinics were on FemCaps customer list.FemCap products have both U.S. and international distribution. FemCap requires a prescription in the United States and is currently distributed via Medical Practices and is available without prescription internationally. FemmyCycle is a consumer product and is currently distributed online via Amazon.com, FemCaps website and select retailers. We see great growth potential for both products by expanding the awareness of the health benefits of these innovative products through aggressive marketing and expanded distribution options. FemCap has already seen a 41% increase in sales in the last two years with a gross profit margin of 66%."LifeApps is incredibly excited to enter into this agreement with Dr. Shihata and FemCap," states Robert Gayman, CEO of LifeApps. "Dr. Shihata has created a pair of truly innovative contraceptive and feminine hygiene products that women love. LifeApps is eager to expand the marketing efforts behind these incredible products and make them more accessible to women globally.

Bringing you accessible lifestyle medicine for a better life.    LifeApps®  is pleased to announce the immediate availability of LifeApps®' top-tier health and wellness app MDWorkout® as a prescription option in IMS Health Incorporated's AppScript(TM) program.  MDWorkout® is now available to doctors and health care professionals who are looking for app based solutions to prescribe to their patients for exercise as medicine through the AppScript app prescribing system. For the first time ever doctors can prescribe exercise through an app based solution.  "LifeApps® continues to pursue synergies with organizations that are forward thinking and dedicated to mobilizing healthcare," states LifeApps® CEO Robert Gayman. "AppScript is a perfect fit for MDWorkout® and our LifeApps® Health initiative." (http://www.LifeAppshealth.com)  Mr. Gayman also states, "MDWorkout® features over 150 exercises crafted by medical doctors and can be a great benefit to health care professionals looking to prescribe exercise as medicine to their patients. With AppScript they will know that the apps they prescribe have been thoroughly tested and reviewed before they recommend them to their patients." (MDWorkout® is a top 5 mobile fitness and wellness app for iPhone.)  IMS Health AppScript is the first app prescribing solution built to the standards that health care professionals and their patients expect in medication prescribing.  As part of wellness, prevention and treatment regimens, physicians can organize these apps into formularies based on their specific patient population and practice preferences. In addition, AppScript enables them to securely prescribe, reconcile and track app use by patients from any mobile interface.  Here is Just One Example of exercise acting as Medicine.... A recent Diabetes Prevention Program landmark study revealed that losing just 5%-7% of your body weight and exercising 30 minutes a day, five days a week, reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 58%!  Excercise prescriptions, along with instructions on diet and health care, can reduce medical cost and insurance cost by billions of dollars.  Below are some examples of the cost associated with a few chronic illnesses.  The time for MDWorkout® prescriptions has come.  * Cardiovascular Disease: $444 Billion * Diabetes: $245 Billion * Obeseity: $254 Billion The Affordable Care Act dictates that compliant health insurance plans now include weight-loss services, in addition to company-sponsored health initiatives. Plans now include obesity screening, referral and counseling as required essential health benefits. As an innovator and leader in mobilizing health and fitness LifeApps® is developing new feature sets and advanced technologies to advance application development in the developing mobile healthcare market. IMS HEALTH NOW RECOMMENDS THE MDWorkout® APP    http://www.imshealth.com http://www.appscript.net   IMS Health is a billion dollar company that provides information, services and technology for the healthcare industry. It is the largest vendor of U.S. physician prescribing data. IMS Health was founded in 1954 and operates in 100+ countries. IMS Health is the world’s leading information, services and technology company dedicated to making healthcare perform better. Their customers include government agencies, pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer health manufacturers and distributors, providers, payers, government agencies, policymakers, researchers and the financial community and nearly every major pharmaceutical and biotech company worldwide.  CLICK to Watch IMS Video on the screening process to isolate only very best health apps.  MDWorkout® is the only pre-approved app of it's kind and for the first time ever doctors can now prescribe exercise through an app based solution.  Many Doctor's have wanted to recommend exercise apps in time past but have always feared the liability of recommending the wrong one.  Now IMS Health AppScript is the first app prescribing solution built to ensure the standards that health care professionals and their patients expect in medication prescribing. This is yet again the evidence of excellence and third party endorsement that shows LifeApps® is positioning itself at the forefront of the rapidly emerging mobile healthcare industry.  Apple also sees this vision and will shortly release the Apple Watch and Apple HealthKit. LifeApps® will benefit and continue to expand it's functions and offerings along with Apple's major release of  these items.    Apple has been taking exhaustive steps to position itself as dominate force in the expanding billion dollar mobile health care market.  Mayo Clinic President and CEO John H. Noseworthy, M.D., said: "We believe Apple's HealthKit will revolutionize how the health industry interacts with people.  LifeApps® has devoted programming and design resources to updating the LifeApps® Tutorial App Platform to integrate new features from Apple's HealthKit. This integration will expand our apps, like MDWorkout, to utilize data gathered from pedometers, heart monitors and more within our own app. Our apps will also be able to share information back to the HealthKit for other apps to share making our apps a more integrated part of a customer's complete mobile health solution. We have also been working on a new LifeApps® Health website that will focus more on the needs of our consumers. The new apps and website are slated for release in early 2015.  (http://www.LifeAppshealth.com) .... Much more to come. LifeApps® is Seeking Partnerships   Remember Jack Tretton, former CEO/President with Sony? (see top of page).  He is helping LifeApps® form strategic partners to take this company worldwide. Mr Tretton joined the LifeApps® team and sits on the board of Advisors.  I call Mr Tretton the "ACE IN THE HOLE CARD".  This should cause you to raise your eye brows by now.  Do some research on Mr Tretton's track record, as he has helped several ventures become BILLION dollar success stories.  My position on this stock (LFAP) is long term BUY and HOLD.  Also, Robert Gayman, CEO of LifeApps®, was once the regional sales manager of half of the United States.  Guess what company he was working for? ... The same company that CEO/President Jack Tretton worked for....  SONY.

LifeApps Brands Inc. To Focus On Women's Health and Personal Care Products


  SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 29, 2016 / LifeApps Brands Inc. (OTC: LFAP) (LifeApps), an emerging growth company and developer of m-health and wellness applications is looking to shift operations to focus the company's attention to women's health initiatives and personal care products.
LifeApps recently entered into an LOI with FemCap Inc. to bring the FemCap and FemmyCycle feminine health and hygiene brands under LifeApps.
FemCap products include the FemCap contraceptive device and the FemmyCycle menstrual cup. These feminine contraceptive and hygiene products are clinically tested and FDA approved. The products have health and wellness benefits over traditionally used contraceptive and feminine hygiene products. Additionally, they are more environmentally friendly (reusable), safe, and easy to use while providing cost savings over traditional products in their markets. In 2015 over 1200 clinicians and clinics were on FemCaps customer list.
FemCap products have both U.S. and international distribution. FemCap requires a prescription in the United States and is currently distributed via medical practices and is available without prescription internationally. FemmyCycle is a consumer product and is currently distributed online via Amazon.com, FemCap's website and select retailers. We see great growth potential for both products by expanding the awareness of the health benefits of these innovative products through aggressive marketing and expanded distribution options.
LifeApps board and management continue to pursue its 90 day LOI with Femcap. 
"LifeApps recognizes the tremendous importance that women represent in today's healthcare and digital economies," states, Robert Gayman, CEO of LifeApps. Women make up 80% of all healthcare consumer purchases and 93% of Over-The-Counter pharmaceuticals, additionally 92% pass along information about online deals or finds to others (Source, The She-conomy Marketing to Women Quick Facts).
LifeApps, as a part of its overall strategy, will begin streamlining its existing digital apps, including MDWorkout, its MD based fitness applications and its yoga apps to forums for women's health and wellness communities. LifeApps will be evaluating how best to utilize its current health and wellness content as it moves towards new business models including personal care products. 
LifeApps recently contracted with First Cornerstone, based in Del Mar, California, to provide advisory and relationship services on business matters including financing strategies, business development, negotiations, and accounting and financial reporting. First Cornerstone offers the benefits of years of knowledge and experience gained from working in executive management in such industries as medical device, healthcare, biotech and technology. LifeApps Board and Management continues to work closely with First Cornerstone on financing strategies and business models for the company.

	Notes
	to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 






	March
	31, 2017 and 2016 






	(Unaudited)





	  





	Note
	1. Nature of Business





	 




	Throughout
	this report, the terms “our,” “we,” “us,” and the “Company” refer to LifeApps
	Brands Inc., including its subsidiaries. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of LifeApps
	Brands Inc. at March 31, 2017 and 2016 have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
	for interim financial statements, instructions to Form 10-Q, and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote
	disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These condensed
	consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included
	in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. In management’s opinion, all adjustments (consisting
	only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation to make our financial statements not misleading
	have been included. The results of operations for the periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 presented are not necessarily indicative
	of the results to be expected for the full year. The December 31, 2016 balance sheet has been derived from our audited financial
	statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.




	 




	We
	are building health, fitness and sports communities across multiple digital platforms including mobile apps, digital sports and
	fitness publications, sports and fitness products, sporting events, gateway platforms, online websites and social media.




	 





	Note
	2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies





	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”),
	which contemplates our continuation as a going concern. We have incurred losses to date of 2,829,712. To date we have funded our
	operations through advances from a related party, issuance of convertible debt, and the sale of our common stock. We intend to
	raise additional funding through third party equity or debt financing. There is no certainty that funding will be available as
	needed. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue operating as a going concern. Our ability to continue
	our operations as a going concern, realize the carrying value of our assets, and discharge our liabilities in the normal course
	of business is dependent upon our ability to raise capital sufficient to fund our commitments and ongoing losses, and ultimately
	generate profitable operations.




	 





	Principles
	of Consolidation





	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our wholly owned subsidiaries, LifeApps
	Inc. and Sports One Group Inc. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual
	results may differ from these estimates.




	 





	Financial
	Instruments





	 




	The
	estimated fair values for financial instruments were determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market information.
	These estimates involved uncertainties and could not be determined with precision. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable,
	accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximated fair value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. The
	fair value of notes payable approximated their carrying value as generally their interest rates reflected our effective annual
	borrowing rate.

	Fair
	Value Measurements: 





	 




	Our
	financial instruments consist of cash, short-term trade receivables, prepaid expenses, payables, accruals and convertible notes
	payable. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade receivables, prepaid expenses, payables, and accruals
	approximate fair value because of the short term maturities of these instruments.




	 





	Accounts
	Receivable





	 




	A
	significant majority of our sales are through credit cards and other electronic payment methods. When we do grant credit to our
	customers it is generally in the form of short term accounts receivables, normally due in 30 days. The credit worthiness of the
	customer is evaluated prior to the sale. As of March 31, 2017 all of our accounts receivable were fully reserved. There was no
	bad debt expense recorded during the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.




	 





	Intangibles





	 




	Intangibles,
	which include websites and databases acquired, internet domain name costs, and customer lists, are being amortized over the expected
	useful lives which we estimate to be three to five years. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”),
	Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350

	Intangibles – Goodwill and Other

	(“ASC 350”),
	the costs to obtain and register internet domain names were capitalized.




	 





	Fixed
	Assets





	 




	Fixed
	assets consists of furniture and equipment and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss,
	if any. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful
	lives used for financial statement purposes is 3 years.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	Revenue
	is derived primarily from the sale of sports and fitness apparel and equipment, and software applications designed for use on
	mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. Revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
	the fee is fixed or determinable, the product or service has been delivered, and collectability is probable.




	 




	We
	sell our software directly via Internet download through third party agents. We recognize revenue when payment is received from
	the agent. Payment is received net of commission paid to the agent, usually 70% to us and 30% to the agent. We record the net
	amount received as revenue.




	 




	We
	also publish and sell digital magazines through the internet. Magazines can be purchased as individual volumes or as a subscription.
	To date we have not had any subscription sales.




	 





	Cost
	of Revenue





	 




	Cost
	of revenue includes the cost of amounts paid for articles, photography, editorial and production cost of the magazine and ongoing
	web hosting costs. Cost of revenue related to product sales includes the direct cost of those products sold.

	Research
	and development, Website Development Costs, and Software Development Costs





	 




	All
	research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs eligible for capitalization under ASC 350-50,

	Website Development Cost

	, and ASC 985-20,

	Software-Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed

	, were not material
	to our financial statements for the periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Research and development expenses amounted to $0 for
	three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Research and development expenses when present are included in general and administrative
	expenses.




	 





	Advertising
	Costs





	 




	We
	recognize advertising expense when incurred. Advertising expense was $0 and $130 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and
	2016, respectively.




	 





	Rent
	Expense





	 




	We
	recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term as defined in ASC Topic 840,

	Leases

	(“ASC 840”). Our lease is short term and will be renewed on a month to month basis. Rent expense was $2,160 and
	$2,145 for the for three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The
	provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740,

	Accounting for Income Taxes

	(“ASC 740”). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
	attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
	tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
	in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and
	liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.




	 




	ASC
	740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements,
	uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized
	in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
	Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
	likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
	facts.




	 




	For
	the for three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 we did not have any interest, penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain
	tax positions.




	 





	Earnings
	per share 





	 




	We
	calculate earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260

	Earnings Per Share

	, which requires a dual presentation of
	basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding
	during the fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share represent basic earnings per share adjusted to include the potentially dilutive
	effect of outstanding stock options and warrants. The diluted earnings per share were not calculated because we recorded net losses
	for the for three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the outstanding stock options and warrants are anti-dilutive.

	We have not recognized any goodwill in these financial statements. Additionally, ASC 805 gives guidance on five types of assets:
	marketing-related, customer-related, artistic-related, contract-related, and technology based intangible assets. We identified
	identifiable intangibles that are marketing-related, customer-related, and technology based.




	 




	The
	amount charged to amortization expense for all intangibles was $225 and $8,419 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016,

	Note
	5. Amounts Due Related Parties





	 




	Parties,
	which can be a corporation or an individual, are considered to be related if we have the ability, directly or indirectly, to control
	the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies
	are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.




	 




	Amount
	due to related parties represent cash advances, salary accruals and amounts paid on our behalf by officers and shareholders of
	the Company. These advances are non-interest bearing, short-term in nature and due on demand. The balance at March 31, 2017 and
	December 31, 2016, was $574,854 and $536,639, respectively. Salary accruals for each period amounted to $37,500 and net cash advances
	amounted to $715 and $15,000, respectively for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.




	 





	Note
	6. Stockholders’ Equity





	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2016 we issued 597,545 shares of common stock in settlement of $8,058 in previously accrued legal
	services.




	 





	Note
	7. Stock Based Compensation





	 




	In
	prior periods, our Board of Directors adopted the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (“2012 Plan”), which was approved by
	our shareholders. The 2012 Plan provided for the issuance of up to 666,667 shares of our common stock. During October 2015 the
	Board of Directors amended the plan to increase the number of shares issuable under the LifeApps Digital Media Inc. 2012 Equity
	Incentive Plan to 20,000,000, on a post-Reverse Stock Split basis. The plan provides for the award of options, stock appreciation
	rights, performance share awards, and restricted stock and stock units. The plan is administered by the Board of Directors. Pursuant
	to the 2012 Plan our Board of Directors granted options to purchase 418,333 shares of our common stock in periods prior to December
	31, 2015. All of those options have been cancelled or lapsed as of December 31, 2016. On May 24, 2016 our Board of Directors granted
	options to purchase 15,000,000 shares of our common stock to officers and or directors and a consultant. The options are exercisable
	quarterly from the grant date over a four-year term.




	 




	The
	fair value of the options granted, $39,000, was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with
	the following assumptions:




	 








	Expected life (in years)

	There

	through the current period. Our policy is to account for income tax related interest and penalties in income tax expense in the
	consolidated statement of operations. There have been no income tax related interest or penalties assessed or recorded.

	The
	Company had deferred fix assets of $621,100 and $604,800 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting from net operating
	loss carry-forwards of approximately $1,572,000 at December 31, 2016. 







	 





	Note
	10. Business Segments





	 




	We
	currently have two business segments; (i) the sale of physical products (“Products”) and (ii) digital publishing (“Publishing”).
	The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.




	 




	The
	publishing segment does not meet the quantitative threshold for disclosure as outlined ASC Topic 280

	Segment Reporting.





	 




	All
	of our revenue is generated in the United States and accordingly no geographic segment reporting is included.




	 




	No
	customers accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in the periods March 31, 2017 and 2016.

	ITEM
	2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





	 





	The
	following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
	on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”), including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of
	March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related notes. References
	in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section to “us,”
	“we,” “our,” and similar terms refer to LifeApps Brands Inc., a Delaware corporation. This discussion
	includes forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the federal securities laws, based upon current expectations that
	involve risks and uncertainties, such as plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events
	could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. Words such
	as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,”
	“believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,”
	and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements.





	 





	We
	caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to a number of uncertainties,
	risks and other influences, many of which are beyond our control, which may influence the accuracy of the statements and the projections
	upon which the statements are based. Factors that may affect our results include, but are not limited to, the risk factors in
	Item 2.01 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
	(the “SEC”) on April 17, 2017. Any one or more of these uncertainties, risks and other influences could materially
	affect our results of operations and whether forward-looking statements made by us ultimately prove to be accurate. Our actual
	results, performance and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.
	We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events
	or otherwise.

	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates





	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”),
	which contemplates our continuation as a going concern. As of March 31, 2017, we have incurred losses of $2,829,712. To date we
	have funded our operations through advances from a related party, issuances of convertible debt, and the sale of our common stock.
	We intend to raise additional funding through third party equity or debt financing. There is no certainty that funding will be
	available as needed. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue operating as a going concern. Our ability
	to continue our operations as a going concern, realize the carrying value of our assets, and discharge our liabilities in the
	normal course of business is dependent upon our ability to raise capital sufficient to fund our commitments and ongoing losses,
	and ultimately generate profitable operations.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual
	results may differ from these estimates.




	 





	Fair
	Value Measurements:





	 




	ASC
	Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"), provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair
	value and expands disclosures which are required about fair value measurements. Specifically, ASC 820 sets forth a definition
	of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to quoted
	prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines
	the hierarchy as follows:




	 




	Level
	1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types
	of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities
	listed on the New York Stock Exchange.




	 




	Level
	2 – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, but are either directly or indirectly observable as of
	the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities
	or contracts, or priced with models using highly observable inputs.




	 




	Level
	3 – Significant inputs to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included
	in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation, such as complex and subjective models
	and forecasts used to determine the fair value of financial transmission rights.




	 




	Our
	financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade receivables, prepaid expenses, payables, accruals
	and convertible notes payable. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade receivables, prepaid expenses,
	payables, and accruals approximate fair value because of the short term maturities of these instruments.




	 





	Inventory





	 




	Inventory
	consists of finished goods, sports and fitness products, and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost
	being determined on a first-in first-out basis.




	 










	16

	 







	 





	 





	Intangibles





	 




	Intangibles,
	which include websites and databases acquired, internet domain name costs, and customer lists, are being amortized over the expected
	useful lives which we estimate to be three to five years. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”),
	Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350 Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”),
	the costs to obtain and register internet domain names were capitalized.




	 





	Derivative
	Financial Instruments:





	 




	We
	do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial
	instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative
	financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value
	and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based
	derivative financial instruments, we used a Black Scholes valuation model to value the derivative instruments at inception and
	on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded
	as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance
	sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required
	within 12 months of the balance sheet date.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	Revenue
	is derived primarily from the sale of sports and fitness apparel and equipment, and software applications designed for use on
	mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. Revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
	the fee is fixed or determinable, the product or service has been delivered, and collectability is probable.




	 




	We
	sell our software directly via Internet download through third party agents. We recognize revenue when payment is received from
	the agent. Payment is received net of commission paid to the agent, usually 70% to us and 30% to the agent. We record the net
	amount received as revenue.




	 




	We
	also publish and sell digital magazines through the internet. Magazines can be purchased as individual volumes or as a subscription.
	To date we have not had any subscription sales.




	 





	Cost
	of Revenue





	 




	Cost
	of revenue includes the cost of amounts paid for articles, photography, editorial and production cost of the magazine and ongoing
	web hosting costs. Cost of revenue related to product sales includes the direct cost of those products sold.




	 





	Equity
	Based Payments





	 




	Equity
	based payments are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. The compensation cost
	is based upon fair value of the equity instrument at the date grant. The fair value has been estimated using the Black-Sholes
	option pricing model.

	Results
	of Operations





	 






	Three
	months ended March 31, 2017 compared with the respective period ended March 31, 2016






	 




	Revenues
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $1,055 and $6,588, respectively. Revenues for the three months ended March
	31, 2017 were derived primarily from sales of sports products. Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016
	were derived primarily from sales of sports apparel. The decrease in revenues is due to a decrease in marketing by us and increased
	competition.




	 




	Cost
	of revenues normally includes our cost of products sold and amounts paid for articles, photography, editorial and production cost
	of the magazine. In the future we will incur direct cost related to revenue such as webhosting and direct cost for our customer
	support. For the foreseeable future we anticipate outsourcing such costs. Cost of revenue related to product sales includes the
	direct cost of those products sold.






	 




	Cost
	of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $49 (4.6%) and $6,456 (98%), respectively. This resulted in
	a gross profit for three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 of $1,066 (95.4%) and $132 (2%), respectively. Costs were primarily
	the cost of products sold. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to sales of discontinued product.

	fees decreased $2,000 (100%) from $2,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $0 for the three months ended March 31,

	marketing and advertising expenses decreased $740 (100%) from $740 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $0 for the three

	All

	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	To
	date, we have been financed primarily by capital contributions from members of LifeApps LLC, the predecessor to LifeApps, from
	short term loans and through sales of our securities. Our existing sources of liquidity may not be sufficient for us to implement
	our business plans. Our need for future capital will be dependent upon the speed at which we expand our product offerings. There
	are no assurances that we will be able raise additional capital as needed.

	the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $715 and $15,000, respectively.




	 




	Additionally,
	we received 35+ net amounts of $715 and $0 of cash advances from our chief executive officer and net amounts of $0 and $15,000
	of cash advances from a director during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.




	 




	We
	will continue to seek out additional capital in the form of debt or equity under the most favorable terms we can find.




	 





	Going
	Concern





	 




	Our
	financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that we will be able to realize our assets and
	discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. We have incurred losses since inception
	resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately $2,829,712 as of March 31, 2017 and further losses are anticipated in the
	development of our business raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue
	as a going concern is dependent upon our generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing
	to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends
	to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and/or additional officer and shareholder advances.
	These financials do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of recorded asset amounts,
	or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.




	 





	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	We
	have no off-balance sheet arrangements.





	 









	ITEM
	3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK





	 




	We
	are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
	Act") and are not required to provide the information required under this item.





	 









	ITEM
	4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	 





	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	 




	Pursuant
	to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), the Company carried out an evaluation,
	with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)
	and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) (the Company’s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness
	of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
	Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO concluded
	that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective , due to a lack of audit committee and segregation
	of duties caused by limited personnel, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that
	the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
	specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
	management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

	Limitations
	on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures





	 




	Our
	management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial
	Officer), does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system,
	no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
	system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits
	of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
	of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
	detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
	and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
	acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of
	controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that
	any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate
	because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the
	inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.




	 




	Management
	believes that the material weakness set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results.




	 





	Changes
	in Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	 




	There
	have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2017 that
	have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Quarterly Report"), including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related notes. References in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section to "us," "we," "our," and similar terms refer to LifeApps Brands Inc., a Delaware corporation. This discussion includes forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the federal securities laws, based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. Words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "plan," "continuing," "ongoing," "expect," "believe," "intend," "may," "will," "should," "could," and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements.  We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which are beyond our control, which may influence the accuracy of the statements and the projections upon which the statements are based. Factors that may affect our results include, but are not limited to, the risk factors in Item 2.01 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on April 15, 2016. Any one or more of these uncertainties, risks and other influences could materially affect our results of operations and whether forward-looking statements made by us ultimately prove to be accurate. Our actual results, performance and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events or otherwise.  Overview  LifeApps Brands Inc. is an emerging growth company and developer and designer of applications, medical and fitness products, new media, digital magazines, publications, and next-generation social networks for sports, health, fitness and entertainment enthusiasts. We have a multimarket revenue strategy that incorporates mobile apps, digital magazines, publications, fitness training devices, web, social media and internet TV to engage consumers in multiple areas of sports, health, fitness and entertainment interests including medical, yoga, golf, tennis, running, soccer, cycling, and other health, fitness and sports topics. Although we have determined to shift our business focus to the medical, health and wellness sectors, we expect that our mobile apps will continue to be represented on the Apple App Store and our MD Workout(R) mobile app will continue to be represented in the IMS Health App Script program.  LifeApps(R) is a licensed developer and publisher of apps for the Apple App Store for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini. LifeApps(R) is also a licensed developer on both Google Play and Amazon Appstore for Android. LifeApps(R) has distributed apps/publications on all three platforms. Moving forward, LifeApps(R) is developing new apps, and exploring new opportunities pairing apps with physical retail and e-commerce/mobile-commerce products.  Plan of Operation  LifeApps(R) is aggressively pushing forward on a strategy for utilizing mobile applications related to healthcare with the LifeApps Health initiative. LifeApps Health, building on the success of the LifeApps MDWorkout(R) mobile app platform, will bring together consumer mHealth lifestyle products, like-minded medical health organizations and medically based health and fitness research organizations to create apps. The convergence of consumer apps with medical programs and clinical research is an exciting milestone in the mHealth marketplace. LifeApps(R) believes that its unique position as an established market participant in providing medically based mHealth fitness lifestyle apps will make LifeApps Health the desired partner for medical organizations who are looking for guidance, app development and distribution into the mHealth marketplace. We believe that we will drive revenues by targeting sports, health and fitness specific communities and developing a relationship with their participants, delivering lifestyle content, social networking, skills and drills training, consumer fitness devices and nutritional content across multiple platforms including, but not limited to, Apple iOS and Google Android systems. LifeApps(R) plans to invest in these sports, health and fitness communities through partnerships with trusted medical organizations, increasing brand awareness and delivering digital content of interest and digitally enhanced physical consumer products that enrich and improve the user's sports, health and fitness lifestyle. We intend to decrease our activities related to our Sports One digital platform due to slowing sales and increased competition as we position ourselves for new opportunities. At the same time, we intend to focus on merger and acquisition candidates in the medical, health and wellness sectors and/or try to develop innovative products related to these sectors internally.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which contemplates our continuation as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, we have incurred losses of $2,701,003. To date we have funded our operations through advances from a related party, issuance of convertible debt, and the sale of our common stock. We intend to raise additional funding through third party equity or debt financing. There is no certainty that funding will be available as needed. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue operating as a going concern. Our ability to continue our operations as a going concern, realize the carrying value of our assets, and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent upon our ability to raise capital sufficient to fund our commitments and ongoing losses, and ultimately generate profitable operations.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Fair Value Measurements:  ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"), provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures which are required about fair value measurements. Specifically, ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy as follows:  Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts, or priced with models using highly observable inputs.  Level 3 - Significant inputs to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation, such as complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine the fair value of financial transmission rights.  Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade receivables, prepaid expenses, payables, accruals and convertible notes payable. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade receivables, prepaid expenses, payables, and accruals approximate fair value because of the short term maturities of these instruments.  Inventory  Inventory consists of finished goods, sports and fitness products, and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on a first-in first-out basis.  Intangibles  Intangibles, which include websites and databases acquired, internet domain name costs, and customer lists, are being amortized over the expected useful lives which we estimate to be three to five years. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ("ASC 350"), the costs to obtain and register internet domain names were capitalized.  Derivative Financial Instruments:  We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, we used a Black Scholes valuation model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue is derived primarily from the sale of sports and fitness apparel and equipment, and software applications designed for use on mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. Revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, the product or service has been delivered, and collectability is probable.  We sell our software directly via Internet download through third party agents. We recognize revenue when payment is received from the agent. Payment is received net of commission paid to the agent, usually 70% to us and 30% to the agent. We record the net amount received as revenue.  We also publish and sell digital magazines through the internet. Magazines can be purchased as individual volumes or as a subscription. To date we have not had any subscription sales.  Cost of Revenue  Cost of revenue includes the cost of amounts paid for articles, photography, editorial and production cost of the magazine and ongoing web hosting costs. Cost of revenue related to product sales includes the direct cost of those products sold.  Equity Based Payments  Equity based payments are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The compensation cost is based upon fair value of the equity instrument at the date grant. The fair value has been estimated using the Black-Sholes option pricing model.  Results of Operations  Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the respective period ended September 30, 2015  Revenues for the three months ended September, 2016 and 2015 were $147 and $19,260, respectively. Revenues for both periods were derived primarily from the sale of sports apparel and health and fitness products. The decrease in revenues is due to an across the board downturn in our business.  Cost of revenue normally includes our cost of products sold and amounts paid for articles, photography, editorial and production cost of the magazine. In the future we will incur direct cost related to revenue such as webhosting and direct cost for our customer support. For the foreseeable future we anticipate outsourcing such costs. Cost of revenue related to product sales includes the direct cost of those products sold.  Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $51 (34.8%) and $26,411 (137.1%), respectively. This resulted in a gross profit  We had net losses of $56,799 and $137,384 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The following is a breakdown of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   Three months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Difference Personnel costs $ 37,679 $ 38,429 $ (750 ) Professional fees 12,000 11,265 735 Marketing and advertising 150 164 (14 ) Stock related expenses 2,437 - 2,437 Rent 2,110 1,252 858 Other expenses 2,294 5,422 (3,128 ) $ 56,670 $ 56,532 $ 138  Costs for personnel, professional fees, marketing and rent did not vary significantly during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Stock related expenses during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 are related to the vesting of stock options during the quarter. These expenses are expected to continue quarterly over a four-year period.  Other expenses decreased by $3,128 (136.4%) as a result of decreased business activity. These expenses include bank and credit card charges, web hosting and general business services.  Expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 also included a charge of $63,462 related to the conversion of related party loans into shares of our common stock.  We had operating losses of $56,799 and $73,351 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the respective period ended September 30, 2015  Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $11,168 and $129,262 respectively. Revenues for both periods were derived primarily from the sale of sports apparel and health and fitness products. The decrease in revenues is due to an across the board downturn in our business.  Cost of revenue normally includes our cost of products sold and amounts paid for articles, photography, editorial and production cost of the magazine. In the future we will incur direct cost related to revenue such as webhosting and direct cost for our customer support. For the foreseeable future we anticipate outsourcing such costs. Cost of revenue related to product sales includes the direct cost of those products sold.  Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $8,122 (72.7%) and $106,485 (82.4%) respectively. This resulted in a gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $3,046 (27.3%) and $22,777 (17.6%), respectively. Costs were primarily the cost of products sold and the margin varies depending on products sold has been sold. The decrease in gross margin is primarily to product mix.  We had net losses of $178,247 and $590,407 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The following is a breakdown of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   Nine months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Difference Personnel costs $ 113,221 $ 130,770 $ (17,549 ) Professional fees 30,930 55,064 (24,134 ) Marketing and advertising 1,895 25,591 (23,696 ) Travel and entertainment - 1,500 (1,500 ) Stock related expenses 7,534 1,547 5,987 Rent 5,685 4,606 1,079 Research and development 200 7,797 (7,597 ) Other expenses 12,254 28,020 (15,766 ) $ 171,719 $ 254,895 $ (83,314 )  Personnel costs decreased $17,549 (15.5%) from $130,770 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $113,221 for the nine months ended September30, 2016. The decrease is a result of decreases in our number of employees from four in 2015 to one (our CEO) in 2016.  Professional fees decreased $24,134 (78%) from $55,064 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $30,930 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease is a result of decreases in our cost of SEC compliance and decreased activity that required legal counsel.  Marketing and advertising expenses decreased $23,696 (1,250.4%) from $25,591 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,895 for the nine months ended September30, 2016. The decrease is a result of changes in our business strategy by focusing less effort on product sales. Also, the nine-month period of 2015 included trade show expenses that have not recurred.  Research and development includes website and applications development costs. Research and development expenses decreased $7,597 (3,798.5%) from $7,797 for 2015 to $200 for 2016. We made no major changes to our applications in 2016 whereas in 2015 we updated most of our applications. Development is an ongoing cost and we anticipate that our development costs both for website and applications may increase in future periods.  Travel and entertainment decreased $1,500 from $1,500 in 2015 to $0 in 2016.  All of our other operating costs decreased as result of generally keeping cost down.  We had operating losses of $178,247 and $261,119 for 2016 and 2015 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We value the derivative liability and the end of each accounting period the difference in value is recognized as gain or loss. We recognized $189,660 of loss for the change in value of the derivative for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We had no derivative liabilities in the first nine months of 2016. In addition, we had losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $110,692 on conversion of debt due to officers, directors and shareholders of the Company.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We were financed primarily by capital contributions from members of LifeApps LLC, the predecessor to LifeApps, from short term borrowings, and through our private placement which we completed in October 2012. Our existing sources of liquidity may not be sufficient for us to implement our initial business plan. Our need for future capital will be dependent upon the speed at which we expand our product offerings. There are no assurances that we will be able raise additional capital as needed.  As of September 30, 2016, we had negative working capital of $(608,696) as compared to $(450,517) at December 31, 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, operations used cash of $54,918 and $87,324 respectively.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we used no cash in investing activities.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $52,485 and $72,750, respectively.  Additionally, we received or (repaid) net amounts of $2,350 and $24,750 of cash advances from our chief executive officer and net amounts of $52,135 and $48,000 of cash advances from a director and a shareholder during the nine months ended September, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Also during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 our chief executive officer converted $31,250 of cash advances into 1,666,667 shares of common stock at a conversion rate based on the trading value of our common stock during a predetermined period.  We will continue to seek out additional capital in the form of debt or equity under the most favorable terms we can find.  Going Concern  Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. We have incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately $2,701,003 as of September 30, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of our business raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and/or additional officer and shareholder advances. These financials do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Nov 21, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

LifeApps recently entered into an LOI with FemCap Inc. to bring the FemCap and FemmyCycle feminine health and hygiene brands under LifeApps.
FemCap products include the FemCap contraceptive device and the FemmyCycle menstrual cup. These feminine contraceptive and hygiene products are clinically tested and FDA approved. The products have health and wellness benefits over traditionally used contraceptive and feminine hygiene products. Additionally, they are more environmentally friendly (reusable), safe, and easy to use while providing cost savings over traditional products in their markets. In 2015 over 1200 clinicians and clinics were on FemCaps customer list.
FemCap products have both U.S. and international distribution. FemCap requires a prescription in the United States and is currently distributed via medical practices and is available without prescription internationally. FemmyCycle is a consumer product and is currently distributed online via Amazon.com, FemCap's website and select retailers. We see great growth potential for both products by expanding the awareness of the health benefits of these innovative products through aggressive marketing and expanded distribution options.
LifeApps board and management continue to pursue its 90 day LOI with Femcap. 
"LifeApps recognizes the tremendous importance that women represent in todays healthcare and digital economies" states, Robert Gayman, CEO of LifeApps. Women make up 80% of all healthcare consumer purchases and 93% of Over-The-Counter pharmaceuticals, addtionaly 92% pass along information about online deals or finds to others (Source, The She-conomy Marketing to Women Quick Facts) 
LifeApps, as a part of its overall strategy, will begin streamlining its existing digital apps, including MDWorkout, its MD based fitness applications and its yoga apps to forums for women's health and wellness communities. LifeApps will be evaluating how best to utilize its
current health and wellness content as it moves towards new business models including personal care products. 
Lifeapps recently contracted with First Cornerstone, based in Del Mar, California, to provide advisory and relationship services on business matters including financing strategies, business development, negotiations, and accounting and financial reporting. First Cornerstone offers the benefits of years of knowledge and experience gained from working in executive management in such industries as medical device, healthcare, biotech and technology. LifeApps Board and Management continues to work closely with First Cornerstone on financing strategies and buisness models for the company.

“Our disposal costs have dropped which at least covers the cost of the compactors. Aside from the monetary aspect, the compactors allow the stores to be considerably cleaner.Clean-up at night is much easier because we have no trash cluttering up the back room of the store. All in all, we are very pleased with the compactors.”
Doug GehrigMcDonalds

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
