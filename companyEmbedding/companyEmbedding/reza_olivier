PARIS — After a long hiatus, Alexandre Reza, one of the most famous names in the Paris jewelry world, is making a comeback with a public show of jewelry — the company’s first in 20 years — which began at Sotheby’s in New York in the fall and is traveling to London; Doha, Qatar; and Beijing.Mr. Reza, of Iranian descent, was born into a jeweler’s family in Moscow in 1922. In 1925 they fled post-revolutionary Russia to France where he eventually started a jewelry and antiques business before gravitating to the gem trade. He is retired now, but he made a fortune as a gem merchant and along the way built an exceptional collection of colored gemstones and diamonds.In the 1960s and ’70s he was a principal supplier to the Parisian jewelers on the Place Vendôme, before discovering his own affinity for design.He set up shop on the Place Vendôme in the 1980s. Olivier Reza, his son, said: “My father acquired a number of Parisian jewelry ateliers and used their savoir-faire to create pieces of his own design. With that, he created his own brand.”

Olivier, now 40, left a banking career in New York in 2008 to take over the company after his father’s retirement the year before. At the time, the business was in the doldrums, still reeling from a series of robberies in the previous 15 years, and he found himself confronting some strategic decisions.

His basic options were to sell the inventory and abandon the brand, or to find a way to carry on. To understand the value of the family business, Olivier Reza had to evaluate the inventory, the house’s history, and the wealth of drawings and records in the company’s archives.Having excluded the idea of selling, he had to come up with a revival strategy. To start, he decided to shrink the business, closing its five stores worldwide.

“The real métier of haute joaillerie, as it was established by Louis Cartier, Frédéric Boucheron, Laurence Graff, Jacques Arpels and my father, draws primarily on passion,” Olivier Reza said in an interview in the ornate first-floor salons of the 18th-century Hôtel de Fontpertuis that the jeweler occupies on the Place Vendôme. “Practically, that means you must be able to invest tens of millions in precious stones and really believe in what you are doing.“After the war, my father was able to purchase quantities of natural and untreated stones in Ceylon and Burma,” he said, referring to today’s Sri Lanka and Myanmar. “The Reza house currently possesses one of the world’s largest inventories of unheated and untreated colored gemstones. When you sit on a fortune like that, you need vision and passion, and you cannot be in a hurry.”He added: “We liberated ourselves from retail pressure to concentrate on creation. Now we have the luxury of time and can take eight to 12 months to produce a piece without worrying about the rent.” The firm has spent three years designing a new collection with a team of four, outsourcing production to three workshops here. The show that represents the culmination of his efforts mixes old and new. It includes 25 historic pieces from the past 40 years, showcasing the stones and craftsmanship that made Alexandre Reza a celebrated name. There are 15 new pieces in a more contemporary style, “mostly unique, that, creatively speaking, were made from scratch,” Olivier Reza said. “Through that process, I have realized I have a preference for geometric shapes.”

Alexandre Reza “was a connoisseur of high-quality stones and brought many exceptional ones to France,” said Marguerite de Cerval, a jewelry historian in Paris. “His technique remained traditional but he had a style and flair that appealed to an international clientele.”The house was particularly known for parures and the show includes several matching pieces, notably a set featuring 102 carats of untreated Colombian emeralds and earrings set with 145 carats of Ceylon sapphires and diamonds.“Some of the parures have 20 stones of over 10 carats each, all in the same color,” Olivier Reza said.Alexandre Reza also made a specialty of “trembleuse,” or articulated, jewelry. A 52-carat Burmese sapphire ring, set atop 101 diamonds, is a striking example of his work: “The mount is invisible, you see only the diamonds,” his son said.

“Alexandre used to say that the stone drove jewelry design,” Ms. de Cerval said. “Some of Olivier’s designs are innovative but others remain on his father’s path. It remains to be seen whether he will succeed in departing from the house’s traditional formulas.”

PARIS — Successfully reviving a legend is not easy. But for Olivier Reza, son of the renowned gem dealer and master jeweler Alexandre Reza, the house’s renaissance over the last eight years has been a crusade.He closed retail outlets worldwide to concentrate on creativity in the Reza atelier and its gilded 18th-century salon in the Hôtel de Fontpertuis on the Place Vendôme here, home of many of jewelry’s major names.In 2014, Mr. Reza put together a traveling exhibition, a mix of his father’s pieces and his own new, contemporary designs, to announce the comeback of the Reza brand.And in August, he opened Reza at the Ritz, a boutique with a smooth modern look at the recently renovated luxury hotel. While the hotel gallery that links the Place Vendôme to the Cambon side is lined with jewel-stuffed vitrines, Reza is one of only two jewelers with a boutique there. And it now is the house’s only public retail space.

“The Ritz is a symbol of savoir-vivre and savoir-faire, the right place for us to provide some visibility on our creations,” Mr. Reza, 42, said during an interview in the house’s salon, just steps away. Continue reading the main story

While he continues to use some of the large collection of flawless, natural and untreated gemstones that his father collected over the years, Mr. Reza has been developing the house’s artistic direction in his own style — putting more emphasis on design, which he said he considers as important as the quality of the stones in creating jewelry.“Design is always a challenge,” he said. “It’s like a fight between the stone and the design each time. When the stone beats the design, I’m not satisfied. The design has to hold its own.”When a friend and client, who had commissioned a ring for his wife, asked, “Am I am buying the stone or the design?” Mr. Reza said he felt his design emphasis had been vindicated. “In this case, the design was up against a beautiful D-color Golconda 10-carat diamond,” Mr. Reza said. “Beat that.”

Mr. Reza’s way of designing is as much made-to-measure as the finished pieces. There are no collections; each piece is created as he is inspired.Most of his work centers on unique pieces, like the Arlequin, a pair of diamond-studded pendant earrings with Brazilian sugar-loaf emeralds. It is one of his transformable designs: The earrings can be clipped together and worn as a brooch. Another piece, the Horn of Plenty earrings, has cascades of pigeon-blood rubies and diamonds.Both the Arlequin and the Horn of Plenty were presented at the European Fine Art Fair earlier this month in the Netherlands; the house exhibits at such prestigious art fairs three or four times a year.Recently, he added a focus on haute jewelry that uses smaller but still high-quality stones, to create pieces priced at less than $100,000, about 94,700 euros.

“They catch your eye and are surprising, but also must be beautiful,” he said of the haute jewelry, which “corresponds to the time we live in.”Rather than designs targeted at daytime, nighttime or special events, he has conceived of pieces that are wearable anytime, anywhere.

One example: the Ruban (or ribbon) earrings, whose delicate diamond-studded loops are lined in contrasting colored gems like sapphires, rubies, emeralds or colored diamonds, and seem to dance up the ear. “They attract a lot of attention and do exactly what I want them to do,” he said. “They are easily wearable, but very different, and make a statement about the woman who is wearing them.”“The designs can be simple,” Mr. Reza said, “but they have to maximize the beauty of the stone. For me, it’s all about shape, colors, composition and contact with the materials, and the need to provide an emotion at every angle.”Another is the diamond-studded Spirale ring, which looks like an abstract sculpture in miniature, and seems to reflect the creative inspiration of his own art collection. “There is no art form that I don’t like,” he said. “I love contemporary, modern and old master paintings. I love sculptures, antiquities, African and pre-Columbian art.”

The Reza hallmark — the creation of important pieces showcasing sumptuous precious stones — still is celebrated. Mr. Reza brought out the Dentelle (or lace) necklace as a spectacular example.“I wanted something delicate but complex,” he said of the Dentelle design. The intricate pattern is centered on an extremely rare and flawless emerald-cut, 9.46-carat octagonal old-mine Colombian emerald, with one lozenge-cut and two marquise-cut Zambian emeralds. There also are trapeze-cut diamonds and brilliants arranged in a setting of white, yellow and black (for contrast) gold.The setting was sent to cutters, who tailored each jewel to fit the design; such pieces can take 12 to 18 months to complete.In every Reza design, “there is artistic composition, but the other thing that doesn’t get enough credit is functionality,” Mr. Reza said. “It needs to be wearable on the human body, where it is constantly in motion. These pieces need to be worn — on an ear, on a hand, as a necklace — so you can see what they were made to be.”

Rather than scale models, which jewelers traditionally used in designing, now 3-D printed versions are made to assure each piece will be both comfortable and beautiful.Mr. Reza has a lot to live up to. His Moscow-born father, whose family fled the Russian Revolution, came to Paris after World War II and was soon renowned for his ability to discover exceptional old-mine gemstones from Colombia, India, Burma (now Myanmar), Thailand and Sri Lanka.“He founded his own house in the 1950s and soon was trading and making jewelry for all the big Place Vendôme names,” Mr. Reza said. “Then he opened his Place Vendôme store in 1984.”As he traveled, Alexandre Reza gathered rare old-mine diamonds, emeralds, sapphires and rubies. That remarkable collection, said to be among the world’s largest, was the reason Olivier Reza abandoned a successful career as an investment banker to take over the business when his father retired. “The most important aspect is the gems, waiting to be alive again,” he said. “I realized I had a huge head start.”But Mr. Reza still has some of a banker’s sensibility. Jewels are the safest investment, he said. “A beautiful emerald or ruby never goes out of fashion.”“My only advice is to buy the best,” he said.

Imperceptible yet undeniable signs of continuity are the hallmarks of the collections by this jewelry dynasty that has decided to return to the Biennale des Antiquaires after 14 years (though it has participated three times in the past). Alexandre Reza has a refined knowledge of rare, precious gems, and it is his name on the famous boutique in Place Vendôme. The torch has been passed to his son Olivier, who worked by his father’s side from the time he was a child. In an important moment of change and affirmation, the Biennale represents a significant step along a new path, the first time the spotlight has been shone on the brand internationally since its relaunch 18 months ago. Olivier Reza worked for four years on the creation of about 30 luxurious pieces inspired by the world of art, by Henri Matisse’s paintings and Robert Lazzarini sculptures. The collection also features pieces that fully embody Alexandre Reza’s philosophy, which seeks out beauty with extremely high quality stones, excellent manufacture and a recognizable style – and brought up to date with a more contemporary feel in terms of creativity. It’s natural to compare the masterpieces of yesterday and today to come to the conclusion that they are products of the same philosophy in terms of the size of the jewels, the same attention to the proportions of the stone and the same use of the most sophisticated working methods like the “en tremblant” technique carried out by the father and now the son to offer a bit of movement to the individual pieces that bring a jewel to life.

Jewelry Exhibits
The Extraordinary Jewelry of Alexandre Reza

Posted on October 31, 2013


 

The name Alexandre Reza is synonymous with exceptional gemstones and extraordinary design.  A major gem dealer and jewelry designer for over 40 years, the legacy of the Russian-born Reza, whose family is of Iranian origin, is best encapsulated in his exquisite jewels, twenty-five of which will be on view in New York next month.  From November 1st through 13th, Sotheby’s will honor the legendary Alexandre Reza, one of the greatest jewelers of the 20th century in the exhibition “The Extraordinary Jewelry of Alexandre Reza“.

After his family fled the Russian revolution, they found a new home in France where the young Reza started his own jewelry and antiques business.  With his willful spirit and enduring determination, Reza keenly cultivated his reputation for dealing in the most exceptional stones, making him a key supplier to Place Vendôme’s master jewelers in the 1960s and 70s.  The following decade, instead of retiring, Reza opened his own shop in the Place Vendôme where he offered his marvelous gems in masterful designs of his own making.
In the 1950s and ’60s, Alexandre Reza was the man Harry Winston, Cartier, and Boucheron turned to when a client requested a particularly rare piece.Photograph Courtesy of Alexandre Reza via Town & Country
Though the boutique was closed in 2008, Reza’s son Olivier has brilliantly revived his father’s business by offering his contemporary designs alongside his father’s archival pieces, both of which will be featured in Sotheby’s exhibition.  Together, the pieces in the exhibition are a mesmerizing peek into Reza’s splendid vaults, which are rumored to house one of the world’s largest and most impressive private collections of gemstones and jewels.

David Bennett, Chairman of Sotheby’s Jewelry Division Europe & Middle East, comments: “Alexandre Reza’s legacy forms an integral and important part of the history of post war jewelry. Sotheby’s is honored to showcase his work through this special exhibition, which will include many of the most important jewels and parures created by Alexandre Reza during the last 40 years, featuring spectacular diamonds, natural pearls and superb colored gems. We are particularly thrilled to support his son Olivier as he carries the Reza name to the next generation of collectors and connoisseurs with his exciting new designs.”

Highlights of the exhibition include several of Reza’s iconic parures, set with impressively-sized emeralds and sapphires, the remarkable “Notre Dame” clip featuring a 133.63-carat unheated Ceylon sapphire and a magnificent ring with a 52.31-carat Burmese sapphire flanked by a double bombé mounting swathed with diamonds.
In 2014, the exhibition will travel to Sotheby’s offices around the world, including Beijing, Doha and London.
