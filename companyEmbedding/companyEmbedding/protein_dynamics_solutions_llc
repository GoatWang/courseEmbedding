        First, the basics: Size and size distributions by Cumulants and Regularization for DLS data, cumulative size distribution, as well as molar mass determination for SLS data from the NanoStar. Statistical analysis on your measurements with display of mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation is provided. But there is more to your results than calculation of size: DYNAMICS can perform virtually any transition analysis, be it temperature or concentration dependence or any parameter measured or defined by the user. Linear, exponential and sigmoid curve analyses are provided for maximum flexibility.

        Size and Size Distributions

        Analyze protein and particle sizes using the method of Cumulants or Regularization. Report average radius, diameter and diffusion coefficient as well as the width of the distribution in terms of polydispersity, % polydispersity or polydispersity index (PDI). In Regularization, size distributions may be viewed as Intensity or Mass distributions and custom data labels may created for each peak.

   

        Cumulative Size Distributions

        For a broad size distribution, it is important to control the entire distribution rather than the mean radius alone. DYNAMICS provides calculation of the percentage of samples below a certain size of particles (either diameter or radius), with values for D10, D50 and D90 (the size of the sample below 10%, 50% and 90% of the entire distribution lies, respectively). The width of the distribution, defined as (D90-D10)/D50, is calculated as well.



        Transition Analysis

        Monitor protein melting or unfolding. Determine temperature transitions for your biomolecule. Every molecule behaves differently. That's why DYNAMICS provides analysis in terms of the onset transition temperature for aggregating samples, midpoint for samples with a defined end state, and linear analysis for any type of transition.

        Similarly, determine the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) with our Concentration Dependence analysis. There are no limitations when it comes to analyzing trends for your samples. Any transition can be analyzed with the Custom Parametric Analysis. Select parameters such as pH versus radius or salt concentration versus molar mass.

        Even perform statistical analysis for duplicate or triplicate samples, or overlay the analysis curves for multiple samples for all of the analysis types listed above.

     

        Absolute Molar Mass Determination

        Measure the absolute molar mass of proteins and small polymers in batch with the dedicated static light scattering detector of the DynaPro NanoStar – simultaneously – while collecting DLS data. Compare the results for molar mass with the hydrodynamic radius to determine molecular conformation and distinguish between aggregation and protein unfolding.

        For measurements of the absolute molar mass in chromatography mode or batch measurements of large polymers, we recommend the use of our multi-angle light scattering instruments.

  
        Everything is already set up for the protein scientist. Simply open a new experiment and start recording your data immediately. Data are stored, analyzed and presented in real time. DYNAMICS features an intuitive 32-bit multi-document graphical user interface. Logically organized, software features are dependent on your specific instrument, showing only the needed features and parameters. At the same time, the software becomes more complex at the right time and situation for data collection, analysis, and presentation. Expandable nodes expose the right level of detail for each measurement. For ease of use, simply click into the appropriate location to bring up desired options in addition to using standard menu items.

  

        Original Data

        Never lose any original data through preprocessing. All acquired autocorrelation functions are stored and can be readily reprocessed using different, customizable data filters to determine the size distribution and other quantities of interest of your samples. Any processing parameter may be changed post-acquisition.

  

        Automated Data Collection

        Unattended operation of your instrument is made possible by using powerful and flexible Event Schedules. Design virtually any sequence of data collection for your instrument, be it temperature or stability studies, plate reader scans or any variation in collection parameters. Wyatt provides an extensive library of Event schedules in the Customer Support Center.

        Extensive Solvent Database


Over 200 of the most common solvents and buffers are already included in our standard database. Of course, custom solvents may be added as well.






        Automation Interface

        An OLE interface is provided for the high-throughput lab using the DynaPro Plate Reader II. Interface your instrument with a robotic handler for fully automated plate loading and data collection. This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. for details.
        Everything is logically organized: View your results as a table, correlation graph, size distribution or parametric graph with multiple y-axis support. Expandable nodes expose the right level of detail for your measurements, so you can choose to display individual acquisitions, measurements or to overlay complete sets of data.

  

        Flexibility

        Any choice to display parameters in tables and graphs as well as user selectable units and precision are available. Settings can be saved globally or individually as presets (Standard Operating Procedures). Graph settings are customizable with custom axis displays, ranges, fonts and user-defined peak labeling. Overlay views for autocorrelation functions and sized distributions show reproducibility of repeat measurements or changes in your sample.

  



        Fully Customizable

        Add custom solvents and parameters to your data. Custom parameters may be even entered directly in your data table. Even better: Make those a part of your measurement name with the handy Names function!



        Variable Data Filter

        Outliers due to dust may be filtered out by a number of criteria. Apply your filter to all data, selected data, or even manually mark out individual acquisitions. Filtration criteria may be changed at any time.

  

        Data Export and Reporting

        Any display can be exported as a graph or as original data with a simple click of the mouse or by pressing shortcut keys. Results reports are partially customizable.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
