LEADING PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM FOCUSED ONENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS

Strategy



ArcLight invests across the energy industry with a focus on energy infrastructure assets with substantial growth potential, significant current income and meaningful downside protection.
Working closely with our portfolio executives and 400-person asset management affiliate, we employ an intensive hands-on approach that seeks to enhance the cash flow and asset value of our investments to generate attractive returns through current income and long-term capital appreciation.
We believe this approach has allowed us to build portfolios capable of achieving attractive private equity returns while also providing current income and a natural hedge against inflation.


Using our sector expertise and substantial industry footprint, we focus on the following core areas:
MidstreamPowerProduction

Pipelines, storage and terminals, gathering and processing, transportation, and offshore
Conventional power (natural gas, coal, oil), renewable power (wind, hydro, solar, biomass), and electric transmission and distribution
Onshore oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids
