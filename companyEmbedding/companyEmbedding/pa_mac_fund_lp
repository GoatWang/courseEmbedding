Campaign History
What kind of a company ignites its charity program by selling lipstick with RuPaul, a drag queen as its spokesperson? Then follows that act with (to use the colloquial) a non-lipstick lesbian, kd Lang? M·A·C, the cult Canadian brand created in 1985 has always been fearless and outspoken and when it comes to the VIVA GLAM message, it's always been loud and clear!
















&times;




The founders of the company, Frank Angelo and Frank Toskan, banded together with the M·A·C artists to create the M·A·C AIDS Fund in 1994, in a grass roots effort to make a difference in the world with a community outreach for HIV/AIDS.
It all started with VIVA GLAM lipstick; the bullet in passionate red that was the shot heard around the world - the first lipstick created to directly confront and raise money and awareness for AIDS at a time when the pandemic dramatically affected the fashion makeup communities, and was greatly stigmatized as a gay disease. With 100 percent of the proceeds of every VIVA GLAM product going directly to men, women and children affected by HIV/AIDS, it was an unprecedented move.
The idea of VIVA GLAM was to celebrate life and the outspoken attitude of the company. It was a connective tissue that encompassed the diversity of M·A·C and its mantra...all ages, all races, all sexes. It was, and continues to be, the signature and the heart and soul of the company. VIVA GLAM spokespeople are provocative, alternative and influential and reflect diverse communities. They are heroes we look up to for their personal triumphs; people who have invented themselves and people who created movements.

KAREN BUGLISI WEILER
GLOBAL BRAND PRESIDENT

 M·A·C Cosmetics


 As famous for her bi-annual performances on stage at International Artist Training Meetings as she is for her skyscraping stilettos and bronzed blonde glamour, what truly sets Karen Buglisi, Global Brand President of M∙A∙C Cosmetics, apart from the crowd is her boundless energy, endless enthusiasm and ceaseless dedication to the M∙A∙C family. Laughing as she addresses her now legendary dance moves, Ms. Buglisi says, “I think sometimes we’re so serious that we forget to have a little bit of fun! My point of view is that if I want our Artists to put themselves out there for the brand every day, I should put myself out there for them.” “Karen has superb leadership skills and has been instrumental in developing M∙A∙C into the number one makeup artist brand in the world,” says John Demsey, Group President of The Estée Lauder Companies. “She has done a tremendous job inspiring our M∙A∙C Makeup Artists, who are at the heart of the brand and the key to our success.” Seemingly born with a suitcase in hand, the indefatigable Ms. Buglisi, an army brat, was born in Japan, moved to Taiwan and then to California by the time she was four. “My father was my hero. He was the most disciplined person I ever met in my life. I think he set a standard for me, and I’ve never forgotten that.” After another move to Augusta, Georgia, her family settled in Washington, D.C., where she discovered the Beauty industry at the age of 16 selling Helena Rubinstein at The Hecht Company in Prince George’s Plaza. “I’ve always liked makeup. I got the job and thought, ‘what a great thing, I can wear makeup everyday and teach people about makeup and how you can make yourself feel better and look better.’ I never looked at it and said, ‘Ok, one day I’m going to be president of a makeup company.’ That never even crossed my mind!” Working everyday since she was a teenager, in addition to raising three sons as a single mother, it’s no surprise that Ms. Buglisi describes herself as someone who loves challenges. “Raising my sons has brought out a strength and determination I was never fully aware of. I know many parents can identify with this. That strength has been so meaningful as I have navigated through my life. I do not scare easily.” A member of the Board of Directors of the M∙A∙C AIDS Fund since 2004, she adds, “I remember sitting my kids down and talking to them about being respectful to girl and to always protect themselves by wearing a condom. You want to embarrass your sons, just have that conversation with them! Let’s put it this way, someone had to do it and it was me! It’s just too important not to have it! Before being recruited by Mr. Demsey in 1998 as Vice President of North American Sales and Artist Training and Development, Ms. Buglisi was national sales manager for the U.S. market for Adipar, a division of the worldwide fashion house Escada, and has also held the position of field sales manager for Borghese, a global cosmetic, skincare and fragrance company. “Servicing customers at retail and learning how to be a merchant have been invaluable in my career. I’ve done every job. I feel I have the ability to communicate at every level.” Promoted to Global Brand President of M∙A∙C Cosmetics in 2010, Ms. Buglisi now finds herself involved in all facets of the brand. “Now I get to work with marketing, global communications, as well as human resources, the MAF, sales operations, Artist training and development, finance and forecasting. It also brings me closer to the creative and product development side. James {Gager} and Jennifer {Balbier} are great partners. It’s so important to have that opportunity to connect all the dots. Also, this position gives me the chance to bring the M∙A∙C family closer together and really unite everybody.” Asked what she’s most energized about for the future of the brand, Ms. Buglisi speaks passionately about the growth of emerging markets like the Middle East, India, Brazil and China. “We’re paving the way. In some of these countries, the prestige makeup industry has never existed. We’re actually developing it as we grow and expand. They’re ready for something new and different and we’re the brand that’s perfectly positioned to deliver. We know when we have a foundation firmly grounded in our brand DNA, the sky is the limit. It’s a credit to all the teams here, working synergistically, making the M∙A∙C brand come alive, market by market. Ms. Buglisi encourages M•A•C Artists and employees to participate in all of M•A•C’s fundraising initiatives from VIVA GLAM to Kids Helping Kids greeting cards. “That’s what I’m most proud of. Every day we get to make a difference and show the world how passionate we are about helping men, women and children affected by HIV and AIDS. We just don’t do the fundraisers where everyone pays a thousand dollars for dinner – it’s one lipstick at a time, every single day, all around the world.” Her final message to the work family she believes in so much? “You can be whatever you want to be at M•A•C. You just have to believe and work hard.”

JAMES GAGER
SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT/CREATIVE DIRECTOR

 M·A·C Cosmetics


 Mr. Gager is constantly evolving the provocative visuals for M•A•C. He has engaged high-profile photographers David LaChapelle, Michael Thompson and Ellen von Unwerth to shoot the VIVA GLAM campaign, which uses hip personalities to promote a lipstick whose proceeds help support people living with HIV and AIDS. In the tradition of M•A•C, Mr. Gager began with musicians - Shirley Manson, Lil' Kim, Mary J. Blige and Elton John - and ultimately widened M•A•C's vision to encompass celebrities in other disciplines including Chloë Sevigny, Linda Evangelista and Dita Von Teese. He has brought what was essentially a grassroots campaign with RuPaul to international acclaim, making each spokesperson iconic during their VIVA GLAM tenure. No detail is spared his discerning eye, and he has even redesigned packaging to showcase a VIVA GLAM red band. Not surprisingly, Mr. Gager looked at hundreds of reds before choosing one that would be both emblematic of the cause and not clash with the ever-widening VIVA GLAM colour palette, which even includes a pale pink for Lady Gaga. Mr. Gager has also invigorated the Kids Helping Kids campaign, a program that showcases art made by children living with and/or affected by HIV and AIDS, by finding new creative materials for the children to use in designing the cards each season. Mr. Gager received his Bachelor of Industrial Design and a Master of Science/Package Design from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. He views his election to the Board of Directors of the M•A•C AIDS Fund as a highlight of his career, as important as any design award he has received.
