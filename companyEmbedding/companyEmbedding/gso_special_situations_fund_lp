In May 2007, GSO sold a minority stake in its business to Merrill Lynch.[1]
The following year, in March 2008, The Blackstone Group acquired GSO for approximately $1 billion.[2] Blackstone paid GSO $620 million in cash and stock and the GSO team also received an earnout worth up to $310 million through payable over the subsequent five years, based on certain earnings targets. Blackstone had existing relationships with the GSO team as an original investor in GSO's funds. The combination of Blackstone and GSO created one of the largest credit platforms in the alternative asset management business, with over $21 billion of total assets under management.[3] Following the completion of the acquisition, Blackstone merged GSO's operations with its existing debt investment operations.[4][5]
In July 2010, GSO announced the final closing of the Blackstone / GSO Capital Solutions Fund (the Fund) with total commitments of over $3.25 billion.[6]

                Investors given option to shift money into other GSO funds
            



                Hedge funds seeking shield from frequent client redemptions
            



Blackstone Group LP is ending its $3 billion distressed-debt hedge fund and will shift most of the assets into other credit funds that lock up client capital.The firm said it’s offered investors in its GSO Special Situations Fund the option to move assets into other distressed credit pools that don’t feature withdrawals. The special situations team, led by Blackstone partner Jason New, will continue to oversee the investments.“We have decided to transition the investment activities of our hedge fund into our other distressed funds with longer-duration, drawdown structures,” spokeswoman Paula Chirhart said. “These funds better complement our competitive strengths and style of investing and will allow us to generate better risk-adjusted returns for our investors.”








Blackstone’s decision is reflective of hedge funds’ desire to shield themselves from quarterly redemptions, which can be difficult to bear when investing in markets as volatile as distressed debt. In late 2015, Marty Whitman’s Third Avenue Management had to suspend redemptions in its main credit fund as outflows and losses imperiled its ability to meet further withdrawals. That sparked a broader industry movement to try changing the structure of credit funds, especially those investing in risky corners of the market.Blackstone’s special situations fund suffered losses in 2015, largely led by its exposure to coal and energy, and bounced back with a rebound in credit markets last year, two people with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be named discussing private details. A gauge for the distressed-bond market gained 54 percent last year, after recording losses of 38 percent and 20 percent the previous two years.Redemption EffectSuch volatility can create uneven returns and spook investors. When clients can pull money frequently, funds can be forced to sell well-performing holdings to avoid a fire sale on more illiquid credits. That can leave the fund stuck with illiquid securities that are depressed in value.




The majority of investors in the Blackstone special situations fund have expressed a desire to keep their money within the firm’s credit business, called GSO Capital Partners, the people with knowledge of the matter said.Blackstone declined to comment on investor decisions and the fund’s holdings.




The special situations hedge fund was started in 2005 and has generated an annualized return after fees of about 6.5 percent, Chirhart said. That compares with a 17 percent net annualized return in GSO’s 2007 mezzanine credit fund and 13 percent in that strategy’s 2011 pool, both of which are drawdown vehicles without a redemption option. GSO’s 2009 and 2013 rescue lending funds, which also don’t feature withdrawals, were returning 11 percent and 18 percent, respectively, as of Dec. 31.Blackstone acquired GSO -- which is named for founders Bennett Goodman, Tripp Smith and Doug Ostrover -- in 2008 and has expanded it nine-fold to be one of the world’s biggest credit investors, with $93.3 billion under management as of Dec. 31. The group accounted for 16 percent of New York-based Blackstone’s pretax profit in 2016.

One of GSO’s partners helping manage the fund, Darren Richman, left at the end of last year to open a hedge fund with David Chene, the former head of U.S. distressed debt at CarVal Investors. GSO’s global trading head, Craig Snyder, departed this month to lead distressed-debt trading at Ares Management LP, and in February GSO said Alan Kerr, who led its European customized credit strategies, planned to leave. Co-founder Ostrover left in 2015 and started Owl Rock Capital the following year.— With assistance by David Carey
