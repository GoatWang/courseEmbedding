Thryve (formerly named QuantBiome) helps people learn about the microbes inside their body and provides custom supplements to improve wellness. Users send in a sample of their poop via a mail-in kit that costs $39. Four to six weeks later, they get an analysis that they can view on their mobile device.
How it makes money
 In addition to the one-time test and analysis, Thryve offers a monthly subscription model and can send testing kits two, four or six times a year that can be accessed via the Web or on mobile devices. It also sells monthly probiotics.
