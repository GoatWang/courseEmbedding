research overview   


Decoding Genetic Information In TranslationThe  genetic code was established over two billion years ago and became  universally adopted by all living organisms. The rules of the  code--which relate specific nucleotide triplets to specific amino  acids--are established by aminoacylation reactions catalyzed by  aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. In these reactions, an amino acid is  associated with a specific nucleotide triplet of the genetic code, by  virtue of being linked to a specific tRNA that harbors the anticodon  triplet cognate to the amino acid. Because of their central role in  establishing the rules of the code, the tRNAs are thought to have arisen  quite early, perhaps in the context of an RNA world. The synthetases  may have been amongst the earliest proteins to appear, perhaps replacing  ribozymes that catalyzed the aminoacylation of primordial tRNAs. The  Schimmel laboratory is interested in understanding all aspects of these  systems. The cloverleaf structure of tRNA is folded into two  domains--one contains the anticodon with the template reading head of  the genetic code, and the other (called the minihelix domain) contains  the amino acid attachment site. The minihelix domain itself is a  substrate for aminoacylation, for at least ten of the synthetases. Even  smaller pieces than the minihelix are active as substrates (see figure).  Because these pieces lack the anticodon trinucleotides, the  relationship between the sequences/structures of these active pieces  (with as few as four base pairs) and the specific amino acid is distinct  from the genetic code. The relationship between sequences and  structures in tRNA acceptor stems and specific amino acids is referred  to as an operational RNA code for amino acids. The operational RNA code  is thought to have predated the genetic code.Our recent studies  have expanded upon these concepts to elucidate a role for the tRNA in  amino acid fine structure recognition. That is, the ability to  distinguish between two closely similar amino acids is greatly enhanced  by an effector function of the tRNA, that causes the rejection of amino  acids that are not exactly matched with the synthetase and its cognate  tRNA. This RNA-dependent fine structure recognition may have first  developed in an RNA world, and later was incorporated into the  synthetase system as a critical part of maintaining the accuracy of the  genetic code.

Life[edit]
Paul Schimmel was born in Hartford, Connecticut. He is Ernest and Jean Hahn Professor at the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute. He used to be the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the Department of Biology at MIT. Schimmel is author or co-author of more than 450 scientific papers and of a widely used three-volume textbook on biophysical chemistry.[2] For his achievements and discoveries in scientific research in the biological sciences, Schimmel has been elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the Institute of Medicine. Additional honors related to research and educational achievements include the American Chemical Society’s Pfizer Award in Enzyme Chemistry, the Stein and Moore Award (the highest honor of the Protein Society), the Biophysical Society’s Emily M. Gray Award (co-recipient) for significant contributions to education in biophysics, the Chinese Biopharmaceutical Society’s Brilliant Achievement Award, the Perlman Award (Lecture) of the American Chemical Society, and the Nucleic Acids Award (Lecture) of the Biochemical Society and Royal Society of Chemistry, UK. He has been active in many scientific and academic organizations and committees, including service as Chairman of the Division of Biological Chemistry of the American Chemical Society and as an editorial board member of ten different scientific journals.
For his entire career Schimmel’s research focused on a group of universal enzymes known as aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. The synthetases are believed by many to be among the first enzymes to arise on this planet in the early stages of the evolution of life. These enzymes translate the genetic information in all living organisms. In each cell, there is a separate tRNA synthetase for each of the 20 amino acids. In translating, or interpreting, the genetic material, they catalyze reactions whereby each amino acid is matched with a nucleotide triplet embedded in its cognate tRNA. In this way, the tRNA synthetases establish the rules of the genetic code and, because of this role, tRNA synthetases are essential for all forms of life. Because of decades of research of Schimmel and others, this group of enzymes is now understood to have additional novel functions, and to have deep-rooted connections to human diseases.
Schimmel and his wife Cleo have two daughters and eight grandchildren.
Principal scientific contributions[edit]
Correcting mistranslation of genetic material[edit]
Schimmel’s laboratory discovered a universal mechanism for correcting errors in the translation (mistranslation) of the genetic material. This mechanism is regarded as one of the most fundamental in biology. Specifically, they discovered an activity in aminoacyl tRNA synthetases that removes an amino acid that has been charged to the wrong tRNA.[3][4] He later discovered the novel module in synthetases that encodes this deacylase activity.[5][6] In mammalian cell-based experiments, and in experiments in mice with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratories, they showed that defects in this translational error-correction mechanism gives rise to profound pathologies, including neurodegeneration.[7][8] These error correction activities were shown to be intimately associated with the beginnings of living organisms.[9][10][11]
Discovery of the "second genetic code"[edit]
Schimmel’s laboratory discovered what has been referred to as a “second genetic code” that relates specific atomic determinants in small RNA substrates to specific aminoacylation.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] This RNA code is considered to give critical insights into the development of the modern genetic code and protein synthesis.
Discovery of the modular design of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases[edit]
Schimmel and coworkers were among the first to use genetic methods to establish the modular design of proteins in general and of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases in particular.[20][21][22][23]
Development of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for genomics[edit]
While Schimmel’s research program has largely focused on aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, in a separate line of research published in 1983, Schimmel developed the concept of what are now known as ESTs (expressed sequence tags) and the strategy of shotgun sequencing, approaches that several years later were adopted for the human genome project.[24] ESTs provide a way to identify all genes that are expressed in a specific tissue, such as muscle, among others. Nature magazine listed Schimmel’s work on ESTs as one of the four key developments that launched the human genome project.[25]
Expansion of the functional genome[edit]
The Schimmel laboratory discovered how tRNA synthetases undergo functional “metamorphosis” in human cells to acquire novel activities in signal transduction pathways ranging from the inflammatory response to angiogenesis.[26][27][28][29][30] This work led to efforts to commercialize applications of human synthetases to treat diseases.

In this way, the tRNA synthetases establish the rules of the genetic code and, because of this role, tRNA synthetases are essential for all forms of life. Because of decades of research of Schimmel and others, this group of enzymes is now understood to have additional novel functions, and to have deep-rooted connections to human diseases.
Schimmel and his wife Cleo have two daughters and eight grandchildren.
Principal scientific contributions[edit]
Correcting mistranslation of genetic material[edit]
Schimmel’s laboratory discovered a universal mechanism for correcting errors in the translation (mistranslation) of the genetic material. This mechanism is regarded as one of the most fundamental in biology. Specifically, they discovered an activity in aminoacyl tRNA synthetases that removes an amino acid that has been charged to the wrong tRNA.[3][4] He later discovered the novel module in synthetases that encodes this deacylase activity.[5][6] In mammalian cell-based experiments, and in experiments in mice with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratories, they showed that defects in this translational error-correction mechanism gives rise to profound pathologies, including neurodegeneration.[7][8] These error correction activities were shown to be intimately associated with the beginnings of living organisms.[9][10][11]
Discovery of the "second genetic code"[edit]
Schimmel’s laboratory discovered what has been referred to as a “second genetic code” that relates specific atomic determinants in small RNA substrates to specific aminoacylation.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] This RNA code is considered to give critical insights into the development of the modern genetic code and protein synthesis.
Discovery of the modular design of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases[edit]
Schimmel and coworkers were among the first to use genetic methods to establish the modular design of proteins in general and of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases in particular.[20][21][22][23]
Development of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for genomics[edit]
While Schimmel’s research program has largely focused on aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, in a separate line of research published in 1983, Schimmel developed the concept of what are now known as ESTs (expressed sequence tags) and the strategy of shotgun sequencing, approaches that several years later were adopted for the human genome project.[24] ESTs provide a way to identify all genes that are expressed in a specific tissue, such as muscle, among others. Nature magazine listed Schimmel’s work on ESTs as one of the four key developments that launched the human genome project.[25]
Expansion of the functional genome[edit]
The Schimmel laboratory discovered how tRNA synthetases undergo functional “metamorphosis” in human cells to acquire novel activities in signal transduction pathways ranging from the inflammatory response to angiogenesis.[26][27][28][29][30] This work led to efforts to commercialize applications of human synthetases to treat diseases.

Life[edit]
Paul Schimmel was born in Hartford, Connecticut. He is Ernest and Jean Hahn Professor at the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute. He used to be the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the Department of Biology at MIT. Schimmel is author or co-author of more than 450 scientific papers and of a widely used three-volume textbook on biophysical chemistry.[2] For his achievements and discoveries in scientific research in the biological sciences, Schimmel has been elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the Institute of Medicine. Additional honors related to research and educational achievements include the American Chemical Society’s Pfizer Award in Enzyme Chemistry, the Stein and Moore Award (the highest honor of the Protein Society), the Biophysical Society’s Emily M. Gray Award (co-recipient) for significant contributions to education in biophysics, the Chinese Biopharmaceutical Society’s Brilliant Achievement Award, the Perlman Award (Lecture) of the American Chemical Society, and the Nucleic Acids Award (Lecture) of the Biochemical Society and Royal Society of Chemistry, UK. He has been active in many scientific and academic organizations and committees, including service as Chairman of the Division of Biological Chemistry of the American Chemical Society and as an editorial board member of ten different scientific journals.
For his entire career Schimmel’s research focused on a group of universal enzymes known as aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. The synthetases are believed by many to be among the first enzymes to arise on this planet in the early stages of the evolution of life. These enzymes translate the genetic information in all living organisms. In each cell, there is a separate tRNA synthetase for each of the 20 amino acids. In translating, or interpreting, the genetic material, they catalyze reactions whereby each amino acid is matched with a nucleotide triplet embedded in its cognate tRNA. In this way, the tRNA synthetases establish the rules of the genetic code and, because of this role, tRNA synthetases are essential for all forms of life. Because of decades of research of Schimmel and others, this group of enzymes is now understood to have additional novel functions, and to have deep-rooted connections to human diseases.
Schimmel and his wife Cleo have two daughters and eight grandchildren.

Life[edit]
Paul Schimmel was born in Hartford, Connecticut. He is Ernest and Jean Hahn Professor at the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute. He used to be the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the Department of Biology at MIT. Schimmel is author or co-author of more than 450 scientific papers and of a widely used three-volume textbook on biophysical chemistry.[2] For his achievements and discoveries in scientific research in the biological sciences, Schimmel has been elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the Institute of Medicine. Additional honors related to research and educational achievements include the American Chemical Society’s Pfizer Award in Enzyme Chemistry, the Stein and Moore Award (the highest honor of the Protein Society), the Biophysical Society’s Emily M. Gray Award (co-recipient) for significant contributions to education in biophysics, the Chinese Biopharmaceutical Society’s Brilliant Achievement Award, the Perlman Award (Lecture) of the American Chemical Society, and the Nucleic Acids Award (Lecture) of the Biochemical Society and Royal Society of Chemistry, UK. He has been active in many scientific and academic organizations and committees, including service as Chairman of the Division of Biological Chemistry of the American Chemical Society and as an editorial board member of ten different scientific journals.
For his entire career Schimmel’s research focused on a group of universal enzymes known as aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. The synthetases are believed by many to be among the first enzymes to arise on this planet in the early stages of the evolution of life. These enzymes translate the genetic information in all living organisms. In each cell, there is a separate tRNA synthetase for each of the 20 amino acids. In translating, or interpreting, the genetic material, they catalyze reactions whereby each amino acid is matched with a nucleotide triplet embedded in its cognate tRNA. In this way, the tRNA synthetases establish the rules of the genetic code and, because of this role, tRNA synthetases are essential for all forms of life. Because of decades of research of Schimmel and others, this group of enzymes is now understood to have additional novel functions, and to have deep-rooted connections to human diseases.
Schimmel and his wife Cleo have two daughters and eight grandchildren.
Principal scientific contributions[edit]
Correcting mistranslation of genetic material[edit]
Schimmel’s laboratory discovered a universal mechanism for correcting errors in the translation (mistranslation) of the genetic material. This mechanism is regarded as one of the most fundamental in biology. Specifically, they discovered an activity in aminoacyl tRNA synthetases that removes an amino acid that has been charged to the wrong tRNA.[3][4] He later discovered the novel module in synthetases that encodes this deacylase activity.[5][6] In mammalian cell-based experiments, and in experiments in mice with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratories, they showed that defects in this translational error-correction mechanism gives rise to profound pathologies, including neurodegeneration.[7][8] These error correction activities were shown to be intimately associated with the beginnings of living organisms.[9][10][11]
Discovery of the "second genetic code"[edit]
Schimmel’s laboratory discovered what has been referred to as a “second genetic code” that relates specific atomic determinants in small RNA substrates to specific aminoacylation.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] This RNA code is considered to give critical insights into the development of the modern genetic code and protein synthesis.
Discovery of the modular design of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases[edit]
Schimmel and coworkers were among the first to use genetic methods to establish the modular design of proteins in general and of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases in particular.[20][21][22][23]
Development of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for genomics[edit]
While Schimmel’s research program has largely focused on aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, in a separate line of research published in 1983, Schimmel developed the concept of what are now known as ESTs (expressed sequence tags) and the strategy of shotgun sequencing, approaches that several years later were adopted for the human genome project.[24] ESTs provide a way to identify all genes that are expressed in a specific tissue, such as muscle, among others. Nature magazine listed Schimmel’s work on ESTs as one of the four key developments that launched the human genome project.[25]
Expansion of the functional genome[edit]
The Schimmel laboratory discovered how tRNA synthetases undergo functional “metamorphosis” in human cells to acquire novel activities in signal transduction pathways ranging from the inflammatory response to angiogenesis.[26][27][28][29][30] This work led to efforts to commercialize applications of human synthetases to treat diseases.

Translational medicine contributions[edit]
With his longstanding interest in the applications of basic biomedical research to human health, Schimmel holds more than 25 patents and is a cofounder or founding director of several companies. These companies have created FDA-approved medicines and are developing new medicines to treat patients for infections, mental disorders, cancers, diabetes, and inflammatory conditions, and have provided over a thousand jobs in the US and China. Seven of these companies became publicly traded and three were acquired by other companies. Examples of these companies are:

RepliGen Corporation [31]
Alkermes [32]
Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[33]
Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[34]
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[35]
Sirtris, a GSK Company [36]
aTyr Pharma [37]

In recognition of the broad impact of his translational medicine activities, he received the Chinese Biopharmaceutical Association’s Brilliant Achievement Award in 2006.[38] The European-based Science Alliance and Technopolicy Network named Schimmel "Most Entrepreneurial Scientist of USA" in 2007 at a ceremony in Washington DC.[39]

Life[edit]
Paul Schimmel was born in Hartford, Connecticut. He is Ernest and Jean Hahn Professor at the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute. He used to be the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the Department of Biology at MIT. Schimmel is author or co-author of more than 450 scientific papers and of a widely used three-volume textbook on biophysical chemistry.[2] For his achievements and discoveries in scientific research in the biological sciences, Schimmel has been elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the Institute of Medicine. Additional honors related to research and educational achievements include the American Chemical Society’s Pfizer Award in Enzyme Chemistry, the Stein and Moore Award (the highest honor of the Protein Society), the Biophysical Society’s Emily M. Gray Award (co-recipient) for significant contributions to education in biophysics, the Chinese Biopharmaceutical Society’s Brilliant Achievement Award, the Perlman Award (Lecture) of the American Chemical Society, and the Nucleic Acids Award (Lecture) of the Biochemical Society and Royal Society of Chemistry, UK. He has been active in many scientific and academic organizations and committees, including service as Chairman of the Division of Biological Chemistry of the American Chemical Society and as an editorial board member of ten different scientific journals.
For his entire career Schimmel’s research focused on a group of universal enzymes known as aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. The synthetases are believed by many to be among the first enzymes to arise on this planet in the early stages of the evolution of life. These enzymes translate the genetic information in all living organisms. In each cell, there is a separate tRNA synthetase for each of the 20 amino acids. In translating, or interpreting, the genetic material, they catalyze reactions whereby each amino acid is matched with a nucleotide triplet embedded in its cognate tRNA. In this way, the tRNA synthetases establish the rules of the genetic code and, because of this role, tRNA synthetases are essential for all forms of life. Because of decades of research of Schimmel and others, this group of enzymes is now understood to have additional novel functions, and to have deep-rooted connections to human diseases.
Schimmel and his wife Cleo have two daughters and eight grandchildren.
Principal scientific contributions[edit]
Correcting mistranslation of genetic material[edit]
Schimmel’s laboratory discovered a universal mechanism for correcting errors in the translation (mistranslation) of the genetic material. This mechanism is regarded as one of the most fundamental in biology. Specifically, they discovered an activity in aminoacyl tRNA synthetases that removes an amino acid that has been charged to the wrong tRNA.[3][4] He later discovered the novel module in synthetases that encodes this deacylase activity.[5][6] In mammalian cell-based experiments, and in experiments in mice with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratories, they showed that defects in this translational error-correction mechanism gives rise to profound pathologies, including neurodegeneration.[7][8] These error correction activities were shown to be intimately associated with the beginnings of living organisms.[9][10][11]
Discovery of the "second genetic code"[edit]
Schimmel’s laboratory discovered what has been referred to as a “second genetic code” that relates specific atomic determinants in small RNA substrates to specific aminoacylation.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] This RNA code is considered to give critical insights into the development of the modern genetic code and protein synthesis.
Discovery of the modular design of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases[edit]
Schimmel and coworkers were among the first to use genetic methods to establish the modular design of proteins in general and of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases in particular.[20][21][22][23]
Development of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for genomics[edit]
While Schimmel’s research program has largely focused on aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, in a separate line of research published in 1983, Schimmel developed the concept of what are now known as ESTs (expressed sequence tags) and the strategy of shotgun sequencing, approaches that several years later were adopted for the human genome project.[24] ESTs provide a way to identify all genes that are expressed in a specific tissue, such as muscle, among others. Nature magazine listed Schimmel’s work on ESTs as one of the four key developments that launched the human genome project.[25]
Expansion of the functional genome[edit]
The Schimmel laboratory discovered how tRNA synthetases undergo functional “metamorphosis” in human cells to acquire novel activities in signal transduction pathways ranging from the inflammatory response to angiogenesis.[26][27][28][29][30] This work led to efforts to commercialize applications of human synthetases to treat diseases.

Translational medicine contributions[edit]
With his longstanding interest in the applications of basic biomedical research to human health, Schimmel holds more than 25 patents and is a cofounder or founding director of several companies. These companies have created FDA-approved medicines and are developing new medicines to treat patients for infections, mental disorders, cancers, diabetes, and inflammatory conditions, and have provided over a thousand jobs in the US and China. Seven of these companies became publicly traded and three were acquired by other companies. Examples of these companies are:

RepliGen Corporation [31]
Alkermes [32]
Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[33]
Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[34]
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[35]

Life[edit]
Paul Schimmel was born in Hartford, Connecticut. He is Ernest and Jean Hahn Professor at the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute. He used to be the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the Department of Biology at MIT. Schimmel is author or co-author of more than 450 scientific papers and of a widely used three-volume textbook on biophysical chemistry.[2] For his achievements and discoveries in scientific research in the biological sciences, Schimmel has been elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the Institute of Medicine. Additional honors related to research and educational achievements include the American Chemical Society’s Pfizer Award in Enzyme Chemistry, the Stein and Moore Award (the highest honor of the Protein Society), the Biophysical Society’s Emily M. Gray Award (co-recipient) for significant contributions to education in biophysics, the Chinese Biopharmaceutical Society’s Brilliant Achievement Award, the Perlman Award (Lecture) of the American Chemical Society, and the Nucleic Acids Award (Lecture) of the Biochemical Society and Royal Society of Chemistry, UK. He has been active in many scientific and academic organizations and committees, including service as Chairman of the Division of Biological Chemistry of the American Chemical Society and as an editorial board member of ten different scientific journals.
For his entire career Schimmel’s research focused on a group of universal enzymes known as aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. The synthetases are believed by many to be among the first enzymes to arise on this planet in the early stages of the evolution of life. These enzymes translate the genetic information in all living organisms. In each cell, there is a separate tRNA synthetase for each of the 20 amino acids. In translating, or interpreting, the genetic material, they catalyze reactions whereby each amino acid is matched with a nucleotide triplet embedded in its cognate tRNA. In this way, the tRNA synthetases establish the rules of the genetic code and, because of this role, tRNA synthetases are essential for all forms of life. Because of decades of research of Schimmel and others, this group of enzymes is now understood to have additional novel functions, and to have deep-rooted connections to human diseases.
Schimmel and his wife Cleo have two daughters and eight grandchildren.
Principal scientific contributions[edit]
Correcting mistranslation of genetic material[edit]
Schimmel’s laboratory discovered a universal mechanism for correcting errors in the translation (mistranslation) of the genetic material. This mechanism is regarded as one of the most fundamental in biology. Specifically, they discovered an activity in aminoacyl tRNA synthetases that removes an amino acid that has been charged to the wrong tRNA.[3][4] He later discovered the novel module in synthetases that encodes this deacylase activity.[5][6] In mammalian cell-based experiments, and in experiments in mice with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratories, they showed that defects in this translational error-correction mechanism gives rise to profound pathologies, including neurodegeneration.[7][8] These error correction activities were shown to be intimately associated with the beginnings of living organisms.[9][10][11]
Discovery of the "second genetic code"[edit]
Schimmel’s laboratory discovered what has been referred to as a “second genetic code” that relates specific atomic determinants in small RNA substrates to specific aminoacylation.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] This RNA code is considered to give critical insights into the development of the modern genetic code and protein synthesis.
Discovery of the modular design of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases[edit]
Schimmel and coworkers were among the first to use genetic methods to establish the modular design of proteins in general and of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases in particular.[20][21][22][23]
Development of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for genomics[edit]
While Schimmel’s research program has largely focused on aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, in a separate line of research published in 1983, Schimmel developed the concept of what are now known as ESTs (expressed sequence tags) and the strategy of shotgun sequencing, approaches that several years later were adopted for the human genome project.[24] ESTs provide a way to identify all genes that are expressed in a specific tissue, such as muscle, among others. Nature magazine listed Schimmel’s work on ESTs as one of the four key developments that launched the human genome project.[25]
Expansion of the functional genome[edit]
The Schimmel laboratory discovered how tRNA synthetases undergo functional “metamorphosis” in human cells to acquire novel activities in signal transduction pathways ranging from the inflammatory response to angiogenesis.[26][27][28][29][30] This work led to efforts to commercialize applications of human synthetases to treat diseases.

Translational medicine contributions[edit]
With his longstanding interest in the applications of basic biomedical research to human health, Schimmel holds more than 25 patents and is a cofounder or founding director of several companies. These companies have created FDA-approved medicines and are developing new medicines to treat patients for infections, mental disorders, cancers, diabetes, and inflammatory conditions, and have provided over a thousand jobs in the US and China. Seven of these companies became publicly traded and three were acquired by other companies. Examples of these companies are:

RepliGen Corporation [31]
Alkermes [32]
Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[33]
Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[34]
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[35]
Sirtris, a GSK Company [36]
aTyr Pharma [37]

In recognition of the broad impact of his translational medicine activities, he received the Chinese Biopharmaceutical Association’s Brilliant Achievement Award in 2006.[38] The European-based Science Alliance and Technopolicy Network named Schimmel "Most Entrepreneurial Scientist of USA" in 2007 at a ceremony in Washington DC.[39]

Research Focus
Decoding Genetic Information In TranslationThe genetic code was established over two billion years ago and became universally adopted by all living organisms. The rules of the code--which relate specific nucleotide triplets to specific amino acids--are established by aminoacylation reactions catalyzed by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. In these reactions, an amino acid is associated with a specific nucleotide triplet of the genetic code, by virtue of being linked to a specific tRNA that harbors the anticodon triplet cognate to the amino acid. Because of their central role in establishing the rules of the code, the tRNAs are thought to have arisen quite early, perhaps in the context of an RNA world. The synthetases may have been amongst the earliest proteins to appear, perhaps replacing ribozymes that catalyzed the aminoacylation of primordial tRNAs. The Schimmel laboratory is interested in understanding all aspects of these systems. Our present work focuses on the discovery of the large new biology that flows out of the tRNA synthetases. These enzymes are now known to be secreted, to have nuclear functions, and to pervade most or all parts of human biology with activities that are distinct from their catalytic function of charging tRNA. The laboratory uses methods and logic of molecular and cell biology, chemistry, and structural analysis to more deeply investigate these novel functions that have a fundamental role in maintaining organismal homeostasis, and in developing and regulating nervous, vascular, and immunological systems. The research is leading to the development of a broad new class of therapeutics to treat and cure human diseases.

Rumi
Annemarie Schimmel and Translated by Paul Bergne

Makers of Islamic Civilization

 Situates Rumi in his religious and literary context 








Rumi
Annemarie Schimmel and Translated by Paul Bergne
Makers of Islamic Civilization



Description



Jalaluddin Rumi (1207-1273) is the most famous exponent of the mystical tradition in Islam and venerated as "Mevlana," "our master." The still flourishing Mevlevi order of dervishes, famous for their ecstatic music and dance, was organized by his eldest son on the basis of Rumi's teaching and practice. He spent most of his life in Konya in Rum (modern Anatolia), whence the name "Rumi." His longest work, the Mathnavi, has held its reputation in the eastern lands of the Islamic world as the most recited and venerated text after the Qur'an. Echoes of the Muslim Scripture, and traces of Rumi's education as a traditional Muslim jurist or faqih, are apparent throughout his writings. The resurgence of interest in Rumi in the West has evolved into a cult, especially on American college campuses. As Schimmel explains, this cult does not do justice to the profound spiritual passion and insights of the Mathnavi and Rumi's Divan. In this concise, readable essay, she sketches the major landmarks in Rumi's life and the influences on it, the religious and cultural background of his poetic Sufism, the dominant strands of imagery and the range of tone and anecdote that animate his spiritual world. She explains why Rumi, as poet and mystic, must be understood in the Persian literary and the Islamic religious traditions to which he belonged. It is through those traditions that he experienced and expressed the Divine Love that the peoples of all faith traditions immediately recognize and affirm. The closing chapters review recent scholarship and translations of Rumi's works, in West and East, and answer the question "What does Rumi mean to us in the modern world?"
