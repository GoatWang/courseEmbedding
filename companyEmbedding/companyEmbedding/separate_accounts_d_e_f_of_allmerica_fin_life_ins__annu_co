731 F. Supp. 2d 103 (2010)
Francisco P. FERNANDES, Plaintiff,
v.
Eric HAVKIN, Elite Mortgages, Inc. and Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., Defendants.
Civil Action No. 08-11498-MBB.
United States District Court, D. Massachusetts.
August 10, 2010.

James W. McGarry, Brook L. Ames, Gina M. Atwood, Kristen A. Kearney, Goodwin Procter, LLP, Boston, MA, for Defendants.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER RE: DEFENDANT COUNTRYWIDE HOME LOANS, INC.' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (DOCKET ENTRY # 36)
MARIANNE B. BOWLER, United States Magistrate Judge.
Pending before this court is a motion for summary judgment (Docket Entry # 36) filed by defendant Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. ("defendant"), under Rule 56(c), Fed.R.Civ.P., seeking judgment in its favor on counts II, III, IV and V of plaintiff Francisco P. Fernandes's ("plaintiff") complaint (Docket Entry # 1). The counts consist of claims for unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A ("chapter 93A") and negligence, respectively. (Docket Entry # 1). On January 27, 2010, this court held a hearing and took the motion (Docket Entry # 36) under advisement.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On September 2, 2008, plaintiff filed the above styled action seeking damages on five counts involving mortgage fraud. (Docket Entry # 1). Defendant filed an answer and affirmative defense to the complaint (Docket Entry # 17) on November 5, 2008, and a cross-claim against defendant Elite Mortgages, Inc. ("Elite") (Docket Entry # 31) for indemnification and contribution on June 1, 2009.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is designed "to pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine whether trial is actually required." Davila v. Corporacion De Puerto Rico Para La Difusion Publica, 498 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2007). As the moving party, defendant must make an initial showing "that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Rule 56(c), Fed.R.Civ.P. "A dispute is genuine if the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in the favor of the non-moving party." Am. Steel Erectors, Inc. v. Local Union No. 7, Int'l Ass'n of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental & Reinforcing Iron Workers, 536 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2008). "A fact is material if it carries with it the potential to affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable law." Id.
Once the moving party properly supports its motion for summary judgment, "the burden shifts to the nonmoving party, with respect to each issue on which it has the burden of proof, to demonstrate that a trier of fact reasonably could find in its favor." Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir.2000). Facts are viewed in favor of the nonmovant, i.e., plaintiff. See Noonan v. Staples, Inc., 556 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. *106 2009). "Where, as here, the nonmovant has the burden of proof and the evidence on one or more of the critical issues in the case is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted." Davila v. Corporacion De Puerto Rico Para La Difusion Publica, 498 F.3d at 12.
The nonmoving party must "produce specific facts, in suitable evidentiary form, to establish the presence of a trialworthy issue" with respect to each element on which he "would bear the burden of proof at trial." Clifford v. Barnhart, 449 F.3d 276, 280 (1st Cir.2006); see F.D.I.C. v. Elder Care Servs., Inc., 82 F.3d 524, 526 (1st Cir.1996) (if a party opposes summary judgment by demonstrating a "factual dispute on which it bears the burden at trial, that party must point to evidence affirmatively tending to prove that fact in its favor"). To this end, "`conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation,'" are insufficient to establish a genuine dispute of fact. Triangle Trading Co., Inc. v. Robroy Indus., Inc., 200 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting Smith v. F.W. Morse & Co., Inc., 76 F.3d 413, 428 (1st Cir.1996)).
Defendant submitted a Local Rule 56.1 ("LR. 56.1") statement of undisputed facts (Docket Entry # 38) to which plaintiff filed a response (Docket Entry # 44). Uncontroverted statements of fact therein comprise part of the summary judgment record.[1]See Cochran v. Quest Software, Inc., 328 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2003) (nonmovant's failure to contest a date in LR. 56.1 statement of material facts caused date to be admitted on summary judgment); see also Stonkus v. City of Brockton Sch. Dept., 322 F.3d 97, 102 (1st Cir.2003) (citing LR. 56.1 and deeming admitted undisputed material facts that the nonmovant failed to controvert).

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On July 8, 2002, Elite, a Pennsylvania mortgage broker company licensed to do business in Massachusetts, and defendant, a California mortgage company licensed to provide mortgages in Massachusetts, entered into a Wholesale Broker Agreement. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. G; Docket Entry # 1, ¶¶ 3 & 4). Under the Wholesale Broker Agreement, Elite brokers were responsible for contact with potential borrowers but were not authorized to modify any terms of the loans issued by defendant in any material respect. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. G & H). Additionally, the agreement expressly stated that defendant and Elite "are operating as independent parties" and that "neither party shall at any time hold itself out to any third party to be an agent or employee of another." (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. G). Plaintiff, a Massachusetts resident, was not apprised of this agreement. (Docket Entry # 43, ¶ 8).
On September 15, 2004, plaintiff purchased the property known as 691-93 Robeson Street, Fall River, MA 02720 for $375,000. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. A). First Franklin Bank ("First Franklin") financed the purchase and plaintiff contributed a down payment of $19,500. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C). First Franklin made two separate loans to plaintiff: the first loan was for $300,000 over a 30 year period with a fixed interest rate of 6.5% for the first two years and the second loan was for $56,250 over a 15 year period with a fixed interest rate of 8.5% for the first two years. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C & E). Plaintiff planned to refinance after the first two years. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C).
Plaintiff received a telephone call in January of 2006 from Eric Havkin ("Havkin") *107 of Elite regarding refinancing plaintiff's First Franklin loans. (Docket Entry # 43, ¶ 3). During this call, Havkin informed plaintiff of a refinance loan with a 1% fixed interest rate over 30 years. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C). After several phone calls and emails between Havkin and plaintiff, plaintiff states that he decided to refinance with the understanding that he was receiving a loan with a 1% fixed interest rate over 30 years. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C). On January 12, 2006, plaintiff and Elite entered into the Borrower-Broker Agreement, which deemed Elite the exclusive agent for obtaining plaintiff's mortgage. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. F).
At the time of the closing, on February 23, 2006, plaintiff noticed that the interest rate on defendant's loan documents was 2.5%. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C). At this time, plaintiff also received disclosure documents pursuant to the Truth in Lending Act which displayed the total costs of the refinance loan from defendant. (Docket Entry # 46, Ex. 1). Plaintiff telephoned Havkin regarding the discrepancy and Havkin assured plaintiff that it was a mistake which would be corrected after plaintiff signed the closing documents. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C). Plaintiff signed the documents with the understanding that the mistake would be corrected, that the terms would be those that he had discussed originally with Havkin and that plaintiff had three days to cancel the transaction if Havkin would not agree to the original terms as negotiated. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C).
On February 24, 2006, plaintiff emailed Havkin regarding the discrepancies between the closing documents and the terms of the loan pursuant to their conversations. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. M). Specifically, plaintiff stated that he would cancel the transaction unless the monthly mortgage insurance ("PMI") was waived, the monthly payment was $1,537 for 30 years and the interest rate was fixed, not variable. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. M). In closing the email, plaintiff stated, "Unless I receive from you these assurances, I may find myself forced to cancel this whole thing by Monday for it is too much of a risk that I cannot afford to take" and that "lots of information you provided me did not materialize in the actual closing paper work that really matters." (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. M).
Subsequently, Havkin reassured plaintiff in writing that discrepancies in the closing documents were a mistake and would be corrected. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C). Specifically, Havkin communicated that the PMI would be "taken off," that plaintiff would have a fixed payment of $1,537 for 360 months and that the interest rate would not change unless plaintiff made interest only payments. (Docket Entry # 42, Ex. 1). Havkin further stated that "The closing paperwork is very confusing and it is legal vocabulary. This is a simple understanding of your new mortgage." (Docket Entry # 42, Ex. 1). Plaintiff did not cancel the transaction within the three day period. (Docket Entry # 43, ¶ 12).
Plaintiff's first loan payment bill, however, retained the unchanged terms of the loan to which plaintiff signed. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C). Plaintiff contacted Havkin via telephone after receiving the first bill and Havkin assured plaintiff that he would correct the discrepancy. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C). Until Havkin left Elite, plaintiff continued to communicate with Havkin regarding a potential second refinancing transaction to restore plaintiff to his original position before refinancing. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C). After Havkin left, plaintiff corresponded with other employees, including Elite's president, Yan Kodomsky, about changing the terms of the loan. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. C).
*108 According to Havkin, an account executive for defendant, Tina Wilson ("Wilson"), had visited Elite to educate the brokers regarding defendant's new products and to encourage the brokers to solicit potential borrowers. (Docket Entry # 42, ¶¶ 2 & 3). Wilson allegedly made herself available to answer any questions regarding defendant's products during plaintiff's loan application and closing process. (Docket Entry # 42, ¶ 4). When Havkin initially contacted plaintiff about refinancing, Havkin states that he described defendant's loan product exactly as Wilson had explained it to Havkin. (Docket Entry # 42, ¶ 8). After receiving the email from plaintiff on February 24, 2006, regarding the discrepancies in the loan terms, Havkin claims that he consulted Wilson who confirmed the negotiated loan terms before he emailed plaintiff. (Docket Entry # 42, ¶ 12). When the first bill from defendant reflected the terms of the loan as signed, and not as negotiated, Havkin claims that he contacted Wilson who then changed her explanation of the loan terms. (Docket Entry # 42, ¶ 19).
Plaintiff subsequently contacted defendant seeking to put himself back to the position he was in before he refinanced. (Docket Entry # 46, Ex. 4). Defendant offered plaintiff a loan modification for refinancing with a lower monthly payment but plaintiff did not accept. (Docket Entry # 46, Ex. 4). The loan modification would have increased his principal to a greater amount than the purchase price of the property. (Docket Entry # 46, Ex. 4). In an email correspondence regarding that offer, an employee of defendant referred to plaintiff's refinanced mortgage as "the worst mortgage in the industry." (Docket Entry # 46, Ex. 5).
On April 13, 2007, plaintiff sent a letter to Elite, addressed to Yan Kadomsky, alleging unfair and deceptive trade practices pursuant to section 9 of chapter 93A. (Docket Entry # 46, Ex. 13). Although the letter was addressed to Elite, defendant responded to the letter on May 14, 2007. (Docket Entry # 46, Ex. 13). There was no settlement offer in defendant's response. (Docket Entry # 46, Ex. 13).

DISCUSSION

I. Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Count III)

In response to Count III alleging defendant's breach of fiduciary duty, defendant moves for summary judgment on the theory that no fiduciary relationship existed between defendant as a lender and plaintiff as a debtor. (Docket Entry # 37). Plaintiff in response argues that defendant's active role in the refinancing process justifies an exception to defendant's theory and created a fiduciary relationship between plaintiff and defendant. (Docket Entry # 45). In addition, plaintiff argues that an agency relationship existed between Havkin and defendant, again creating a fiduciary duty of defendant to plaintiff. (Docket Entry # 45).
For the following reasons, this court finds no general issues of material fact regarding defendant's or Wilson's interaction with Havkin or with plaintiff during the brokerage process. This court further finds that judgment should enter as a matter of law in favor of defendant on Count III.

A. Fiduciary Relationship

Plaintiff alleges that defendant "violated [its] fiduciary duty by construing the [mortgage] transaction to [defendant's] benefit and plaintiff's detriment." (Docket Entry # 1, ¶ 52). Defendant claims that plaintiff's argument fails as a matter of law because "under Massachusetts law, the relationship between a lender and a borrower, without more, does not establish a fiduciary relationship." FAMM Steel, Inc. v. *109 Sovereign Bank, 571 F.3d 93, 102 (1st Cir.2009); see Corcoran v. Saxon Mortgage Servs., Inc., 2010 WL 2106179, *4 (D.Mass. May 24, 2010) ("under Massachusetts law, neither a mortgage holder nor its servicer owes a fiduciary duty to a borrower"); see also Pimental v. Wachovia Mortgage Corp., 411 F. Supp. 2d 32, 39 (D.Mass.2006) ("[l]enders normally do not owe borrowers fiduciary duties").
Plaintiff argues that defendant's and Wilson's alleged involvement in the brokerage process constitutes the something "more" such that a fiduciary relationship is formed. (Docket Entry # 45). To this end, plaintiff relies on the Declaration of Havkin (Docket Entry # 42) to link Wilson, and thus defendant, to Havkin's statements regarding plaintiff's loan. Although Havkin alleges that he merely conveyed the terms of the loan to plaintiff exactly as Wilson had explained them, neither Havkin in his declaration nor plaintiff in his brief in opposition to summary judgment provide any further specificity. (Docket Entry # 44, ¶ 70; Docket Entry # 42, ¶ 8). The exact terms that Wilson allegedly relayed to Havkin are unstated and left to inference. In fact, the terms of the loan as negotiateda 1% fixed interest rate over 30 yearsare not specifically mentioned in Havkin's declaration. (Docket Entry # 42).
Plaintiff next claims that, after he noticed discrepancies between the closing terms and those negotiated, Havkin contacted Wilson who "confirmed the loan program terms." (Docket Entry # 42, ¶ 12; Docket Entry # 44, ¶ 72). Again, plaintiff does not specifically state what those terms were but rather relies on "conclusory allegations" and "inferences" to imply that Wilson verified incorrect terms. See Triangle Trading Co., Inc. v. Robroy Indus., Inc., 200 F.3d at 2. Notably, Havkin attached to this declaration the February 24, 2006, communication between Havkin and plaintiff, but none between Havkin and Wilson. (Docket Entry # 42, Ex. 1).
After plaintiff received his first bill from defendant and subsequently contacted Havkin, Havkin alleges that he again attempted to confirm the validity of the negotiated terms with Wilson. (Docket Entry # 44, ¶ 73; Docket Entry # 42, ¶¶ 16 & 17). At that point, according to Havkin, Wilson altered her description of the loan. (Docket Entry # 44, ¶ 73; Docket Entry # 42, ¶ 19). Neither Havkin nor plaintiff articulate from what, or to what, Wilson allegedly changed her description or provide any evidence in this respect.
Plaintiff thus fails to provide sufficient evidence to create an issue of material fact regarding defendant's involvement in the brokerage process. See F.D.I.C. v. Elder Care Servs., Inc., 82 F.3d at 526 (a party opposing summary judgment "must point to evidence affirmatively tending to prove that fact in its favor"). Arguments put forth in Havkin's declaration (Docket Entry # 42) fail to "produce specific facts, in suitable evidentiary form, to establish the presence of a trialworthy issue." Clifford v. Barnhart, 449 F.3d at 280. The conclusory allegations and inferences contained in the declaration do not give rise to a triable issue of fact. See Triangle Trading Co., Inc. v. Robroy Indus., Inc., 200 F.3d at 2.
Plaintiff analogizes to Bakis, in which the National Bank of Greece ("the Bank") actively solicited Greek-American investors to invest in a software company founded by individuals of Greek descent. Bakis v. Nat'l Bank of Greece, S.A., 1998 WL 34064622, *1-2 (Mass.Super. Dec. 15, 1998) ("Bakis"). The Bank targeted the Greek community of Greater Boston by exploiting personal relationships and invoking notions of Greek national pride and community spirit. Id. at *2-3. The Bank, however, failed to disclose to investors that *110 they were solicited as a strategy to relieve the Bank of its liability on unsecured and risky loans issued to said company, or that the Bank had contemplated liquidating the company. Id. at *2.
In general, a customer who merely "reposes confidence and respect in the judgment of another and trust in his character cannot, without more, transform a business relationship into one which is a fiduciary." Id. (citing Superior Glass Co., Inc. v. First Bristol County Nat'l Bank, 380 Mass. 829, 406 N.E.2d 672, 674 (1980)); see Corcoran v. Saxon Mortgage Servs., Inc., 2010 WL 2106179, *4 (same). "[A] fiduciary relationship arises when the defendant knowingly accepts the trust and confidence reposed in him by another and takes advantage of it to his benefit." Bakis, 1998 WL 34064622, *13; see FAMM Steel, Inc. v. Sovereign Bank, 571 F.3d at 102 ("a fiduciary relationship may arise... where the borrower reposes its trust and confidence in the lender and the lender knows of and accepts the borrower's trust"); see also Corcoran v. Saxon Mortgage Servs., Inc., 2010 WL 2106179, *4 ("the defendant must know of and accept the plaintiff's trust"); Pimental v. Wachovia Mortgage Corp., 411 F.Supp.2d at 40 (a fiduciary relationship arises "if a lender both knows that a borrower is placing her trust in it and accepts that trust").
The special circumstances in Bakis that justified an exception to the general rule that "the relationship of a bank as creditor and a customer as debtor is not that of a fiduciary" do not apply to the case at bar. Bakis, 1998 WL 34064622, *13. The court in Bakis held that in targeting the Greek community "the Bank knew and exploited the fact that [the investor] had a deep respect for financial institutions as well as a deep personal trust and respect for ... the Bank's agent." Id. The Bank's actions constituted a self-benefitting acceptance of the investors' trust such that a fiduciary relationship was formed. Id.
While the Bank in Bakis directly solicited investors, plaintiff and defendant lacked any direct relationship, certainly not one of deep, personal trust and respect. There is no evidence in the record that plaintiff placed its trust in anyone other than Havkin, nor that defendant knew of or accepted any offers of trust from plaintiff. Plaintiff has additionally failed to specify or demonstrate any special relationship between plaintiff and defendant or any specific deception on defendant's part. Since no fiduciary duty exists when the relationship is "an arms-length, lender-borrower business relationship, not one of trust and confidence," defendant cannot be held to fiduciary duty standards as to plaintiff. FAMM Steel, Inc. v. Sovereign Bank, 571 F.3d at 102.
In sum, there is no justification for an exception to the general rule that, under Massachusetts law, the relationship between a lender and a borrower does not establish a fiduciary duty. See FAMM Steel, Inc. v. Sovereign Bank, 571 F.3d at 102; Corcoran v. Saxon Mortgage Servs., Inc., 2010 WL 2106179, *4; Pimental v. Wachovia Mortgage Corp., 411 F.Supp.2d at 39.

B. Agency Relationship Between Defendant and Havkin

Plaintiff additionally argues that defendant violated a fiduciary duty in that Havkin, as an agent of defendant, violated his fiduciary duty to plaintiff. (Docket Entry # 45). "Agency is the fiduciary relation which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act."[2]Restatement (Second) *111 of Agency § 1 (1958);[3]see Commonwealth Aluminum Corp. v. Baldwin Corp., 980 F. Supp. 598, 611 (D.Mass.1997) (agency relationship "results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control"); see also Motorsport Eng'g, Inc. v. Maserati SPA, 316 F.3d 26, 29-30 (1st Cir.2002) ("[a]n agent is simply someone who is authorized by the principal to act on the principal's behalf and bind the principal as if the latter were there himself").
The existence of an agency relationship under Massachusetts law is "ordinarily a question of fact for the jury." White's Farm Dairy, Inc. v. De Laval Separator Co., 433 F.2d 63, 66 (1st Cir.1970) (whether equipment dealer was agent of equipment manufacturer in breach of warranty action was a jury question). Plaintiff, however, retains the underlying burden of proof to establish that Havkin acted as defendant's agent during the refinancing process. See Sabel v. Mead Johnson & Co., 737 F. Supp. 135, 138 (D.Mass.1990) (plaintiffs "carried their burden of demonstrating the existence of an agency relationship").
Under Massachusetts law, "[a]n agency relationship is created when there is mutual consent, express or implied, that the agent is to act on behalf and for the benefit of the principal, and subject to the principal's control." Theos & Sons, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 431 Mass. 736, 729 N.E.2d 1113, 1119 (2000); see Restatement (Second) of Agency § 1 (requiring "manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control"); Restatement (Second) of Agency § 13, cmt. a ("agreement to act on behalf of the principal causes the agent to be a fiduciary").
Plaintiff argues that Havkin "acted with apparent and ostensible authority" and "per the control and direction" of defendant but has provided evidence neither that defendant consented to an agency relationship with nor wielded any control over Elite or Havkin. (Docket Entry # 45). While there is no evidence of "mutual consent, express or implied, that [Elite or Havkin] is to act on behalf and for the benefit of [defendant]," there is an express agreement stating the contrary. Theos & Sons, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 729 N.E.2d at 1119. The Wholesale Broker Agreement explicitly states that "neither party shall at any time hold itself out to any third party to be an agent or employee of another." (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. G). This document articulates defendant's lack of consent to an agency relationship with Elite. For the purpose of discerning an actual agency relationship, plaintiff's ignorance of it is immaterial. In light of this document, defendant cannot be held to have consented to an actual agency relationship with Elite or Havkin. As discussed above, plaintiff has failed to produce sufficient evidence of Wilson's interactions with Havkin and Elite. Arguments regarding Wilson's alleged actions and statements, therefore, cannot be relied upon to demonstrate consent on behalf of defendant.
Plaintiff likewise does not support his claim that Elite or Havkin was in any way "subject to the [defendant]'s control." Theos & Sons, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 729 N.E.2d at 1119; see Commonwealth *112 Aluminum Corp. v. Baldwin Corp., 980 F.Supp. at 611 ("[t]he essence of the principal-agent relationship is the right of power or control by the alleged principal over the conduct of the alleged agent"). The Wholesale Broker Agreement specifically states that defendant and Elite agree "that at all times they are operating as independent parties." (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. G). There is no evidence in the record to contradict this agreement.
Plaintiff also alleges that Havkin acted with the apparent authority of defendant. "Massachusetts law recognizes apparent authority where `conduct by a principal... causes a third person reasonably to believe that a particular person ... has authority to enter into negotiations or to make representations as his agent.'" Kansallis Fin. Ltd. v. Fern, 40 F.3d 476, 480 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Hudson v. Mass. Prop. Ins. Underwriting Ass'n, 386 Mass. 450, 436 N.E.2d 155, 159 (1982)); see Restatement (Second) of Agency § 27 (apparent authority "is created as to a third person by written or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him"). If the third party changes its position in reliance on this reasonable belief, "the principal is estopped from denying that the agency is authorized." Kansallis Fin. Ltd. v. Fern, 40 F.3d at 480.
Plaintiff fails to produce evidence that defendant acted in a manner to justify a reasonable belief that Havkin or Elite was an agent of defendant. While plaintiff may have signed the closing documents and not canceled the transaction in reliance on Havkin's assurances that the terms would be altered, there is no evidence that defendant undertook any conduct that would cause plaintiff to reasonably believe that those assurances were made by an agent of, or per the instruction of, defendant. The mere allegation that plaintiff believed Havkin to be an agent of some lender "whatever formal name ultimately used" is insufficient to establish apparent authority. (Docket Entry # 44, ¶ 9). Plaintiff must point to some conduct by defendant that justified his belief. See Kansallis Fin. Ltd. v. Fern, 40 F.3d at 480 (requiring "conduct by a principal").
Absent a showing of any conduct that would cause plaintiff to reasonably believe that Havkin was an agent of defendant, the relationship between plaintiff and defendant remains merely one of a lender and borrower where no fiduciary duty is owed. See FAMM Steel, Inc. v. Sovereign Bank, 571 F.3d at 102 ("relationship between a lender and a borrower, without more, does not establish a fiduciary relationship").
Plaintiff cites to Trifiro[4] for the proposition that defendant, through some conduct, bestowed apparent authority onto Havkin. (Docket Entry # 45). Plaintiff, however, misreads the decision. Trifiro, a potential real estate investor, sued New York Life Insurance Co. ("NYL") claiming that a Real Estate Analyst at NYL negligently misrepresented himself during negotiations with Trifiro and his agents and breached a contract to market several commercial properties to Trifiro. Trifiro v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 1987 LEXIS 6833, *9.
Trifiro claimed that the analyst was actively involved in the negotiation process and in a position of ostensible authority such that NYL must be held to the terms as negotiated. Id. at *12. Plaintiff submits that the facts at bar are analogous. *113 There is no evidence, however, that defendant was "indisputably actively involved" in the negotiation such that a belief of apparent authority would be reasonable. (Docket Entry # 45). The Trifiro courts, in fact, reached a similar conclusion. While holding that "an argument could be made" that the analyst acted with ostensible authority, "any reliance by Trifiro upon [the analyst's] statements was not reasonable as a matter of law" because the assertions were made as part of mere preliminary negotiations. Trifiro v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 1987 LEXIS 6833, *14, 18; see 845 F.2d at 33 ("purchaser did not reasonably rely on statement by vendor's officer" and therefore "could not recover for deceit or negligent misrepresentation"). Summary judgment was accordingly allowed, and affirmed, in NYL's favor on all counts. Plaintiff's reliance on Havkin's alleged assertions, after acknowledging that the terms contained in the closing documents were vastly inconsistent with those negotiated, and acknowledging that it is "the actual closing paper work that really matters," is similarly unreasonable. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. M).[5]
In sum, although agency is usually a question of fact, plaintiff fails in his burden to provide evidence demonstrating that defendant and Havkin were in an actual, apparent or implied agency relationship. No genuine issue of material fact therefore exists and plaintiff's claim fails as a matter of law. As no fiduciary relationship exists between defendant as a lender and plaintiff as a borrower, and as there is no evidence that Havkin acted as an agent of defendant, summary judgment is warranted in defendant's favor on Count III.

II. Unjust Enrichment (Count II)

Count II alleges that Havkin "tricked" plaintiff into entering an unfavorable mortgage transaction whereby plaintiff lost approximately $40,000 in equity in his home and was forced to pay an excess of $167,000 in interest. (Docket Entry # 1, ¶¶ 45-47). Plaintiff claims that, "as a result of Havkin's deceit," defendant made a profit on plaintiff's loss that constitutes an unjust enrichment. (Docket Entry # 1, ¶ 48).
Plaintiff claims that defendant "engaged [in] deceptive behavior in order to induce [him] into signing mortgage documents consisting of terms vastly different than had been negotiated by him." (Docket Entry # 45). As a result, plaintiff submits that defendant holds a promissory note which, at the conclusion of the payment period, will net over one million dollars in payments to defendant where the payoffs on plaintiff's original mortgages were to be less than $370,000. (Docket Entry # 45). In addition, the promissory note is secured against plaintiff's residence so that if defendant forecloses on its security interest, defendant may obtain ownership of plaintiff's home. (Docket Entry # 45).
Defendant counters that plaintiff did not bestow any benefit on defendant for which it is unjust for defendant to retain. (Docket Entry # 37). Defendant provided accurate descriptions of the loan terms at the mortgage closing. Havkin, not defendant, *114 was responsible for plaintiff's belief that the closing terms were a mistake. (Docket Entry # 37). In addition, defendant submits that it has sustained a greater loss as a result of the mortgage transaction than has plaintiff. (Docket Entry # 37). Defendant disbursed $364,500 at the time of closing. Plaintiff, however, has repaid only $87,927.28an approximate $275,000 loss for defendant. (Docket Entry # 37). Plaintiff has also benefitted from having his two First Franklin mortgages paid off as a result of the refinancing and, despite remaining on his property, has not made a mortgage payment to defendant "in over a year." (Docket Entry # 37).
"Unjust enrichment is defined as `retention of money or property of another against the fundamental principles of justice or equity and good conscience.'" Kerr v. Vince, 2010 WL 1416511, *17 (D.Mass. Apr. 1, 2010) (quoting Santagate v. Tower, 64 Mass.App.Ct. 324, 833 N.E.2d 171, 176 (2005)); see Taylor Woodrow Blitman Constr. Co. v. Southfield Gardens Co., 534 F. Supp. 340, 347 (D.Mass.1982). For a claim to prevail in Massachusetts, there must be "`unjust enrichment of one party and unjust detriment to another party.'" Mass. Eye and Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., 552 F.3d 47, 57 (1st Cir.), reh'g denied 559 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2009); see Nat'l Ass'n of Chain Drug Stores v. New Eng. Carpenters Health Benefits Fund, 582 F.3d 30, 42 (1st Cir. 2009) ("[u]njust enrichment, in a legal framework, comprises a claim or claims on which relief may be granted in a lawsuit by the person unjustly deprived").
"Not every conferral of a benefit... automatically give[s] rise to claims for unjust enrichment." Motorsport Eng'g, Inc. v. Maserati SPA, 316 F.3d at 31. Plaintiff must show that he bestowed a benefit on defendant, that defendant's retention of that benefit is unjust and that equity requires that this court shift the benefit back to plaintiff. See Taylor Woodrow Blitman Constr. Co. v. Southfield Gardens Co., 534 F.Supp. at 346-48.[6]
A claim of unjust enrichment, however, is "not available to a party with an adequate remedy at law." Ben Elfman & Son, Inc. v. Criterion Mills, Inc., 774 F. Supp. 683, 687 (D.Mass.1991); see Kerr v. Vince, 2010 WL 1416511, *17 ("[t]he equitable remedy for unjust enrichment is not available, however, to parties with an adequate remedy at law"); see also One Wheeler Road Assocs. v. Foxboro Co., 843 F. Supp. 792, 799 (D.Mass.1994) (common law and statutory reimbursement remedies are adequate remedies at law that preclude unjust enrichment claims). Plaintiff's negligence and chapter 93A claims thus preclude a claim for unjust enrichment. The disposition of those claims is irrelevant. Their mere availability is a bar to a claim of unjust enrichment. See Adrion v. Knight, 2009 WL 3152885, *1 n. 1 (D.Mass. Sept. 28, 2009) ("the availability of an adequate remedy at law (whether successful or not) precludes an equitable claim of unjust enrichment").
In addition, the mortgage between defendant and plaintiff constitutes an express contract which governs their relationship in this matter. (Docket Entry *115 # 39, Ex. I). In an unjust enrichment action, a court can infer an implied contract where none would otherwise exist. See Incase Inc. v. Timex Corp., 488 F.3d 46, 54 (1st Cir.2007) ("[u]nder Massachusetts law, a quasi-contract may be implied in law to remedy the unjust enrichment of another party, even where the facts do not necessarily support the existence of an express or implied-in-fact contract"). Where there is an express contract, however, the terms therein are controlling. "Massachusetts law does not allow litigants to override an express contract by arguing unjust enrichment." Platten v. HG Bermuda Exempted Ltd., 437 F.3d 118, 130 (1st Cir.2006); see Okmyansky v. Herbalife Int'l of Am., Inc., 415 F.3d 154, 162 (1st Cir.2005) ("plaintiff concedes the existence of a valid express contract between the partiesand the existence of such a contract bars the application of the equitable doctrines that he ... invokes").
Parol evidence is not generally admissible to vary the unambiguous terms of an integrated written contract. See Winchester Gables, Inc. v. Host Marriott Corp., 70 Mass.App.Ct. 585, 875 N.E.2d 527, 533 (2007).[7] While a party may provide proof of prior negotiations, the determination of whether the parties intended their written contract to be a statement of their complete agreement is a decision to be made by the court. Cabot v. Cabot, 55 Mass.App.Ct. 756, 774 N.E.2d 1113, 1120 (2002); Ryder v. Williams, 29 Mass.App. Ct. 146, 558 N.E.2d 1134, 1135-36 (1990).
Where a document "shows on its face that it contains all the essential terms that are necessary to constitute a contract, it is presumed that the parties intended it to be a complete and final statement of the whole transaction." Latham v. Homecomings Fin. LLC, 2009 WL 6297593, *4 (Mass.Super. Nov. 3, 2009); see Gifford v. Gifford, 354 Mass. 247, 236 N.E.2d 892, 893 (1968).
Accordingly, where the "mortgage executed by [plaintiff] contain[s] all the essential and material terms necessary for a loan transaction, and constitute[s] a completely integrated agreement ... the parol evidence rule bars consideration of any evidence proffered to impose additional duties on [defendant]." Latham v. Homecomings Fin. LLC, 2009 WL 6297593, *4; see Carney v. Shawmut Bank, N.A., 72 Mass.App.Ct. 1117, 2008 WL 4266248, *2 (Mass.App.Ct. Sept. 19, 2008) (where a document is a fully integrated agreement, "the parol evidence rule bars consideration of evidence proffered to contradict explicit terms ... set forth in the writings").
Plaintiff's mortgage, as a fully integrated and express contract, precludes consideration of any negotiation or statements made by Havkin prior to the closing, at which time defendant provided accurate descriptions of the loan terms to plaintiff. The mortgage contract precludes plaintiff's claim for unjust enrichment as plaintiff cannot argue the unfairness of terms which he accepted and per which he contracted. See Carney v. Shawmut Bank, N.A., 2008 WL 4266248, *2 ("the parol evidence rule bars consideration of evidence proffered to contradict explicit terms ... set forth in the writings").
It is therefore unnecessary to determine the relative degree of enrichment and detriment between plaintiff and defendant as plaintiff's claim is precluded as a matter of law. As plaintiff cannot sustain a claim for unjust enrichment, summary judgment is appropriate in defendant's favor on Count II.


*116 III. Chapter 93A (Count IV)

Count IV alleges that defendant violated chapter 93A in that defendant "participated and/or benefitted from a mortgage refinancing transaction" that "was based on fraudulent representations that were made knowingly by [Havkin]" as an agent of defendant.[8] (Docket Entry # 1, ¶¶ 57-59). Plaintiff further alleges that the final terms of the loan, as detailed in the closing documents signed on February 23, 2006, facially violate chapter 93A and are patently unfair as a matter of law.[9] (Docket Entry # 45).
Defendant counters that a chapter 93A claim must fail as Havkin was not in an agency relationship with defendant, defendant provided accurate disclosures to plaintiff regarding the terms of his loan and plaintiff failed to send a written demand for relief as required per section nine of chapter 93A. (Docket Entry # 37).

A. Alleged Misrepresentations as Deceptive Trade Practices

Plaintiff argues that defendant, through an agency relationship with Havkin, employed deceptive methods during the negotiation process to mislead plaintiff into signing a loan which was to his detriment. (Docket Entry # 1, ¶¶ 57-59). Defendant rebuts that it is not liable for a broker's alleged misrepresentations and that it cannot be held to have deceived plaintiff when defendant provided accurate descriptions of the loan terms at the time of closing and on the closing documents. (Docket Entry # 37).
Section two of chapter 93A prescribes "[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices." Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 2(a). The statute, however, does not define either "unfair" or "deceptive." See Arthur D. Little, Inc. v. Dooyang Corp., 147 F.3d 47, 55 (1st Cir. 1998); see also In re Pharmaceutical Indus. Avg. Wholesale Price Litig., 491 F. Supp. 2d 20, 93 (D.Mass.2007) ("Chapter 93A gives no definition of `unfairness,' and Massachusetts courts have refrained from establishing such a definition"); see also Boston Pilots v. Motor Vessel Midnight Gambler and East Coast Excursions, Inc., 357 F.3d 129, 134 (1st Cir.2004) ("precise contours of ch. 93A liability have remained somewhat undefined").
*117 Chapter 93A, though imprecise, has been held to pertain to certain practices:
Massachusetts courts have, however, enumerated several factors to be considered when determining whether a practice is unfair: "(1) whether the practice... is within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; [and] (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen)."
In re Pharmaceutical Indus. Avg. Wholesale Price Litig., 491 F.Supp.2d at 93-94. "Additional consideration may be given to the `equities between the parties,' `what a defendant knew or should have known,' and `a plaintiff's conduct, his knowledge, and what he reasonably should have known.'" Id. at 94 (quoting Swanson v. Bankers Life Co., 389 Mass. 345, 349, 450 N.E.2d 577 (1983)); see Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 41 (1st Cir.1998) (to state a chapter 93A claim, "the defendant's conduct must be not only wrong, but also egregiously wrong").
To prove a claim under chapter 93A, "it is neither necessary nor sufficient that a particular act or practice violate common or statutory law." Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., 552 F.3d at 69 (citing Kattar v. Demoulas, 433 Mass. 1, 739 N.E.2d 246, 257 (2000)). Rather, "because `[t]here is no limit to human inventiveness in this field,' Massachusetts courts evaluate unfair and deceptive trade practice claims based on the circumstances of each case." Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., 552 F.3d at 69 (citing Kattar v. Demoulas, 739 N.E.2d at 257). In doing so, "Massachusetts leaves the determination of what constitutes an unfair trade practice to the court's performance of a legal gatekeeping function." Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., 552 F.3d at 69; see Milliken & Co. v. Duro Textiles, LLC, 451 Mass. 547, 887 N.E.2d 244, 259 (2008) ("[a]lthough whether a particular set of acts, in their factual setting, is unfair or deceptive is a question of fact... the boundaries of what may qualify for consideration as a c. 93A violation is a question of law"); see also Incase Inc. v. Timex Corp., 488 F.3d at 56-57 ("[a] ruling that conduct violates [chapter] 93A is a legal, not factual, determination").
As stated above, there is no evidence in the record that defendant influenced either plaintiff to enter into a bad mortgage or Havkin to relay misleading information to plaintiff. Havkin was not in an agency relationship with defendant and there was no direct interaction between plaintiff and defendant during the negotiation process for which defendant could be held liable. See Speakman v. Allmerica Fin. Life Ins., 367 F. Supp. 2d 122, 142 (D.Mass.2005) (a corporation's parents, subsidiaries and other affiliates are not liable for the actions of the corporation under chapter 93A "unless they played an active role in the alleged wrongful conduct" nor may claims against such affiliates be based on conclusory allegations). Defendant, rather, provided accurate disclosures of the loan terms to plaintiff on the closing documents and accompanying disclosure statements. As such, defendant cannot be held to have undertaken any immoral, unethical or unscrupulous actions that plaintiff relied upon to his detriment.
In a case similar to that at bar, a plaintiff alleged unfair and deceptive conduct in that the final terms of a mortgage offered by the defendant lender, and signed by the plaintiff, were less favorable than terms previously offered by defendant. Hogan v. Riemer, 619 N.E.2d at 985. Despite the plaintiff's claim that "[the defendant] had lured [the plaintiff] into a loan more onerous than initially described to her," summary judgment was affirmed in the defendant's *118 favor. Id. at 985-86. The court held that though the parties "discussed loan terms at variance with those later reflected in the loan papers, the detailed and integrated legal documents, executed by [the plaintiff] with her lawyer by her side would, in the absence of fraud, supersede earlier conversations." Id. at 987. As in the case at bar, there was no evidence in the record to "suggest fraud in the sense that the content of the documents or their significance at the time of closing was misrepresented" by the defendant. Id. at 987-88.
As no agency relationship existed between Havkin and defendant and as defendant was not part of the negotiation process, it cannot be shown that defendant made any deceptive representations during the refinancing negotiations and, as defendant provided accurate disclosures at the closing, plaintiff cannot rely on Havkin's statements to establish a deceptive trade action against defendant per section two of chapter 93A.

B. Unfair Conduct Per the Terms of the Loan

Plaintiff further contends that, separate from and in addition to Havkin's alleged misrepresentations, the terms of the final refinanced mortgage loan facially violate chapter 93A[10] and are unfair as a matter of law. (Docket Entry # 45).[11] As noted, the alleged unfair or deceptive practice must exist within at least the penumbra of some commonlaw, statutory or other established concept of unfairness or be immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous. See In re Pharmaceutical Indus. Avg. Wholesale Price Litig., 491 F.Supp.2d at 93-94. To meet these criteria, plaintiff alleges that the terms of the final refinanced loan rise to a common law definition of unfairness.
Massachusetts courts have held that under some circumstances mortgage loans with certain characteristics are facially "unfair" and in violation of chapter 93A. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Fremont Inv. & Loan, 2008 WL 517279, 2008 LEXIS 46 (Mass.Super. Feb. 25, 2008), aff'd 452 Mass. 733, 897 N.E.2d 548 (2008); Commonwealth v. H & R Block, Inc., 2008 LEXIS 427 (Mass.Super. Nov. 25, 2008); Doyle v. U.S. Bank, 2009 WL 3839015, 2009 LEXIS 283 (Mass.Super. Oct. 20, 2009). The Fremont courts held that:
[L]oans featuring a combination of the following four characteristics qualified as "unfair" under G.L. c. 93A, § 2:(1) the loans were ARM [adjustable rate mortgage] loans with an introductory period of three years or less; (2) they featured an introductory rate for the initial period that was at least three per cent below the fully indexed rate; (3) they were made to borrowers for whom the debt-to-income ratio would have exceeded fifty per cent had [the defendant] measured the borrower's debt by the monthly payments that would be due at the fully indexed rate rather than under the introductory rate; and (4) the loan-to-value ratio was one hundred per cent, or the loan featured a substantial prepayment penalty (defined by the [lower court] judge as a greater than the "conventional prepayment penalty" defined in G.L. c. 183C, § 2) or a prepayment penalty that extended beyond the introductory rate period.
*119 Commonwealth v. Fremont Inv. & Loan, 897 N.E.2d at 554; see 2008 WL 517279, at *9-10, 2008 LEXIS 46, *29-31. Plaintiff submits that his refinance loan from defendant meets the above characteristics. (Docket Entry # 45).
The underlying rationale in Fremont was to prohibit loan terms that would make it "almost certain the borrower would not be able to make the necessary loan payments, leading to default and then foreclosure." Commonwealth v. Fremont Inv. & Loan, 897 N.E.2d at 551. The four Fremont characteristics, however, are not per se unfair; these conditions, rather, "may under certain circumstances make a loan unfair" including their issuance "with utter disregard for risk of foreclosure." Commonwealth v. H & R Block, Inc., 2008 LEXIS 427, *17; see Latham v. Homecomings Fin. LLC, 2009 WL 6297593, *6 ("[t]he combination of independently legal terms may render a loan unfair under Chapter 93A if the combination constitutes an unsound lending practice and in essence dooms the borrower to foreclosure").
Plaintiff fails to evince that the terms of his loan meet the four Fremont characteristics or that the loan was issued with utter disregard to the risk of foreclosure. Plaintiff, in both his April 13, 2007 letter to Elite and in his complaint, alleges the illegality of the loan only in that it provided no benefit to plaintiff. (Docket Entry # 1; Docket Entry # 46, Ex. 13). Plaintiff's brief in opposition to summary judgment later levies conclusory statements that plaintiff's mortgage resembles that in Fremont but offers neither evidence nor a detailed argument that plaintiff's loan met the four Fremont characteristics or was issued with disregard to the risk of foreclosure.
Where, as here, plaintiff has not "proffered evidence that the combination of features contained in his note constitutes an unsound lending practice which in essence dooms the borrower to foreclosure," plaintiff "has no reasonable expectation of proving that [defendant] violated Chapter 93A by originating a presumptively unfair loan." Latham v. Homecomings Fin. LLC, 2009 WL 6297593, *6 (summary judgment granted in the defendant lender's favor where "summary judgment record is devoid of evidence that [the plaintiff's] debt-to-income ratio would have exceeded fifty percent had [the defendant] measured his debt by the fully indexed rate or that the loan-to-value ratio was one hundred percent").
There is a similar lack of evidence and specificity in this matter. As plaintiff has failed to demonstrate plaintiff's loan was issued with disregard to the risk of foreclosure or that the loan met the four Fremont characteristics or otherwise violated the applicable standard of a section nine violation, plaintiff cannot rely on this argument to maintain a chapter 93A claim.

C. Chapter 93A Demand Letter

Defendant submits that plaintiff's claim falls under section nine of chapter 93A and is therefore precluded as a matter of law because plaintiff failed to send defendant the required written demand of relief prescribed therein. (Docket Entry # 37). Plaintiff maintains that, to the extent that his claim does fall under section nine, plaintiff complied with this prerequisite by mailing the April 27, 2007 demand letter that, although sent to Elite, was responded to by defendant. (Docket Entry # 45; Docket Entry # 46, Ex. 13). Plaintiff further argues that, because defendant does not maintain a place of business or keep assets within Massachusetts, the demand letter prerequisite does not apply to this matter. (Docket Entry # 45).
Section 9(3) of chapter 93A mandates that, "[a]t least thirty days prior to the filing of a [chapter 93A] action, a written *120 demand for relief, identifying the claimant and reasonably describing the unfair or deceptive act or practice relied upon and the injury suffered, shall be mailed or delivered to any prospective respondent." Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(3). The respondent has 30 days thereafter to tender a settlement before a suit may be filed. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(3). This "statutory notice requirement is not merely a procedural nicety, but, rather `a prerequisite to suit.'" Rodi v. New Eng. Sch. of Law, 389 F.3d 5, 19 (1st Cir.2004); see Entrialgo v. Twin City Dodge, Inc., 368 Mass. 812, 333 N.E.2d 202, 204 (1975) ("demand letter listing the specific deceptive practices claimed is a prerequisite to suit and as a special element must be alleged and proved").
Defendant claims that plaintiff failed to meet this prerequisite in that plaintiff did not mail a demand letter directly to defendant. Defendant's argument fails because defendant's thorough response to the letter, which was in compliance with section nine of chapter 93A, constructively satisfied the purpose of the demand letter requirement, which is making the respondent aware of claimant's grievance and providing an opportunity to settle the claim prior to litigation. See Entrialgo v. Twin City Dodge, Inc., 333 N.E.2d at 204 ("[t]he purpose of the demand letter is to facilitate the settlement and damage assessment aspects of c. 93A"); see also Lily Transp. Corp. v. Royal Inst. Servs., Inc., 64 Mass.App.Ct. 179, 832 N.E.2d 666 (2005) (purpose of enacting chapter 93A was to encourage more equitable behavior in the marketplace).
Defendant was put on notice of plaintiff's claim, and defendant's liability in potential litigation, as demonstrated by defendant's answering plaintiff's letter itself. In addition, by answering the letter addressed to Elite, defendant likely prevented plaintiff from sending an additional and separate letter to defendant. In light of defendant's thorough response to the letter sent to Elite, it would be reasonable for plaintiff to consider sending an additional letter to defendant to be a superfluous undertaking.
The sufficiency of plaintiff's demand letter is a non-issue, however, in light of his inability to demonstrate an unfair or deceptive business practice on the part of defendant. This court finds no genuine issues of material fact regarding plaintiff's chapter 93A claim. As plaintiff fails to evince an unfair or deceptive trade action for which defendant may be held liable, summary judgment is warranted in defendant's favor on Count IV.

IV. Negligence (Count V)

Count V alleges that, as a licensed mortgage company, defendant is liable for negligent misrepresentation or deceit[12] because it "owed a duty to ensure fair dealings" and that, as a result of defendant's *121 failure to oversee or rectify Havkin's allegedly deceitful actions, plaintiff suffered significant harm while defendant obtained a benefit. (Docket Entry # 1, ¶¶ 65-68).
Defendant counters that it is not liable for false representations made by Havkin and that a claim of deceit or negligence cannot lie where defendant disclosed accurate descriptions of the loan terms to plaintiff. (Docket Entry # 37). Further, a lender owes no duty of care to a borrower and that, even if an agency relationship existed between Havkin and defendant, the accurate disclosures break any causal connection between Havkin's alleged misrepresentations and plaintiff's injury. (Docket Entry # 37).
To establish a claim for negligent misrepresentation, plaintiff must establish that defendant "made a false representation of material fact, with knowledge of its falsity, for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to act on this representation" and that plaintiff "reasonably relied on the representations as true, and . . . acted upon it to [his] damage." Cumis Ins. Society, Inc. v. BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc., 455 Mass. 458, 918 N.E.2d 36, 47 (2009); see Edlow v. RBW, LLC, 2010 WL 2034772, *7 (D.Mass. May 21, 2010); see also Trifiro v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 1987 LEXIS 6833, *11 ("to make out a claim for deceit or negligent misrepresentation, [plaintiff] must show that [defendant] made an intentional, reckless or negligent misrepresentation of material fact meant to be relied upon and in fact relied upon").
Plaintiff fails to demonstrate that defendant made a false representation of material fact for the purpose of inducing plaintiff to act. As discussed above, plaintiff fails to provide evidence that defendant or Wilson influenced Havkin's alleged statements or that defendant acted in a manner which would permit plaintiff to reasonably believe that Havkin was an agent of defendant. In the first interaction that defendant did have with plaintiff, defendant provided plaintiff with accurate descriptions regarding the terms of the loan. As Havkin is not an agent of defendant, it cannot be held that defendant made any false representations of material fact to plaintiff.
Plaintiff again cites Trifiro v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 1987 LEXIS 6833. Plaintiff proffers that because the Trifiro court found an issue of material fact regarding whether the NYL agent acted with sufficient ostensible authority, summary judgment as to a claim of negligent misrepresentation or deceit was denied in Trifiro's favor. (Docket Entry # 45). A closer reading of the opinion, however, finds that the court held that even if the agent acted with ostensible authority, the circumstances surrounding the agent's representations made it unreasonable for Trifiro to rely upon them; as a result, Trifiro's claim was rejected and summary judgment entered for NYL. Id. at *11-15.
Trifiro, therefore, stands for the proposition that reliance must be reasonable to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation. The fact that the closing documents contained terms vastly different than those negotiated made it unreasonable for plaintiff to rely on Havkin's representations. (Docket Entry # 39, Ex. I & M). Regardless, as discussed above, Havkin is neither the actual nor apparent agent of defendant, and plaintiff has proffered no evidence that Havkin acted with any authority from defendant.
In addition to a showing of negligent conduct, a duty of care is an essential element of any negligence claim. See Siegal v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 921 F.2d 15, 17 n. 4 (1st Cir.1990). "Under Massachusetts law, every contract is subject to an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing" with the purpose to "`ensure that neither party interferes with the ability of the other to enjoy the fruits of the contract' and that . . . the parties remain *122 faithful to the intended and agreed expectations of the contract.'" FAMM Steel, Inc. v. Sovereign Bank, 571 F.3d at 100 (quoting Chokel v. Genzyme Corp., 449 Mass. 272, 867 N.E.2d 325, 329 (2007)).
"In the lender-borrower context, the implied covenant `would require that the bank be honest in the dealings with [plaintiff] and that it not purposefully injure [his] right to obtain the benefit of the contract.'" FAMM Steel, Inc. v. Sovereign Bank, 571 F.3d at 100 (quoting Chokel v. Genzyme Corp., 867 N.E.2d at 329); see Corcoran v. Saxon Mortgage Servs., Inc., 2010 WL 2106179, *4 ("[defendant] does not owe plaintiff a duty to ensure fair dealings because a lender owes no general duty of care to a borrower"); see also Pimental v. Wachovia Mortgage Corp., 411 F.Supp.2d at 39-40 (a negligence claim fails where there is no fiduciary duty between lender and borrower).
As defendant provided accurate descriptions of the loan terms at the time of closing and cannot be held liable for any alleged misrepresentations by Havkin, plaintiff has made no showing that defendant undertook any negligent conduct that would violate a duty of care. Since plaintiff can show no improper conduct on defendant's part, and as no fiduciary relationship exists between a lender and a borrower, plaintiff's negligence claim fails. See FAMM Steel, Inc. v. Sovereign Bank, 571 F.3d at 100 (claims must have involved dishonesty and a showing that defendants acted purposefully to injure plaintiff).
Massachusetts law also requires that plaintiff establish, "by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of a causal connection between the defendant's actions (or inactions) and the injury sustained by the plaintiff." Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth., 905 F.2d 515, 524 (1st Cir.1990); see Stuart v. Town of Brookline, 412 Mass. 251, 587 N.E.2d 1384, 1387 (1992) (the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the injuries are "`causally related to the [defendant's actions]'"). "This connection cannot be left to the jury's conjecture or speculation." Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth., 905 F.2d at 524. Plaintiff must show that the "defendant's conduct was a butfor cause of [plaintiff's] injury and that defendant's conduct was a `substantial legal factor' in bringing about the alleged harm to the plaintiff." Id.; see Payton v. Abbott Labs, 780 F.2d 147, 156 (1st Cir. 1985) ("the plaintiff must prove it is `more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm'"); see also Embriano v. Grosnick, 892 F. Supp. 20, 22 n. 5 (D.Mass.1995).[13]
*123 Plaintiff cannot link Havkin's alleged misrepresentations to any conduct on behalf of Wilson or defendant. As there is no evidence that defendant took any action to cause plaintiff's pecuniary injury, there is no causal connection between the injury and defendant's actions. Regardless, the accurate descriptions of the loan terms supplied by defendant break any causal connection between Havkin's conduct and plaintiff's injury. In short, plaintiff's failure to sustain a claim for negligent misrepresentation or deceit thereby merits summary judgment in defendant's favor on Count V.

CONCLUSION
In accordance with the foregoing discussion, defendant's motion for summary judgment (Docket Entry # 36) is ALLOWED.
NOTES
[1]  Statements of law in the LR. 56.1 statement of undisputed facts are not considered.
[2]  In an agency relationship, "[t]he one for whom action is to be taken is the principal" and "[t]he one who is to act is the agent." Restatement (Second) of Agency § 1 (1958). Defendant is therefore the alleged principal and Elite and Havkin the alleged agents of defendant.
[3]  Massachusetts courts often cite to Restatement (Second) of Agency in determining the presence of an agency relationship. See, e.g., Theos & Sons, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 431 Mass. 736, 729 N.E.2d 1113 (2000) (citing sections one, seven, eight, 14 & 15).
[4]  Trifiro v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 1987 LEXIS 6833 (D.Mass. July 14, 1987), aff'd, 845 F.2d 30 (1st Cir.1988).
[5]  As with theories regarding actual and apparent authority, a claim of implied authority would likewise fail. "Actual authority," either express or implied, is the agent's power to affect the principal's relations with third parties as manifested to the agent by the principal. See Restatement (Second) of Agency § 7. While "actual authority" results when the principal explicitly manifests consent, either through words or conduct, that the agent should act on behalf of the principal, "implied authority" is actual authority that evolves by implication from the conduct of the parties. See Restatement (Second) of Agency § 7. There is no evidence in the record that the inherent relationship between defendant and Elite evolved into one of an agency relationship.
[6]  The lack of a fiduciary relationship between plaintiff and defendant, as discussed above, does not preclude a claim of unjust enrichment. See Greenwald v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp., 241 F.3d 76, 78 (1st Cir.2001) (doctrine of unjust enrichment does not require any contractual or fiduciary relationship between parties). The essence of unjust enrichment is fairness rather than culpability. See Id. at 81 ("[t]he origins of unjust enrichment actions lie largely in equity," and "[t]o some degree ... reflect a weighing of whether an outcome is more or less `fair' or `just'"); see also Brandt v. Wand Partners, 242 F.3d 6, 16 (1st Cir.2001) ("[u]nder Massachusetts law unjust enrichment does not always require finding of wrongdoing by the defendant").
[7]  A fully integrated contract is a statement which the parties have adopted as a complete and exclusive expression of their agreement. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 210(1) (1981); see Starr v. Fordham, 420 Mass. 178, 648 N.E.2d 1261, 1268 n. 8 (1995); Cabot v. Cabot, 55 Mass.App.Ct. 756, 774 N.E.2d 1113, 1120 (2002).
[8]  Plaintiff does not specify in his complaint (Docket Entry # 1) or in his brief in opposition to summary judgment (Docket Entry # 45) under what section in chapter 93A he rests this claim. For the purposes of its brief in support of summary judgment, defendant assumed this action was brought under section nine as it involves "a consumer action against a business entity." (Docket Entry # 37). Plaintiff responds that his claims are not limited to section nine but does not specify the other applicable sections. (Docket Entry # 45). This court addresses plaintiff's claims under sections two and nine of chapter 93A. See, e.g., Hogan v. Riemer, 35 Mass.App. Ct. 360, 619 N.E.2d 984 (1993) (applying section nine to individual mortgagor's chapter 93A claims against mortgagee). Section 11 is inapplicable as it pertains only to a party "who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce." Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 11; see Trs. of Boston Univ. v. ASM Commc'ns, Inc., 33 F. Supp. 2d 66, 76 n. 16 (D.Mass.1998) ("[s]ection 11 is only applicable if, first, "the interaction [between the parties] is `commercial' in nature, and second, ... the parties were both engaged in `trade or commerce,' and therefore acting in a `business context'"").
[9]  Regarding the chapter 93A claim, the complaint centers on Havkin's alleged misrepresentations by which plaintiff "was harmed by the mortgage transaction." (Docket Entry # 1). The complaint does not allege the terms of the loan themselves to be in violation of chapter 93A. (Docket Entry # 1). It is only in plaintiff's brief in opposition to summary judgment does he raise the argument that the final terms of the refinanced loan are unfair as a matter of law and in violation of chapter 93A. (Docket Entry # 45).
[10]  Absent plaintiff's specificity, this court applies sections two & nine to this prong of plaintiff's chapter 93A claim.
[11]  The legality of the final terms of the loan, per chapter 93A, was not raised in the complaint (Docket Entry # 1) but rather is challenged only in plaintiff's brief in opposition to summary judgment (Docket Entry # 45).
[12]  Plaintiff references "negligent misrepresentation or deceit" in his brief in opposition to summary judgment (Docket Entry # 45) but alleges only "negligence" in his complaint (Docket Entry # 1, ¶¶ 61-68). The fact that Count V "is titled `negligence' rather than `negligent misrepresentation' is not determinative. The `nature and character of the pleading is determined by its substance and not its title, name or description attached to it.'" LBM Fin., LLC v. Individual Lot, LLC, 2010 WL 1050531, *2 (Mass.Super. Feb. 24, 2010); see City of Worcester v. HCA Mgmt. Co., Inc., 1994 WL 123629, *1 (D.Mass. Apr. 7, 1994) (negligent misrepresentation count "is not subject to the particularity requirement of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b)"); see also Grafton Partners, LLC v. Barry & Foley Motor Transp., Inc., 2007 WL 1418529, *3 (Mass.Super. Apr. 9, 2007) (as negligent misrepresentation is not a claim that must be plead with specificity, a party is not prejudiced by a failure to properly name the count in the complaint, where all the allegations necessary to sustain the claim of negligent misrepresentation appear in the complaint).
[13]  The economic loss doctrine may also present challenges to plaintiff's claim. "In the context of ordinary negligence claims in tort actions, the Supreme Judicial Court has held that `purely economic losses are unrecoverable. . . in the absence of personal injury or property damage.'" Cummings v. HPG Int'l, Inc., 244 F.3d 16, 24 (1st Cir.2001). There has been discussion in Massachusetts courts regarding whether the doctrine applies to negligent misrepresentation. If applied to a negligent misrepresentation claim with only an economic injury, "even if a duty existed, the claim is barred by the economic loss doctrine which provides that, in negligence actions, `purely economic losses are unrecoverable. . . in the absence of personal or property damage.'" Corcoran v. Saxon Mortgage Servs., Inc., 2010 WL 2106179, *4 (quoting FMR Corp. v. Boston Edison Co., 415 Mass. 393, 613 N.E.2d 902, 903 (1993)); compare with Danca v. Taunton Sav. Bank, 385 Mass. 1, 429 N.E.2d 1129, 1134 (1982) (the economic loss doctrine does not apply to negligent misrepresentation). By applying the economic loss doctrine, the Corcoran court rejected a negligent misrepresentation claim because the "alleged damages, the additional costs and interest accrued on the loan, are purely economic in nature." Corcoran v. Saxon Mortgage Servs., Inc., 2010 WL 2106179 at *4. If the economic loss doctrine was applied to this matter, plaintiff likewise would not have pled a recoverable loss.

					UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON PORTLAND DIVISION  NAEGELI REPORTING CORPORATION,  Civil No. 3:11-1138-HA (lead case) 3:11-1145-HA  Plaintiff, v.  OPINION AND ORDER  EDGAR L. PETERSEN and TIFFANY J. RODERICK, Defendants.  HAGGERTY, District Judge: Plaintiff filed this action against its former employees asserting contract claims, tort claims, and violations of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, ORS 646.461-.475, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030. Defendants have asserted counterclaims for declaratory relief and violations of Oregon's Whistleblower Act, ORS 659A.199. Shortly after initiating this action, plaintiff filed a motion seeking preliminary injunctive relief and expedited discovery. The parties subsequently agreed to an expedited discovery 1 -- ORDER   schedule, exchanged documents, and took several depositions. Following the completion of the expedited discovery, this court held oral argument on plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction on November 21 and 22, 2011. The court heard testimony from witnesses, received exhibits, and then took the matter under advisement. For the following reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction [4] is DENIED. STANDARDS A party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate (1) that it is likely to succeed on the merits of such a claim, (2) that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in its favor, and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest. Beaty v. Brewer, 649 F.3d 1071, 1072 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)). In the Ninth Circuit, a district court may also issue a preliminary injunction if the party seeking injunctive relief demonstrates "serious questions going to the merits," the balance of hardships tips strongly in its favor, and the other two elements of the test are met. Alliance For The Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131-32 (9th Cir. 2011). Injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the party seeking the injunction is entitled to such relief. Winter, 555 U.S. at 22. BACKGROUND Plaintiff is an Oregon corporation that provides court reporting and other services to legal professionals. Plaintiff's clients often contact plaintiff to schedule a court reporter and then plaintiff contacts one of its independently contracted court reporters to attend the proceeding. Plaintiff synchronizes the written transcript with the audio or video recording, and provides key2 -- ORDER   word indexing, digital scanning, and special formatting to set its transcripts apart from other firms. Plaintiff maintains a database of client information known as the Act! Sales Database. The Act! Sales Database contains allegedly confidential client and prospective client information, including contact information, details relating to business transactions with clients, sales information, marketing information, employee data, and other information about plaintiff's services. Naegeli Decl. at 5-6. Defendants were formerly employed by plaintiff in its marketing department. As part of their employment, defendants had access to the Act! Sales Database and other customer information. Defendant Roderick was employed as plaintiff's Marketing Specialist, and Petersen was employed as a Sales Manager. Although Roderick strongly recommended that plaintiff hire Petersen, she never disclosed to plaintiff that Petersen is her father. Petersen was terminated by plaintiff in May 2011. Roderick, along with Dennis Toomey, Lawrence Zeringer, and Allie Mincks,1 voluntarily resigned in August 2011. Defendants now work for Esquire Solutions (Esquire), which is another court reporting firm that recently established an office in Portland, Oregon. Plaintiff alleges that defendants formed a team known as the "Anti-Naegeli Project." As part of the project, defendants allegedly misappropriated plaintiff's confidential and trade secret  1  Plaintiff has filed separate actions against these former employees as well. Plaintiff's action against Dennis Toomey in this court was recently consolidated with this case. See Naegeli Reporting Corp. v. Toomey, Case No. 11-1138-HA. Plaintiff has also filed suit against Lawrence Zeringer in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, Naegeli Reporting Corp. v. Zeringer, Case No. 11-3490LRS, and against Allie Mincks in Oregon Circuit Court for Multnomah County, Naegeli Reporting Corp. v. Mincks, Case No. 11-09-12442. 3 -- ORDER   information while they were employed by plaintiff, and schemed to start a competing business. Plaintiff contends that defendants encouraged plaintiff's employees to resign, recruited its employees and court reporters to join their new business, and raided plaintiff's confidential client database. DISCUSSION Plaintiff seeks to enjoin defendants and "anyone acting in concert with them" from:   ¢  retaining, using, disclosing, or misappropriating plaintiff's confidential and trade secret information;    ¢  soliciting plaintiff's customers or employees; and    ¢  from using plaintiff's confidential or trade secret information to encourage plaintiff's customers, employees, or court reporters to terminate their relationship with plaintiff and enter into a relationship with one of plaintiff's competitors.  To obtain the injunctive relief it seeks, plaintiff must demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits or serious questions going to the merits, a likelihood of irreparable harm, a balance of hardships that tips in its favor, and that an injunction serves the public interest. 1.  Likelihood of Success Plaintiff contends that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims for breach of  contract, violations of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Defendants respond that: (1) the Non-Solicitation Agreement is unenforceable under Oregon's statutory and common law, (2) plaintiff's customer lists do not constitute a trade secret, and (3) since their employment with plaintiff ended, defendants have never improperly used plaintiff's information to solicit business for Esquire. 4 -- ORDER   A.  Breach of Contract claims  Defendants each executed three contracts upon commencement of their employment with plaintiff: a Non-Solicitation Agreement, a Confidentiality Agreement, and a Non-Competition Agreement. Plaintiff is only seeking to enforce the first two agreements. The Non-Solicitation Agreement provides that during defendants' employment with plaintiff and for a period of two years following the termination of their employment, defendants "will not, Directly or Indirectly solicit, divert, or appropriate (or attempt to solicit, divert, or appropriate) . . . any person or entity that was a customer or prospective customer of [plaintiff] during such non-solicitation period." Compl. at Ex. 2, 4. Similarly, defendants agreed to not "directly or indirectly, solicit, divert, or hire away (or attempt to solicit, divert, or hire away) . . . any independent contractor or employee [of plaintiff]." Id. The parties disagree as to whether the Non-Solicitation Agreement should be construed as a non-competition agreement, which must comply with Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) 653.295, or merely as a restraint on solicitation, which need only comply with common law. After January 1, 2008, any non-competition agreement entered into between an employer and an employee is voidable and may not be enforced by a court of this state unless four requirements are met. ORS 653.295(1). First, the employer must inform the employee in a "written employment offer received by the employee at least two weeks before the first day of the employee's employment that a noncompetition agreement is required as a condition of employment" or "the agreement is entered into upon a subsequent bona fide advancement of the employee by the employer." Id. at 653.295(1)(a). Second, the employee must be employed as an exempt administrative, executive, or professional employee. Id. at 653.295(1)(b); 653.020(3). 5 -- ORDER   Third, the employee must have access to trade secrets, or competitively sensitive confidential business or professional information. Id. at 653.295(1)(c). Fourth, the employee's total annual gross salary and commissions at the time of the employee    s termination must exceed the current median family income for a four-person family as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau. Id. at 653.295(1)(d). The parties do not dispute that defendants were given insufficient notice of the agreements prior to their employment. Roderick was hired on January 22, 2010, and signed her agreement that same day without any prior notice. Petersen executed his agreement on January 14, 2010, only six days before his first day of employment. Accordingly, the Non-Solicitation Agreement is unenforceable if it is construed as a non-competition agreement. Plaintiff argues that the Non-Solicitation Agreement is merely a "covenant not to solicit employees of the employer or solicit or transact business with customers of the employer." See ORS 653.295(4). The Agreement, however, is much broader.2 By the terms of the Agreement, defendants may not directly or indirectly solicit, divert, or appropriate any past, present, or prospective customer of plaintiff for two years following their termination. See Compl. at Ex. 2, 4. This language extends beyond a restriction not to solicit or transact business with plaintiff's customers, but also prevents defendants from engaging in activities that indirectly divert prospective customers away from plaintiff. The overall effect of the Agreement is to prevent defendants from competing with plaintiff. Moreover, case law interpreting prior versions of ORS 653.295 has consistently held that an agreement restraining an employee from directly or indirectly soliciting business from former 2  The court declines plaintiff's invitation to rewrite the scope of the Agreement.  6 -- ORDER   clients or prospective clients should be construed as a non-competition agreement. See Moreland v. World Commc'n Ctr., Inc., No. Civ. 09-913-AC, 2010 WL 4237302, at *3-4 (D. Or. Sept. 17, 2010) (holding that an agreement restricting an employee from directly or indirectly soliciting clients or otherwise causing the employer to lose clients was a non-competition agreement even though it was intended as a non-solicitation agreement); Dymock v. Norwest Safety Protective Equip. for Or. Indus., 19 P.3d 934, 937 (Or. Ct. App. 2001), overruled on other grounds, 45 P.3d 114 (Or. 2002) (holding that non-competition agreements include covenants that materially deter or impair an employee from engaging in the same business as the employer); First Allmerica Fin. Life Ins. Co. v. Sumner, 212 F. Supp. 2d 1235, 1239 (D. Or. 2002) (holding that a contractual provision restraining an employee's ability to solicit former customers and co-workers amounts to a non-competition agreement). Plaintiff has not articulated a persuasive basis for the court to depart from this line of cases. Alternatively, even if the Non-Solicitation Agreement is simply a restraint on trade, plaintiff has not shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits of this claim. To be enforceable, a restrictive covenant must be (1) partial or restricted in its operation in respect either to time or place; (2) on some good consideration; and (3) must be reasonable, that is, it should afford only a fair protection to the interests of the party in whose favor it is made, and must not be so large in its operation as to interfere with the interests of the public. Nike, Inc. v. McCarthy, 379 F.3d 576, 584 (9th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). Although plaintiff may succeed as to the first two elements, plaintiff has not demonstrated that the Non-Solicitation Agreement is reasonable. Again, the court finds the breadth of the Agreement to be troubling. On its face, the Agreement precludes defendants from 7 -- ORDER   engaging in conduct that even indirectly diverts former or prospective customers from plaintiff. It does not merely restrict defendants from soliciting clients they had actual contacts with while employed by plaintiff. See Konecranes, Inc. v. Sinclair, 340 F. Supp. 2d 1126, 1131 (D. Or. 2004) ("In deciding whether a non-compete agreement is reasonable, an important consideration is whether it merely restricts the former employee from luring away specific accounts ( i.e., those he serviced while employed) or whether it restricts the employee from competing at all.") Plaintiff has also not met its burden as to the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement provides that during the "term of this Agreement, and indefinitely subsequent to the termination of this Agreement for whatever reason, [the employee] shall not, directly or indirectly, under any circumstances or by any means, disclose or divulge or use for [the employee's] benefit or for the benefit of any third party, the Confidential Information of the Company without the express written consent of the President of the Company." Compl. at Ex. 1, 3. Further, the employees must return all confidential information or materials that are the property of the employer upon request or upon termination of employment. Id. The Confidentiality Agreement, however, does not prohibit defendants from using information "for legitimate business purposes within the scope of Employee's employment." Id. Based on the testimony provided, any allegedly improper downloading or e-mailing may have been performed for legitimate business purposes. Defendants testified that their conduct enabled them to work from home, to compare their client lists with their commission reports to ensure that they were properly compensated, or to otherwise complete their work for plaintiff. While it is clear that defendants may have violated the Confidentiality Agreement by retaining plaintiff's property, injunctive relief is not a proper remedy as it does not appear that there is any 8 -- ORDER   ongoing potential for harm, irreparable or otherwise. Any alleged harm can be remedied with damages. Additionally, after consulting with plaintiff's counsel regarding potential spoliation issues, defendants have agreed to delete any retained data that is the property of plaintiff. B.  Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) claim  To establish a claim under the UTSA, plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) the subject of the claim qualifies as a statutory trade secret; (2) the plaintiff employed reasonable measures to maintain the secrecy of its trade secrets; and (3) the conduct of the defendants constitutes statutory misappropriation." Acrymed, Inc. v. Convatec, 317 F. Supp. 2d 1204, 1217 (D. Or. 2004). According to the statute, a trade secret includes: information, including a drawing, cost data, customer list, formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process that: (a) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (b) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. ORS 646.461(4). "A customer list can sometimes be a trade secret, e.g., when the employer has expended considerable time and money to pinpoint a narrow segment of the population that is interested in this product or service." IKON Office Solutions, Inc. v. Am. Office Products, Inc., 178 F. Supp. 2d 1154, 1167 (D. Or. 2001). This includes nonpublic information about clients that employees have agreed to keep confidential. Dial Temporary Help Servs. v. Shrock, 946 F. Supp. 847, 854 (D. Or. 1996). However, a customer list is not considered a trade secret if the information is publicly available or can be easily identified by a person with rudimentary knowledge of the 9 -- ORDER   industry. IKON Office Solutions, Inc., 178 F. Supp. 2d at 1168 (citing W. Med. Consultants, Inc. v. Johnson, 835 F. Supp. 554, 557-58 (D. Or. 1993) (customer information not trade secret if it is commonly known in the industry or readily ascertainable through public sources)). Here, plaintiff's allegedly secret customer lists consist of contact information for law firms and attorneys who previously scheduled court reporting services with plaintiff. See Hunt Decl. Under Seal, Exs. A-C. Presumably, any person familiar with the court reporting industry would know that law firms and attorneys are prospective clients for a court reporting firm. The only information in plaintiff's lists that is not publicly available is the date of plaintiff's last contact with that client and the name of the legal assistant who contacted plaintiff. The court recognizes that the identity of the legal assistants who arrange for court reporters may be valuable to plaintiff and defendants, but is not confident that it is a trade secret. Although plaintiff has taken efforts to keep its Act! Sales Database and customer lists private, plaintiff has not shown that it has expended considerable effort or expense to create its lists, or that it derives independent economic value from the publicly available contact information. Plaintiff has, however, raised a serious question regarding whether plaintiff's court reporter list should be considered a trade secret. Plaintiff's list of reliable, well-qualified, and recommended court reporters has been honed over several years and is not publicly available. Defendants may have improperly retained this list following the end of their employment with plaintiff, but do not believe that they have the list. In any event, this factor weighs in favor of an injunction.  10 -- ORDER   C.  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)  An individual is liable under the CFAA if he or she "knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than $5,000 in any 1-year period." 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4). Again, the court finds that plaintiff has not established that it is likely to succeed on this claim because defendants credibly testified that any computer access was legitimate and part of defendants' duties while employed by plaintiff. However, Roderick admits that she sent client lists to Petersen after he had been terminated, and that defendants continued to e-mail documents to their personal accounts after being warned to stop that conduct immediately by plaintiff. Such evidence raises some questions as to whether defendants exceeded their authority. This factor weighs slightly in plaintiff's favor. 2.  Irreparable harm Plaintiff contends that its loss of its confidential client information and loss of business  constitutes irreparable harm. See Alexander & Alexander Benefits Servs., Inc. v. Benefit Brokers & Consultants, Inc., 756 F. Supp. 1408, 1414-16 (D. Or. 1991) (finding a probability of success on the merits and irreparable harm where the defendants admitted taking copies of the employer's client activity reports and customer files, and the employer would be unable to fairly compete because of the misappropriation). At this point, the court finds no irreparable harm. Defendants have admittedly returned or will delete any of plaintiff's property that they retained following their termination of employment. Defendants testified that they have never used any of those 11 -- ORDER   documents to divert business from plaintiff. Thus far, plaintiff has presented no evidence that it will be unable to fairly compete with Esquire or other related businesses because of defendants' conduct. The loss of plaintiff's confidential court reporter list could limit plaintiff's inability to contract with well-qualified court reporters. This harm, however, can be reasonably quantified and remedied with damages. Therefore, this factor weighs against the issuance of an injunction. 3.  Balance of hardships Plaintiff has only demonstrated serious questions going to the merits of its claims, so the  balance of hardships must tip sharply in its favor to obtain an injunction. See Alliance For The Wild Rockies, 632 F.3d at 1131-32. Plaintiff asserts a legitimate interest in preventing defendants from disseminating plaintiff's confidential information and soliciting plaintiff's clients. Although defendants may be voluntarily restricting their marketing practices for Esquire in the Portland area, they have received no threats to their jobs with Esquire. At this time, the hardships favor plaintiff. 4.  Public interest  Plaintiff argues that the public interest in contracts and business development would be furthered by this injunction. This court disagrees. The public interest would be disserved by the enforcement of an unduly broad and statutorily voidable contract. Although defendants may have breached their Confidentiality Agreements or exceeded their authority in their use of plaintiff's information, the only potentially confidential information held by defendants is the list of reliable court reporters. Because these court reporters are independent contractors, this court believes that any injunction affecting the court reporters' ability to obtain work would not serve 12 -- ORDER   the public interest. If this list is later deemed to be a trade secret, plaintiff's losses can be ameliorated with monetary damages. CONCLUSION For the reasons provided, Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction [4] is DENIED. IT IS SO ORDERED. DATED this 5th day of December, 2011.  /s/ Ancer L. Haggerty Ancer L. Haggerty United States District Judge  13 -- ORDER

					UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN SOUTHERN DIVISION  BENJAMIN DEHART III, Plaintiff, CASE NO. 2:11-cv-11806 v. HON. MARIANNE O. BATTANI LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA, Defendant. _________________________________/ OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT    S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE RECORD, GRANTING DEFENDANT    S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON ITS COUNTERCLAIM, DENYING PLAINTIFF    S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE RECORD, AND GRANTING DEFENDANT    S MOTION TO STRIKE This matter is before the Court on Defendant Life Insurance Company of North America    s Motion to Affirm Administrator    s Decision and Judgment on Counterclaim (Doc. 33) and Plaintiff Benjamin DeHart    s Motion to Reverse the Life Insurance Company of North America    s Decision to Terminate Long Term Disability Benefits. (Doc. 35). DeHart filed the instant action pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (    ERISA    ), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq., after Defendant terminated his disability benefits in 2009. In addition, Defendant filed a counterclaim to recover an alleged overpayment of benefits. (Doc. 26). The matter is fully briefed and the Court finds that argument will not aid in the resolution of this matter. See E.D. Mich. L.R. 7.1(f)(2). For the reasons stated below, the Court GRANTS Defendant    s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record, GRANTS Defendant    s Motion for Summary   Judgment on its Counterclaim, DENIES Plaintiff    s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record, and GRANTS Defendant    s Motion to Strike. I.  STATEMENT OF FACTS Plaintiff Benjamin DeHart worked for Northwest Airlines as an airplane mechanic.  He worked from September 18, 1989 until November 1, 2004, the date he was placed on medical leave of absence for injuries arising from an automobile accident in which his vehicle was rear-ended by a truck.  Soon thereafter, DeHart sought long term  disability benefits (    LTD    ) under Northwest    s group employee benefit plan entitled:     Northwest Airlines Department A4710 Disability Benefit Plan     (the     Plan    ), effective June 1, 2002.  The Plan, issued and administered by Defendant Life Insurance  Company of North America (    LINA    ), a subsidiary of CIGNA corporation, provides LTD benefits to employees who offer continued     satisfactory proof of Disability.     (A.R. 262). The Plan defines     Disability     as the following: An Employee is considered Disabled if, solely because of Injury or Sickness, he or she is: 1. unable to perform the material duties of his or her Regular Occupation; and 2. After Disability Benefits have been payable for 36 months, the Employee is considered Disabled if, solely due to Injury or Sickness, he or she is unable to perform all the material duties of any occupation for which he or she is, or may reasonably become qualified based on education, training, or experience. (A.R. 258). In accordance with the Plan, LINA determined DeHart could not meet the duties of his     Regular Occupation     as an airplane mechanic. He began receiving LTD benefits on January 30, 2005. After the accident, DeHart began treatment with Dr. Marvin Bleiberg for pain in his neck and back. The treatment was relatively unsuccessful in relieving the pain.  2   Based on the results of an MRI, Dr. Teck Mun Soo diagnosed DeHart with traumatic spondylopathy, disc herniation C3-4, C4-5, C5-6; bilateral L5 radiculopathy; myelopathy; and carpel tunnel. (A.R. 1161). He underwent decompression and fusion surgery of the spine on October 23, 2006. (Id.) Prior to the surgery in March 2006, DeHart applied for and received Social Security Disability benefits. (A.R. 115). On February 27, 2007, DeHart received a $1.5 million settlement arising out of his third-party tort action filed against the driver of the truck.  (Doc. 33, Ex. B).  He did not notify LINA of the  settlement. On September 28, 2007, DeHart underwent another MRI which indicated that the fusion was stable.  (A.R. 1038-39).  A month later, Dr. Bleiberg performed an  electrodiagnostic nerve conduction study on DeHart.  (A.R. 1029-31).  Dr. Bleiberg  found     Carpel Tunnel Syndrome on the right and left     and that     [t]here is no electrodiagnostic evidence for a Cervical Radiculopathy.     (A.R. 1031). Several months later on January 30, 2008, the standard for disability changed, requiring DeHart to demonstrate that he was unfit to perform     any occupation     in order to continue receiving LTD benefits. (A.R. 258). Nonetheless, LINA approved payment under this standard and continued DeHart    s benefits.  During this time, DeHart also received insurance  benefits from State Farm, his no-fault carrier. On September 11, 2008, nearly four years after the accident, DeHart visited Dr. Joseph Femminineo for an independent medical examination (    IME    ) requested by State Farm. Based on the exam, Dr. Femminineo concluded that DeHart was able to perform sedentary and light-duty work. (A.R. 912). On March 19, 2009, a transferable skills analysis revealed that DeHart could perform sedentary and light occupations such  3   as electric meter repairer, parts manager, and aircraft equipment sales representative. (A.R. 433). Therefore, on March 25, 2009, LINA notified DeHart that he failed to qualify for continuing LTD benefits. (A.R. 184-86). On June, 8, 2009, DeHart appealed the termination of his benefits. In support, he submitted a letter dated April 21, 2009 from Dr. Bleiberg stating,     Mr. DeHart is permanently disabled from any and all gainful employment.     (A.R. 429). Dr. Bleiberg noted that DeHart required several medications to treat his pain, including OxyContin, methadone, baclofen, Restoril, Albutrin, and Zoloft, resulting in decreased concentration and fatigue. (A.R. 431). Dr. Bleiberg also posited that DeHart     requires the ability to alternate sitting, standing, walking and lying down at will     and that DeHart would likely miss several days of work because of the pain in his neck and back. (Id.) DeHart also submitted several office notes detailing DeHart    s recurring visits to Dr. Bleiberg during 2010. (A.R. 804-34). Dr. Charles McCool, LINA    s associate medical director, and Dr. Donald Minteer separately reviewed DeHart    s appeal.  Both concluded that the medical information  indicated that DeHart could perform light to sedentary work. (A.R. 29-34). Therefore, LINA upheld its decision to terminate benefits. (A.R. 168-170). DeHart then filed a second appeal on December 14, 2010. LINA assigned the case to Dr. Francis Hall to conduct an independent peer review. (A.R. 292-95). Dr. Hall concluded that DeHart could at least return to sedentary work. (A.R. 293). Notably, Dr. Hall unsuccessfully attempted to contact Dr. Bleiberg twice. (A.R. 294). On February 2, 2011, LINA affirmed its decision to terminate benefits. (A.R. 155-56). On April 25, 2011, DeHart filed the instant action seeking judicial review of the termination of his  4   benefits under ERISA. Upon disclosure of the $1.5 million settlement agreement, the Court granted leave for LINA to amend its answer and file a counterclaim to recover overpayment of benefits. (Doc. 26). II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW Motions for judgment on the administrative record in an ERISA action are not  akin to motions for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). See Wilkins v. Baptist Healthcare Sys., Inc., 150 F.3d 609, 618 (6th Cir. 1998) (    This standard of review does not neatly fit under either Rule 52 or Rule 56, but is a specially fashioned rule designed to carry out Congress    s intent under ERISA.    ). Accordingly, a district court reviews an ERISA plan administrator's denial of benefits de novo unless the plan grants the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits. Cox v. Standard Ins. Co., 585 F.3d 295, 299 (6th Cir. 2009) (citing Gismondi v. United Techs. Corp., 408 F.3d 295, 298 (6th Cir. 2005)). If the plan gives the administrator discretionary authority, a court applies the highly deferential Aarbitrary and capricious@ standard of review. Id.     The arbitrary and capricious standard is the least demanding form of judicial review of administrative action. When it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation, based on the evidence, for a particular outcome, that outcome is not arbitrary or capricious.@ Schwalm v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 626 F.3d 299, 308 (6th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Shields v. Reader's Digest Ass'n, Inc., 331 F.3d 536, 541 (6th Cir. 2003)). Even when a claimant has introduced evidence that might be sufficient to support a finding of disability, if there is a reasonable explanation for the administrator's decision denying benefits because of the plan's provisions, then the decision is neither arbitrary nor capricious.  5  Id. (citing   Williams v. Int'l Paper Co., 227 F.3d 706, 712 (6th Cir. 2000)). Therefore, a reviewing court must uphold the administrator's decision     if it is the result of a deliberate, principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence.     Baker v. United Mine Workers of Am. Health & Ret. Funds, 929 F.2d 1140, 1144 (6th Cir. 1991). III.  ANALYSIS A.  Appropriate Standard of Review      Arbitrary and Capricious  LINA asserts that the Plan contains language granting it discretionary authority to determine benefit eligibility, and thus the arbitrary and capricious standard of review applies. Cox, 585 F.3d at 299. Indeed, the Plan provides:     [claimant] must provide to [LINA], at his or her own expense, satisfactory proof of Disability before benefits will be paid.     (A.R. 262); see also (A.R. 267) ([LINA] shall have the authority, in its discretion . . . to decide questions of eligibility for coverage or benefits under the Plan    ). DeHart does not dispute the effect of Plan language. Indeed, such language is sufficient to confer discretionary authority to LINA. See Perez v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 150 F.3d 550, 556-57 (6th Cir. 1998) (noting that language requiring satisfactory evidence     to the insurer     or     to the company     created a     clear grant of discretion    ). As such, the Court finds the language sufficient to grant discretion to LINA in determining benefit eligibility. Nonetheless, DeHart asserts the Court must review the decision de novo because: (1) Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (    CGLIC    ) (a wholly owned subsidiary of CIGNA), sent a letter to the Michigan Commissioner of Insurance warranting that CGLIC does not use forms containing discretionary clauses in its policies; (2) Minnesota law prohibits discretionary clauses in insurance policies; and (3)  6   LINA, as both claims administrator and insurer, operated under a conflict of interest in processing DeHart    s claim. Each argument will be addressed in turn. First, DeHart asserts LINA is bound by CGLIC    s statement that it does not use forms containing discretionary clauses in its policies issued in Michigan. (Doc. 35, Ex. 2). LINA is a wholly owned subsidiary of CGLIC. However, the Plan in this case was issued in Minnesota, not Michigan. (A.R. 247). Regardless, subsidiaries are treated as wholly separate corporations under Michigan law, and thus must be treated as such. See Wells v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 364 N.W.2d 670, 674 (Mich. 1984) (    We recognize the general principle that in Michigan separate entities will be respected.    ). Consequently, LINA cannot reasonably be bound by statements in a letter sent from a parent corporation to the insurance department of another state. DeHart    s argument is without merit. Next, DeHart argues Minn. Stat. § 62Q.107 prohibits discretionary clauses in policies issued after January 1, 1999 (LINA    s LTD Plan was issued June 1, 2002). The statute provides in relevant part: [N]o health plan . . . may specify a standard of review upon which a court may review denial of a claim or of any other decision made by a health plan company with respect to an enrollee. This section prohibits limiting court review to a determination of whether the health plan company    s decision is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or any other standard less favorable to the enrollee than a preponderance of the evidence. Minn. Stat. § 62Q.107.      Health plan     is a statutorily defined term that expressly  excludes     disability or income protection coverage.     Minn. Stat. § 62A.011. Because the policy at issue concerns only LTD benefits and is not a     health plan     under Minnesota law, the statute is inapplicable.  7   Last, DeHart argues that a conflict of interest influenced LINA    s decision, and thus the Court must review the decision de novo. The general rule is that an apparent conflict of interest arises when the administrator both determines eligibility for benefits and is responsible for paying such benefits. See Glenn v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 461 F.3d 660, 666 (6th Cir. 2006) (noting that such a     dual function creates an apparent conflict of interest    ). In such a case,     the conflict must be weighed as a     facto[r] in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.         Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115 (1989) (internal citation omitted). Here, LINA, as administrator, determined eligibility for benefits and paid out benefits.  LINA contracted with Professional Disability Associates (    PDA    ), which  employed Dr. Hall to review DeHart    s appeal. Contrary to DeHart    s claim, an apparent conflict of interest does not require the court to engage in de novo review. See Kalish v. Liberty Mut., 419 F.3d 501, 506 (6th Cir. 2005). Rather, it is only a factor in the court    s analysis as to whether the decision was arbitrary and capricious. Moreover, other than a blanket statement that LINA routinely hires PDA to review claims, DeHart provides no evidence that PDA or Dr. Hall are prone to find in favor of LINA merely because LINA paid for the independent peer review. See Peruzzi v. Summa Med. Plan, 137 F.3d 431, 433 (6th Cir. 1998) (requiring     significant evidence     that the conflict of interest tainted the decision). Such unsupported conclusory statements do not demonstrate that the decision was tainted. Consequently, the Court will place little weight on this factor in its analysis of LINA    s decision to terminate benefits, and the decision will be analyzed under the arbitrary and capricious standard.  8   B.  LINA    s Decision was not Arbitrary and Capricious  LINA    s decision to terminate benefits will be upheld     if it is the result of a deliberate, principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence.     Baker, 929 F.2d at 1144. DeHart bears the burden of demonstrating he is eligible for benefits. (A.R. 262). He argues that LINA improperly terminated his LTD benefits because his condition has not improved and he is still completely disabled. Specifically, he argues LINA ignored the medical evidence provided by his treating physician, Dr. Bleiberg, indicating the severe pain he experiences on a daily basis, precluding his ability to work any occupation. DeHart also asserts LINA failed to consider the ruling by the Commissioner of Social Security that he is disabled.  In contrast, LINA claims  DeHart is able to perform at least sedentary work and failed to meet his continuing burden for LTD benefits.  LINA asserts it considered the award of Social Security  benefits and properly discounted Dr. Bleiberg    s conclusions based on the medical evidence in the record. 1.  Social Security Administration    s Decision  A finding of disability by the Social Security Administration (    SSA    ) does not     automatically entitle[] [a claimant] to benefits under an ERISA plan, since the plan    s disability criteria may differ from the Social Security Administration    s.     DeLisle v. Sun Life Assur. Co of Canada, 558 F.3d 440, 445-46 (6th Cir. 2009) (citing Whitaker v. Hartford, 404 F.3d 947, 949 (6th Cir. 2005)). However, where the plan administrator (1) encourages the applicant to apply for Social Security disability payments; (2) financially benefits from the applicant    s receipt of Social Security; and then (3) fails to explain it is taking a position different from the SSA on the question of disability, the reviewing court should weigh this in favor of a finding that the decision was arbitrary or capricious.  9   Bennett v. Kemper Nat. Servs., Inc., 514 F.3d 547, 554 (6th Cir. 2008). In the instant case, it is undisputed that LINA encouraged DeHart to apply for Social Security disability benefits and that LINA benefitted from the award because it reduced its obligation. In fact, LINA hired an attorney to represent DeHart in the matter. DeHart argues that LINA failed to provide an explanation for discounting the decision of the SSA, and thus this factor weighs in his favor that the decision was arbitrary and capricious. In the letter denying DeHart    s appeal, LINA stated: We are aware that Mr. DeHart was awarded Social Security Disability benefits; however, the standard for determining Disability under this policy may be different from the standard used by the Social Security Administration (SSA). As a fiduciary under Northwest Airlines Departments     LTD Policy, we are required to make our determination based on the applicable provisions of the Policy and the proof of loss information available. Without an opinion from SSA explaining the basis for its decision, we cannot evaluate its reasoning and so, can take note of its decision, but cannot rely on or otherwise promote that decision ahead of other proof of claim and policy information. We must make our determination independent of Social Security    s determination and based upon the medical information provided and the specific policy provision requirements under Northwest Airlines Department Policy Number LK 30561. (A.R. 164). In contrast to the above statement, DeHart asserts LINA received the SSA opinion in 2006. (A.R. 1349). Although LINA received notice of the decision, there is no evidence in the record that it received the actual opinion detailing the SSA    s rationale for a finding of disability.  The fax, dated March 20, 2006, does not contain the SSA  opinion. In fact, DeHart cites no evidence that he submitted it to LINA in accordance with his burden to demonstrate his disability. Undoubtedly, LINA cannot provide an explanation for something it did not possess during its determination. 10  Dr. Hall did   consider the award letter in his review, but did not provide a discussion of its contents because he did not possess the actual opinion. (A.R. 743). Perhaps most importantly, the SSA    s decision predates LINA    s decision to terminate benefits by over three years. During this time, DeHart underwent intense surgery and substantial medical treatment for his injuries, resulting in improved functionality. LINA explained its reasoning for not following the SSA    s decision, noting that it must conduct its own review in accordance with the Plan language and that DeHart never submitted the actual opinion as evidence of his disability. Due to the changing circumstances of DeHart    s treatment, the SSA    s disability determination offers little probative value as evidence of DeHart    s disability at the time LINA terminated LTD benefits. Regardless, the Court will consider this factor in DeHart    s favor, but will afford it little weight. 2.  Medical Evidence  LINA terminated benefits based on its conclusion that DeHart failed to demonstrate his inability to perform the material duties of any occupation because he is able to perform sedentary to light work. As evidence of that he cannot perform even sedentary work, DeHart points to several statements in Dr. Bleiberg    s April 2009 letter that his pain is debilitating and that he is completely and permanently disabled. DeHart submitted the letter in support of both appeals.  In all, Dr. Bleiberg listed eighteen  different diagnoses affecting DeHart. He also stated that despite all of the treatment,     Mr. DeHart remains with severe pain and significant functional deficits to the present time.     (A.R. 430). He further notes that DeHart complains of insomnia and severe back spasms. (Id.) In terms of functional limitations, Dr. Bleiberg noted that the amount of  11   medication DeHart requires leads to fatigue and concentration problems. Based on his pain, Dr. Bleiberg concluded that DeHart     requires the ability to alternate sitting, standing, walking and lying down at will.     (A.R. 431). He further posited that this would require DeHart to miss numerous days of work, precluding any ability to maintain gainful employment.  Dr. Bleiberg    s extensive patient notes document DeHart    s consistent  complaints of pain. For example, on July 19, 2010, DeHart complained of a     sharp and stabbing sensation in his back.     (A.R. 831). However, Dr. Bleiberg noted that there is     no specific aggravating factor     and that     not much is seeming [sic] to help.     (Id.) LINA correctly points out that Dr. Bleiberg never conducted a physical examination in order to determine functionality.  Dr. Bleiberg confirmed this in his  deposition. (A.R. 303). When asked how DeHart    s functionality was determined, Dr. Bleiberg stated that it was solely based on what DeHart tells him. (Id.) In contrast, Dr. Femminineo conducted a comprehensive physical examination and concluded that DeHart could return to work with restrictions.  (A.R. 910-12).  These restrictions  included:     avoidance of lifting weight greater than 30 pounds; avoidance of repetitive bending, stooping and twisting at the waist; and in particular avoidance of extension of the cervical spine and lumbar spine over extended periods of time    .  (Id.)  Dr.  Femminineo also recommended weaning DeHart off of the several pain medications, as DeHart had reached maximum medical improvement, noting     [h]e is on some very potent long-acting narcotic agents for his present subjective complaints.      (Id.)  He  expressed concern that DeHart had been taking the medications for several years. DeHart attacks this analysis, citing Dr. Bleiberg    s deposition testimony that Dr. Femminineo failed to take into account DeHart    s cervical and lumbar radiculopathy  12   (pinched nerves), muscle spasms, severe pain, and narcotic medications. (A.R. 849). In essence, these all relate to DeHart    s complaints of pain. However, Dr. Femminineo    s physical functional analysis revealed DeHart possessed enough functionality without pain to perform sedentary work, notwithstanding his complaints of pain in his lower back and neck.  Remarkably, Dr. Bleiberg    s September 2007 report expressly found no      electrodiagnostic evidence for a Cervical Radiculopathy,     contradicting his deposition testimony. (A.R. 1031). DeHart offers no explanation for this discrepancy. Dr. Bleiberg never conducted a physical functional analysis, instead relying solely upon DeHart    s self-reported complaints.  DeHart fails to provide any other reason as to why Dr.  Femminineo    s medical opinion is unsound. Certainly, LINA reasonably afforded greater weight to Dr. Femminineo    s functional analysis as opposed to Dr. Bleiberg    s second hand reports of DeHart    s pain in his neck and back. This also undermines Dr. Bleiberg    s conclusion that side effects of the several prescribed narcotic medications preclude DeHart    s ability to work.  Dr.  Femminineo concluded that the medications should be gradually discontinued, thereby removing any side effects that interfere with concentration or cause fatigue during work. Moreover, Dr. Hall, Dr. McCool, and Dr. Minteer all concluded that DeHart could return to at least sedentary work. DeHart takes issue with LINA    s reliance on these     paper reviews.     However, there is     nothing inherently objectionable about a file review by a qualified physician in the context of a benefits determination.     Calvert v. Firstar Fin., Inc., 409 F.3d 286, 296 (6th Cir. 2005). In his review, Dr. Hall noted that DeHart had     grade one anteriolithesis and moderate to severe loss of invertebral disc space.     (A.R. 293). However, he stated that     [t]his is likely a cause for him to have low back  13   pain difficulties but by itself does not determine how debilitating his pain is and should not be considered fully debilitating with a competent functional analysis.     (Id.) Further, Dr. Hall noted that although DeHart     self reports pain[,] little is offered in the form of treatment aside from medical management.      (A.R. 294).  Dr. Hall also noted that  DeHart stated that he could perform daily living activities and that he rides an exercise bike for ten minutes a day. In all, four independent physicians determined that DeHart could at least return to sedentary work. Thus, it was reasonable for LINA to discount Dr. Bleiberg    s findings, considering that Dr. Bleiberg never determined DeHart    s functionality.  Dr. Bleiberg  merely relegated DeHart to prescription drugs based on his complaints of severe pain. Indeed, a plan administrator is not required to accept opinions of the claimant    s treating physician when contrary medical evidence exists. See Cooper v. Life Ins. Co. of North Am., 486 F.3d 157, 167 (6th Cir. 2007) (noting that insurer     was not obligated to blindly accept the treating physicians     opinions    ). Here, Dr. Bleiberg    s conclusion that DeHart is permanently disabled and unable to maintain gainful employment is substantially based on DeHart    s complaints of pain and unsupported by the evidence.  Notably,  DeHart offers no other evidence to refute the findings of the four other physicians. LINA did not ignore Dr. Bleiberg    s opinion, but reasonably concluded that DeHart could return to work in at least a sedentary capacity after being disabled for several years as a result of the accident. 3.  Conclusion  DeHart concedes that it is his burden to demonstrate that he is disabled. However, a substantial majority of the medical evidence indicates that he can return to  14   work in at least a sedentary capacity. After weighing all of the relevant factors, including the little weight afforded to both the apparent conflict of interest and SSA    s decision, it is clear LINA performed a full and fair review of DeHart    s claim.  Under this very  deferential standard, LINA    s decision is not arbitrary and capricious where objective medical evidence of DeHart    s inability to perform sedentary work is lacking. C.  LINA    s Counterclaim 1.  Standard of Review  LINA    s counterclaim to recover overpaid benefits is not entitled to deferential review, but is appropriately analyzed as a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56(a). See Lee v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan Long Term, 2012 WL 664733 *2 (N.D. Cal. February 28, 2012) (noting that     because [defendant    s] counterclaim does not implicate the denial of long-term disability benefits . . . the Court finds it appropriate to treat the present Motions as motions for summary judgment    ). Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is     no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.     Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The central inquiry is     whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.      Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52 (1986).  Rule 56  mandates summary judgment against a party who fails to establish the existence of an element essential to the party's case and on which that party bears the burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).  15   2.  LINA    s Motion to Strike  Before turning to the merits of LINA    s counterclaim, the Court must address LINA    s motion to strike several affidavits addressing DeHart    s settlement award in 2007. In support of his argument that LINA is not entitled to overpayment, DeHart submitted affidavits from Leonard Koltonow and James Borin, both Michigan attorneys. Koltonow, who represented DeHart in the negligence lawsuit, attests that the lawsuit did not arise out of a work loss provision in a No-Fault insurance policy. (Doc. 35, Ex. 3). It also states that the settlement did not allocate payment for lost wages. (Id.) Similarly, the affidavit of Borin states that the     clear language of the [Plan] does not confer a right of set off of proceeds from any tort or negligence settlement.     (Doc. 35, Ex. 4). LINA also seeks to strike DeHart    s affidavit, which states that State Farm has continued its payment of benefits.  (Doc. 42).  DeHart    s affidavit is offered as evidence of his  disability, but was never presented to LINA during its review of DeHart    s claim. The Court did not consider it in its analysis above. Consequently, the Court will strike the affidavit. See Racknor v. First Allmerica Fin. Life Ins. Co., 71 F. Supp. 2d 723, 729 (E.D. Mich. 1999) (    The Court may not admit or consider any evidence not presented to the administrator.    ). It is clear that the affidavits of Koltonow and Borin are offered as legal conclusions that the settlement proceeds from the negligence lawsuit do not qualify as     Other Income Benefits     under the Plan. The Court refuses to accept these affidavits as support for DeHart    s position. See Berent v. Kemper Corp., 780 F. Supp. 431, 440 n.11 (E.D. Mich. 1991) (noting that     the Court is not required      and expressly refuses      to accept as support for a party    s position with respect to a pending motion an Affidavit of a  16   third-party . . . who offers nothing more than his personal opinion regarding the law    ). Although Koltonow represented DeHart in the negligence suit, his opinions regarding the interpretation of LINA    s Plan language are irrelevant. Consequently, the Court will strike both affidavits. 3.  No Genuine Dispute of Fact Exists  Under ERISA, a plan fiduciary may commence a civil action     to obtain other appropriate equitable relief . . . to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.     29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3). The Plan provides that if a disabled employee entitled to LTD benefits receives additional     Other Income Benefits,     those benefits will reduce any benefits payable or will result in a     request for a lump sum payment of the overpaid amount.     (A.R. 263, 265).     Other Income Benefits     include     any amounts which the Employee receives (or is assumed to receive) under . . . any work loss provision in mandatory     No-Fault     auto insurance.     (Id.) The Plan further provides that     Other Income Benefits or earnings that are paid in a lump sum will be prorated over the period for which the sum is given. If no time is stated the lump sum will be prorated monthly over a five year period.     (A.R. 264). In addition,     [i]f no specific allocation of a lump sum payment is made, then the total payment will be an Other Income Benefit.     (Id.) Here, LINA seeks return of the overpayment of benefits to DeHart, not for a portion of his settlement. Based on the Plan language, which grants LINA authority to recover overpaid benefits, the Court finds LINA    s counterclaim qualifies as     appropriate equitable relief     under § 1132(a)(3). See Thurber v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 712 F.3d 654, 664-65 (2d Cir. 2013) (holding that claimant held administrator    s overpayment of  17   benefits in constructive trust upon which administrator held an equitable lien, thereby constituting equitable relief under ERISA). LINA asserts that the $1.5 million settlement DeHart received as a result of his third-party tort action filed against the driver of the truck constitutes     Other Income Benefits     because it results from work loss damages under mandatory No-Fault auto insurance. Thus, LINA overpaid DeHart    s benefits in the amount of $46,033.00. DeHart does not dispute this amount. The Plan expressly provides that LINA may recover overpaid benefits if the claimant receives other benefits pursuant to any work loss provision in mandatory nofault auto insurance. Under Michigan no-fault law, an injured party    s recovery is limited to 85% of lost wages for up to three years. See Mich. Comp. Laws § 500.3107(b). However, Michigan    s mandatory no-fault scheme also authorizes third-party actions for noneconomic and economic damages in excess of 85% of three years     worth of work loss. M.C.L § 500.3135(3)(c). Indeed, DeHart    s action expressly sought     damages for all allowable expenses and work loss in excess of the daily, monthly, and three year limitations plus all other economic damages allowable under the Michigan No-Fault Law.     (Doc. 33, Ex. A, ¶ 17). DeHart received a $1.5 million settlement arising out of his third-party tort action.  Clearly, DeHart    s settlement proceeds constitute     Other  Income Benefits     under the policy, as they arise out of     any work loss provision in mandatory     No-Fault     auto insurance.     Per the     Reimbursement Agreement,     DeHart was required to     promptly notify     LINA of any award of other benefits received. (A.R. 1592). In addition, because the settlement did not allocate or differentiate between  18   work loss payments and noneconomic damages, the entire lump sum offsets the benefits paid by LINA from the time of settlement. DeHart argues that the settlement proceeds do not constitute     Other Income Benefits     under the Plan for several reasons.  First, he argues the Plan does not  expressly require offset from an auto negligence lawsuit and that the settlement did not account for lost wages or income replacement. DeHart filed the suit seeking damages under Michigan    s no-fault scheme. The mere fact that the settlement agreement did not allocate any categories of damages is not dispositive. Notably, DeHart    s suit would have been barred but for the express provision permitting such actions in the Michigan No-Fault scheme. DeHart relies on Baxter v. Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, 833 F. Supp. 2d 833 (N.D. Ill. 2011) for the proposition that negligence actions cannot arise under no-fault statutory schemes.  His reliance is misplaced.  In Baxter, the  beneficiary received a settlement award arising out of a medical malpractice suit brought against the hospital where he received treatment.  Id. at 836.  Defendant  argued that the award constituted     Other Income Benefits     because it was an amount received     due to income replacement or lost wages paid to you by compromise, settlement, or other method as a result of a claim for any Other Income Benefit.     Id. at 837.  The court found the language insufficient to include medical malpractice tort  claims within the definition of     Other Income Benefits     because     a malpractice recovery is not a typical     income benefit     which foreseeably results from [a disability].     Id. at 842. Perhaps more importantly, the claimant    s tort action arose out of treatment he received after he became disabled, unrelated to the cause of his disability. Id. at 842 n.6. Unlike  19   Baxter, DeHart    s third-party tort action sought damages relating to the cause of his disabling condition and fits squarely within the Plan language. Second, DeHart asserts that because Michigan no-fault insurance work loss only compensates an insured for up to three years, work loss recovery is not a     mandatory     recovery under M.C.L. § 500.3135(3). This argument is off point. The Plan uses the word     mandatory     to modify     No-Fault auto insurance.     It merely refers to the type of no-fault scheme, which in Michigan, is mandatory for all operators of automobiles. Last, DeHart argues that settlement proceeds do not constitute     income     under the Internal Revenue Code (    IRC    ).  His settlement proceeds may not be taxable  income under the IRC. However, this does not modify the defined terms of the Plan. In sum, LINA is entitled to recover $46,033.00 in overpaid benefits. IV.  CONCLUSION Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant    s Motion for Judgment on the  Administrative Record, GRANTS Defendant    s Motion for Summary Judgment on its Counterclaim, DENIES Plaintiff    s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record, and GRANTS Defendant    s Motion to Strike.  The decision of the administrator is  AFFIRMED. IT IS SO ORDERED. s/Marianne O. Battani MARIANNE O. BATTANI UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  DATE: September 5, 2013  20   CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE I hereby certify that on the above date a copy of this Opinion and Order was served upon all parties of record via the Court    s ECF Filing System. s/Bernadette M.

ITEM 27.  NUMBER OF CONTRACT OWNERS 

As of November 30, 2015 there were 9,787 Contract Owners.             

ITEM 28.  INDEMNIFICATION 

 The Company may indemnify any person who is or was a director, officer,
  employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of
the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another      
     corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against
    expenses reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense
   of any action, suit or proceeding, civil or criminal, in which he is made
    or threatened to be made, a party by reason of being or having been in any
    such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, except in relation to
matters as to which he is adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding,
civil or criminal, to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the   
performance of duty to the Company; provided however, that such       
    indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
  those indemnified may be entitled under any provision of the Articles of
  Incorporation, By-Laws, resolution, or other authorization heretofore or
     hereafter adopted, after notice by a majority vote of all the voting shares
then issued and outstanding.                                          

   Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act
    of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of
the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the
registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as  
    expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a
    claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment
  by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any 
action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or  
    controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the
   registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate    
 jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against
 public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue.                                           

ITEM 29.  PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER

Court of Appeals of Tennessee.
MASSACHUSETTS MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY v. David A. JEFFERSON.
No. M1998-00904-COA-R3-CV.
    Decided: September 05, 2002

		WILLIAM C. KOCH, JR., J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which BEN H. CANTRELL, P.J., M.S., and WILLIAM B. CAIN, J., joined.Thomas H. Bilbrey, Lafayette, Tennessee, for appellant, David A. Jefferson. Tyree B. Harris, IV and Lisa Ramsay Cole, Nashville, Tennessee, for appellee, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company.
OPINIONThis appeal involves a clinical psychologist who lost his professional license following a sexual affair with a former patient. Five months after the Board of Examiners in Psychology revoked his license, the psychologist filed a claim with his disability insurance carrier asserting that depression had prompted him to have the affair and had also rendered him unable to practice psychology.   The insurance company denied coverage and filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Sumner County seeking to establish its obligations under the psychologist's policy.   Following a bench trial, the court determined that the psychologist has failed to demonstrate that he was disabled within the meaning of the policy.   On this appeal, the psychologist asserts that he is entitled to disability benefits, and the insurance company insists that it was entitled to discretionary costs under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2).   We concur with the trial court's conclusion that the psychologist has not demonstrated that he is entitled to benefits under his disability policy.   We also find that the insurance company was entitled to recover part of its requested discretionary costs.I.David A. Jefferson obtained a doctorate in clinical psychology and acquired a license to practice psychology in Tennessee in 1977.   He and his family moved to Sumner County where he established a flourishing private practice in Hendersonville.   In 1984, Dr. Jefferson began treating Jane Roe 1 for panic attacks and depression.   Ms. Roe's panic attacks eventually subsided, and Dr. Jefferson discontinued her therapy in August 1987.   However, Dr. Jefferson and Ms. Roe continued to see each other on a personal basis.   Even though both of them were married, they began having a sexual relationship in October 1987.2  Their affair ended in February 1989 after Dr. Jefferson started an affair with another woman.   Ms. Roe retaliated by telephoning Dr. Jefferson's wife and children to tell them about her relationship with Dr. Jefferson and by filing a complaint with the Board of Examiners in Psychology (“licensing board”).3 In May 1989, Dr. Jefferson sought therapy from Dr. Wayne C. Richard, another clinical psychologist.   Dr. Richard determined that “various stressors” had rendered Dr. Jefferson “somewhat dysfunctional” in his professional and home life.4  In July 1989, the licensing board filed a formal notice of charges against Dr. Jefferson based on Ms. Roe's complaint.   Dr. Jefferson responded to these charges by asserting that he was “a highly qualified and competent psychologist” and that “there was no ethical rule ․ which prohibited social or romantic relationships between psychologists and their former patients.”   Following a hearing on April 26 and 27, 1990, the licensing board entered an order on May 15, 1990, finding that Dr. Jefferson had “engaged in improper sexual contact and sexual intercourse with ․ [an] individual who had recently completed a course of psychotherapy and was still under the influence of that powerful relationship” and that he had “used said individual to fulfill his needs and exploited said individual.”   Accordingly, the licensing board permanently revoked Dr. Jefferson's license to practice psychology in Tennessee.Dr. Jefferson promptly filed a petition for reconsideration and a motion for a stay of the licensing board's May 15, 1990 order.   Less than one month later, he consulted with a physician friend, Dr. William E. Hardin, about “going on disability because of depression.” On October 1, 1990, Dr. Jefferson filled out a claim form seeking benefits under his Disability Income Policy issued by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (“Massachusetts Mutual”).   He described his sickness as “major depression following revocation of license” and stated that he had been totally disabled since April 29, 1990 and that he had been receiving treatment from Dr. Hardin since June 12, 1990.On December 14, 1990, the licensing board heard argument on Dr. Jefferson's petition for reconsideration and motion for stay.   Approximately one month later, on January 24, 1991, Massachusetts Mutual denied Dr. Jefferson's claim for disability benefits.   Thereafter, on February 5, 1991, the licensing board denied his motions to reconsider and to stay its order.   Dr. Jefferson then filed an untimely, pro se petition for reconsideration of the board's February 5, 1991 order asserting, among other things, that “I am so rehabilitated that it is almost beyond description.”   When the licensing board did not act on his petition, Dr. Jefferson sought judicial review of the board's decision in the Chancery Court for Davidson County.In June 1991, Massachusetts Mutual filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Sumner County to ascertain its rights and obligations under Dr. Jefferson's disability insurance policy.   It asserted that Dr. Jefferson's claimed disability was the result of his own voluntary acts rather than a debilitating sickness or injury.   After taking proof on October 31 and November 5, 1996, the trial court entered its judgment on February 3, 1997, concluding that Dr. Jefferson “was not entitled to any benefits under the policy of disability insurance in question ․ having failed to demonstrate that he was unable to work as the direct and proximate result of a compensable disability and did not demonstrate a loss of income of at least twenty percent (20%) as the direct and proximate result of a disability․” Dr. Jefferson filed a timely Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.04 motion, and Massachusetts Mutual moved for its discretionary costs under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2).On December 4, 1997, while the parties' post-trial motions were pending, the Chancery Court for Davidson County filed its memorandum and order in the proceeding to review the licensing board's revocation of Dr. Jefferson's license.   The chancery court determined that the licensing board erred by finding that Dr. Jefferson had violated the ethical prohibition against client-therapist relationships.   However, it found the evidence supported the board's findings that Ms. Roe was still under Dr. Jefferson's influence and that he had exploited their relationship to fulfill his own needs.   Accordingly, the chancery court upheld the licensing board's determination that Dr. Jefferson was guilty of repeated negligence in the course of his practice.   The chancery court also reduced Dr. Jefferson's punishment from a permanent revocation to an eight-year suspension ending on May 15, 1998.   The court conditioned the reinstatement of Dr. Jefferson's license on the licensing board's imposition of reasonable conditions to assure that his negligent behavior did not reoccur.5 The chancery court's decision prompted Dr. Jefferson to file an amended Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.04 motion in this proceeding.   On January 13, 1998, the trial court filed an order denying Dr. Jefferson's Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.04 motion and Massachusetts Mutual's motion for discretionary costs.   Dr. Jefferson perfected this appeal. He now argues that the trial court misconstrued the terms of his disability policy and “did not properly weigh the evidence.”   Massachusetts Mutual asserts that the trial court properly determined that Dr. Jefferson was not entitled to benefits under his disability policy but that the trial court erred by denying its motion for discretionary costs.II.Dr. Jefferson's Disability Income PolicyThis appeal requires that we first scrutinize Dr. Jefferson's disability policy because both his rights and Massachusetts Mutual's obligations are governed by the terms of their contract of insurance. Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Batts, 59 S.W.3d 142, 148 (Tenn.Ct.App.2001).   In this case, the contract of insurance is found in the policy itself “which includes any attached papers and endorsements.” 6  Insurance policies are subject to the same rules and principles that are used to construe other contracts.  American Justice Ins. Reciprocal v. Hutchison, 15 S.W.3d 811, 814 (Tenn.2000);  Williams v. Berube & Assocs., 26 S.W.3d 640, 643 (Tenn.Ct.App.2000).   The courts' role is to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in their written contract of insurance.   Harrell v. Minnesota Mut. Life Ins. Co., 937 S.W.2d 809, 814 (Tenn.1996);  Angus v. Western Heritage Ins. Co., 48 S.W.3d 728, 730 (Tenn.Ct.App.2000).   Accordingly, when the provisions of an insurance policy are clear and unambiguous, our construction of the policy should favor neither party, Brown v. Tennessee Auto. Ins. Co., 192 Tenn. 60, 63, 237 S.W.2d 553, 554 (1951);  Victoria Ins. Co. v. Hawkins, 31 S.W.3d 578, 580 (Tenn.Ct.App.2000), and should avoid artificially narrowing the policy's coverage or extending coverage beyond the policy's intended scope.   Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Batts, 59 S.W.3d at 148. An insurance policy should be construed fairly and reasonably.  Angus v. Western Heritage Ins. Co., 48 S.W.3d at 730-31;  Black v. Aetna Ins. Co., 909 S.W.2d 1, 3 (Tenn.Ct.App.1995).   It should also be construed as a whole, English v. Virginia Sur. Co., 196 Tenn. 426, 430, 268 S.W.2d 338, 340 (1954), and its language should be taken and understood in its plain, ordinary, and popular sense.  American Justice Ins. Reciprocal v. Hutchison, 15 S.W.3d at 814;  Griffin v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co., 18 S.W.3d 195, 200 (Tenn.2000).   When coverage questions arise, the courts should consider the components of an insurance policy in the following order:  (1) the declarations, (2) the insuring agreements and definitions, (3) the exclusions, (4) the conditions, and (5) the endorsements.  Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Chester O'Donley & Assocs., 972 S.W.2d 1, 7 (Tenn.Ct.App.1998).   The insuring agreement defines the outer limits of an insurance policy's coverage.   Thus, if coverage cannot be found in the insuring agreement, it cannot be found elsewhere in the policy.  Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Batts, 59 S.W.3d at 148.The insuring agreement in Dr. Jefferson's disability policy appears under the heading “Income Benefit.”   It states quite succinctly that “[w]e will pay a monthly income for each month that the Insured is disabled beyond the end of the Waiting Period.”   The significant terms in this sentence, “monthly income,” “disabled,” and “waiting period,” are defined elsewhere in the policy.For our purposes, the term most relevant to this appeal is “disabled” because an insured is not entitled to a monthly income payment for any month in which he or she is not disabled.   The term “disability” is defined in the policy's definition section asan incapacity of the Insured which:• Is due to sickness or injury;  and• Begins while this policy is in force;  and• Requires care by or at the direction of a legally qualified physician (this physician must be someone other than the Insured or a member of the Insured's immediate family);  and• Reduces the Insured's ability to work;  and• Causes a Loss of Earned Income, as discussed in this Part.The repeated use of the coordinating conjunction “and” at the conclusion of the separate clauses limiting the scope of the term “incapacity” signals that an incapacity must be consistent with each of the five limitations before it can be considered a disability for the purposes of Dr. Jefferson's policy.   See Sherman v. Reserve Ins. Co., 350 So.2d 349, 352 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1977);  Casteel v. Iowa Dep't of Transp., 395 N.W.2d 896, 898 (Iowa 1986);  see also Black's Law Dictionary 86 (6th ed.1990) (defining “and” as a “conjunction connecting words or phrases expressing the idea that the latter is to be added to or taken along with the first”).The policy further defines several of the key terms found in the clauses limiting the types of incapacity that will render a person disabled.   A disability due to sickness is a “disability which results from, or is contributed to by, illness, disease or bodily or mental infirmity.”   A disability due to injury is a “disability which results from accidental bodily injury to the Insured and which is not contributed to by illness, disease or bodily or mental infirmity.”Not all persons who become ill or who are injured are entitled to disability benefits under Dr. Jefferson's policy.   In light of the policy's definition of “disability,” a person whose ability to work has been reduced because of a sickness or injury is not entitled to monthly income payments unless the sickness or injury has also caused a “Loss of Earned Income.”   The policy defines and explains the computation of the “Loss of Earned Income.”   It is essentially a monthly computation of the difference between (1) the monthly average of the insured's earned income before the sickness or injury 7 and (2) the amount of income the insured actually earns during a particular month following the illness or injury.   However, before an insured is entitled to disability benefits for a particular month, the policy requires that his or her Loss of Earned Income for that month be at least 20% of his or her average pre-disability income.8  In simple terms, an insured is not entitled to a monthly disability payment unless his or her earned income for that month is at least 20% less than his pre-disability average earned income.9 III.Dr. Jefferson's Disability Claim We now turn to Dr. Jefferson's disability claim.   As the person seeking benefits, Dr. Jefferson had the burden of establishing that he had become incapacitated and that he was entitled to benefits under his disability policy.   While the basis for Dr. Jefferson's claim changed over time, the trial court concluded that his “incapacity” beginning on April 29, 1990, was not caused by a disability due to sickness and that this incapacity had not resulted in a Loss of Earned Income.   We agree.A. Dr. Jefferson's disability claim must be analyzed using one of the most basic principles of insurance law.   This principle is that the insured has the burden of demonstrating that a covered loss has occurred.10  Pitman v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, 217 F.3d 1291, 1298 (10th Cir.2000);  Blaine Constr. Corp. v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 171 F.3d 343, 349 (6th Cir.1999) (construing Tennessee law);  Prudential Ins. Co. v. Davis, 18 Tenn.App. 413, 436, 78 S.W.2d 358, 372 (1934) (holding that a person claiming total permanent disability insurance benefits had the burden of proving that his disability was both total and permanent);  see also 20 John A. Appleman & Jean Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice § 11376 (1980).   This rule applies to disability claims.  Heller v. Fortis Benefits Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 487, 494 (D.C.Cir.1998);  Abnathya v. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., 2 F.3d 40, 46 (3d Cir.1993);  Zenk v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 171 F.Supp.2d 929, 933 (D.Minn.2000).   Accordingly, from the outset of his claim, Dr. Jefferson had the burden of establishing that he had been disabled by an incapacity that satisfied his disability policy's five requirements.B.In his “Statement of Claimant” dated October 1, 1990, Dr. Jefferson described the nature of his claimed sickness as “major depression following revocation of license.”   He checked a box on the form indicating that this sickness did not occur at work.   He also identified his sole treating physician was “Wm. Hardin” and stated that Dr. Hardin had treated him, presumably for his “major depression,” from June 12, 1990 to the present.   When asked “How long were or will you be totally disabled,” Dr. Jefferson replied that he had been totally disabled from April 29, 1990 and that he did not know how long his disability would continue.In addition to the information regarding the nature and treatment of his claimed sickness, Dr. Jefferson provided information regarding his earned income on the “Statement of Claimant” form.   He estimated that his earned income for the twelve months immediately preceding the date of his disability, April 29, 1990, had been $150,000 and that his earned income for the highest twenty-four months out of the last five years prior to his disability had been $300,000.   He also stated that he had earned nothing for services rendered or work performed from April 29, 1990 to October 1, 1990.In light of the information Dr. Jefferson supplied to Massachusetts Mutual on October 1, 1990, his disability claim had three essential ingredients.   First, the incapacity that reduced his ability to work was his “major depression following [the] revocation of [his] license.”   Second, that the incapacity for which he was seeking benefits began on April 29, 1990.   Third, that the claimed incapacity has resulted in a 100% loss of earned income after April 29, 1990.The complexion of Dr. Jefferson's disability claim changed somewhat after Massachusetts Mutual pressed him for more information. After receiving Dr. Jefferson's October 1, 1990 claim form, the company requested him to provide additional information, including his 1985 through 1989 federal income tax returns, his work activities after April 29, 1990, his job description, the disciplinary proceedings before the licensing board, and details of the treatment he had been receiving for depression.   Dr. Jefferson provided a great deal of additional information in response to these requests, including his tax returns, materials and transcripts from the disciplinary proceeding, and treatment notes from the professionals whom he had consulted.In his responses, Dr. Jefferson revealed for the first time that Dr. Richard had treated him for depression from May 1989 through May 1991.   He did not explain why he had not listed Dr. Richard on his October 1, 1990 “Statement of Claimant” 11 or why he had stated that his depression had caused his incapacity in April 1990 rather than in May 1989 when he first sought treatment from Dr. Richard.   The essence of the information provided by Dr. Richard was that Dr. Jefferson was suffering from “major depression” when he first sought treatment in May 1989.   Dr. Richard could not identify precisely when this “major depression” had started but believed that it was the result of cumulative stresses at home and at work, including Jane Roe's complaint to the licensing board.   Dr. Richard had also determined that Dr. Jefferson had had dysthymia 12 since childhood or adolescence and that he also had a personality disorder.13 The information Dr. Jefferson provided Massachusetts Mutual demonstrated (1) that he had not missed work from 1987 through April 27, 1990, (2) that he had continued to see patients up until the day that the licensing board revoked his license, and (3) that prior to the administrative hearing he had made appointments to see patients during and after May 1990.   The records of the licensing board's proceedings revealed that Dr. Jefferson had vigorously asserted throughout that he was a competent clinical psychologist, that he should be permitted to continue to see patients, and that the disciplinary proceedings had provided him with whatever rehabilitation he required.Dr. Jefferson's federal income tax returns demonstrated that his gross business income had trended steadily upward during the five years from 1985 to 1989 and that his net business income showed a similar trend.14  His 1990 tax return revealed a precipitous decline in net business income because he was required to close his practice following the revocation of his license in April 1990,15 and his appointment books indicated that he saw fewer patients between January and March 1990 than he had seen between January and March 1989.16  Notwithstanding the decrease in the number of patients he saw during the first four months of 1990, Dr. Jefferson reported gross business earnings of $42,472 in 1990 before his license was revoked.17 C.Dr. Jefferson takes issue with the trial court's conclusion that he had not “demonstrate[d] a loss of income of at least twenty percent (20%)․” First, he argues that it is uncontradicted that he has earned virtually nothing since the revocation of his license in April 1990.   Second, he asserts that his federal income tax returns do not paint an accurate picture of the services he performed each month or of his monthly billings prior to April 1990 because they contained annualized information and because there was a lag time between when he rendered the services and when his patients paid for them.Dr. Jefferson's first point is well-taken.   There can be no reasonable dispute that for every month following April 1990, he has earned at least twenty percent less than his pre-April 1990 average monthly income.   Thus, the trial court's conclusion regarding Dr. Jefferson's loss of income after April 1990 is not supported by the preponderance of the evidence.   Dr. Jefferson's undisputed testimony establishes that he has not practiced psychology since April 1990 and that he has earned relatively modest amounts from a patent on a mechanical checklist device for pilots and from working as an ariel photographer, a landscaper, and in mortgage sales.   It also establishes that he has consistently earned less than eighty percent of his pre-April 1990 average monthly income from these activities.We fail to see the relevance of Dr. Jefferson's second point.   While Dr. Jefferson, like many other professionals, may very well have been paid for his services months after he rendered them, this fact adds little support for his post-April 1990 disability claim.   He has already established that he provided no psychological services after April 29, 1990.   It is, therefore, irrelevant that he would have been paid months later for his services had he provided them.   For our purposes, the relevant facts are (1) that Dr. Jefferson provided no professional services after April 29, 1990, (2) that he earned no income from professional services after that date, and (3) that his earned income in any month following April 29, 1990 has, as far as this record shows, never exceeded eighty percent of his pre-April 1990 average monthly income.This point might conceivably be relevant were Dr. Jefferson seeking disability benefits for some period prior to April 29, 1990.   However, he is not.   His October 1, 1990 “Statement of Claimant” pinpoints the beginning date of his disability as April 29, 1990.   It necessarily follows that if Dr. Jefferson insists that his disability began on April 29, 1990, he could not possibly be seeking disability benefits for any period prior to that date.   Therefore, the circumstances surrounding the payments Dr. Jefferson received for professional services rendered before April 29, 1990 is essentially irrelevant to his claim involving a post-April 1990 disability.D.The fact that Dr. Jefferson's post-April 1990 monthly income has never exceeded eighty percent of his pre-April 1990 average monthly income, does not by itself entitle the doctor to draw disability.   To be entitled to disability benefits under his policy, he must also demonstrate that the decline in his monthly income was caused by an incapacity that was “due to sickness or injury.”   For the purpose of Dr. Jefferson's policy, the term “sickness” includes a “mental infirmity.”The record establishes that Dr. Jefferson has or had at least three mental infirmities-dysthymia, a narcissistic personality disorder, and “major depression.”   Dr. Jefferson's depression is the only one of the three that could possibly support a disability claim because its onset occurred after the effective date of his policy.18  However, Dr. Jefferson's “major depression” will not support his disability claim unless he can also demonstrate (1) that it caused his incapacity to work and (2) that it would have prevented him from practicing as a clinical psychologist even if his license had not been suspended.1.Dr. Jefferson is not the first professional who has sought disability benefits following the revocation or suspension of a professional license.   When called upon to review these claims, the courts have distinguished between persons who are unable to engage in their profession and those who are not allowed to do so.  New York Life Ins. Co. v. Daly, No. 95-6702, 2001 WL 1231736, at *3-4, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16691, at *15-16 (E.D.Pa. Oct. 10, 2001);  BLH ex rel. GEH v. Northwestern Mut. Life Ins.

Apr. 4, 1995).   This distinction is reflected in the courts' differentiation between factual disabilities and legal disabilities.The courts have repeatedly held that disability insurance policies provide coverage for factual disabilities but not for legal disabilities.  Allmerica Fin. Life Ins. Co. v. Llewellyn, 139 F.3d 664, 666 (9th Cir.1997);  Goomar v. Centennial Life Ins. Co., 855 F.Supp. 319, 325 (S.D.Cal.1994);  10 Lee R. Russ & Thomas F. Segalla, Couch on Insurance § 146:9 (3d ed.1998).   They have also noted that disability insurance policies do not insure against a professional's inability to pursue his or her occupation profitably because of a limited patient base or because potential patients or clients are repelled by adverse publicity about his or her conduct.  Grayboyes v. General Am. Life Ins. Co., 1995 WL 156040, at *8, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4233 at *19. A factual disability is an incapacity caused by illness or injury that prevents a person from engaging in his or her occupation.  Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Fleischer, 26 F.Supp.2d 1220, 1223 (C.D.Cal.1998);  Goomar v. Centennial Life Ins. Co., 855 F.Supp. at 325;  Solomon v. Royal Maccabees Life Ins. Co., 243 Mich.App. 375, 622 N.W.2d 101, 104 (2000).   A legal disability includes all circumstances in which the law does not permit a person to engage in his or her profession even though he or she may be physically and mentally able to do so.   The courts have found that a legal disability may be the result of incarceration,19 the revocation or suspension of a professional license,20 surrendering a professional license as part of a plea agreement or to avoid disciplinary action,21 or practice restrictions imposed by a licensing board.22 Frequently, professionals seeking disability benefits have both a legal and a factual disability because of the same condition.   As one court noted, “a blinded bus driver or a drug addicted pilot may [have] lost their licenses for the same condition that renders them totally disabled to drive or fly.”   Grayboyes v. General Am. Life Ins. Co., 1995 WL 156040, at *8, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4233, at *21.   However, a person's legal disability does not necessarily render him or her unable to perform the tasks expected of those engaged in the same profession.   As the same court noted, “[t]hat some morally indignant parents will not enroll their sons in a private school for boys because a teacher with a sexual disease or perversion involving young girls would not render the person afflicted unable to perform the functions of a teacher, at least in a setting limited to males or adults.”  Grayboyes v. General Am. Life Ins. Co., 1995 WL 156040, at *8, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4233, at *22.In cases where the person claiming disability benefits has a concurrent legal disability and factual disability, the courts determine which of the two disabilities occurred first.   If the legal disability preceded the onset of the factual disability, the courts uniformly hold that the claimant is not entitled to disability benefits.   See, e.g., Allmerica Fin. Life Ins. & Annuity Co. v. Llewellyn, 139 F.3d at 666 (chiropractor who claimed that the onset of his depression occurred the day after his license was revoked for fraud);  Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Fleischer, 26 F.Supp.2d at 1224-26 (financial advisor's depression was brought on by his legal difficulties and incarceration);  Brumer v. National Life of Vt., 874 F.Supp. 60, 64 (E.D.N.Y.1995) (podiatrist developed a visual impairment after his license had been suspended).   If, however, the onset of the factual disability preceded the legal disability, the courts have consistently declined to treat the subsequent legal disability as a superseding cause of the person's loss of earned income.  BLH ex rel. GEH v. Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co., 92 F.Supp.2d at 916 n. 2;  Ohio Nat'l Life Assur. Corp. v. Crampton, 822 F.Supp. 1230, 1233 (E.D.Va.1993). The courts consider three factors when a person seeking disability benefits asserts that a factual disability preceded a legal disability.   First, the courts address whether the claimed factual disability is medically bona fide.   Second, if the claimed factual disability is medically bona fide, the courts address whether its onset actually occurred before the legal disability.   Third, if the factual disability is medically bona fide and actually arose before the legal disability, the courts address whether the factual disability actually prevented or hindered the person seeking disability benefits from engaging in his or her profession or occupation. Obviously, claimants who cannot satisfy a trier-of-fact that their claimed medical disability is bona fide should not recover disability benefits.   Claimants who cannot satisfy the trier-of-fact that their medical disability actually occurred before the legal disability should likewise not recover.   Similarly, claimants who cannot satisfy the trier-of-fact that, notwithstanding their legal disability, their medical disability and associated behaviors actually impaired their ability to engage in their profession or occupation should not recover.  Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Millstein, 129 F.3d at 691 (holding that a claimant was entitled to disability benefits only if his prior condition rendered him incapable of performing his occupational duties);  Paul Revere Life Ins. Co. v. Bavaro, 957 F.Supp. 444, 449 (S.D.N.Y.1997) (noting that “[i]f the trier of fact believes that but for ․ [the claimant's] legal disability he would be able to perform his occupation, then he is not entitled to disability payments”);  Ohio Nat'l Life Assurance Corp. v. Crampton, 822 F.Supp. at 1233 (noting that a claimant would be entitled to disability benefits if he would remain unable to work in his currently alleged mental state even if he was placed on probation or his guilty plea was thrown out).   Persons who would still be practicing their profession had their licenses not been suspended or revoked are not entitled to disability benefits.  Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Ouellette, 617 A.2d at 134.The cases addressing the nature and extent of a factual disability's effect on a claimant's ability to pursue his or her occupation or profession are not uniform because of differences in the various disability policies' provisions.   Policies that condition the payment of benefits on total disability require that a disability have a greater effect on a person's ability to practice than policies that do not.   Thus, an emergency room physician whose substance abuse prevented him from working in emergency rooms would be considered totally disabled.  Royal Maccabees Life Ins. Co. v. Parker, 2001 WL 1110489, at *7-8, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20595, at 23-24.   With regard to polices that do not condition the right to benefits on total disability, the courts have required claimants to prove a demonstrable qualitative or quantitative drop 23 in performance prior to the onset of the legal disability.  Damascus v. Provident Life & Acc. Ins. Co., No. 96-16503, 168 F.3d 498, 1999 U.S.App. LEXIS 1234, at *9 (9th Cir. Jan.27, 1999).   The courts will not find a professional to be disabled if the nature and schedule of his or her practice remained essentially unaffected following the onset of the claimed disability.  Goomar v. Centennial Life Ins. Co., 76 F.3d 1059, 1062 (9th Cir.1996) (recounting coworkers' testimony that a physician claiming a mental disability had continued to maintain a normal work schedule);  Zenk v. Paul Revere Ins. Co., 171 F.Supp.2d at 934 (denying a chemically dependent physician's disability claim because the nature and schedule of his practice had remained unchanged).2. Massachusetts Mutual was not required to pay Dr. Jefferson disability benefits until he proved that a mental infirmity arising after he obtained his policy had reduced his ability to work before the licensing board revoked his license.   Because Massachusetts Mutual's policy does not distinguish among the types of mental impairment that could trigger a disability, the type of mental impairment Dr. Jefferson had or has is irrelevant, as long as it is medically bona fide.  Stern v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 744 So.2d 1084, 1087 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999) (declining to “place a judicially imposed value judgment on what type of psychiatric sickness is worthy of consideration as a disability over another type”).   However, Dr. Jefferson was obliged to demonstrate that his mental infirmity, whatever it may be, actually hindered his ability to practice psychology. Depression qualifies as a mental infirmity under Dr. Jefferson's disability policy.   There are, however, different levels of depression, and not all levels of depression impair a person's ability to practice his or her profession.   While Dr. Jefferson demonstrated that he was, to some degree, depressed as early as May 1989, he was not entitled to disability benefits until he demonstrated that his depression became so severe that it reduced his ability to work.   This is precisely where his case falls short.Initially, Dr. Jefferson pinpointed April 29, 1990 as the day on which his depression became so severe that it disabled him from practicing as a clinical psychologist.   This date was two days after the licensing board had decided to revoke his license.   Both Dr. Jefferson's physician and the psychiatrist retained by Massachusetts Mutual to review Dr. Jefferson's claim agreed that the loss of a professional license could trigger a disabling depression.   Dr. Hardin stated that Dr. Jefferson was neither mentally nor physically capable of practicing psychology immediately after the revocation of his license.   Dr. Kenner agreed that the loss of Dr. Jefferson's license “must have been a significant blow to his over-inflated ego.”Dr. Jefferson, however, shifted the onset of his depression sometime after he submitted his disability claim.   He may very well have realized that post-license revocation depression would most likely not warrant the payment of disability benefits.   Instead of claiming that his disability was caused by a depression triggered by the loss of his license, he asserted that the onset of his disabling depression occurred at least three years before be lost his license and that he had, in fact, been “very impaired” since 1987.   These assertions have two significant shortcomings.   First, Dr. Jefferson's treating professionals declined to state categorically that his depression, whenever its onset, had rendered him incapable of practicing psychology prior to May 1990.   Second, Dr. Jefferson proved by his own conduct that his depression had not prevented him from continuing to practice psychology until the day the licensing board revoked his license.Dr. Richard, the clinical psychologist who treated Dr. Jefferson from May 1989 to May 1991, stated that he had diagnosed Dr. Jefferson with a major depression.   While he could not determine precisely when this depression began, he stated that its onset was before May 1989 and that it was the result of the cumulative effects of various stresses in Dr. Jefferson's life, including the regulatory threat to his license.   Dr. Richard agreed that psychologists can continue to function with stresses similar to those experienced by Dr. Jefferson but added that they do not function well.   Based on the information provided by Dr. Jefferson,24 Dr. Richard determined that Dr. Jefferson had become “somewhat dysfunctional in his professional life, as well as his home life and personal life.”   He concluded that Dr. Jefferson's “function would begin to fall off” whenever he “felt that the stress level was supremely high.”   While Dr. Richard stated on several occasions that Dr. Jefferson's depression “contributed to him making poor decisions and judgments,” he never stated that depression prevented Dr. Jefferson from practicing psychology.   In fact, despite diagnosing Dr. Jefferson with a major depression and personality disorder, Dr. Richard insisted that Dr. Jefferson was “a very compassionate person who cares about people” and also stated “I don't know that he's not a good therapist.”Dr. Hardin was the only physician who treated Dr. Jefferson for depression.   He began treating Dr. Jefferson in June 1990 and stated unequivocally that Dr. Jefferson was mentally and physically incapable of practicing psychology after he lost his license in April 1990.   However, Dr. Hardin was far less certain about Dr. Jefferson's circumstances prior to the loss of his license.   He conceded that he lacked personal knowledge regarding Dr. Jefferson's ability to discharge the duties and responsibilities of a clinical psychologist from 1987 through early 1990.   While he surmised that Dr. Jefferson was “probably” not capable of practicing psychology prior to June 1990, he admitted that he could not “judge” whether Dr. Jefferson's depression actually affected his work.Dr. Kenner, the psychiatrist retained by Massachusetts Mutual to evaluate Dr. Jefferson's disability claim, stated that Dr. Jefferson was depressed prior to April 1990 but that he was not so depressed that he was unable to work.   He concluded that the loss of his license was a “significant blow” to Dr. Jefferson and that Dr. Jefferson did not have a major depressive disorder until he lost his license.   Dr. Kenner opined that Dr. Jefferson's long-standing personality disorder, not his depression, was the root cause of the conduct that had precipitated the disciplinary proceedings against him.   And, like Dr. Richard, Dr. Kenner concluded that none of Dr. Jefferson's mental infirmities were compulsive disorders.The evidence regarding the nature of Dr. Jefferson's practice, most of which Dr. Jefferson himself provided, undermines his claim that a major depression had already impaired his ability to practice psychology by the time the licensing board revoked his license in April 1990.   Dr. Jefferson testified that he had been actively practicing psychology since 1977.   His annual billings and gross income had increased steadily every year, even after 1987, the year in which Dr. Jefferson claimed that his “major depression” had rendered him “very impaired.”   By all accounts, the nature of Dr. Jefferson's practice remained essentially unchanged until early 1990.Dr. Jefferson conceded that he would have continued to practice psychology had the licensing board not revoked his license in April 1990.   He insisted throughout the administrative and judicial proceedings involving his license that he was not impaired and that he had done nothing unethical enough to justify revoking his license. He continued to see patients until the very day his license was revoked and had even been setting appointments during the month following the anticipated licensing board's hearing.   Dr. Jefferson also acknowledged that he would have continued to see patients had the Board decided not to revoke his license.The timing and circumstances of Dr. Jefferson's treatment for depression likewise undermine his claim that it significantly affected his ability to practice psychology.   Despite his assertion that he had been suffering with a major depression since 1987, he did not seek another psychologist's assistance until May 1989, shortly after Jane Roe filed her complaint against him with the licensing board.   When he did consult another clinical psychologist, he chose one who lacked experience or expertise in treating psychologists or other professionals accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with clients or former clients.   Similarly, Dr. Jefferson did not seek a physician's assistance for his depression until June 1990, three years after its claimed onset but a little more than one month after the licensing board revoked his license.   Dr. Jefferson's expressed purpose for seeking his physician's assistance, according to the physician's treatment notes, was to discuss “going on disability because of depression.”Dr. Jefferson concedes, as he must, that he would not have stopped practicing psychology had the license board not forced him to.   However, he asserts that he successfully demonstrated that his pre-April 1990 depression had impaired his ability to practice.   In this regard, he points to the evidence (1) that he was in denial about his problems prior to April 1990, (2) that the number of patients he was seeking declined markedly beginning in January 1990, and (3) that the quality of his work had declined.   We have determined that each of these facts, even if true, do not necessarily prove that Dr. Jefferson was unable to function as a clinical psychologist prior to the revocation of his license.Dr. Jefferson insisted throughout the proceedings before the licensing board that he was “a highly qualified and competent psychologist.”   However, to bolster his disability claim, he downplays these assertions by insisting that he was in denial prior to April 1990 and that he began to overcome this denial only after the licensing board revoked his license.   While Drs. Harding and Richard corroborated Dr. Jefferson's claim that he had been in denial, much of the force of the denial argument is undercut by the fact that Dr. Jefferson never conceded to the licensing board that he had been impaired in any way and never acted as if he had become more self-aware after the revocation of his license.   Ten months after losing his license, Dr. Jefferson personally proclaimed to the licensing board, “I am so rehabilitated that it is almost beyond description.”   Throughout the lengthy judicial proceedings to review the licensing board's decision that lasted until December 1997, Dr. Jefferson never departed from his insistence that he was fully competent to practice psychology.   The force of the denial argument is also undercut by the concessions of Drs. Hardin and Richard that psychologists with depression are not necessarily incapable of practicing psychology.Dr. Jefferson also relies on his testimony that he saw far fewer patients during the first three months of 1990 than he did during the same period in 1989.   Even if this evidence is true, it does not necessarily establish that Dr. Jefferson treated fewer patients in 1990 because he was unable to treat more.   The decline in his patient base could very well have been caused by other external factors not related to his ability to practice psychology such as increased competition from other psychologists or the spreading awareness in the community where he practiced of his disciplinary problems with the licensing board.The decline in the number of Dr. Jefferson's patients could also have been caused by concerns on the part of referring physicians about the efficacy of his therapy.   The record contains anecdotal evidence that Dr. Jefferson may have been inappropriately impatient, distracted, or preoccupied during several therapy sessions with several of his patients.   However, Dr. Jefferson never conceded that his treatment of any patient was improper, and there is no evidence that his impatience, distraction, or preoccupation prevented him from competently treating his patients.   Disability insurance policies are not malpractice policies and do not insure against the risk that an otherwise competent professional might render service in a particular case that falls below the prevailing standard of care.   Competency is not inexorably linked with capacity.   Accordingly, the anecdotal evidence of isolated therapeutic lapses does not establish that Dr. Jefferson's ability to render acceptable psychological services was impaired prior to the revocation of his license.We have in this case, not an appeal from a summary judgment, but an appeal from a trial court's considered decision following a bench trial.   The trial court heard all the testimony, reviewed the exhibits, and assessed the credibility of the witnesses called both by Dr. Jefferson and by Massachusetts Mutual.   After weighing all the evidence, the trial court concluded that Dr. Jefferson had failed to demonstrate that his depression had actually impaired his ability to practice psychology before the licensing board revoked his license in April 1990.   The evidence, as we see it, supports this conclusion.   Accordingly, the record demonstrates that Dr. Jefferson's post-April 1990 loss of income was not due to his depression, but rather to the loss of his license.   Because the loss of his license was a legal disability not covered by his disability insurance policy, Dr. Jefferson is not entitled to disability benefits.IV.Massachusetts Mutual's Claim for Discretionary CostsMassachusetts Mutual takes issue with the trial court's denial of its motion for $21,680.15 in discretionary costs.   It asserts that the trial court erred because it had prevailed in the declaratory judgment action it was required to file to address Dr. Jefferson's claim.   We have determined that the trial court erred by declining to grant $2,514.40 in covered discretionary costs that appear to be necessary and reasonable.A.Following the entry of the judgment declaring that Dr. Jefferson was not entitled to disability payments, Massachusetts Mutual moved to assess $21,680.15 in discretionary costs against Dr. Jefferson under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2).   Massachusetts Mutual itemized these costs in an affidavit attached to its motion.   These costs included:  (1) $1,889.40 for court reporter fees, (2) $15,606.50 for Dr. Kenner's fees, (3) $350.00 representing Dr. Hardin's fee to attend his deposition, (4) $275.00 for Dr. Richard's court appearance, (5) $175 for Dr. Bill Phofl, (6) $2,030.00 for the services of Dr. Prudence L. Orr, (7) $1,005.00 for the services of Dr. C. Dawne Kimbrell, (8) $15.25 for copying and for court documents, and (9) $334.00 for Dr. Orr's airfare.Dr. Jefferson responded that the requested costs should be disallowed because their amount was “exorbitant” and “outrageously unreasonable.”   He insisted that Dr. Kenner's fee was “ridiculous” and that it should be disallowed because Dr. Kenner “only testified at trial and he never evaluated the defendant, neither was his deposition taken,” and because the trial court had not accepted Dr. Kenner's testimony.   In more general terms, he argued that Massachusetts Mutual was not entitled to costs under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) because it had initiated the suit and because “in view of defendant losing his license to practice psychology, the requiring of him to pay this amount will work an undue financial burden on him, in that, he is earning his income from mowing lawns.”B.The courts exist in our society to resolve disputes that the parties themselves cannot resolve.   While the courts strive to secure a just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every dispute brought before them, it is an inescapable modern reality that obtaining a judicial resolution of a dispute can be costly and time-consuming.   All too frequently, the parties who prevail in litigation are not made whole because their litigation expenses erode the economic value of their recovery. Many judicial systems have allocated the increasing costs of litigation by embracing the principle of loser pays all.   American courts, however, have continued to require, as a general matter, each party to be responsible for its own litigation expenses.   Thus, the American Rule requires litigants to pay their own attorney's fees in the absence of a statute or contractual provision otherwise.  State v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 18 S.W.3d 186, 194 (Tenn.2000);  John Kohl & Co. v. Dearborn & Ewing, 977 S.W.2d 528, 534 (Tenn.1998).   Litigants are also required to underwrite the costs of preparing for trial.   Traditionally, the only litigation-related costs that a losing party was expected to pay were the statutory costs taxed by the trial court clerk.  Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(1).Tennessee's courts have recognized several modest exceptions to the traditional rules governing the allocation of litigation expenses.   These exceptions stem from a desire to make the prevailing party whole.  Scholz v. S.B. Int'l, Inc., 40 S.W.3d 78, 85 (Tenn.Ct.App.2000).   Thus, even in the absence of a statute or contract, we have recognized that losing defendants in slander of title actions should be required to pay the prevailing plaintiff's legal expenses.  Ezell v. Graves, 807 S.W.2d 700, 702-03 (Tenn.Ct.App.1990).   For similar reasons, the Tennessee Supreme Court has promulgated Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) that permits the courts to require losing parties to pay certain other litigation expenses incurred by the prevailing party.The passage of time has obscured Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2)'s history.   It was first promulgated by the Tennessee Supreme Court on January 23, 1986, and was intended to complement legislation that had been introduced in the Tennessee General Assembly amending Tenn.Code Ann. § 20-12-119 to permit the courts to tax certain litigation expenses as costs.25  The legislation specifically empowered the court to tax as costs (1) court reporter expenses for depositions and trial, the cost of transcripts, the fees of court-appointed experts, interpreter's fees, and the costs of charts and photographs. 4 Nancy F. MacLean & Bradley A. MacLean, Rules of Civil Procedure Annotated § 54.8, at 312 (2d ed.1989).Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2)'s companion legislation stalled soon after it was referred to the Senate and House Judicial Committees.   On March 18, 1986, faced with the certainty that the General Assembly could not enact the proposed amendments to Tenn.Code Ann. § 20-12-119, the Tennessee Supreme Court submitted a revised version of Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) that omitted any reference to the amendment to Tenn.Code Ann. § 20-12-119 that was then foundering in the legislature.   Ultimately, the General Assembly approved the revised version of Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2), even though it never enacted its companion legislation.26  Thus, as of August 1, 1986, Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) read as follows:A party who desires to recover discretionary costs or any recoverable costs not included in the bill of costs prepared by the clerk of the trial court shall move the court to assess discretionary costs and attach thereto an itemized and verified bill of costs.   The affidavit shall be made by the party or his duly authorized attorney or agent having knowledge of the facts, certifying that such items of costs are accurate and were reasonable and necessary to preparation and trial of the case and that the services for which such fees have been charged were actually performed.   The motion shall be filed as a post-trial motion pursuant to Rule 59.01.27 The watershed event that shaped the current understanding of Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) was Lock v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 809 S.W.2d 483 (Tenn.1991).   In that case, the Tennessee Supreme Court approved the trial court's use of Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) to award a prevailing plaintiff (1) the court reporter's appearance fees for the depositions and trial, (2) the court reporter's transcription costs, and (3) the fees charged by the expert witnesses for appearance at their depositions.  Lock v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 809 S.W.2d at 489 n. 3. Noting that the case was its first opportunity to construe Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2), the court explained that “[i]t was our intent that reasonable and necessary costs, in the preparation and trial of a case, could be assessed as discretionary costs by the trial court.”  Lock v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 809 S.W.2d at 490.In 1993, following the Lock decision, the Tennessee Supreme Court amended Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) to more precisely define the types of costs that could be recovered and to require that motions seeking these costs must be filed and served within thirty days after entry of the judgment.  Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54, adv. comm'n cmt. to 1993 amend.   Following other amendments in 1995 and 2001, Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) now provides, in part:Costs not included in the bill of costs prepared by the clerk are allowable only in the court's discretion.   Discretionary costs allowable are:  reasonable and necessary court reporter expenses for depositions or trials, reasonable and necessary expert witness fees for depositions or trials, reasonable and necessary interpreter fees for depositions or trials, and guardian ad litem fees;  travel expenses are not allowable discretionary costs. Awarding costs in accordance with Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2), like awarding other costs, is within the trial court's reasonable discretion.   Perdue v. Green Branch Mining Co., 837 S.W.2d 56, 60 (Tenn.1992).   Accordingly, we employ a deferential standard when reviewing a trial court's decision either to grant or to deny motions to assess these costs.  Scholz v. S.B. Int'l, Inc., 40 S.W.3d at 84.   Because these decisions are discretionary, we are generally disinclined to second-guess a trial court's decision unless the trial court has abused its discretion.  Woodlawn Mem'l Park, Inc. v. Keith, 70 S.W.3d 691, 698 (Tenn.2002);  Stalsworth v. Grummons, 36 S.W.3d 832, 836 (Tenn.Ct.App.2000);  Mitchell v. Smith, 779 S.W.2d 384, 392 (Tenn.Ct.App.1989). The “abuse of discretion” standard of review calls for less intense appellate review and, therefore, less likelihood that the trial court's decision will be reversed.  State ex rel. Jones v. Looper, 86 S.W.3d 189, 193 (Tenn.Ct.App.2000);  White v. Vanderbilt Univ., 21 S.W.3d 215, 222-23 (Tenn.Ct.App.1999).   Appellate courts do not have the latitude to substitute their discretion for that of the trial court.  Myint v. Allstate Ins. Co., 970 S.W.2d 920, 927 (Tenn.1998);  State ex rel. Vaughn v. Kaatrude, 21 S.W.3d 244, 248 (Tenn.Ct.App.2000).   Thus, a trial court's discretionary decision will be upheld as long as it is not clearly unreasonable, Bogan v. Bogan, 60 S.W.3d 721, 733 (Tenn.2001), and reasonable minds can disagree about its correctness.  Eldridge v. Eldridge, 42 S.W.3d 82, 85 (Tenn.2001);  State v. Scott, 33 S.W.3d 746, 752 (Tenn.2000).   Discretionary decisions must, however, take the applicable law and the relevant facts into account.  Ballard v. Herzke, 924 S.W.2d 652, 661 (Tenn.1996).   Accordingly, a trial court has “abused its discretion” when it applies an incorrect legal standard, reaches a decision that is illogical, bases its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or employs reasoning that causes an injustice to the complaining party.  Woodlawn Mem'l Park, Inc. v. Keith, 70 S.W.3d at 698;  Clinard v. Blackwood, 46 S.W.3d 177, 182 (Tenn.2001);  Wilder v. Wilder, 66 S.W.3d 892, 895 (Tenn.Ct.App.2001);  Robinson v. Clement, 65 S.W.3d 632, 635 (Tenn.Ct.App.2001). Parties are not entitled to costs under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) simply because they prevail at trial.  Sanders v. Gray, 989 S.W.2d 343, 345 (Tenn.Ct.App.1998).   The particular equities of the case may influence a trial court's decision about these costs.  Perdue v. Green Branch Mining Co., 837 S.W.2d at 60;  Stalsworth v. Grummons, 36 S.W.3d at 835.   However, the courts should, as a general matter, award discretionary costs to a prevailing party if the costs are reasonable and necessary and if the prevailing party has filed a timely and properly supported motion.  Scholz v. S.B. Int'l, Inc., 40 S.W.3d at 84. A nonspecific antipathy toward awarding discretionary costs under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) appears to continue in some quarters of Tennessee's judiciary.   It is not an easy undertaking to reconcile cases upholding the denial of discretionary costs with other cases affirming the award of similar costs based on essentially similar facts.   Even though the decisions regarding these costs are “discretionary,” a trial court's decision should be guided by the language of Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) itself and the policies that led to the rule's enactment.  Stalsworth v. Grummons, 36 S.W.3d at 835.   Thus, when deciding whether to award discretionary costs under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2), the courts should (1) determine whether the party requesting the costs is the “prevailing party,” 28 (2) limit awards to the costs specifically identified in the rule, (3) determine whether the requested costs are necessary and reasonable,29 and (4) determine whether the prevailing party has engaged in conduct during the litigation that warrants depriving it of the discretionary costs to which it might otherwise be entitled.30  The courts should not, however, base their decisions to award costs under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) on (1) a desire to punish the losing party,31 (2) whether the prevailing party is the plaintiff or defendant,32 or (3) the weight given to a particular witness's testimony.33  The party seeking to recover its costs under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) has the burden of demonstrating that it is entitled to recover these costs.  Stalsworth v. Grummons, 36 S.W.3d at 835.   As a general matter, a party seeking these costs must file a timely motion and must support this motion with an affidavit detailing these costs, verifying that they are accurate and that they have actually been charged, and that they are necessary and reasonable.   Once a party seeking costs under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) has filed its motion, the non-moving party may present evidence and argument challenging the requested costs.   The party who takes issue on appeal with a trial court's decision regarding discretionary costs has the burden of showing how the trial court abused its discretion.  Sanders v. Gray, 989 S.W.2d at 345. Proceedings involving discretionary costs, like proceedings involving requested attorney's fees, are frequently decided on affidavits and argument of counsel in light of the entire record.   Parties rarely seek contested hearings on requests for discretionary costs and, thus, do not commonly present evidence beyond their competing affidavits.   Thus, fully developed records of contested proceedings involving costs under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) are rare and are certainly not required to enable the trial court, or an appellate court for that matter, to review a claim for discretionary costs.   In cases where the issue of discretionary costs has been decided on affidavits and the record of the entire proceeding without the presentation of new evidence specifically pertaining to the disputed costs themselves, the trial court's decision can effectively be reviewed without a transcript of the hearing on the Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) motion.   Accordingly, parties challenging a trial court's decision regarding discretionary costs are not necessarily required to submit a transcript of the hearing on discretionary costs in order to raise the issue on appeal.34 C.The trial court's order denying Massachusetts Mutual's motion for discretionary costs does not state that the court heard additional evidence regarding discretionary costs at its January 9, 1998 hearing.   It states simply that the motion was decided on the “entire record,” the “[m]otion to [a]ssess [d]iscretionary [c]osts and supporting pleadings of ․ Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company,” the “statement of counsel,” and the “filings in support of or in opposition to the pending post-judgment [m]otions.”   This recitation leaves no room for reasonable doubt that the parties did not present additional evidence regarding Massachusetts Mutual's request for discretionary costs at the January 9, 1998 hearing.   Accordingly, having a transcript of this hearing is not necessary to enable us to effectively review the trial court's decision to deny discretionary costs in this case. Massachusetts Mutual is clearly the prevailing party in this case. It convinced the trial court to declare that it was not contractually obligated to pay Dr. Jefferson disability benefits.   It also convinced the trial court to dismiss Dr. Jefferson's counterclaim.   The company also filed a timely and properly supported motion seeking discretionary costs.   Likewise, the voluminous record contains no evidence that the company engaged in the sort of conduct during the litigation that would disentitle it to recover its costs.   Thus, based on the record as a whole, we have concluded that Massachusetts Mutual is entitled to recover its expenses that qualify as discretionary costs and that these expenses are necessary and reasonable.Based on its affidavit, Massachusetts Mutual is entitled to $1,889.40 for its court reporter fees, $350.00 for Dr. Hardin's fee to appear at his discovery deposition, and $275.00 for Dr. Richard's fee for appearing at trial.   By the same token, Massachusetts Mutual clearly is not entitled to $334.00 for Dr. Orr's travel expenses because Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) explicitly excludes them.   The company is likewise not entitled to the claimed $15.25 in document expenses because they are not among the types of expenses listed in Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) that qualify as discretionary costs.   Thus, the only remaining disputed costs are the $18,816.50 in expert witness fees claimed by Massachusetts Mutual, including Dr. Kenner's $15,606.50 fee. Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04(2) limits the types of expenses related to expert witnesses that can be recovered as discretionary costs.   Only “reasonable and necessary expert witness fees for depositions and trial” are recoverable.   Thus, prevailing parties cannot recover expert witness fees for preparing for depositions or trial, no matter how reasonable and necessary these fees are.  Miles v. Marshall C. Voss Health Care Ctr., 896 S.W.2d 773, 776 (Tenn.1995) (permitting the recovery of a vocational expert's witness fee but not the fee charged to examine the plaintiff);  Crawford v. Dodson, No. W1998-00805-COA-R3-CV, 2000 WL 1286368, at *6 (Tenn.Ct.App. Aug.28, 2000) (No Tenn. R.App. P. 11 application filed);  Shahrdar v. Global Hous., Inc., 983 S.W.2d at 239-40.   Likewise, they cannot recover the fees of professionals who testify as fact witnesses rather than as experts, Parks v. Royal Ins. Co., No. W2000-02778-WC-R3-CV, 2001 WL 1584107, at *3 (Tenn. Sp. Worker's Comp. Panel Dec. 4, 2001), or for appearances at depositions for proof when the expert also testifies at trial.  Seals v. England/Corsair Upholstery Mfg. Co., 984 S.W.2d 912, 917 (Tenn.1999).   Prevailing parties may, however, be able to recover the stand-by fees charged by expert witnesses who were required to be on call but who were not called because of some act attributable to the non-prevailing party.  Stalsworth v. Grummons, 36 S.W.3d at 836.The record contains little information regarding the nature of the services provided by Drs. Kenner, Kimbrell, Orr, and Pfohl other than the dates on which the services were rendered and the fees charged for the services.   The affidavit supporting Massachusetts Mutual's motion to assess discretionary costs does not explain the nature or purposes of these services.   Other parts of the record, including Dr. Jefferson's response to Massachusetts Mutual's motion, establish that Dr. Kenner was not deposed but that he testified at trial on November 15, 1996;  that Dr. Pfohl was never deposed and did not testify at trial;  and that neither Dr. Orr nor Dr. Kimbrell testified at trial even though one of them was apparently deposed. Massachusetts Mutual, as the party seeking discretionary costs, had the burden of demonstrating that it should be reimbursed for the costs associated with its experts.   In light of the nature of Dr. Jefferson's disability claim, it was certainly appropriate for Massachusetts Mutual to decide to present expert testimony regarding Dr. Jefferson's mental infirmities and their effect on his ability to practice psychology.   However, Massachusetts Mutual was still obliged to demonstrate that the claimed fees for these experts were necessary and reasonable and were limited to fees charged for appearing at a deposition or trial. The record contains only sketchy information regarding Drs. Kimbrell, Orr, and Pfohl.   It provides no factual basis for concluding that their services, whatever they may have been, were necessary and reasonable rather than duplicative of Dr. Kenner's services.   It also provides no basis for determining that their claimed fees were limited to fees charged for appearing at trial or at a deposition.   Accordingly, Massachusetts Mutual has not demonstrated that it is entitled to reimbursement for the expenses associated with these three experts. Dr. Kenner testified at trial.   Despite the trial court's opinion regarding the value of his testimony, presenting expert evidence regarding Dr. Jefferson's mental infirmities and their effect on his ability to practice psychology was necessary and reasonable.   However, Massachusetts Mutual is not entitled to recover any of Dr. Kenner's fees as discretionary costs for two reasons.   First, much of his fee plainly involved non-recoverable trial preparation services.   Second, the affidavit supporting the motion to assess discretionary costs does not identify which of Dr. Kenner's many fees represented his fee for attending the trial.   Accordingly, Massachusetts Mutual has failed to demonstrate that it is entitled to reimbursement for any portion of Dr. Kenner's fees.V.We affirm the trial court's conclusion that Dr. Jefferson has failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to benefits under Massachusetts Mutual's disability policy.   We vacate the order denying Massachusetts Mutual's motion to assess discretionary costs and remand the case to the trial court with directions to enter an order awarding Massachusetts Mutual a judgment for discretionary costs in the amount of $2,514.40.   We tax the costs of this appeal to David A. Jefferson and his surety for which execution, if necessary, may issue.FOOTNOTES1.   Ms. Roe's identity is not relevant to the issues in this case.2.   This liaison was apparently not Dr. Jefferson's first sexual relationship with a patient.  Roe v. Jefferson, 875 S.W.2d 653, 654 (Tenn.1994) (noting that Dr. Jefferson told Ms. Roe in early 1988 that he was being investigated for potential ethical violations stemming from an affair with a former patient in 1979).   The Board of Examiners of Psychology eventually directed Dr. Jefferson to conduct research and write four papers addressing intimate relationships with former patients.   Dr. Jefferson later confided to another clinical psychologist that he had had affairs with four former patients.3.   Ms. Roe also filed a medical malpractice case against Dr. Jefferson on February 23, 1990, which was subsequently dismissed as untimely.  Roe v. Jefferson, 875 S.W.2d 653 (Tenn.1994).4.   Dr. Jefferson later identified these “stressors” as (1) his marital problems, (2) his difficulties with a daughter over a boyfriend, (3) the stress of dealing with patients, (4) his long-standing difficulties with his father, (5) his extramarital affairs, and (6) the threat of disciplinary proceedings.5.   Jefferson v. Board of Examiners in Psychology, No. 91-1076-II (Davidson Ch. December 4, 1997).   Apparently, the licensing board did not appeal the chancery court's decision.6.   The policy itself recites that “[t]his policy is a legal contract between the Owner and us.   The entire contract consists of the policy, which includes any attached papers and endorsements.”   Accordingly, the trial court correctly determined that the promotional materials Dr. Jefferson received from Massachusetts Mutual prior to applying for insurance were not part of the insurance contract.7.   For the purposes of establishing the monthly average of an insured's income before the disability began, the policy selects the higher of (1) the average of the insured's income for the twelve months before the disability began or (2) the average of the insured's highest income for any consecutive 24 month period during the five years before the disability began.8.   Dr. Jefferson's policy provides that a reduction in earned income will not qualify as a “Loss of Earned Income” unless it is at least 25% of the insured's average pre-disability income.   However, sometime after the policy was issued, Massachusetts Mutual liberalized this condition by decreasing the 25% threshold to 20%.9.   The policy contains the following example explaining this computation:The monthly average of your Earned Income before you became disabled was $1,000.   Now, your disability prevents you from earning that amount.   For any month that you can earn $400, your Loss of Earned Income is $600, or 60%.   For any month that you can earn $800, your loss is less than 25% and there is no Loss of Earned Income for the purpose of this policy.   For any month that you can earn only $200, your loss exceeds 75% and the Loss of Earned Income is considered to be 100%.  [Italics in the policy]After Massachusetts Mutual's liberalization of the minimum Loss of Earned Income requirement from 25% to 20%, the $200 loss of earned income in this example would, in fact, qualify as a Loss of Earned Income because it amounts to at least 20% of the insured's average pre-disability income.10.   Two corollaries to this principle are (1) that an insurance company has the burden of proving that an exclusion in its policy applies to a claim, Interstate Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Gammons, 56 Tenn.App. 441, 446, 408 S.W.2d 397, 399 (1966), and (2) that once an insurance company demonstrates that an exclusion applies, the burden shifts to the insured to demonstrate that its claim fits within an exception to the exclusion.  Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Chester O'Donley & Assocs., 972 S.W.2d at 8.11.   Perhaps, Dr. Jefferson did not identify Dr. Richard on the October 1, 1990 form because it asked only for a list of “Treating Physicians.”   Dr. Richard was a clinical psychologist, not a physician.   In common parlance, a physician is a person who possesses a medical degree.   This common understanding generally comports with the word's technical meaning.   For licensing purposes, a “physician” is a person who is licensed pursuant to either Chapter 6 or Chapter 9 of Title 63 of the Tennessee Code. Tenn.Code Ann. § 63-6-204(d)(7)(F) (Supp.2001).   Chapters 6 and 9 apply to persons with a medical degree or a degree from a school of osteopathic medicine.   Psychologists are not licensed under Chapters 6 or 9 but rather under Chapter 11.12.   Dr. Richard described dysthymia as a “low grade of depression” that does not necessarily interfere with a person's functioning.   In his words, persons with dysthymia “keep going but they are not actualizing their potential or having a lot of fun in life.”   He also stated that Dr. Jefferson's dysthymia had probably begun in childhood or adolescence.   Clearly, Dr. Jefferson's dysthymia did not bring about an incapacity under his disability policy because (1) it began before the policy was in force, (2) it had not reduced his ability to work, and (3) it had not caused a “Loss of Earned Income.”13.   While Dr. Richard declined to specifically characterize Dr. Jefferson's personality disorder, he determined that Dr. Jefferson had a “sexual addiction.”   Dr. William Kenner classified Dr. Jefferson's condition as a “narcissistic personality disorder” that caused Dr. Jefferson to lack “the moral courage to tell himself no when it comes to having sex with patients.”   Both Drs. Richards and Kenner stated that Dr. Jefferson's personality disorder had been in place since childhood or adolescence.   Accordingly, like his dysthymia, Dr. Jefferson's personality disorder was not a “mental infirmity” that caused an incapacity under his disability policy because (1) it began before the policy was in force and (2) it had not reduced his ability to work.14.   Dr. Jefferson's net income in 1989 fell below the previous year primarily as a result of a $12,105 deduction for legal fees and professional services stemming from the disciplinary proceeding before the licensing board.15.   His net business income in 1990 was $8,666 as compared to $77,414 in 1989.16.   Dr. Jefferson claimed that he saw 25% fewer patients in January 1990 than he had seen in January 1989, 29% fewer patients in February 1990 than in February 1989, and approximately 50% fewer patients in March 1990 than in March 1989.17.   Had Dr. Jefferson's license not been revoked or suspended in April 1990, his estimated annual gross earnings for 1990 were $127,416 [$42,472 x 3 = $127,416].   These estimated earnings are approximately 86% of his gross business earnings for 1989.   Dr. Jefferson offered no clear explanation concerning how an average 35% decline in patients could have resulted in only a 14% decline in revenue.   One possible explanation is that Dr. Jefferson had increased his rates.18.   By all accounts, Dr. Jefferson's dysthymia and narcissistic personality disorder existed long before the effective date of the policy.19.   See, e.g., Nashville Trust Co. v.

Crye Leike Realtors, No. M1999-00071-COA-R3-CV, 2001 WL 747638, at *12 (Tenn.Ct.App. July 5, 2001), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Dec. 10, 2001).29.   Stalsworth v. Grummons, 36 S.W.3d at 835.30.   Scholz v. S.B. Int'l, Inc., 40 S.W.3d at 85.31.   Scholz v. S.B. Int'l, Inc., 40 S.W.3d at 85.32.   Woodlawn Mem'l Park, Inc. v. Keith, 70 S.W.3d at 698 (holding that “[n]on-prevailing party defendants are not relieved from paying discretionary costs merely because a plaintiff has obliged them to appear in court”).33.   In one unreported opinion, a panel of this court disallowed expert witness fees solely because the trial court commented that the testimony of the witness had not been helpful to the court.  McCracken v. City of Millington, No. 02A01-9707-CV-00165, 1999 WL 142391, at *13 (Tenn.Ct.App. Mar.17, 1999) (No Tenn. R.App. P. 11 application filed).   We decline to follow this approach because the test is not the weight given to a particular witness's testimony but rather the reasonableness and necessity of expert proof regarding the subject matter.  Stalsworth v. Grummons, 36 S.W.3d at 836 (awarding an expert witness's appearance fee because there was no showing that expert testimony on the issue would have been cumulative, unhelpful, or unnecessary);  Shahrdar v. Global Hous., Inc., 983 S.W.2d 230, 240 (Tenn.Ct.App.1998) (awarding the appearance fee of a testifying expert witness even though the parties disputed the necessity of the testimony).34.   Other panels of this court have held that they will presume that the evidence supports a trial court's decision regarding discretionary costs in the absence of a transcript or record of the hearing on discretionary costs.  Luna v. Breeding, No. M2000-01932-COA-R3-CV, 2001 WL 950187, at *3 (Tenn.Ct.App. Aug.22, 2001) (No Tenn. R.App. P. 11 application filed);  Faux v. Spears, No. 03A01-9312-CV-00433, 1994 WL 147830, at *1 (Tenn.Ct.App. Apr.26, 1994) (No Tenn. R.App. P. 11 application filed);  Moser v. Bibee, No. 03A01-9209-CV-00347, 1993 WL 133292, at *1 (Tenn.Ct.App. Apr.28, 1993) (No Tenn. R.App. P. 11 application filed).   We decline to apply this appeal-ending presumption unless the record affirmatively shows that the trial court's decision regarding discretionary costs was based on evidence other than the parties' affidavits and the record as a whole.WILLIAM C. KOCH, JR., J.

Case 4:04-cv-40179-FDS Document 21 Filed 11/05/2004 Page 6 of 18



Defendants Allmerica Financial Corporation (“AFC”), Allmerica Financial Life 

Insurance and Annuity Company (“AFLIAC”) (collectively “Allmerica”), and Frederick H. 

Eppinger, Jr. submit this memorandum in support of their Motion to Dismiss plaintiffs’ Class 

Action Complaint (the “Complaint”) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted 

under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). 

INTRODUCTION 

Plaintiffs are three former Allmerica agents who allege that they entered into an oral 

contract with AFC and/or AFLIAC in September 2002, which provided that they would receive 

“100% commissions” for selling “non-proprietary products” (i.e., life insurance and annuities 

administered by a company other than Allmerica). Plaintiffs claim that Allmerica paid 100% 

commissions from October 1, 2002 through November 15, 2002, but then stopped doing so for 

“replacement” sales (whereby Allmerica products were exchanged for non-proprietary products) 

and allege that defendants attempted to recoup some commissions that had been paid previously. 

Plaintiffs bring claims for breach of contract and a violation of the Pennsylvania Wage Payment 

and Collection Law (“Wage Act”). Both claims fail as a matter of law. 

Specifically, plaintiffs’ claims are preempted by the Securities Litigation Uniform 

Standards Act (“SLUSA”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78p(b), 78bb(f)(1), because this Court already has ruled 

(in denying plaintiffs’ motion to remand) that this is a “covered class action” under the statute. 

Even if SLUSA did not apply, the statute of frauds bars plaintiffs’ attempt to sue for breach of an 

oral contract. Plaintiffs cannot state a Wage Act claim because as “independent contractors” 

they lack standing and, in any event, such a claim requires plaintiffs to plead an enforceable 

employment contract, not an unenforceable oral agreement. As set forth below, the Court should 

dismiss plaintiffs’ Complaint with prejudice.

Case 4:04-cv-40179-FDS Document 21 Filed 11/05/2004 Page 7 of 18



ALLEGATIONS OF COMPLAINT1 

AFC and AFLIAC are Delaware corporations with offices located in Worcester, 

Massachusetts. (Compl. ¶ 5.) Frederick H. Eppinger is the President and Chief Executive 

Officer (“CEO”) of AFC. (Id. ¶ 6.) 

Plaintiffs are former financial advisors of Allmerica, who provided financial planning 

services for their clients and “marketed and sold a variety of Allmerica annuity, insurance, and 

investment products to clients,” for which they were paid a commission based on the total dollar 

value of the sale. (Id. ¶¶ 8, 12, 13, 26-27.) As Allmerica agents, plaintiffs sold both “proprietary 

products,” which were annuities and life insurance policies administered by Allmerica, and “non-

proprietary products,” which were annuities and life insurance products administered by a 

company other than Allmerica. (Id. ¶¶ 28-29.) When plaintiffs sold a non-proprietary product, 

the company administering that product paid a commission to Allmerica, and Allmerica 

historically paid 65% of that commission to the agent responsible for the non-proprietary sale 

and retained the balance of 35%. (Id. ¶ 29.) 

Plaintiffs allege that during a September 2002 meeting, the managing director of 

Allmerica’s Pittsburgh office announced that, effective October 1, 2002, Allmerica would pay 

agents in the Pittsburgh region 100% of the commissions (up from 65%) for their sales of non-

proprietary variable annuities and life insurance (the “100% commission arrangement”). (Id. ¶ 

30.) Plaintiffs also allege that the 100% commission arrangement was “announced” in e-mails, 

conference calls, and individual meetings. (Id. ¶ 32.) 

Plaintiffs claim that over the next six weeks (until November 15, 2002), they arranged for 

many of their existing variable life and annuity customers to replace their existing proprietary

For purposes of this Motion only, defendants recite the factual allegations set forth in the 

Complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In so doing, defendants admit neither the veracity of plaintiffs’ 
allegations, nor their relevance.

Case 4:04-cv-40179-FDS Document 21 Filed 11/05/2004 Page 8 of 18



products (with Allmerica) with non-proprietary products (with other companies) and that 

Allmerica paid 100% commissions on those transactions. (Id. ¶¶ 37-39, 41.) However, plaintiffs 

claim that on November 15, 2002, Allmerica terminated the 100% commission arrangement on 

the replacement business (i.e., transfers of Allmerica accounts to non-proprietary accounts), 

retroactive two weeks to November 1, 2002. (Id. ¶¶ 43-44.) Plaintiffs further allege that 

Allmerica attempted to recoup some of the commissions paid to plaintiffs under the 100% 

commission arrangement during those weeks by deducting amounts from commissions that 

otherwise would have been paid to plaintiffs. (Id. ¶¶ 45-54.) 

On May 12, 2004, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit purportedly on behalf of a putative class of 

Allmerica agents who sold non-proprietary products through Allmerica between October 1, 2002 

and November 15, 2002 pursuant to the 100% commission arrangement, and (1) did not receive 

the commissions to which they claim they were entitled, (2) were required to return their 

commissions, or (3) had their commissions “charged back” against their trail commissions. (Id. 

¶ 14.) In Count I, plaintiffs allege that Allmerica breached a “contract” by attempting recoup 

commissions paid to plaintiffs pursuant to the 100% commission arrangement. (See id. ¶¶ 55-

58.) In Count II, plaintiffs allege that Allmerica and Mr. Eppinger violated the Pennsylvania 

Wage Payment and Collection Law, 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 260.1, et seq. (See id. ¶¶ 59-63.) 

ARGUMENT 

I. 

PLAINTIFFS’ STATE LAW CLAIMS ARE PREEMPTED BY SLUSA. 

The Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety because it asserts two purportedly state 

law claims that are preempted by SLUSA. This Court already has ruled that the Complaint was 

properly removed to federal court under SLUSA because it “arises out of the sale of annuities 

and variable life insurance products, both of which are ‘covered securities’ for purposes of the 



- 3 - 

Case 4:04-cv-40179-FDS Document 21 Filed 11/05/2004 Page 9 of 18



SLUSA.” See Order dated October 6, 2004, at 4 (denying motion to remand).2 That Order also 

compels dismissal because the scope of SLUSA preemption is identical to that for removal. See 

15 U.S.C. §§ 78p(c), 78bb(f)(2); see also 15 U.S.C. §§ 77p(b), 77bb(f)(1) (“No covered class 

action . . . may be maintained in any State or Federal court”). 

Simply put, because this state law class action has been found to have been properly 

removed under SLUSA, by definition it must be dismissed under SLUSA (thereby leaving 

plaintiffs with whatever federal remedies they are entitled to assert). See, e.g., Cape Ann 

Investors LLC v. Lepone, 296 F. Supp. 2d 4, 10 (D. Mass. 2003) (state claims dismissed under 

SLUSA; “Congress [made] federal court the exclusive venue” for class actions covered by 

SLUSA “by providing for removal of state actions to federal court, and requiring the immediate 

dismissal of ‘covered lawsuits.’”) (quoting Riley v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 

292 F.3d 1334, 13420 (11th Cir. 2002) (emphasis supplied)); Winne v. Equitable Life Assurance 

Soc’y, 315 F. Supp. 2d 404, 416 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (granting motion to dismiss; “Because the 

removal and dismissal provisions of SLUSA are intertwined, once the Court determines that 

federal subject matter jurisdiction exists pursuant to the statute, it is a short step to dismissal of 

the state-law claims”) (emphasis supplied); Araujo v. John Hancock Life Ins., 206 F. Supp. 2d 

377, 380 (E.D.N.Y. 2002) (granting motion to dismiss; “SLUSA directs the removal and 

dismissal of class actions” within its scope) (emphasis supplied). 



2 

Plaintiffs cannot relitigate the Court Order that held that each of the elements required for SLUSA 
removal and dismissal has been satisfied. See Davis v. Dawson, Inc., 15 F. Supp. 2d 64, 117 (D. Mass. 1998) (under 
law of the case doctrine, “once a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same 
issues in subsequent stages in the same case”). In any event, the Order is correct. First, this lawsuit is a “covered” 
class action. Compare 15 U.S.C. § 78bb(f)(5)(B)(i)(II) (“covered class action” includes any lawsuit in which 
“damages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons or prospective class members”), and Order at 3, with 
Compl. ¶ 15 (“The class consists of hundreds of individuals”). Second, both of plaintiffs’ claims were brought 
under state “statutory or common law” based at least in part on alleged misrepresentations and manipulation. See 
Order at 3-4; Compl. ¶¶ 43-50, 55-58, 59-63. Third, variable annuities and variable life insurance as a matter of law 
are “covered securities” under SLUSA. See Order at 3 (citing Lander v. Hartford Life Ins. Co., 251 F.3d 101 (2d 
Cir. 2001); Dudek v. Prudential Securities, Inc., 295 F.3d 875 (8th Cir. 2002); Herndon v. Equitable Variable Life 
Ins. Co., 325 F.3d 1252 (11th Cir. 2003)).

II. 

PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS WOULD NOT SURVIVE DISMISSAL EVEN IF THEY 
WERE NOT PREEMPTED BY SLUSA. 













A. 

The Statute of Frauds Bars Plaintiffs’ Breach of Contract Claim. 

Plaintiffs’ contract claim -- an attempt to sue under an unwritten commission agreement -

- is barred by the Massachusetts statute of frauds, which specifically requires that any such 

agreements to compensate “brokers” be in writing: 

Any agreement to pay compensation for service as a broker or finder . . . shall be 
void and unenforceable unless such agreement is in writing, signed by the party to 
be charged therewith, or by some other person authorized . . . . The provisions of 
this section shall apply to a contract implied in fact or in law to pay reasonable 
compensation but shall not apply to a contract to pay compensation for 
professional services as an attorney-at-law or licensed real estate broker or real 
estate salesman acting in their professional capacity. 

Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 259, § 7 (emphasis supplied). 

This “special business brokerage Statute of Frauds manifested a legislative purpose to 

discourage claims for commission based on conversations which persons heard differently or 

remembered differently.” See Alexander v. Berman, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 458, 462 (1990). It 

“should be interpreted broadly to further its policy determination that agreements for 

compensation for certain services be in writing.” See Cantell v. Hill Holiday Connors 

Cosmopulos, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 550, 552-53 (2002). For this reason, Massachusetts courts 

dismiss lawsuits brought to enforce unwritten commission arrangements. See, e.g., North East 

Tech. Sales, Inc. v. Barshad, No. 99-1427-B, 2000 WL 1252184, at *2 (Mass. Super. Ct. Aug. 

14, 2000) (dismissing breach of contract claim based on oral agreement to pay 20% sales 

commission as unenforceable under Chapter 259, § 7); Cox v. Thornton Assocs., Inc., No. CIV. 

A. 97-00178, 1998 WL 470508, at *3 (Mass. Super. Ct. Aug. 4, 1998) (dismissing breach of 

contract claim based on oral agreement to pay sales commissions as barred by Chapter 259, § 7).

Count I must be dismissed because Chapter 259, § 7 forecloses plaintiffs’ attempt to sue 

for breach of an alleged oral contract to pay “100% commissions.” There is no question that 

plaintiffs are “brokers or finders” under Chapter 259, § 7. A “broker” is “an agent who acts as 

an intermediary or negotiator, especially between prospective buyers and sellers; a person 

employed to make bargains and contracts between other persons in matters of trade, commerce, 

and navigation.” Cantell, 55 Mass. App. Ct. at 553 (statutory term “broker” not a technical term 

and should be given ordinary meaning and construed according to common usage). A “finder” is 

“an intermediary who brings together parties for a business opportunity.” Id. at 553.3 

Plaintiffs plead themselves into the “broker or finder” definition. They allegedly served 

as “intermediaries” between their clients, who were prospective buyers of life insurance and 

annuities, and Allmerica, which sold those products. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 13 (alleging that 

plaintiffs “marketed and sold a variety of Allmerica annuity, insurance, and investment products 

to clients”). Plaintiffs also allege that they “were compensated based upon a system comprised 

of commissions,” calculated as a “percentage of the total dollar value of products purchased by 

the client.” See id. ¶¶ 26, 27 (alleging that plaintiffs “paid commissions as a result of client’s 

purchasing annuities and life insurance policies, mutual funds, stock sales, and other services”). 

On similar allegations, Massachusetts courts have found plaintiffs to be “brokers or finders” 

under Chapter 259, § 7. See Cantell, 55 Mass. App. Ct. at 554 (holding that employment agency 

was “broker” because “its claim for services is predicated upon its serving as an intermediary 

that was willing to negotiate an employment contract between [employer and employment 

candidate]”); Bay Colony Mktg. Co. v. Fruit Salad, Inc., 41 Mass. App. Ct. 662, 662-64 (1996) 



3 

“A finder differs from a broker-dealer because the finder merely brings two parties together to 

make their own contract, while a broker-dealer usually participates in the negotiations. A finder locates, introduces, 
and brings parties to a transaction together, while a broker does more, attempting to bring the parties to an 
agreement.” See Cantell, 55 Mass. App. at 553-54.

Case 4:04-cv-40179-FDS Document 21 Filed 11/05/2004 Page 12 of 18



(oral agreement for solicitation of new accounts and sales territories for seller’s food products in 

return for commission within statute of frauds); Alexander, 29 Mass. App. Ct. at 461-62 

(plaintiff who introduced defendant seller to potential buyer of business was “broker”).4 

It is equally clear that plaintiffs are suing to enforce an oral “contract” that, even if it 

existed, would be “void and unenforceable” under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 259, § 7. Plaintiffs 

contend that defendants contracted to pay 100% commissions (i.e., “compensation”) for their 

sales of non-proprietary products (i.e., “services as a broker or finder”), Compl. ¶ 30, yet 

nowhere does the Complaint allege that any such deal was memorialized in a written contract 

signed by Allmerica as required by Chapter 259, § 7. To the contrary, plaintiffs affirmatively 

allege that the supposed 100% commission arrangement was oral. For example, plaintiffs claim 

that defendants “announced the implementation” of the 100% commission arrangement at a 

meeting in September 2002, and thereafter “promulgated and announced” the deal in unsigned 

and unidentified e-mails, conference calls, and individual meetings. See Compl. ¶ 30 (emphasis 

supplied), ¶ 32. This is not sufficient. See North East Tech. Sales, 2001 WL 1252184, at *1 

(dismissing contract claim under statute of frauds where, as here, complaint alleged that 

agreement was set forth in “various e-mails” and an unsigned draft of contract). 

Plaintiffs certainly have not satisfied the signed writing requirement by attaching to their 

Complaint two unsigned documents that, if anything, demonstrate why ch. 259, § 7 requires that 

commission agreements be in writing. Exhibit A is an e-mail reminding recipients to attend a 



4 

Significantly, insurance agents and brokers do not fall within one of Chapter 259, § 7’s express 

statutory exceptions for “an attorney-at-law or licensed real estate broker or real estate salesman.” Indeed, the 
legislature’s inclusion of the express statutory exceptions “strengthens the inference that no other exception was 
intended.” Cantell, 55 Mass. App. Ct. at 553 (emphasis supplied) (quoting Protective Life Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 425 
Mass. 615, 620 (1997)). For this reason, courts routinely dismiss contract claims brought by “brokers” and “finders” 
who -- like plaintiffs here -- do not fall within the statutory exceptions. See, e.g., Cantell, 55 Mass. App. Ct. at 553 
(dismissing contract claim by employment agent who did not fall within any of the statutory exceptions); Bay 
Colony, 41 Mass. App. Ct. at 667 (food broker’s contract claim dismissed under Chapter 259, § 7; no basis in statute 
to conclude that “Legislature intended to obviate disputes over claimed commissions for services rendered in certain 
commercial brokerage contexts, but not others”). 



- 7 - 

Case 4:04-cv-40179-FDS Document 21 Filed 11/05/2004 Page 13 of 18



meeting and conference call at a local country club but says nothing about the supposed 

agreement upon which plaintiffs base their claim. See Compl., Ex. A. Exhibit B is a letter to 

one plaintiff that references a commission chargeback, but does not refer to any agreement to pay 

any particular amount of commissions, much less any obligation by any defendant to pay 100% 

commissions on replacements of proprietary products with non-proprietary ones. See Compl., 

Ex. B. Thus, even taken together, these documents do not approach an enforceable contract. See 

Christo v. Draper, No. 00-P-1530, 2002 WL 1492230, at *1 (Mass. App. Ct. July 12, 2002) 

(holding that two documents did not satisfy statute of frauds: first document not in compliance 

where, as here, not signed or initialed by party; second document not in compliance where, as 

here, it made no mention of any payment to plaintiff in exchange for finder services). 

Finally, plaintiffs’ attempt to sue for breach of an alleged oral contract is particularly 

improper because they do not specify the party with whom they claim to have contracted. They 

claim only to have been employed by “Allmerica,” a term they define in the Complaint to 

include AFC and AFLIAC without ever identifying which entity allegedly was bound to (and 

allegedly breached) the 100% commission obligation. See Compl. ¶ 5. Even under a Rule 8(a) 

notice pleading standard, plaintiffs are required to identify the party that is allegedly bound. See 

Orrell v. Umass Mem. Med. Ctr., Inc., 203 F. Supp. 2d 52, 68 (D. Mass. 2002) (dismissing 

breach of contract claim where plaintiff failed to allege privity of contract with defendants). 

Plaintiffs’ failure to plead the other side to the contract is also conspicuous because, although 

they sued AFC and AFLIAC, the documents they filed with the National Association of 



- 8 - 

Case 4:04-cv-40179-FDS Document 21 Filed 11/05/2004 Page 14 of 18



Securities Dealers (“NASD”) identify neither as their employer, but instead say they worked for 

Allmerica Investments, Inc., which they have not sued.5 

B. 

Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim Under the Pennsylvania Wage Act. 

Plaintiffs also fail to state a claim under the Pennsylvania Wage Act (Count II) because 

plaintiffs (i) are not “employees” with standing to sue under the Wage Act; and (ii) cannot 

reinvent an inactionable contract claim as one under the Wage Act. 

1. 

Plaintiffs Are Not “Employees” Under the Wage Act. 

Plaintiffs cannot state a claim under the Wage Act because only “employees” have 

standing to sue under the statute, and there are no factual allegations that they were employees of 

AFI, as opposed to AFLIAC, or of Mr. Eppinger personally. See 43 Pa. Stat. § 260.9a(a). 

Plaintiffs’ bald assertion of having been “employees” of all defendants is inadequate. See 

Resolution Trust Co. v. Driscoll, 985 F.2d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 1993) (affirming dismissal of 

complaint; in passing on motion to dismiss, although factual allegations are assumed to be true, 

“this tolerance does not extend to legal conclusions or to bald assertions”).6 Although plaintiffs 

allegedly were Allmerica agents and clearly are suing over a dispute that arises out of a master-

servant or “employment” relationship, the Wage Act does not apply to all employment 

relationships -- it only provides a remedy to those who were “employees” and excludes those 

who provided services as “independent contractors.” See Turk v. Communication Design Inc., 



5 

As registered representatives licensed to sell securities (such as variable annuities and life 

insurance), plaintiffs are obligated to file public Forms U-4 and BD identifying their employer. See 15 U.S.C. § 
78o. As a matter of law, the Court is entitled to consider publicly -filed documents on a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., 
Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993) (district court properly considered public documents in granting 
motion to dismiss). NASD-compiled information based on plaintiffs’ U-4 and BD forms are attached hereto as 
Exhibits A (Ries), B (Murray), and C (Henry). 

6 

That is, plaintiffs parrot the statute by referring to themselves as “employees,” Compl. ¶ 26, but 
nowhere is that assertion supported by factual allegations. Even under the liberal standard of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), 
plaintiffs cannot satisfy their pleading burden with unsupported legal conclusions. See United States ex rel. 
Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hosp., 360 F.3d 220, 240 (1st Cir. 2004) (granting motion to dismiss; “[s]imply 
parroting the language of a statutory cause of action, without some factual support, is not sufficient to state a 
claim”). 



- 9 - 

Case 4:04-cv-40179-FDS Document 21 Filed 11/05/2004 Page 15 of 18



10 Pa. D. & C.4th 42, 46 (Pa. Ct. Cm. Pleas 1991) (granting demurrer to plaintiff’s Wage Act 

claim where, as here, plaintiff was independent contractor, and not defendant’s employee); see 

also General Electric Co. v. Lyon, 894 F. Supp. 544, 553 (D. Mass. 1995) (granting motion to 

dismiss statutory counterclaim where, as here, defendant failed to allege facts that would support 

statute’s “critical elements”).7 

Plaintiffs certainly cannot hide behind a boilerplate “employee” allegation now that, in 

related litigation, they denied they were “employees” but instead represented that they were 

“independent contractors.” Speakman v. Allmerica Fin. Life Ins. & Annuity Co., No. Civ. 4:04-

cv-4007-FDS (D. Mass.), Pls.’ Mem. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 22. Nor is this semantics; 

courts have found that insurance agents like plaintiffs are independent contractors, not 

employees. See, e.g., Schweiger v. Farm Bureau Ins. Co. of Nebraska, 207 F.3d 480 (8th Cir. 

2000) (insurance agent held to be independent contractor); Knight v. United Farm Bureau Mut. 

Ins. Co., 950 F.2d 377 (7th Cir. 1991) (same); Oestman v. National Farmers Union Ins. Co., 958 

F.2d 303 (10th Cir. 1992) (same).8 

2. 

Plaintiffs Cannot Base a Wage Act Claim on a Void and Unenforceable 
Oral Contract. 

Even if plaintiffs had standing to sue under the Wage Act, Count II must be dismissed 

because they have failed to allege breach of an enforceable contract. That is, the Pennsylvania 

Wage Act “does not create a right to compensation. Rather, it provides a statutory remedy when 

the employer breaches a contractual obligation to pay earned wages. The contract between the 

parties governs in determining whether specific wages are earned.” Weldon v. Kraft, Inc., 896 


7 

Thus, the Pennsylvania Wage Act is distinguished from Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, which excludes 

the entire universe of “employment relationships” and does not distinguish between “employee” and “independent 
contractor.” 

8 

Indeed, even if “independent contractors” were deemed “employees” for purposes of the Wage 
Act, as noted above, plaintiffs never identified which of the two entities they sued employed them, and have not 
sued the entity (Allmerica Investments, Inc.) that they identified as their employer in the documents they filed with 
the NASD. See Exs. A, B, C. 



- 10 - 

Case 4:04-cv-40179-FDS Document 21 Filed 11/05/2004 Page 16 of 18



F.2d 793, 801 (3d Cir. 1990) (emphasis supplied) (affirming dismissal of Wage Act claim where, 

as here, there was no express contractual obligation to pay wages). Here, plaintiffs transparently 

rely on their deficient breach of contract allegations. See Compl. ¶ 62 (“By breaching its 

contracts with Plaintiffs for commissions as outlined above, Defendants are in breach of the 

Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law.”). Plaintiffs cannot sue directly for breach of 

that “void and unenforceable” oral contract, see supra § II.A., nor as the basis for a Wage Act 

claim. See Borrell v. Weinstein Supply Corp., No. Civ. A. 94-2857, 1994 WL 530102, at *7 

(E.D. Pa. Sept. 27, 1994) (where plaintiff’s underlying breach of employment contract failed to 

state claim for lack of sufficiently definite terms, court dismissed Wage Act claim; plaintiff 

“failed thus far to properly allege a claim based on breach of contract. Accordingly, he has 

failed to state a claim under the [Wage Act].”). 

3. 

Plaintiffs State No Claim Against Mr. Eppinger 

The Wage Act claim against Frederick Eppinger should be dismissed for the additional 

reason that he is not alleged to have done anything other than serve as the CEO and President of 

Allmerica Financial Corporation. See Compl. ¶ 6. As a matter of law, an individual’s status as a 

corporate officer does not make him or her personally liable for the corporation’s contracts, and 

certainly not for those of the corporation’s subsidiaries. See, e.g., North East Tech. Sales, 2000 

WL1252184, at *2-3 (dismissing contract claim against officer of company because officers 

cannot be held personally liable on company’s contracts “except in rare particular situations to 

prevent gross inequity”) (quoting Evans v. Multicon Constr. Corp., 30 Mass. App. Ct. 728, 732 



- 11 - 

Case 4:04-cv-40179-FDS Document 21 Filed 11/05/2004 Page 17 of 18



(1991)).9 Plaintiffs implicitly recognize this because they have not brought their contract claim 

against Mr. Eppinger. Because he cannot be liable on plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim, a 

fortiori, the Wage Act claim against Mr. Eppinger should be dismissed. 

CONCLUSION 

For the foregoing reasons, this Court should dismiss plaintiffs’ Complaint, with 

prejudice.

Plaintiffs make no attempt to pierce the corporate veil to hold Mr. Eppinger personally liable for 

the corporations’s contracts, which would require allegations of: (1) active and pervasive control of related business 
entities by the same controlling persons and a fraudulent or injurious consequences as a result of those relationships; 
or (2) confused intermingling of activity if two or more corporations engaged in a common enterprise with 
substantial disregard of the separate nature of the corporate entities, or serious ambiguity about the manner and 
capacity in which the various corporations and their respective representatives are acting.” See Evans, 30 Mass. 
App. Ct. at 732. (internal quotes and citations omitted).
