BEND, Ore., July 27, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Cascade Bancorp (NASDAQ:   CACB) (the "Company") and its wholly-owned subsidiary Bank of the Cascades (the "Bank"), today announced that on Monday, July 25, 2011 Patricia L. Moss, the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, advised the Board of Directors of the Company of her intent to retire next year on July 25, 2012, at which time she plans to provide her formal notice of resignation.  During the interim period, she will continue to serve as CEO and President of the Company and CEO of the Bank.
Patricia L. Moss commented, "After a 34-year career with the Bank, I look forward to spending more time with my family and fulfilling a personal desire to travel upon my retirement.  Importantly, advising the board of my future retirement plans a year in advance of my retirement allows them sufficient time to make necessary succession and transition plans.  I remain committed to the Bank and to all of our employees to carry out my duties as CEO until I retire next year and I look forward to supporting a smooth transition."
Gary Hoffman, chairman of the board, commented, "For 34 years Patti has been an outstanding leader for the Company and the Bank.  As a Board, we are particularly grateful to Patti for the extraordinary effort and dedication she has consistently demonstrated over the years and particularly during the recent economic downturn. Thanks to her actions, she will be leaving our bank in a position of financial strength and well prepared to serve our communities into the future.  We are very appreciative that she has provided us with adequate time to plan for a smooth transition.  The Board has been conducting a search for a President of the Bank and in consideration of Patti's future retirement plans the board has created a search committee to begin the process of identifying the best CEO/President candidate.  The Board is actively engaged and dedicated to finding a strong and experienced leader who shares Bank of the Cascades values to lead the Bank into the future."

                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            PenFed does a hard inquiry on your credit report just to set up a savings account.I wanted to start stashing part of my retirement check in a savings account.

Navy Federal Credit Union nRewards® Credit Card


                                            I thought this was a good program until I tried to order a Yeti cooler on the members mall and every cooler in every size was out of stock. So I ordered $400 in gift cards instead to purchase the item at a retailer. After about 3 weeks of waiting the cards never showed up. I...show more

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.
