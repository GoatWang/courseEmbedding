IGNITION HARNESSES

The aircraft ignition harness carries an electrical current from the aircraft magneto to the spark plugs. An aircraft ignition harness is shielded to support and protect the wires from damage and to act as a conductor for stray magnetic fields. This in turn will minimize electrical interference with sensitive electrical equipment on the aircraft.

FAA-PMA approved Slick Harnesses by Champion are built to handle the maximum spark energy produced while delivering more energy than is required by the spark plugs – even during emergency full-power engine operation. Using anything less could result in more than a 50% reduction of radio sensitivity in commonly used communication frequencies, as tested by Champion. Features such as a heavy-gauge contact spring provide more contact area and force inside the spark plug, while the flexibility of the coiled center conductor reduces fatigue and breakage resulting from repeated temperature cycling and vibration. 

Champion Ignition Leads have a polymer coating to resist heat and are engineered for high-temperature environments, which is common in reciprocating engines.

ELECTRONIC IGNITION

Champion Aerospace developed a Lycoming Piston Engine Solid State Ignition System, CH42PR20A, in 2010 for the Light Sport Aircraft program. This ignition system design can be tailored for use on experimental aircraft as well. At the system level the design consists of a control module assembly and two capacitive discharge module assemblies. Both assemblies are packaged within anodized aerospace grade aluminum housings for mechanical strength, environmental and EMI considerations. The design is interchangeable with the traditional magneto and has two redundant electrical power and control channels. The unit is powered at low RPM by aircraft bus power and then is self-powered at the targeted internal permanent magnet alternator assembly (PMA) takeover speed to avoid burdening the electrical bus during flight.


The control module contains two surface mounted PCB assemblies, traditional style magneto shaft and bearing assembly, a sensor assembly and the PMA assembly. The capacitive discharge ignition (CDI) module assembly receives a low voltage input from the control assembly and steps the voltage up to traditional magneto output levels. The delivered energy can easily be configured to customer requirements for improved ignition performance. The high voltage harness assemblies are compatible with traditional harness designs. Any Champion Aerospace Spark Plug Assembly can be used with this ignition system design.

Champion can provide Industry Certification compliant ignition system hardware for hazardous environment requirements (i.e. CSA, CE, ATEX etc…).

There are three components of a turbine engine ignition system: the exciter, the ignition lead, and the igniter. The exciter takes input power from the aircraft electrical system, steps up the voltage, stores the energy and switches a high voltage output signal through the ignition lead to the igniter. The igniter sparks once its gap is ionized and the field between the center electrode and igniter shell breaks down. Champion’s ignition systems are optimized to reduce to total cost of ownership for the end user. Many of its exciters incorporate solid state switching technology to extend the on engine life of the exciter and to provide the ideal electrical waveform to assure reliable engine starting. Champion’s ignition leads, where possible, are matched to its exciters and igniters to minimize line losses within the system. They offer higher delivered energy than similarly constructed competitive brands, with less flashover and greater electrical shielding. The igniter designs benefit from over 100 years of spark plug and igniter design and manufacturing experience. The result is the longest lasting, most reliable igniter designs in the turbine engine industry.

Slick Magnetos




Product OverviewFeaturesChampion DistributorVideoTech SheetsThe function of the aviation piston engine ignition system is to provide an electrical spark to ignite the fuel/air mixture in the engine cylinders.  The ignition system of the engine is a separate system and is not part of the airplane’s overall electrical system. The magneto type ignition system is used on most reciprocating aircraft engines. Magnetos are engine-driven self-contained units that supply electrical current without using an external source of current.  Magnetos are frequently not maintained to requirements specified in L1363 Manual- 4300/6300 Series Magneto Maintenance and Overhaul Manual, probably because they’re so reliable and all engines have a redundant magneto.  Magnetos need regular maintenance, and the consequences of neglect can be devastating. 
Modern airplane engines are required by to have a dual ignition system – that is, two separate magnetos to supply the electric current to the two spark plugs contained in each cylinder. One magneto system supplies the current to one set of plugs, while the second magneto system supplies the current to the other set of plugs.  The airplane’s double ignition system provides better performance because of more efficient combustion and a higher level of safety through redundancy. 
Champion Slick magnetos have applications on nearly all piston engines and are known for the following design features:

Smaller and lighter unique design allowing for a dimensionally smaller magneto,
resulting in easier installation and lighter weight- as much as one pound lighter than competitive magnetos. 
Radio noise suppression- Slick magnetos feature superior noise suppression, eliminating the need for magneto filters. 
Easy to maintain- Slick magnetos use up to 50% fewer parts than the competitive aircraft magnetos. In addition, 70% of the parts in any Slick magneto are interchangeable with the comparable parts in other current production Slick magnetos.


Slick magnetos are engineered so that mechanical parts wear at a balanced rate. Consistent and complimentary wear patterns establish the recommended maintenance intervals defined in Champion Aerospace service literature, so used and service-worn parts should never be used to troubleshoot or repair a magneto, nor should original parts be replaced by used service worn parts on magnetos being returned to service. 
Further, non-Champion Aerospace manufactured parts may wear at uneven and different rates than original Champion Aerospace manufactured parts, making Champion Aerospace service literature an inappropriate guide to proper maintenance. Parts not manufactured by Champion Aerospace, even if FAA/PMA Approved, may not fit or operate like original Champion Aerospace manufactured parts. FAA testing of PMA parts does not require operation on an engine or flight tests and does not require the test duration to exceed the maintenance intervals called out in Champion Aerospace literature. For these reasons, used service worn parts or parts not manufactured by Champion Aerospace may adversely affect magneto reliability in ways not anticipated by Champion Aerospace and its service literature. 
Genuine Champion Aerospace parts are produced and inspected under rigorous procedures to ensure airworthiness and suitability in Slick magnetos. Parts purchased from sources other than Champion Aerospace (even though outwardly identical in appearance) may not have had the required tests and inspections performed, may be different in fabrication techniques and materials, and may be dangerous when installed in a Slick magneto. Salvaged magneto parts, reworked parts obtained from non-Champion Aerospace approved sources, or parts the service history of which is unknown or cannot be authenticated may have been subjected to unacceptable stresses or temperatures or have other hidden damage, not discernible through routine visual or usual nondestructive testing techniques. This may render service work with this part, even though originally manufactured by Champion Aerospace, unsuitable or unsafe for use in a Slick magneto. Champion Aerospace expressly disclaims any responsibility.
Slick magnetos can also be economically serviced at 500-hour intervals. To ensure their reliability, all AD’s are complied with and the following high wear parts are replaced:

Brush 
Capacitor(s) 
Points
Rotor Gear
Impulse Spring (as applicable)


For aircraft that operate in demanding environments, use Champion SlickSTART™ technology.  Cold Start, Hot Start, Any Start- SlickSTART™.   SlickSTART unleashes a firestorm of ignition energy to get your engine started under the worst environmental conditions.  SlickSTART is so effective, even sub-optimal fuel mixtures and seriously fouled spark plugs won’t stop the capacitive discharge output from providing the ignition boost your engine needs for reliable starts under demanding conditions.  SlickSTART’s sure starting power:

Delivers up to 340% more spark energy to your plugs during starting
Increase output voltage by more than 30%
Overcomes poor engine priming
Reduces costly electrical stress to your battery and starter
Is approved for use with Slick Magnetos


Plus, it’s inexpensive and easy to install.  Just add SlickSTART to your impulse coupled magnetos or replace your antiquated starting vibrator.

Champion Slick Magnetos make timing, installation, inspection, and maintenance simpler and more convenient than ever before. We also incorporated mechanic-endorsed features to improve performance and service life. 
Lift-off housing – Internal timing is not disturbed during inspections. 
Simplified internal timing – Improved internal markings and unique Slick E-gap tool make timing easier and more accurate. 
Fully sealed bearings – Keeps contaminants out and grease in for smoother operation and less maintenance. 
Lower EMI Levels – Redesigned housing improves sealing and results in less radio noise.

Ignition Harness




Product OverviewFeaturesChampion CatalogChampion DistributorVideoTech SheetAircraft ignition harness assemblies prevent the entrance, formation, and accumulation of impurities within the shielded distribution systems universally employed on airplanes using high-sensitivity radio receivers.
Champion Slick ignition harnesses feature corrosion resistant connections, a heavy-gauge contact spring to provide more contact area and force against the spark plug contact, plated ground path overbraid  and a center conductor wire design that provides flexibility to reduce fatigue and breakage of the specialized plated stainless steel coiled conductor core from repeated temperature cycling and engine vibration.   Fluid susceptibility concerns are addressed by the silicone based sheathing that protects the ignition wire from spark plug termination to the harness backplate. This extremely flexible wire lends itself to sharp bends, thereby eliminating the need for old style harness elbows. There are no soldered joints in the grounding circuit, and they are custom made for most 4 and 6 cylinder engine applicatinos using Slick magnetos.  Harnesses for Slick magnetos are furnished with the backplates installed.
FAA-PMA approved Slick Harnesses by Champion are built to handle the demanding environmental conditions, maximum spark energy produced and maintain optimized levels of electromagnetic Interference protection.  Using anything less could result in more than a 50% reduction of radio sensitivity in commonly used communication frequencies, as tested by Champion.


Full one year or 500 hour new part warranty on Slick components
Over 100 years of aviation ignition manufacturing experience
All manufacturing and customer service based in the USA
Heat-resistant polymer coating specifically engineered for high-temperatures.
Coiled center wire for greater flexibility eliminating the need for old style elbows
Flexible, 16 strand silicone impregnated scuff resistant braid greatly reduces EMI.
Heavy-gauge contact spring for greater contact force reducing the chance of flashover
Completely repairable and all pieces are independently available through distribution.

SPARK PLUGS

Champion Aerospace Aviation Spark Plugs are the preferred ignition spark plug for reciprocating engines. Advanced-engineered Champion Aerospace spark plugs, designed for the critical difference in performance, are far beyond the ordinary. Champion Aerospace spark plugs stand up to high temperatures, pressures, and lead deposits with performance that’s second to none. When you’re up in the air, count on quality Champion spark plugs. 

For even higher performance engines, choose longer-lasting Iridium “S” spark plugs. Longer lasting than platinum spark plugs, Iridium “S” plugs resist lead attack and provide better scavenging than standard platinum plug designs. Iridium “S” offers exceptional performance, even under the most demanding conditions.
A major benefit this design offers is a quick turnaround during a forced emergency outage.

IGNITION HARNESSES

The aircraft ignition harness carries an electrical current from the aircraft magneto to the spark plugs. An aircraft ignition harness is shielded to support and protect the wires from damage and to act as a conductor for stray magnetic fields. This in turn will minimize electrical interference with sensitive electrical equipment on the aircraft.

FAA-PMA approved Slick Harnesses by Champion are built to handle the maximum spark energy produced while delivering more energy than is required by the spark plugs – even during emergency full-power engine operation. Using anything less could result in more than a 50% reduction of radio sensitivity in commonly used communication frequencies, as tested by Champion. Features such as a heavy-gauge contact spring provide more contact area and force inside the spark plug, while the flexibility of the coiled center conductor reduces fatigue and breakage resulting from repeated temperature cycling and vibration. 

Champion Ignition Leads have a polymer coating to resist heat and are engineered for high-temperature environments, which is common in reciprocating engines.

ELECTRONIC IGNITION

Champion Aerospace developed a Lycoming Piston Engine Solid State Ignition System, CH42PR20A, in 2010 for the Light Sport Aircraft program. This ignition system design can be tailored for use on experimental aircraft as well. At the system level the design consists of a control module assembly and two capacitive discharge module assemblies. Both assemblies are packaged within anodized aerospace grade aluminum housings for mechanical strength, environmental and EMI considerations. The design is interchangeable with the traditional magneto and has two redundant electrical power and control channels. The unit is powered at low RPM by aircraft bus power and then is self-powered at the targeted internal permanent magnet alternator assembly (PMA) takeover speed to avoid burdening the electrical bus during flight.


The control module contains two surface mounted PCB assemblies, traditional style magneto shaft and bearing assembly, a sensor assembly and the PMA assembly. The capacitive discharge ignition (CDI) module assembly receives a low voltage input from the control assembly and steps the voltage up to traditional magneto output levels. The delivered energy can easily be configured to customer requirements for improved ignition performance. The high voltage harness assemblies are compatible with traditional harness designs. Any Champion Aerospace Spark Plug Assembly can be used with this ignition system design.

Product Information and Technical Data



IGNITION SYSTEMSChampion Aerospace is a global leading manufacturer of aero, marine and industrial ignition systems for turbine engine powered applications. With more than 300 different igniter designs, 150 lead designs, and more than 50 exciter designs, Champion’s ignition system products are specified as original equipment on products from CFM International, General Electric, Honeywell, Pratt & Whitney, Pratt & Whitney Canada, Rolls-Royce, Solar, Siemens, Sundstrand, Teledyne, Turbomeca, Volvo, Westinghouse, and Williams International.   Champion Aerospace also produces ignition systems for global industrial and marine based endusers, including land and marine power plants; oil, gas, and coal furnaces; oil rig operations; and pumping stations. Champion can provide Industry Certification compliant ignition system hardware for hazardous environment requirements (i.e. CSA, CE, ATEX etc…).

There are three components of a turbine engine ignition system: the exciter, the ignition lead, and the igniter. The exciter takes input power from the aircraft electrical system, steps up the voltage, stores the energy and switches a high voltage output signal through the ignition lead to the igniter. The igniter sparks once its gap is ionized and the field between the center electrode and igniter shell breaks down. Champion’s ignition systems are optimized to reduce to total cost of ownership for the end user. Many of its exciters incorporate solid state switching technology to extend the on engine life of the exciter and to provide the ideal electrical waveform to assure reliable engine starting. Champion’s ignition leads, where possible, are matched to its exciters and igniters to minimize line losses within the system. They offer higher delivered energy than similarly constructed competitive brands, with less flashover and greater electrical shielding. The igniter designs benefit from over 100 years of spark plug and igniter design and manufacturing experience. The result is the longest lasting, most reliable igniter designs in the turbine engine industry.
