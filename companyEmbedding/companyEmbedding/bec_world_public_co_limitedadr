Mean RecommendationN/A

Consensus Rating: The average of analysts recommendations for a single entity.

Assigning a numeric value to the broker text enables Thomson Financial I/B/E/S to calculate a consensus recommendation. This consensus recommendation appears as the mean (average) of the assigned values.  The color coding assigns a value of Very Positive to Very Negative. The Color Key, below, indicates the assigned values and a possible explanation for the rating. However, it is important to note that each value should be looked at in combination with other factors.

BEC World Public Co., Ltd. : Neutral assessment on price but strong on fundamentals – CapitalCube

CapitalCube





















BEC World Public Co., Ltd. : Neutral assessment on price but strong on fundamentals 
October 13, 2016 by CapitalCube 


BEC World Public Co., Ltd. relative valuation is now NEUTRAL. It was previously rated OVERVALUED, and has a fundamental analysis score of 63.
Our analysis is based on comparing BEC World Public Co., Ltd. with the following peers – Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. Class A, Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Inc. Class A, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. Class A and Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. Class A (SNI-US, NXST-US, SBGI-US and CETV-US).
Relative Valuation
BEC World Public Co., Ltd. is currently neutrally valued, as its previous close of USD 5.04 lies within the CapitalCube estimate range of USD 3.59 to USD 5.31. Over the last 52 week period, BEC World Public Co., Ltd. has fluctuated between USD 5.04 and USD 9.92.


Company Overview

Considering peers, relative underperformance over the last year and the last month suggest a lagging position.


BEC World Public Co., Ltd. Unsponsored ADR currently trades at a higher Price/Book ratio (4.53) than its peer median (3.42).


The market expects BECVY-US to grow at about the same rate as the peers and to maintain the median returns it currently generates.


BECVY-US has a successful operating model with relatively high net profit margins and asset turns.


Compared with its chosen peers, the company’s annual revenues and earnings change at a slower rate, implying a lack of strategic focus and/or lack of execution success.


BECVY-US‘s return on assets currently and over the past five years suggest that its relatively high operating returns are sustainable.


The company’s relatively high pre-tax margin suggests tight control on operating costs versus peers.


While BECVY-US‘s revenues growth has been below the peer median in the last few years, the market still gives the stock a P/E ratio that is around peer median and seems to see the company as a long-term strategic bet.


The company’s level of capital investment is relatively low and suggests it is milking the business.


BECVY-US has the financial and operating capacity to borrow quickly.


Investment Outlook
BEC World Public Co., Ltd. has a fundamental score of 63 and has a relative valuation of NEUTRAL. 
BEC World Public Co., Ltd. appears on the top right hand quadrant of CapitalCube’s Value – Price Matrix. We classify this as ‘Safety’. In other words, BEC World Public Co., Ltd. has a relatively high Fundamental Analysis score of 63, while being potentially overvalued and trading higher than its CapitalCube Implied Price of 4.45. There might be some safety in this stock where it’s fundamental strength perhaps justifies its relatively higher price.
