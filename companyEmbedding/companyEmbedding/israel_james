                In this groundbreaking new book, distinguished biblical scholar James L. Crenshaw investigates both the pragmatic hows and the philosophical whys of education in ancient Israel and its surroundings. Asking questions as basic as "Who were the teachers and students and from what segment of Israelite society did they come?" and "How did instructors interest young people in the things they had to say?" Crenshaw explores the institutions and practices of education in ancient Israel. The results are often surprising and more complicated than one would expect.

Education, for the people who lived in the biblical world, was more than a simple matter of memorizing information and taking tests. It was a search for the hidden plan and presence of God. Knowledge was gained, according to biblical texts such as Ecclesiastes and Proverbs, not only by means of patient observation and listening, but through communication with Wisdom, the feminine incarnation of the Divine. Drawing upon a broad range of ancient sources, Crenshaw examines this religious dimension of education in ancient Israel, demonstrating how the practice of teaching and learning was transformed into the supreme act of worship.

Product Description
Israel James Friend & Elizabeth Eva Hammer and Their Descendants
by
Patty (Friend) Thompson
Israel James Friend, son of Jacob Friend and Elizabeth Skidmore, was born in1783 in Rockingham County, Virginia.  In 1811 he married Elizabeth Eva Hammer and together they had five known children. Like most men of this time, Israel James Friend was a farmer, working the land to feed his family.
Israel James Friend and his children would be known as pioneers of this nation. Since no personal diaries or documented stories were written by Israel James or Elizabeth Eve themselves their lives are represented in the form of US Census records, transcribed deeds, wills, photographs, obituaries, newspaper articles, military documents, birth, marriage and death records in an effort to record their family’s history before it is lost to time.
This is 469 page, indexed, black/white spiral bound edition, which may be purchased at the FFAA. All proceeds of this book published by the FFAA will go to the FFAA, a non-profit organization. All sales of copies of this book and CD are final.
Credit card purchases can be made by using Pay Pal at the FFAA web site.

Product Description▼▲
¿Qué era el Tabernáculo de Israel en realidad? ¿Cómo se construyó este lugar portátil de culto? ¿Cómo surgió la función sacerdotal, y qué papel jugó el Tabernáculo en la vida de la persona promedio? ¿Qué significado tiene el Tabernáculo para el cristiano? Estas y muchas otras preguntas se responden en este fascinante estudio del primer lugar de la adoración de Israel. Uno de los más respetados estudiosos de la Biblia del siglo XIX, el Dr. James Strong duró unos treinta años de estudio sistemático en la preparación de El Tabernáculo de Israel. Utilizando dos grandes categorías para su estudio del Tabernáculo - su estructura y su simbolismo - Strong proporciona una imagen detallada de la historia, la construcción, el funcionamiento y la importancia del "tabernáculo de reunión" de Israel. También se incluyen treinta y nueve dibujos e ilustraciones que detallan el diseño del Tabernáculo y sus partes.What was the Tabernacle of Israel really like? How was this portable place of worship constructed? How did the priesthood function, and what role did the Tabernacle play in the life of the average person? What significance does the Tabernacle have for the Christian? These and many other questions are answered in this fascinating study of Israel's first place of worship. One of the nineteenth century's most respected Bible scholars, Dr. James Strong spent some thirty years of systematic study in preparing The Tabernacle of Israel. Using two broad categories for his study of the Tabernacle - its structure and its symbolism - Strong provides a detailed picture of the history, construction, function, and significance of Israel's "tent of meeting." Also included are thirty-nine drawings and illustrations detailing the design of the Tabernacle and its parts.

Product Description▼▲
What was the Tabernacle of Israel really like? How was this portable place of worship constructed? How did the priesthood function, and what role did the Tabernacle play in the life of the average person? What significance does the Tabernacle have for the Christian? These and many other questions are answered in this fascinating study of Israel's first place of worship.  One of the nineteenth century's most respected Bible scholars, Dr. James Strong spent some thirty years of systematic study in preparing The Tablernacle of Israel. Using two broad categories for his study of the Tabernacle - its structure and its symbolism - Strong provides a detailed picture of the history, construction, function, and significance of Israel's "tent of meeting." Also included are thirty-nine drawings and illustrations detailing the design of the Tabernacle and its parts.

In the Hebrew language, the word "feasts" literally means "appointed times."  God appointed Seven Feasts for the Hebrew people to celebrate and to remember until the end of time.  Through those Seven Feasts, God not only spoke directly of his plan for mankind, but he also gave us some beautiful historical - and future - pictures of his plan of redemption and provision embedded within the precepts of the ancient Mosaic Law.  As we look at each of these Seven Feasts, we should not only be amazed and astonished at God's consistency and perfection in all that he does; but we should also realize that each event prophesied in the Seven Feasts has, thus far, unfolded perfectly and will continue to do so in the time to come.  The first Four Feasts were fulfilled in the days of Christ and the Early Church; but the last three await God's perfect timing for their fulfillment in the End Time.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
