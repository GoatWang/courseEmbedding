HSBC Global Asset Management is the marketing name for the asset management businesses of HSBC Holdings Plc. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. serves as the investment adviser to the HSBC Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., member FINRA, is the distributor of the HSBC Funds and is not affiliated with the adviser. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE, FINRA and SIPC, is a sub-distributor of the HSBC Funds. Affiliates of HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. may receive fees for providing various services to the funds.

Risk Considerations: 
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective or will work under all market conditions. The value of investments may go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks, which should be considered carefully along with their investment objectives and fees. Equity investments fluctuate in value based on changes to an individual company’s financial condition and overall market conditions. Investments in foreign markets involve risks such as currency rate fluctuations, potential differences in accounting and taxation policies, as well as possible political, economic, and market risks. These risks are heightened for investments in emerging markets which are also subject to greater illiquidity and volatility than developed foreign markets. Frontier markets generally have smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets, and therefore investing in frontier markets can magnify the risks of investing in emerging markets. Fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed income security that result from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, a portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Investments in high yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities. The prices of high yield securities, which may be less liquid than higher rated securities, may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market, economic or political conditions. Risk is inherent in all investing. You could lose money by investing in the Money Market Fund (‘MM Fund’). Although the MM Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the MM Fund is not a deposit of HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The MM Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the MM Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the MM Fund at any time. For complete risk considerations, please refer to the fund's prospectus.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company and the mutual fund. For clients of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., please call 1-888-525-5757 for more information. For other investors and prospective investors, please call the Funds directly at 1-800-782-8183. You can download the fund prospectus from this site.  Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
US persons (both entities and individuals) are subject to US taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their US and non-US accounts. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a US law designed to prevent the use of non-US accounts or non-US entities to avoid US taxation of income and assets. To meet this objective, FATCA imposes on US and non-US entities certain documentation, due diligence, withholding and reporting requirements with respect to accounts and certain payments. Investors should consult their independent tax advisors about investment tax implications.  


Investment products are offered by HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (HSI), member NYSE/FINRA/SIPC. HSI is an affiliate of HSBC Bank USA, N.A.
