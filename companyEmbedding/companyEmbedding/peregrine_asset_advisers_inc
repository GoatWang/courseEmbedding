Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Should You Hire A Registered Investment Adviser?












Should You Hire A Registered Investment Adviser?
 A Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) can help you manage your assets and guide you to financial independence. RIAs provide crucial work when markets are volatile. The work of RIAs protects your assets and saves you the chore of interpreting news events.
The cost of hiring an adviser is very economical.
Short term movements in the markets can easily exceed the annual management fee of an adviser.
RIAs offer continuous financial and investment advice and put your interests first.
Usually, RIAs are fee only professionals and act as a fiduciary for clients. Fiduciary responsibility means your interests as a client comes before the interests of the RIA.
RIAs are required to disclose to you any conflicts of interest and are required to give you a brochure which outlines any potential conflicts.
This brochure will also include the adviser’s fee schedule and any regulatory or criminal record of the firm or its staff.
RIAs partner with brokerage firms like Fidelity and Schwab to hold client assets. RIAs are governed by rules set fourth by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or State Securities offices, depending on the size of the adviser’s assets under management.
Employees of RIAs often hold exemplary certifications such as Certified Financial Planner or Chartered Financial Analyst although these titles are not mandatory for firm personnel.
Finally, RIAs provide you a one on one relationship with a financial professional.
We are always readily available in an “old school” way to meet your immediate needs.

Investment Edge












Investment Edge

You need an edge from your money manager.
How do you receive an edge from Peregrine?
Our management is characterized by a hands-on approach. What does this mean? It means your portfolio will be managed to gain the most from the current investment environment. This work is constant and continuous so that your money will grow.
We invest in pillar companies.  These companies have the best growth prospects in the stock market and are marked as being exciting and innovative.  These companies are widely recognized and relevant.  Investing in these companies can make a big difference in your portfolio.
Our time-tested, comprehensive spectrum of research and management means you will invest in many stocks in order to find the pillars for your investment portfolio. All  investments chosen are designed so that you will make a profit but many of these stocks need to be sold because the companies don’t continue to meet stringent tests for holding them in a portfolio. Throughout the process of filtering  your portfolio, you should expect monthly cumulative trading profits from the stocks that are sold.
The one-two combination of long term gains and monthly short term profits will “..make your assets thrive” and give you an investment edge.
Trading profits and long term gains are the building blocks  to financial independence and “…making assets thrive.”

A lack of progress in Washington, international conflict, and the French elections has not been able to derail the markets. The S&P 500 is back to 2400, its record […]

2016 2nd Quarter Overview

The High Performing Portfolio
A high performing portfolio has a dual mandate to generate growth and minimize setbacks at the same time. A high performing portfolio strikes a balance that reflects the natural condition of the overall economy and has suitable diversification so that at least some investments within the portfolio will flourish given whatever circumstances occur.
To create a high performing portfolio, the construction process means a “pinch of this and a pinch of that,” culminating in an account that provides superior investment performance. Sometimes this process can take a while and test our patience. Ultimately, these carefully chosen components will reflect the good things happening in the investment ecosystem and the portfolio will deliver long term growth.
A high performing portfolio needs to own the most relevant companies in industry that shape the business landscape. These companies are recognizable names and their products and services are well known. Amazon, Facebook, Federal Express, Honeywell, John Deere, and Union Pacific are examples of holdings that we might use for client portfolios. These companies are impossible for investors to ignore.
A high performing portfolio needs stocks that hold the best relative strength. These are companies that have the best recent relative price performance compared to all other stocks. They may not be immediately recognized as household names. We currently own Acuity Brands in this category (up 50% since the February 11 low for the market). Ulta Salon and Equinix are also great examples of relative strength in the current market.
A high performing portfolio has investments that are complementary to the macro-economy. These investments benefit from prevailing economic themes. For example, the current economy is marked by low interest rates, muted economic growth, and central banks that are printing money. Under these economic conditions, dividend paying stocks, utilities, and gold, are more desirable to investors and will work well.
A high performing portfolio needs diversification. This means investing in areas which are out of favor or neglected by the investment mainstream. We invest in companies that are substantially down from historic levels as potential turnaround candidates. These investments give clients diversification because stocks that are oversold are more resilient, withstanding market downturns more readily. We also inject diversification by investing in foreign markets because these markets can perform differently than the US markets.
Finally, a high performing portfolio must generate profits. Our client investments need to be fruitful so this means selling stocks for gains. Stocks typically top out and decline at some point, so investment gains need to be harvested.
The construction of a high performing portfolio will lead to good long term growth for our client assets.
Lower Interest Rates Hikes Stocks
The markets have been getting good traction since June 16 and the S&P 500 has broken out to new all time highs in recent days. Despite this, the earnings reports from the S&P 500 companies are estimated to decline 6% in the quarter ending June 30. Generally, sales and earnings are actually falling, year over year. Furthermore, our economy is barely growing. Nevertheless, stocks are doggedly moving higher due to lower interest rates and highly accommodating central banks around the world.
Since stock valuation models are determined by interest rates, when interest rates decline, stock valuations rise. So, even if earnings decline, which is happening now, prices can rise due to lower long term interest rates.
We are relieved at the recent market rally but we realize these levels are only fractionally above the late 2014 levels. In addition, many broader market measures like the Russell 2000 and the New York Stock Exchange index rest below their 2013 highs. These lagging indices also might point to a catch up phase where the market rally broadens to include smaller companies. If recent gains hold and the market doesn’t slip back to its old range, we could really enjoy some momentum to the upside.
Brexit
Amidst the acrimony over this politically charged event, Brexit has not carried an enduring consequence to the US stock market.
Peregrine Portfolios
Client portfolios are on a path for a good year. Our Equity Composite gained 4.35% for 2016 through June 30. Our Balanced Composite is up 4.63%. The S&P 500 was up 2.7% for the first half of 2016. Further gains have happened in July. This strength can feed on itself as the market breaks out of its range.
Many companies present exciting opportunities. Along with Acuity Brands (mentioned above), bright prospects exist in Facebook, select steel companies, gold mining stocks, energy pipelines, foreign bonds, mortgages, real estate companies, and housing companies.
It is important that high performing portfolios earn compensation from interest and dividends. Many stocks offer dividends far above the yield on Treasury bonds and CDs so it is natural for us to invest in these companies for clients. In addition, many ETFs offer dividend yields which can give clients good returns with low risk.

Significant general stock market moves up and down can influence the performance of client portfolios. Composite returns are based on client portfolios of over $100,000. Not all clients are included in the composites. All returns include the reinvestment of dividends. All returns are net of fees. Composite returns are derived from aggregated, time-weighted returns for clients of Peregrine Asset Advisers. Individual client returns can deviate from the composite returns. While Peregrine uses the S&P 500 as a benchmark, Peregrine does not attempt to mimic the structure of this index. Individual client portfolios vary.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
