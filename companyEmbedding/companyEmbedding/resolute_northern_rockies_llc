Registration Statement on
Form S-3
Relating to an Aggregate $500,000,000
Offering Price and/or Principal Amount of Securities






Ladies and
Gentlemen:


     We have acted as
counsel to Resolute Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(“ Resolute ”), Hicks Acquisition Company I,
Inc., a Delaware corporation, Resolute Aneth, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, Resolute Natural Resources Company, LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company, Resolute Wyoming, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, BWNR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, WYNR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and
Resolute Northern Rockies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (collectively, the “ Guarantors ”), in
connection with the registration by Resolute and the Guarantors
pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the “
Registration Statement ”) under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “ Act ”), of an aggregate
$500,000,000 offering price and/or principal amount, as applicable,
of (i) senior and/or subordinate debt securities of Resolute
(together, the “ Debt Securities ”)
(ii) shares of Resolute common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share (the “ Common Stock ”), (iii) shares
of Resolute preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the
“ Preferred Stock ”), (iv) warrants to
purchase any of the Debt Securities, Common Stock or Preferred
Stock (the “ Warrants ”), (v) guarantees of
Debt Securities by the Guarantors (the “ Guarantees
”), (vi) rights to purchase Common Stock, Preferred
Stock, and/or Debt Securities (the “ Rights ”),
(vii) units consisting of two or more securities (the “
Units ”), and (vii) depositary shares (the
“ Depositary Shares ”). The Debt Securities,
Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Warrants, Guarantees, Rights, Units
and Depositary Shares are referred to collectively herein as the
“ Securities .”


     The Debt
Securities will be issued from time to time either in whole or in
part under one or more indentures (each, an “
Indenture ”), each of which will be between Resolute
and a trustee to be named in a supplement
(“Supplement”) to the prospectus (the “
Prospectus ”) included in the Registration Statement,
and, if applicable, one or more Guarantors as guarantors with
respect to such Debt Securities. Any Securities will be issued
pursuant to a Supplement to the Indenture pursuant to which the
corresponding Securities are issued. The Warrants will be issued
under one or more warrant agreements between Resolute and a banking
institution organized under the laws of the United States or
one

of the states
thereof (each, a “ Warrant Agreement ”). The
Rights will be issued under one or more rights agreements between
Resolute and a bank or trust company as rights agent (each, a
“ Rights Agreement ”). The Depositary Shares
will be issued under one or more deposit agreements between
Resolute and a bank or trust company as depositary (each, a “
Depositary Agreement ”).


     We have examined
and relied on originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate
records and other instruments, have made such inquiries as to
questions of fact of officers and representatives of Resolute and
the Guarantors, and have made such examinations of law as we have
deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of giving the opinion
expressed below. In such examination, we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals, and the conformity with the originals
of all documents submitted to us as copies.


     We have assumed
for purposes of this opinion (i) the corporate power,
authority and legal right of the trustees under the Indentures, the
banking institutions under the Warrant Agreements, the rights
agents under the Rights Agreements, and the banks or trust
companies under the Depositary Agreements to execute, deliver and
perform their obligations under the Indenture, Warrant Agreement,
Rights Agreement, or Depositary Agreement, as applicable, that the
performance of such obligations by any such trustee, banking
institution, rights agent, bank, or trust company will not violate
its charter or by-laws, or applicable organizational documents, and
that the trustee, banking institution, rights agent, bank, or trust
company has the legal ability to exercise their purported powers in
the State of Colorado, (ii) that the Indentures, Warrant
Agreements, Rights Agreements, and Depositary Agreements will have
been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the trustee,
banking institution, rights agent, bank, or trust company at the
time of issuance of the Debt Securities, Warrants, Rights, or
Depositary Shares, as applicable, (iii) that the aggregate number
of shares of Resolute which would be outstanding after the issuance
or reservation for issuance of the Securities, and any other
contemporaneously issued or reserved Common Stock or Preferred
Stock, together with the number of Common Stock and Preferred Stock
previously issued and outstanding and the number of shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock previously reserved for issuance
upon the conversion or exchange of other securities issued by
Resolute does not exceed the number of then authorized shares of
Resolute.


     The opinions
herein are limited to matters governed by the federal laws of the
United States of America and the laws of the State of Colorado, the
Delaware General Corporation Law and the Delaware Limited Liability
Company Act, including the provisions of the Delaware Constitution
and the reported judicial decisions interpreting such law. Except
as expressly stated above, we express no opinion with respect to
any other law of the state of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction.


     Based upon and
subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and
assumptions set
