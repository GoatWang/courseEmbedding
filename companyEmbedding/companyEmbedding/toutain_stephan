Such individuals may benefit from enhanced dental care to prevent or treat periodontitis and thereby lower their systemic inflammatory burden. Targeted management of systemic inflammation has been shown to help manage several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. The PerioPredict test is made available to employees in covered health plans under the supervision of a licensed dentist or physician, and the results provide important information to dental professionals for assessing prevention and treatment options for their patients. The PerioPredict test is run solely in Interleukin’s CLIA-certified lab in Waltham, MA. For more information, please visit www.PerioPredict.com.About Interleukin GeneticsInterleukin Genetics, Inc.
