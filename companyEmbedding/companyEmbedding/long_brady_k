What Tom Brady's New Hairdo Looks Like Without Hair Gel

  As 
  we reported last week, Tom Brady has a new hairdo.


  It's long on the top and shorter on the sides, and he spikes it
  up with some type of hair product.


  Today at Patriots mini camp, Brady stepped out with his new 'do
  without whatever hairspray, mousse, or gel he typically uses.


  Here's the result. It's a little floppy (via
  Mike Reiss of ESPN):





@MikeReiss




  Here it is after some work. Note the spikes:
