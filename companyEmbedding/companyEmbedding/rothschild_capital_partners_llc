What are analysts saying about Nasdaq stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Nasdaq stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Nasdaq remains focused on growth through acquisitions and organic initiatives that enable entry and cross-selling opportunities into new markets at a low-cost and highly-flexible platform. It displays prudence by accelerating its non-transaction revenue base. Nasdaq realigned its reporting segments to better reflect client orientation, rebranded its fixed income business and has decided to end its NLX interest rate futures business as well. However, elevated expenses restrict the desired margin expansion. Intense competition and regulatory issues remain key concerns. Also, shares of Nasdaq underperformed the Zacks categorized Securities Exchanges industry, year to date. The company is set to report second quarter release on Jul 26. According to our proven model a Zacks Rank #3 when combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes prediction difficult for a likely earnings beat." (7/17/2017)
2. UBS AG analysts commented, "Lowering 1Q17 EPS estimate to $1.06 from $1.09 vs. $1.09 Street consensus. Following NDAQ's February metrics release, we are lowering our 1Q EPS estimate to $1.06 from $1.09. This is now $0.03 below the latest Street consensus. Volumes for February were mixed relative to the prior month but were generally down y/y. QTD volumes are also mostly running down y/y, with US equities and options as well as OMX volumes all running below our prior forecasts. In addition to reducing our 1Q forecasts to reflect lower-than-previously-expected volumes in these areas (with the most downside from European derivatives), lower US FICC expectations add to the downside in our estimate revision. While we wait until next month for 1Q pricing data, we believe slightly disappointing volume trends (read: downside to near-term forecasts) could hold back the shares a bit tomorrow." (3/3/2017)
3. Barclays PLC analysts commented, "Industry U.S. cash equity average daily volume (ADV) in August was 6.1 million, down 7–8 percent," according to Barclays, "bringing our estimate for the quarter down to 6.5 million from 6.8 million."Market share fell 10bps to 16.6 percent, causing Barclays' third-quarter market share estimate to slip a bit to 16.7 percent. On the European cash side, the value of shares increased by 4 percent, while August ADV fell by 3 percent, pushing our 3Q16 estimate to 405k from 440k."Related Link: Happy National Beer Lover's Day! How Have Your Favorite Suds Performed In 2016?On the derivatives front, U.S. equity options ADV fell 8 percent sequentially to 12.6 million. Market share trends declined to 39.1 percent from 39.7 percent. As such, Barclays' third quarter estimate slipped to 39.5 percent from prior 40 percent.Meanwhile, European derivative ADV for August came in at 293,000 roughly 2 percent lower sequentially. "We expect ADV to improve in September given seasonal trends, but are lowering our 3Q16 forecast to 325k from 398k," (9/8/2016)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 6 Hold Ratings, 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.33)Consensus Price Target: $73.33 (1.34% downside)

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
