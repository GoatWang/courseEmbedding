Product Details

				Featuring a full set of rear horizontals and heavy-duty internal spreaders, this stepladder is ideal for professional contractors and industrial users. It features a lock-in system to secure tools from falling while keeping them right at hand. The fiberglass rails are nonconductive for working near electricity, and a bracing system helps protect them from damage. The double-riveted steps are knee braced and slip resistant. Back-up plates reinforce all top connectors.

Why is this contact information displayed?  

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Asked by: Ewald

            Thank you for your recent inquiry with The Home Depot. Unfortunately, we do not stock this item in an 8' x 10' size. The largest we carry is 5' x 8'. However, we do offer alternative models that may suit your needs. For any other questions, please call us at HomeDepot.com Customer Service 800-430-3376.

It looked great when we first received it. However after a couple vacuums the edges are coming undone. I expected it to be better quality with Home Depot putting there name by it.

        Great rug, but gets very dirty easily.
This rug is amazing, however the white colors show dirt too easily. I have it in my office here in Hawaii and the white parts of the "G" are already turning orange after a week or two. Might be permanently stained. Looks awesome though!

	                      "I wanted to 
	                      thank you for getting the new telephone batteries to us so soon!. We 
	                      were having phone problems and the quick service was appreciated. I 
	                      purchase many things from websites and once many of them have the order 
	                      they don't seem to worry about how long it takes for the products to 
	                      arrive... I really appreciate the follow-up to my status request email 
	                      and that the batteries arrived even sooner than we had planned."

5 Ft. Fiberglass Step-Ladder, Type IAA

The safe and durable Werner® 5-Foot Fiberglass Step Ladder, Type-IAA is ideal for many projects. It is duty rated for 375 pounds to support a full set of tools and supplies, and the HolsterTop lock-in system keeps them in place as well as nearby for easy access. A complete set of rear horizontals, as well as the internal heavy-duty spreaders make this Werner step ladder stable. The double-riveted and knee-braced TRACTION-TRED® steps provide for safe stepping on the slip-resistant step ladder. Its EDGE® system minimizes damage to the rail, and includes integrated foot pads. The 5-foot step ladder has non-conductive rails, making it an excellent choice for electricians. This ladder is ANSI- and OSHA-approved.
