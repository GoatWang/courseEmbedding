 In this beautifully illustrated book for children, Chico the cat describes the life of his "best friend", Pope Benedict, in this authorised biography of the Pope for young people approved by the Vatican.  "Dear Children, here you will find a biography that is different than others because it is told by a cat and it is not every day a cat can consider the Holy Father his friend and sit down to write his life story," the Pope's personal secretary, Monsignor Georg Ganswein, says in the foreword. The Pope is known for his fondness of animals, especially cats, and Joseph and Chico is narrated by Chico, a real cat who took up with the Pope in his native Germany long before he became the Pope. Chico tells the story of the life of "my best friend" from his birth in Germany in 1927, through his days as a young man, priest, bishop and cardinal.  With a colorful and sometimes amusing language, the author makes this funny cat tell us about the life of the young Joseph all the way up to his election as Pontiff on April 19, 2005. It recounts the Nazi era in Germany when the Pope was a teenager, calling the war years "one of the most dramatic and shameful times in the history of man". Later when he became Cardinal Ratzinger, Chico recounts how each time when the Cardinal returned to Germany from Rome for a vacation, the cat would run into his house and sit on his lap as he played the piano. The lavish color illustrations throughout make this a wonderful gift book and a cherished keepsake for people of all ages!

If some of the story is beyond quite small children, they would probably enjoy looking at and hearing about the pictures. Jeanne Perego does a good job with the story though as I learned some things about Pope Emeritus Benedict I didn't know before.The introduction is by Father Georg Ganswein, longtime personal secretary of Pope Emeritus Benedict, and now secretary to Pope Francis. What a book he'll be able to write someday (and I mean that in a good way). Father Georg writes in the introduction:"Pope Benedict never stops repeating that love is the secret to joy and peace in the world, that only Love, that is, God, can fulfill the desires of our hearts and give meaning to our lives?" (P. 4)A good lesson from the end of the book for children (and adults) from the mouth of Chico the cat about Pope Benedict reads:"He has shown you how you need to stay faithful and committed in life, without getting discouraged when difficulties arise." (P. 36)Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA Pope's Life As Told by a CatByjiffyon September 14, 2013Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseJoseph and Chico is a 37-page children's picture book dealing with the life of Joseph Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI, as told by a cat named Chico.  I have a strong bias in favor of realistic illustrations and these definitely are not realistic.  But the pictures are so charming that I didn't care.  They show various events in Joseph's life, especially during his youth, and Chico is always present.  Another reviewer pointed out that this was impossible because of the life span of cats, and I wondered about that, too.  But Chico mentions on page 28 that he first met Joseph when the priest became a professor at the University of Regensburg and lived next door to Chico's family.  So how did Chico get into the earlier pictures?  Maybe, as he told the story, he imagined himself as an observer to things that happened before he was born.  Other reviewers had problems with the reading level, which, granted, is too advanced for the youngest readers.  But adults can read it to young children in multiple sittings, and older children can read it themselves.  So can adults, who may enjoy it more than anyone.  It's a delightful biography of an admirable man, combined with a lot of extremely appealing cat pictures.  I loved it, and I think others will, too.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsEndearing and InformativeByPatricia L. Markson April 12, 2008Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThis tender book about Pope Benedict and his love of cats is very endearing and informative. It shows the gentle nature of a somewhat shy scholar who was reluctant when chosen Pope. His reputation as the stern head of the Holy Office preceded him. Now after these few years as Pontiff, he has become an beloved writer and thinker to so many.Read more0Comment|

        Bento boxes are a unique and stylish—yet simple—way to pack a waste-free lunch. In bento lunch boxes, every part of your meal can be compactly and neatly stowed, allowing you and your family to pack a zero-waste lunch in one convenient, self-contained space. In fact, the word “bento” is a slang term from the Song dynasty that means convenient! Each bento box you’ll find here features helpful dividers and small containers to keep food separate, fresh and uncontaminated. Choose your color, size, style and material—and let our kids bento boxes and bento boxes for adults organize your waste-free lunch and lifestyle.
