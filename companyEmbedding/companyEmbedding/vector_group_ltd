If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

3 Reasons Vector Group Ltd is Not a Top Dividend Stock
Is this even a cigarette company anymore? Can it continue to pay out such a big dividend?











                Brian Stoffel
            

                (TMFCheesehead)



            
            Dec 9, 2014 at 5:04PM
            
            





At first blush, it might actually seem like a fairy-tale investment for those nearing or in retirement: a company hawking an incredibly addictive product, a 7.2% dividend yield, and a yearly stock dividend that nets an additional 5% gain.
But if you don't dig into Vector Group's (NYSE:VGR) full story, you could be making a big mistake. The maker of ultra-discount cigarettes like Pyramid, Grand Prix, and e-cigarette Zoom isn't as solid as the stock's 40% jump in 2014 might have you believe.

Some of Vector Group's most popular discount brands. Source: Vector Group 
Here are three big reasons why investors need to be cautious when it comes to buying shares of this cigarette company.
Discount cigarettes are in steep decline For most of its life as a publicly traded company, Vector was one of the few players focused on the ultra-discount brands of cigarettes. It worked fairly well for them since bigger players like Altria and Reynolds American focused on the pricing power of upscale brands, and the rest was left to Vector.





But times have changed. Competition is heating up for discount cigarettes, and Vector is having trouble keeping pace. While the company's domestic market share topped out at 3.8% in 2011 -- following six straight years of increases -- it has declined to 3.3% over the past twelve months.
Within the discount cigarette industry, rivals have begun capturing more customers. Vector's cigarette business recorded a 5.3% drop in volume during the third quarter, and its market share within the sub-industry fell from 12.1% in 2012 to 11.6% last year.
It's not just cigarettes anymore Many retirees -- and dividend investors in general -- are comforted by buying shares of companies that produce things they understand. While buying shares of Vector Group might lead you to believe you are mainly investing in a cigarette company, that is quickly changing.
Perhaps sensing the decline in the discount cigarette market, Vector management began branching out a few years back into the real-estate business. Through its wholly owned subsidiary New Valley, Vector has a 70% stake in one of New York City's biggest residential real-estate companies, Douglas Elliman. From a purely financial standpoint, that decision has actually been a boon for investors and helps explain why shares are up 40% this year, despite declining cigarette volumes.





The amount of adjusted EBITDA the real-estate division has brought in has boomed over the past three years. In 2011, it accounted for just 11% of adjusted EBITDA; over the past twelve months that percentage has mushroomed to 25%.
At first glance this isn't a terrible development, but it requires extra due diligence on the part of investors and a realization that any trouble in the NYC real-estate market could wreak havoc on this cigarette company's cash flow.
An unsustainable dividend But perhaps the most damning evidence that Vector Group isn't a top dividend stock is the simple unsustainability of its dividend. In the end, there's a reason today's yield sits at about 7.2%: investors don't think it's that safe.
Consider the fact that free cash flow (FCF) -- the amount of cash a company puts in its pocket every year, minus capital expenditures -- is the lifeblood of any dividend paying company. Over the past four years, Vector's free cash flow has come nowhere near being able to cover the company's payouts.






Vector Group's Unsustainable Dividend |Create infographics
It should be noted that in last quarter's investor presentation, management showed how Pro-Forma FCF was much higher than in the chart above, but that these numbers represented "Pro-Forma Adjusted EBITDA less Pro-Forma Capital Expenditures."
Unfortunately, the whole reason to analyze a company's FCF -- instead of earnings or pro forma adjusted EBITDA -- is because it represents the real amount of money a company took in during a year, minus what it spent on capital expenditures. By using pro forma adjusted EBITDA, we simply don't get the same kind of reliability.
Add these three factors together, and I think there are definitely better places for your investment dollars today.

Vector Group Ltd. – Welcome


 























 Welcome
Dear Investors, Customers, Employees and Friends:
Welcome to the Vector Group Ltd. website. Through our subsidiaries, Liggett Group LLC and Vector Tobacco Inc., we manufacture and market high quality cigarette products to adult smokers in the United States. Vector Group also owns New Valley LLC.
Vector Group’s tobacco subsidiaries have a proud history of charting an independent course in the tobacco industry, dating from Liggett’s founding in 1873. In 1996, Liggett became the first tobacco company to settle certain smoking-related litigation. A year later, we led Liggett into its landmark announcement that smoking is addictive and causes cancer and other health ailments. To this day, Liggett – the fourth largest cigarette manufacturer in the U.S. – remains the only major tobacco company to carry “Smoking Is Addictive” warning labels on its cigarette packs and to list ingredients on its cartons. Liggett has a strong collection of discount cigarette brands, which includes Eve, Grand Prix, Pyramid, Liggett Select and Eagle 20’s.
Vector Group is also involved in the real estate business through its New Valley subsidiary. New Valley owns a 70.59% ownership interest in Douglas Elliman Realty LLC, which operates the largest residential real estate brokerage company in the New York metropolitan area. New Valley also holds investments in several significant real estate projects in California and New York.
We continue to strive to deliver high quality products to our customers and increased value to our stockholders. We thank our stockholders, employees, customers and clients for their continued support.
Sincerely,

Howard M. Lorber
President & Chief Executive Officer

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
