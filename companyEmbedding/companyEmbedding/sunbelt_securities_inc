Financial Goals for Our Clients
For each of our clients, we strive to help create financial stability and security with the end goal of financial independence. Not only will you find our financial advisors knowledgeable, but you will also discover that our staff truly cares about making your financial goals a reality. 
As your financial advisor, we will do everything in our power to keep you focused on where you want to go, advise you on how to get there, and continually remind you of the importance of maintaining a disciplined approach to reach your goals.
Product Definitions

Fixed Annuity:  A Fixed Annuity is one under which the insurer, rather than the contract owner, bears the risk of loss of principal. The insurer guarantees the contract owner that the principal will not be lost, regardless of the insurers investment performance; and that the interest at least equal to a stated minimum rate will be credited to the contract.
Variable Annuity:  Unlike a fixed annuity, in which the insurer bears the investment risk, contract owners of variable annuities bear the risk of loss of principal to the extent that the variable annuity premiums are allocated (by the contract owner) to the insurers separate account. To the extent that the variable annuity premiums are allocated to the separate account, the accumulated value of the variable annuity depends upon the performance of the variable subaccounts to which the premiums are allocated. In a variable annuity, the contract owner may allocate his or her premiums to the separate account or the fixed account.
Corporate Bonds:  A Corporate Bond is a bond issued by a corporation. It is a bond that a corporation issues to raise money in order to expand its business. The term is usually applied to longer-term debt instruments, generally with a maturity date falling at least a year after their issue date.
Education Savings Accounts:  A Coverdell Education Savings Account (also known as an Education Savings Account, a Coverdell ESA, a Coverdell Account, or just an ESA and formerly known as an Education Individual Retirement Account), is a tax-advantaged investment account in the United States designed to encourage savings to cover future education expenses (elementary, secondary or college), such as tuition, books, uniform, etc.
Government Bonds:   A government bond is a bond issued by a national government denominated in the country's own currency. Bonds issued by national governments in foreign currencies are normally referred to as sovereign bonds.
Keoghs:  Keogh plans are full-fledged pension plans for self-employed people in the United States.
Long - Term Care Insurance:  An insurance product sold in the United States and United Kingdom, helps provide for the cost of long-term care beyond a predetermined period. Long-term care insurance covers care generally not covered by health insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid.  Individuals who require long-term care are generally not sick in the traditional sense, but instead, are unable to perform the basic activities of daily living (ADLs) such as dressing, bathing, eating, toileting, continence, transferring (getting in and out of a bed or chair), and walking.
Municipal Bonds:  A municipal bond is a bond issued by a city or other local government, or their agencies. Potential issuers of municipal bonds include cities, counties, redevelopment agencies, school districts, publicly owned airports and seaports, and any other governmental entity (or group of governments) below the state level. Municipal bonds may be general obligations of the issuer or secured by specified revenues. Interest income received by holders of municipal bonds is often exempt from the federal income tax and from the income tax of the state in which they are issued, although municipal bonds issued for certain purposes may not be tax exempt.
Stocks:  In the investment world, a share of stock (also referred to as equity share) represents a share of ownership in a corporation (company). In the plural, stocks is often used as a synonym for shares especially in the United States, but it is less commonly used that way outside of North America.
401 (k) Employee Plans:  A 401(k) plan allows a worker to save for retirement and have the savings invested while deferring current income taxes on the saved money and earnings until withdrawal. The employee elects to have a portion of his or her wages paid directly, or "deferred," into his or her 401(k) account. This deferment is also known as a "contribution".
403 (b) Retirement Planning:  A 403(b) plan is a tax-advantaged retirement savings plan available for public education organizations, some non-profit employers (only US Tax Code 501(c)(3) organizations),Cooperative hospital service organizations and self-employed ministers in the United States. It has tax treatment similar to a 401(k) plan, especially after the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.
Managed Account Solutions:  A fee-based investment management product for high net worth individuals. The appeal of Managed Accounts is the access to professional money managers, high degree of customization and greater tax efficiencies in a fee-based product.
Alternative Investments:  An investment product other than traditional investments such as stocks, bonds or cash. This broad definition makes it impossible to list all alternative strategies, but the most important areas are real estate, private equity, venture capital, commodities, and hedged or absolute return strategies. Wine, art and antiques, indeed any business of value, might also be considered as an alternative investment. One common theme to alternative investments is that they are often hoped to have modest correlations with traditional investments and so to increase the diversification of investor's portfolios.
Key person insurance:  Key person insurance is needed if the sudden loss of a key executive would have a large negative effect on the company's operations. The payout provided from the death of the executive essentially buys the company time to find a new person or to implement other strategies to continue the business.
Mutual Fund:  Mutual funds give investors access to professionally managed, diversified portfolios of equities, bonds and other securities. Each shareholder participates proportionally in the gain or loss of the fund. Mutual fund units, or shares, are issued and can typically be purchased or redeemed as needed at the fund's current net asset value (NAV) per share, which is sometimes expressed as NAVPS.

Sunbelt Securities Inc.'s Business Continuity Planning
 

Sunbelt Securities, Inc. has developed a Business Continuity Plan on how we will respond to events that significantly disrupt our
business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to
actual events as they occur. With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.
CONTACTING US  If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us as you usually do at 713-965-9510, you should
call our alternative number 713-253-4700 (Patrick Smetek) or 713-819-1439 (David Smetek) or go to our website at
www.sunbeltsecurities.com. If you cannot access us through either of those means, you should contact Ray Miller at 713-614-7777
or contact your Registered Representative directly.
OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN  We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business
disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the
firms books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to
permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.
Our business continuity plan addresses: data backup and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational
assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees;
critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their
funds and securities if we are unable to continue our business.
Our clearing firm, NFS, backs up our important records in a geographically separate area. While every emergency situation poses
unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, we have been advised by our
clearing firm that its objective is to restore its own operations and be able to complete existing transactions and accept new
transactions and payments within the same business day. Your orders and requests for funds and securities could be delayed during
this period.
VARYING DISRUPTIONS  Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our
firm, the business district where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region. Within each of these areas,
the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In a disruption to only our firm or a building housing our firm, we
will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect to recover and resume business within the same business day. In
a disruption affecting our business district, city, or region, we will transfer our operations to a site outside of the affected area, and
recover and resume business within 2-3 business days. In either situation, we plan to continue in business, transfer operations to our
clearing firm if necessary, and notify you through our web site www.sunbeltsecurities.com or customer emergency number, 713-
253-4700 how to contact us. If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, you
may contact the NFS Customer Service Line at 800-801-9942 which will assure our customers prompt access to their funds and
securities. (Please note that the representatives at this number will only be able to assist you with your account in the event that our
firm goes out of business entirely. If this is not the case and we are simply experiencing a temporary business disruption, you should
follow the alternate routes of contact previously mentioned.)
FOR MORE INFORMATION  If you have questions about our business continuity planning, you can contact us at 713-965-9510.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
