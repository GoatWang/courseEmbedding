Strategic Storage Trust IV intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ending December 31, 2017 and will offer up to $1.0 billion in shares of its common stock in its primary offering, consisting of three classes of shares: Class A shares for $25.00 per share (up to $450 million in shares), Class T shares for $24.21 per share (up to $450 million in shares), and Class W shares for $22.75 per share (up to $100 million in shares). 
Strategic Storage Trust IV's share classes are designed for and available for different categories of investors. All investors may choose to purchase Class A or Class T shares in the offering, while Class W shares are only available to investors purchasing through certain fee-based programs or registered investment advisors.
