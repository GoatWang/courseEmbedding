Synthesis Energy Systems, Inc. Key Developments

Synthesis Energy Systems, Inc. Announces Successful Completion of 4-System Performance Testing at Capacity Aluminum Corporation of China Industrial Syngas Facility
Jul 24 17
Synthesis Energy Systems, Inc. announced that the capacity industrial syngas facility for Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (CHALCO) with four SGT systems, CHALCO Henan, has successfully completed performance testing. This concludes successful performance testing at all seven SGT systems installed for CHALCO. SES Gasification Technology (SGT) is supplying stable and reliable industrial synthesis gas to three CHALCO aluminum hydroxide processing facilities, in Henan, Shanxi and Shandong provinces. The Aluminum Corporation of China’s CHALCO Henan facility, with four SGT systems has a syngas capacity of 120,000 Nm3 per hour. The initial start-up of the facility was reported to be complete in April 2017. The three-facility Aluminum Corporation of China order was secured by Tianwo-SES Clean Energy Technologies Co. Ltd., SES’s joint venture with Suzhou THVOW Technology Co. Ltd. (THVOW). Tianwo-SES provided the SGT technology design and proprietary gasification equipment for CHALCO’s alumina upgrade projects with a total of seven SGT systems now in operation for the customer: CHALCO Henan, CHALCO Shanxi, and CHALCO Shandong.


Nasdaq Approves To Transfer Synthesis Energy Systems' Listing From The Nasdaq Global Market To The Nasdaq Capital Market
Jun 28 17
On June 27, 2017, Synthesis Energy Systems, Inc. received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq”), approving the transfer of the listing of the Company’s common stock from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market. This transfer will be effective at the opening of business on June 29, 2017. The Nasdaq Capital Market operates in substantially the same manner as the Nasdaq Global Market, and listed companies must meet certain financial requirements and comply with Nasdaq’s corporate governance requirements. The Company’s common stock will continue to trade under the symbol “SYMX.” Following the transfer of its listing, the Company has been granted an additional 180-day period, or until December 18, 2017 (the “Compliance Date”), to regain compliance with Bid Price Rule. If, at any time before the Compliance Date, the bid price for the Company’s common stock closes at $1.00 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days as required under the Compliance Period Rule, the Staff will provide written notification to the Company that it complies with the Bid Price Rule, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend this 10 day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(F). If the Company does not regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by the Compliance Date, the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq will provide written notification to the Company that its common stock may be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal the Staff’s delisting determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (“Panel”). The Company expects that its stock would remain listed pending the Panel’s decision. There can be no assurance that, if the Company does appeal a delisting determination to the Panel, that such appeal would be successful. The Company has provided written notice of its intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency prior to the Compliance Date, including by carrying out a reverse stock split, if necessary.
