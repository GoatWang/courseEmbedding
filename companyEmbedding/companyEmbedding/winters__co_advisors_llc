Crossover Refunding Utilizing Investment Agreement Escrows              
Due to the current relatively low U.S. Treasury rates versus municipal
                bond rates, and relatively high investment agreement rates versus
                Treasury rates, it is now possible to utilize a crossover refunding
                to complete advance refundings that are not economically feasible
              with traditional open market escrows. 
 In a traditional advance refunding, refunding bonds are sold
                and the proceeds are used to purchase an open market escrow, or
                defeasance escrow, consisting of direct U.S. Government obligations.
                The principal and interest from the escrow is used to make the
                debt service payments on the refunded bonds until the call date
                and to call the bonds on the call date. In a crossover refunding,
                the proceeds from the new bond issue are used to purchase an investment
                agreement. This investment agreement, which has a higher yield
                than an open market escrow, will make the debt service payments
                on the new bonds until the call date. On the call date, the investment
                agreement matures and the proceeds from the investment agreement
                are used to retire the old, or refunded bonds. At that point, the
                revenues that previously supported the debt service payments on
              the old bonds "crossover" to support the new bonds. 
 The investment agreements used in crossover refundings are generally
                provided by entities rated "A" or are collateralized. In order to
                comply with U.S. Treasury arbitrage regulations requiring that
                investments be purchased at fair market value in an arms length
                transaction, the crossover refunding investment agreement is generally
              purchased through a bid process. 
 Obtaining the rate for a crossover refunding investment agreement
                can be done very quickly. In order to provide indicative rates
                we need only a schedule showing the escrow requirements and the
                permitted investment definition. A bid to obtain the investment
                agreement can be completed in as little as two days and closing
              generally takes place within two weeks.
