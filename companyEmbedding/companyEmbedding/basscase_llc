User Instructions – BassCase


































Open Menu








User Instructions

February 07, 2017
Tags: Instructions









First of all thank you for your business. We are a small company and appreciate all of our customers. Some customers did not receive their instruction sheet in their packaging. So in addition to the diagram image above, below you will find some further instructions on how to operate BassCase.
The switch on the back has three positions. The furthest left is "Off".
The middle position is the Bluetooth position. To play music put the switch into the Bluetooth position. Make sure your phone's Bluetooth is turned on and look for "BassCase" on the list of Bluetooth devices nearby. Simply click "connect". Now when you watch a movie, play music or play any audio on your phone it will come out of the BassCase speakers. In the future, since your phone is already paired to BassCase you would only need to put the switch in the middle position in order for it to automatically connect.
The far right position is the charging "lightning bolt" position. This position connects the BassCase to the phone electronically which allows power transfer from BassCase to the phone when it is plugged in OR when you need extra power on the go. So if you are not plugged into the wall and want to run the power from the BassCase battery to your phone battery; you would simply move the switch to the lightning bolt position. The BassCase battery, however, will charge no matter what position the switch is in. Therefore, you can charge BassCase while it is playing music. This will allow you to use it as a standalone speaker for endless music play.
The charger cord must be pushed firmly to ensure it goes all the way in to BassCase or you might see it go back and forth from charging to not charging.
Please let us know if you have any other questions. By emailing [email protected]
Regards,
Tom Edson

Description


Shop Policies






This is a large "BassCase" (patent pending). My cases have become widely popular in the last year with drummers of many different genres. They are extremely versatile due to the particular cases I choose. Each one comes ready to plug up and play with a external xlr input and a internal xlr microphone cable to connect your favorite low end mic (mic not included). Each one has a felt top pedal connection to allow for a tight hold of your bass drum pedal, works best with a cotton beater. Each also has rubber feet to ensure your case stays put even through the heaviest hits. All of my cases come with a quick guide to help you or your sound tech eq your BassCase to bring out its best possible tone. These things are great for every setting and I use mine regularly at multiple venues and pretty much everywhere. They pack a punch! I am asking $150 obo for this one plus shipping. You won't be disappointed!

Brian: Coming from a not so fortunate upbringing, music was something that played a vital role in the structure of my life. Music helped build my character and values growing up. Being apart of the metalcore scene, just like the rave scene it was and still is given a bad rep from the mainstream media, but to be honest they couldn't be more wrong. A band like Hatebreed is not be to judged by cover or name-hands down this was the most influential band that impacted my life and taught me to stand up for what I believe in, to never give up, and to live for something or die for nothing. This lead me to join the military, to make something of cards that were dealt to me, which ultimately lead me here. But that helped build my heart but not fill it, that's where dance music comes in. Dance music helped me fill my heart and open my mind. The scene being so welcoming and open minded is something I was not use to. EDM drove me to want to learn how to dance. The many genres of EDM bring you through their own unique emotional ride, where you can express yourself through many different styles of dancing. My relationship with music is the definition of true love. I learn how to love something so much that it showed me what love meant on a whole other level, which allowed me to love the people and things in my life even more. Cody: Umm...Not sure how to follow that but, umm, if it was legal, I would marry music if I could.
 
Interview

Hometown: Memphis, TN
Currently Living: San Diego, CA
Origin of Name: "Music All Day Everyday." We listen to music all day everyday. Music has always been there every step of our days; it's a major part of our lives.
Weapon of Choice: One mind, any weapon.
Source of Power: 
Brian: Hatebreed, Throwdown, Headhunterz, Trance Generators, Zatox, Killswitch Engage;
Cody: Pink Floyd!!!;
Both: Armin Van Buuren, Above & Beyond, Andrew Rayel, Markus Schulz, Dash Berlin, Cosmic Gate, W&W, Showtek, Eminem, Linkin Park. The list can go on and on…
Are there any dots to connect with where/how you grew up to your musical output?
Honestly, none. We both had no musical education experience growing up. Once we were introduced to dance music and decided we wanted to create our own is when we started making dots to connect.
What's the strangest part of your job?
Balancing our busy military careers, multiple deployments, and finding time to pursue a dream that requires a great amount of time and work. Seeing it get to this level is really mind blowing. "Pursuit of happiness."
What is the biggest misconception about being a DJ?
It's not all fun and games, there is a lot of hard work and long nights put into it.
What is your ultimate career dream?
To play at A State of Trance!
Are you impulsive with your work or do you have a sketch in mind before you start?
Both, some days you're on and some days you can't even make a paper plane.
How, if at all, does listening to music figure into your creative process?
You have to understand how to be a good follower in order to be a great leader. So we believe in being good listeners to inspire us to become great producers. There are a lot of unbelievably talented artists out there that you can gain a great amount of knowledge from just by listening to their music.
If we pressed Shuffle on your iPod while you went to the bathroom, what would you be embarrassed to come back to us listening to?
There are some tracks on our iPods that would embarrass people just for being in the room while they're on. But we're not ones to get embarrassed by music we love.
What should everyone just shut the fuck up about?
Stop highlight the problems in the scene and work on coming up with solutions to make it better.
What gets you excited when you think about the future of electronic music and club culture?
The fact that we get to be a part of it.
When you look at electronic music and the surrounding culture, what worries you about the future?
It's commercializing; people are starting to forget the foundation that the scene was built upon and we need to work towards reeducating, not only for safety but for the overall experience.
How would you describe your sound to a deaf person?
Show them a heart.
Tell me about your most memorable night out as an artist or as a fan.
When Cosmic Gate premiered their Wake Your Mind album with Emma Hewitt at Nocturnal 2011. It was such an emotional set.
Do you have a favorite all-time mixed CD or series?
Backstreet Boys Millennium…JK
Brian: All That Remains The Fall of Ideals
Cody: Armin Van Buuren's Universal Religion…can't pick just one.

bassCASE Bio:
bassCASE, the mastermind behind the intriguing music productions of bassCASE; was born and raised in San Diego, CA. His musical influences were generated from early Rock & Roll, and his thematic roots come from an old school hip-hop background. His love for Electronic Dance Music evolved at the age of 16, when Southern California's 'Underground' and 'Massive Festival' scene began to marry. Upon stumbling across dance music, his passion fell deeper than the lights and unity of people- his passion for production became his driving force, and his career. bassCASE worked with various production and lighting companies both inside and beyond music festivals, and smaller parties. Sound design became bassCASE's ultimate ambition, and he pursued a lucrative career in audio engineering. His dream is to not only be a part of the overall music production side of things but, also to one day have his own company engineering music equipment for electronic music producers around the world. Today, bassCASE has proved himself as a sound engineer, a producer, DJ, and all around savvy dance music individual.

Every musician needs to transport his or her instrumentâ€”that's just a fact of life. Getting your bass guitar from place to place in one piece is reason enough to put it in a case. You'll have an easy time carrying the bass around with a case's handle, and the shell will stand between your instrument and anything that might cause damage or knock it out of tune.  A rigid case is especially important if you travel often, where it will have to contend with such hazards as packed touring vans or careless airline baggage handlers. There are plenty of hard shell cases to choose from, giving you your choice of exterior and interior fit and finish. The traditional rigid electric bass case is rectangular, but you could also go with a violin-shaped case if that's more your speedâ€”or if you're moving an acoustic bass guitar, of course.  For less demanding travel, there are also plenty of soft cases available. If you're jumping in the car to bring your bass to your buddy's house for a jam session or heading to a downtown gig from your place in the suburbs, a soft case makes a lot of sense. It'll be lighter and a bit easier to carry, not to mention more compact. Soft cases are easy to store, since you can collapse them down and stuff them in the back of a closet to save space.  Be sure to consider the extras when you're picking out a case, no matter which type you're looking for. How much storage space do you need in the case for your picks, extra strings and other accessories? Do you want to be able to lock the case? Maybe you'd like a case with roller wheels to make it easier to tote through mazelike airport terminals. Check that you're getting all the features you need.  Whether you're just getting into the bass and looking for your first case or you're a seasoned pro replacing one that's served you well, all of our bass guitar cases are worth a good look. The right case for you will be one that fits your bass model, can stand up to the travel you plan to use it for and has the storage space and features that you need.

Whether it’s because your old gig big has seen better days, you are gearing up for a tour, or you’re ready to project a more professional image, you’ve decided it’s time to upgrade to a hard shell bass guitar case. After all, it’s not worth it to take a chance on subpar protection for your bass. That’s why we carry a wide variety of bass cases for all different body styles.

Whether you’re going to a gig across town or across the country, we have a hard shell case that will fit your bass like a glove and protect it from whatever it encounters on the road. You can choose from a variety of shapes and styles. Among our large selection of rectangle cases, individual features distinguish each case. A standard wood case clad with tolex will do a fine job protecting your instrument from dings and scratches. And we carry models that fit nearly any bass shape.

Want even more protection and security? Take a look at our molded ABS cases with aluminum fittings. These are light, economical, and very shock resistant. Your bass will rest in comfort, thanks to the plush foam interior. These are great options for regular gigging and short tours. But if you are preparing for hardcore traveling, such as going overseas or frequent flight travel, you will want something a bit more rugged. One popular option is the wood-sided ATA compliant flight case, with tough, spring loaded handles, recessed latches, and reinforced corner pieces. Alternately, go can for a fully waterproof bass guitar case, with ultra-high strength polymer resin construction, and corrosion resistant hardware and wheels. 

Let’s not forget about aesthetics. Maybe what you really want is good protection in a case that looks as sharp as you. Then you’ll definitely want to check out our vintage inspired Tolex and tweed clad cases. These quality enclosures will transport your instrument with just the right amount of style. We also carry a huge selection of aftermarket cases designed for specific brands and models. These are seriously tough pieces of kit with an interior cavity moulded to fit your exact bass.

Rest assured that we have a bass guitar case for every instrument and scenario. But if you don’t want to leave anything to chance, call us. A short chat with one of our Sales Engineers will help you identify all the options for your specific instrument. We are committed to ensuring you get the perfect case for your bass guitar. And all of our bass guitar cases will give you peace of mind whenever your bass is out of sight.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
