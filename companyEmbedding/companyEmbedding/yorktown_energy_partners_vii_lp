DENVER, Aug. 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- (Nasdaq:   HNRG)  Hallador Energy Company (Hallador) has been advised by Yorktown Partners LLC ("Yorktown") that Yorktown Energy Partners VII, L.P. distributed 700,000 shares (about 2% of the total outstanding shares) of Hallador common stock to its limited and general partners after the close of the stock market on August 19, 2015.  After yesterday's distribution, Yorktown will collectively hold 7.85 million shares of Hallador common stock representing a 27% ownership.  Yorktown informed us that they have not made any determination as to the disposition of their remaining shares. 
We were also advised that the shares distributed can be immediately sold.  
While we do not know Yorktown's ultimate strategy to realize the value of their investment, we expect that over time distributions such as this will improve our liquidity and float.
Hallador is headquartered in Denver, Colorado and through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sunrise Coal, LLC, produces coal in the Illinois Basin for the electric power generation industry.  To learn more about Hallador or Sunrise, visit our websites at www.halladorenergy.com or www.sunrisecoal.com.

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and based on 29,044,000 shares of the Common Stock of the Company issued and outstanding as of August 5, 2015. 
(c) On August 19, 2015, Yorktown distributed in-kind, on a pro rata basis and for no additional consideration, in accordance with its

Exhibit 10.7

CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE










 
 
 


$10,000,000
 
June 25, 2007




     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Approach Oil
& Gas Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”),
hereby promises to pay to the order of YORKTOWN ENERGY PARTNERS
VII, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the
“Lender”), the principal sum of Ten Million and no/100
Dollars ($10,000,000), together with interest thereon from the date
of this Convertible Promissory Note (this “Note”) on
the unpaid principal balance. Interest shall accrue at a rate of
seven percent (7%) per annum based on a three hundred sixty-five
(365) – day year and compounded annually. Principal and
accrued interest shall be due and payable on the third anniversary
of the date of this Note; provided, that the Company shall have the
right to prepay the principal in whole or in part from time to time
without premium or penalty provided that the Company gives the
Lender at least fifteen (15) days prior notice of such
prepayment. Lender shall have the right to exercise its conversion
rights in whole or in part prior to such prepayment.

     All payments shall be made in lawful
money of the United States of America at the principal office of
the Lender, or at such other place as the holder hereof may from
time to time designate in writing to the Company. All payments
shall be credited first to the accrued interest then due and
payable and the remainder applied to principal.

     At any time commencing
December 31, 2007 or earlier in connection with the
Company’s prepayment hereof or the occurrence of a
“Sales Event” as defined below, the Lender shall have
the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to convert all or
any portion of the unpaid principal of and interest on this Note
into shares of the equity securities of the Company or any
successor to the Company of any class or classes issued by the
Company or its successor prior to the date of the Lender’s
election. Except as provided below with respect to an automatic
conversion upon the occurrence of an IPO (defined below), the
number of shares of such equity securities to be issued upon such
conversion shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(a) by (b), where (a) is the outstanding principal and
accrued interest of this Note (or such portion as will be
converted), and (b) is (i) the lowest price per share
that equity securities in any such class have been issued by the
Company, or (ii) if no such shares have been issued, then at
One Hundred and no/100 Dollars ($100) per share. The conversion
price will be subject to adjustment to provide the Lender with full
antidilution protection in the case of any stock splits,
recapitalizations or changes in capital structure of the Company or
the issuance of options, warrants, or other rights to acquire or
convertible into equity securities of the Company excluding only
options, warrants, rights or other equity-based awards issued as
part of reasonable compensation plans approved by the
Company’s Board of Directors. Shares issued for consideration
other than cash shall be deemed to be issued at the fair market
value of the consideration given for them.

     The first day on which both of the
following transactions shall have been consummated shall be
referred to herein as the “IPO Conversion Date”:
(a) the initial sale by Approach Resources Inc., a Delaware
corporation, of shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per
share

  



 

(the
“Approach Common Stock”), to the public pursuant to a
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(“IPO”), and (b) the exchange of all outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for shares of Approach Common Stock
and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the
terms of a contribution agreement by and among Approach, the
Company and certain other parties thereto (the “Contribution
Agreement”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, this Note shall, on the IPO Conversion Date,
automatically and without further action required by any person,
convert into shares of Approach Common Stock. The number of shares
of Approach Common Stock to be issued upon such automatic
conversion shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(a) by (b), where (a) is the outstanding principal and
accrued interest of this Note, and (b) is the initial public
offering price per share, less any underwriting discount per share
for the shares of Approach Common Stock that are issued in the IPO.
The shares of Approach Common Stock issued to Lender upon any
automatic conversion of this Note shall be entitled to the same
registration rights as those provided to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares are exchanged into shares of
Approach Common Stock pursuant to the Contribution Agreement.
Approach shall execute an agreement with the Lender reflecting
those rights on or prior to the IPO Conversion Date.

     The Lender shall be granted no less
protective rights with regards to such shares of equity securities
(including preferences and voting rights) acquired pursuant to the
conversion of this Note as are granted to any other holder of such
shares of equity securities. If only a portion of this Note is
converted into equity securities, the Company shall return this
Note to the Lender with a notation thereon of the remaining
outstanding principal of this Note or, at the request of the
Lender, shall issue and deliver to the Lender a replacement
convertible secured promissory note for the remaining outstanding
balance hereof, such Note containing the same material terms as set
forth herein. The issuance of certificates for shares of equity
securities upon conversion of this Note will be made without charge
to the Lender for any issuance tax in respect thereof or other cost
incurred by the Company in connection with such conversion and the
related issuance of shares of equity securities. Upon conversion of
this Note, the Company will take all such actions as are necessary
in order to ensure that the shares issuable with respect to such
conversion will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable.

     The following will be deemed to
constitute events of default under the Note:



 
a)
 
The Company shall fail to make when due any payment of
principal or interest under this Note and such failure shall remain
uncured for a period of five (5) business days.


 


 
b)
 
The Company shall fail to perform or observe, in any material
respect, any provision of this Note or any

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
