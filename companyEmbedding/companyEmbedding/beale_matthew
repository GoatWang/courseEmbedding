A Multnomah County jury on Friday ordered a medical-device company to pay $4.75 million to a Portland man and his wife in a product liability lawsuit that may have national implications. 
The jury found I-Flow Corp. liable for destroying the cartilage in Matthew Beale's right shoulder and leaving the 38-year-old father of four with constant pain and a disabled arm. 
I-Flow, according to the lawsuit, encouraged surgeons to use a "pain pump," which delivers pain medication via a catheter to the affected spot, in an unapproved and unsafe manner for patients recovering from shoulder-joint surgery. 
The verdict is notable not just for its size but also because I-Flow and other manufacturers face hundreds of similar lawsuits alleging that such pumps have caused severe cartilage deterioration, called chondrolysis, in patients around the country. 
After dozens of reports of chondrolysis, the Food and Drug Administration in November issued a statement clarifying that it has not approved such devices for prolonged infusion of medicine to joints. 
"It's a great verdict for this family but also a great verdict for all the plaintiffs out there," said John Coletti, the lead attorney for the Beale family, which declined to comment. "I-Flow wanted to use this family as a test case, and they (the jury) sent a message. It's one of those messages that hopefully will be heard nationally." 
The three-week trial drew national interest, with people crowding Judge Youlee You's courtroom to listen. The jury started deliberations Thursday afternoon. 
I-Flow, now part of household goods conglomerate Kimberly-Clark Corp., plans to appeal. 
"Obviously, we're very disappointed with the outcome of this trial," said Kay Jackson, a spokeswoman for Dallas, Texas-based Kimberly-Clark, which markets Kleenex tissues, Huggies diapers and other products. 
Kimberly-Clark, which on Friday reported a 2009 profit of just less than $2 billion, bought California-based I-Flow for $325 million late last year. 
Jackson declined to comment further. Eric Neiman, the Portland attorney for the company, also declined to comment. 
The case dates to 2004 when Beale was playing a pickup game of football and "tweaked his shoulder," said Tom Powers, another attorney for the family. 
A Beaverton doctor, Brooke Benz, performed arthroscopic surgery to repair Beale's torn bicep. The doctor then inserted the catheter portion of an I-Flow pain pump into the shoulder joint, where it released pain medication for 2 1/2 days. 
Beale seemed to recover at first, Powers said. But after about six months, he noticed stiffness, clicking sounds and pain. The pain intensified. After multiple visits, doctors found that the once-healthy cartilage had been eaten away, leaving bone-on-bone friction that was "excruciating," Powers said. 
Lawyers for the Beale family argued that I-Flow had been pushing surgeons to use its pain pump directly into the joint area as a new avenue for making money. They failed to conduct testing or pay heed to safety concerns, the lawyers said. 
"It was a disastrous marketing decision that led to medical disasters for all these people," Powers said. The doctor, who was initially named in the lawsuit, was later dropped from the case. 
These days, Beale is in constant pain, his lawyers said, with motion limited to below his elbow. He has difficulty playing with his kids and shaking hands, and is trying to learn how to do everything with his left arm. 
The verdict includes a $1.275 million award for Krista Beale, Matthew Beale's wife, for loss of consortium. "She literally becomes his right hand," Powers said, helping him with tasks such as getting dressed. 
Beale has had a partial shoulder replacement and faces three to five replacements in his lifetime, Powers said. 
And although he can still do his job as a commodities broker for Electro Scientific Industries Inc., Powers said, it is unlikely he will be able to continue in his work until retirement age because of intensifying pain. 
"These companies have to understand that if you don't know about its safety, you test for it," said Powers. "If you can't test, you warn. They didn't do any of that. They didn't test, they didn't warn. They chased the dollar."
