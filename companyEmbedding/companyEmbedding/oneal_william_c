Bill O’Neil is an accomplished trial lawyer who concentrates his practice on a variety of business disputes.
M&A LitigationA significant portion of Bill's practice involves representing private equity funds and their portfolio companies. Bill frequently represents buyers and sellers in post-closing disputes, including working capital, representation and warranty, and fraud claims. Bill also represents buyers in claims against representation and warranty insurance carriers. More than a dozen private equity funds have retained Bill to handle these disputes; often where another law firm handled the underlying transaction. He brings a practical, business-minded approach to contentious disputes; he is frequently praised by his clients for the depth of his understanding of M&A transactions.    
Complex Commercial Litigation Mr. O’Neil also represents numerous public company clients in corporate governance litigation, shareholder strike suits, internal investigations, and other complex business litigation. He has represented dozens of Fortune 500 companies in disputes ranging from routine to high-stakes, “bet the company” litigation. Mr. O’Neil is also frequently called upon to provide risk management and litigation avoidance advice to his clients.
Antitrust Litigation Mr. O’Neil has significant antitrust experience. He was defense counsel in In re Automotive Parts Litigation, In re Linerboard Antitrust Litigation, and In re Sulfuric Acid Litigation, and successfully prosecuted price-fixing claims on behalf of Solyndra LLC against three of China’s largest solar panel manufacturers.
Pro BonoMr. O’Neil’s pro bono cases have included representing a prison inmate in a successful appeal before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals that resulted in new law in the circuit, the court’s reversal of its own prior precedent, and the reversal of the defendant’s conviction. 



Honors & Awards
In 2016, Bill was named to Benchmark Litigation’s “Under 40 Hot List.” This national award recognizes the nation’s most accomplished trial lawyers under the age of 40 based upon a peer review and case examination process.
In 2015, Bill was one of only 16 lawyers invited to participate in Microsoft’s Advocacy Academy, a week-long intensive trial skills course dedicated to the development of Microsoft’s next-generation of trial lawyers. 
Also in 2015, Winston & Strawn was named the “Chicago Litigation Department of the Year” for general litigation by The National Law Journal.




Activities
Bill serves as the co-chair of Winston’s Hiring Committee. In this role, he oversees Winston’s associate hiring on a firmwide basis. In addition, Bill serves as the liaison between the Firm’s Associates Committee and its Executive Committee. During his tenure, Winston has ascended more than 100 spots in the American Lawyer’s Mid-Level Associate Satisfaction Survey and now owns a spot as a Top 20 firm.  
A member of the Board of Directors of The First Tee of Greater Chicago (TFTGC), an organization dedicated to teaching life skills through the game of golf to at-risk youth in the Chicagoland area, Bill is committed to his community. He serves as the Chair of TFTGC’s Governance & Nominating Committee. During his tenure on the Board, TFTGC has more than doubled in size—both financially and in terms of the number of youth impacted.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Hardcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1921 edition. Volume: 201 (1921) - 250 (1928) Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This hardcover book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of hardcover binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal hardcovers. This book is printed on demand on acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Station. Now called Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station (MAFES) 1056 pages Volume: 201 (1921) - 250 (1928).
