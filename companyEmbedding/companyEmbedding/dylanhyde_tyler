Board of Directors





















Christopher J. Reinhard
Mr. Reinhard is co-founder of Cardium and has served as a director and the Chief Executive Officer, President and Treasurer of Cardium since its inception in December 2003. Mr. Reinhard has played a leadership role in the pre-clinical, clinical and commercial development of the Generx program. In 1996, he was co-founder of Collateral Therapeutics, which licensed the Generx technology covering methods of cardiovascular gene therapy based on discoveries by researchers at the University of California, San Diego. He helped lead a five year strategic partnership with Schering AG that supported the clinical development of Generx and ultimately led Schering to purchase Collateral for approximately $160 Million. After Schering was subsequently acquired by Bayer, Mr. Reinhard and Dr. Dylan-Hyde co-founded Cardium Therapeutics to re-acquire rights to the technology and advance the Generx program as a non-surgical approach to the treatment of coronary heart disease. He is also Chief Executive Officer and President of Tissue Repair Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cardium, since August 2006. He served as a director and Chief Executive Officer of Cardium’s subsidiary InnerCool Therapies Inc., from its acquisition in March 2006 until sale of the business to Royal Philips Electronics in July 2009; and its subsidiary To Go Brands Inc., from its acquisition in September 2012 until sale of the business to Cell-Nique Corporation in November 2013.

From 2004-2008, Mr. Reinhard was Executive Chairman of Artes Medical, Inc., a publicly-traded medical technology company; and prior to cofounding Collateral Therapeutics, he was Vice President and Managing Director of the Henley Group, a publicly traded diversified industrial and manufacturing group, and Vice President of various public and private companies created by the Henley Group through spin-out transactions, including Fisher Scientific Group, a leading international distributor of laboratory equipment and test apparatus for the scientific community, Instrumentation Laboratory and IMED Corporation, a medical device company.

CRISPR Therapeutics AG. (3/28/17). "Press Release: CRISPR Therapeutics Announces European Patent for CRISPR/Cas Gene Editing". Basel.
- Patent to include CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing compositions for use in any non-cellular and cellular setting, including human and other eukaryotic cells


CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) reported that the European Patent Office (EPO) has announced its intention to grant a patent broadly covering CRISPRs in-licensed gene editing technology. The claims are directed to the CRISPR/Cas9 single-guide gene editing system for uses in both non-cellular and cellular settings, including in cells from vertebrate animals such as human or mammalian cells  as well as composition claims for use in any setting, including claims for use in a method of therapeutic treatment of a patient.

Were very pleased with the decision by the European Patent Office recognizing the broad applicability of our foundational IP, and we look forward to pursuing additional cases to grant in other jurisdictions globally, said Dr. Rodger Novak, CEO of CRISPR Therapeutics.

The European patent application (No. 13793997) was the subject of numerous third-party observations or TPOs filed by the Broad Institute and others attempting to prevent or delay its grant. Following review of those submissions, the EPO determined that the technical evidence and associated legal arguments did not alter patentability of the inventions by the applicants, and accordingly announced its intention to advance the case to grant in Europe. The full EPO case files, TPOs, and claims intended for grant are available on-line via the EPOs official website at https://register.epo.org/application?number=EP13793997.

The underlying international patent application is based on the same U.S. priority application that has been involved in an interference proceeding with the Broad et al., which priority application (USSN 61/652086) was filed on May 25, 2012, on behalf of CRISPRs co-founder Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier (currently a director at the Max-Planck Institute in Berlin) along with the Regents of the University of California and University of Vienna.

The United Kingdoms Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) has also examined the related applications, and likewise considered technical evidence and arguments submitted by third parties, before ultimately reaching similar conclusions to those of the EPO. The UKIPO granted a first UK Patent to the CRISPR/Cas9 single-guide gene editing system for uses in both non-cellular and cellular settings (No. 2518764), and a second UK Patent to chimeric CRISPR/Cas9 systems in which the Cas9 protein is modified to provide alternative DNA-modulating activities (No. 2537000).

"We and the licensors of these foundational cases for CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing have long appreciated that Emmanuelle Charpentier along with Jennifer Doudna and their doctoral and post-doctoral colleagues provided innovations that facilitated the CRISPR field, said Dr. Tyler Dylan-Hyde, Chief Legal Officer of CRISPR Therapeutics. We also appreciate that despite attempts by third parties to delay or prevent these grants through TPOs or potential oppositions, patent offices are beginning to recognize both the fundamental significance of the teachings by the Charpentier-Doudna team and their wide applicability to CRISPR/Cas gene editing, noted Dr. Dylan-Hyde. We look forward to pursuing similar findings in the U.S. under the first-to-invent system  and throughout the approximately 80 other countries our filings cover worldwide, including Europe, all of which are on a first-to-file priority system.
