It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View James’ Full ProfileSummaryI've always been interested in computing and now, I'm able to live out my passion doing what I can in any and all fields of opportunity. I'm quite fortunate to absolutely enjoy all of my work.As a result, I've accumulated 10+ years of experience in the industry as both a Software Developer and Entrepreneur, accumulating and honing my skills in all disciplines required.On the software engineering side, I've had professional experience in:* C# on Windows/.NET, my primary professional platform* Scala, which tickles my wish for programming language elegance* C on Linux, MacOS (Classic and X) and Windows, for when performance is all that mattersA good software practitioner must dabble or have working knowledge in many more areas, and I'm no exception. This includes:* Web-Based Software: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS and the like. More or less anything that comes out of the W3.* C++, for when I must.* Java, for the other half of businesses that don't use .NET.I'm very interested in any type of computing work that involves heavy use of algorithms (which includes Deep Learning, now a very popular form of implementing light AI) and business-related applications, such as those my end-users are required to use to get their jobs done. Nothing quite satisfies me like an end-user able to increase their productivity with my software.As an entrepreneur, I've learned from hard experience in how to effectively manage software teams and delivery schedules to ensure that quality is delivered on time. I believe that this skill is well-learned and only gets better through extensive experience, and is one of the other joys I experience while in the industry.ExperienceCo-Founder and Chief ArchitectPhiarMarch 2017  –  Present (5 months)SKILLS: C, Deep Learning, Video and Image ProcessingOptimizing video processing software for embedded systems use.Optimizing Deep Neural Networks also for use in embedded systems.IT Administration.Software Development ConsultantSelf-EmployedApril 2016  –  Present (1 year 4 months)CURRENT CLIENT: Cambridge Select, Inc.SKILLS: PGSQL, C#/.NET, Windows, Microservices in ZeroMQWorking on multiple growth projects to improve operational efficiency.Developer ConsultantLots of ProjectsJanuary 2011  –  June 2017 (6 years 6 months)SKILLS: Scala, C, Linux, HTML5/CSS, JavaScriptFoundational and exploratory work on new ventures and ideas, including:- Media Bundling- Hashed Binary Patching- Snack and Quick-Serve Food Products- Audio-Snippet Podcast LinkingSoftware EngineerRoundtown, Inc.April 2015  –  March 2016 (1 year)SKILLS: Scala, Web, JavaScript, AWS, Testing, Bash Shell, LinuxMaintenance and feature work on back-end services, including event ingest and formatting.Ensured ticket links were present and working.A little bit of server administration.Chief Technology OfficerCambridge SelectMarch 2013  –  April 2015 (2 years 2 months)SKILLS: Team Management, Company IT Strategy Direction, PGSQL, C#/.NET, Windows, C, Linux, MicroservicesFully developed the initial implementation just about each software component used by in-house personnel, front-to-back, until early 2015.Directed software development and IT strategy at a foundational level.Managed development team between 2 and 5 persons.Prototyped most software developed.Developer ConsultantMendes & Mount LLPMarch 2011  –  March 2013 (2 years 1 month)SKILLS: MSSQL, C#/.NET, Windows, Reverse Engineering, End-to-End Systems DevelopmentRewrote major partner's custom case management system.Reimplemented software system to manage Reinsurance case information, whose major feature was to synchronize information obtained on a visit (potentially disconnected) with that stored in-house.Reimplemented Collections financial management system, which collates incoming payments..NET Software DeveloperSunGard - now part of FISMarch 2007  –  January 2011 (3 years 11 months)SKILLS: C#/.NET, MSSQL, Agile, Unit Testing, TDDCore member of VPM 9.0 product development team.Implemented back-end data organization and front-end modules.Helped to develop the current testing methodology and continue to practice it.Knowledgeable resource.Helped optimize system performance.SkillsSoftware DevelopmentSoftware Project ManagementC#SQLScalaHedge FundsTrading SystemsBusiness AnalysisAgile MethodologiesRequirements Analysis.NETConsultingMicrosoft SQL ServerIntegrationSDLCJavaScriptHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!EducationRochester Institute of TechnologyBachelor's degree, Computer ScienceBachelor's degree, Computer ScienceGroupsScala EnthusiastsVPMView James’ full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact James directlyView James’ Full ProfileNot the James you’re looking for?

Nearly ten years to be exact, and each and every experience with this business was pleasant until recently. I went in to add copper low lights with Angelica and the end result was fire truck red and blonde highlights!!!! I'm not a color expert, but last time I checked there was a difference between the two shades. I also pointed to the color swatch I liked and provided a picture of their previous work. When I saw the end product, I didn't know how to react. While I stared at the hot mess, Angelica convinced me that after several washes the color would fade to what I wanted. Little did I know, I'd wash my hair and the red would bleed into the blonde making me look like Carrot Top's sister. This was beyond a hot mess! I called and let them know what the situation was and Araceli, the shop manager assured me she would fix it. I went in and again the same stylist took care of me. I asked her to get rid of the red, and so she began. Turns out she just toned it down. Again, not what I asked for. Notice any patterns? Anyways, third is sorta the charm because I was fed up and just wanted it all gone. She covered it with a half effort job because now I have random patches of red, and burgundy over my natural color. As if this wasn't enough, all through out this return visit, Angelica was passive- aggressive. Smiling at me but snickering on the side, and very hard on my head, pulling and tugging at my hair as she "fixed" it. After this experience, it is needless to say that I will not be returning. They have lost several customers since many of my relatives and friends were also clients. Its a true disappointment that there is no professionalism or real responsibility with their work or to their customers. Consumers, beware of the potential wrecks you're paying for at this place.Hair by Samkikiflynn ratedRidiculously nice people. Afte...Ridiculously nice people. After going once, Sam and Lynn (his right-hand gal) will remember your name, the service you received last time, and how you were feeling. That's awesome (and rare) up here in Albany Park. Lynn gives stellar manis and pedis (as do the other girls who come and go- but ask for Lynn if you have a choice!) and Sam's the hair guy. You'll be offered water, tea, or- on occasion- whatever cookies and treats someone has dropped off for them. (Always accept. I've never regretted trying something new and delicious.) So why only four outta five stars? Because while the prices are unreal affordable and the service is lovely, it's not always the fanciest haircut for a girl. (For a guy- absolutely. My husband always looks awesome after coming home from here.) Cuts for a woman are *very* basic and just fine. But again, you can't beat the prices and people. Their massage chairs are also top notch. Sometimes I stay a little longer and hog one of their chairs. Bonus- Sam and Lynn are so polite that they've never told me to perhaps give the chair to a waiting client. I like that.57th Street Beauty SalonDantá W. ratedTo me personally I grade a salon on three things plus some: professionalism, service, and of course atmosphere. 1) The fact that esther does a great job of cutting, texturing my hair, and is quick as most of my old barbers from madison, it is great. 2) The decor of art, cleanliness, and space is something most other salons, at least in the Hyde Park Bronzeville area lacks is space. 3) the professionalism of the receptionsit upon arrival, and when I asked how long the wait is, he was honest about timing and saw an opening and predicted when esther would be done with client and the time she would finish my hair was exactly at 22 minutes. they had time, she was quick but very good and wash was included plus she was interesting to talk to. they never turn customers away without calling them and giving the best time to come back to fit me in. plus, they had foaming cream available at the price of 17 I think. not bad for salon prices. 2nd haircut was better cuz esther knew what I needed. lolRestoration Salonnoratellez ratedI love Carmelo at Restoration ...I love Carmelo at Restoration at the Clark location in Chicago, IL. I have been going in a consistant basis to Restoration and Carmelo is the only stylist that I would trust with any suggestion and my hair. Carmelo will never make you look dumb or horrible. I am very visible to the public, my appearnace is foremost important. Years of service I have received at a regular basis at Restoration and my many dates, photo shoots, work events and even galas I get all sorts of compliments because of Carmelo. I have swept the crowd with the amazing ways he works wonders with my hair. Every single time my pictures are at display the amount of great comments are proof of Carmelo's miracle and artistic hands. Carmelo makes look like a movie star! Like I told Carmelo, I never trust my hair to just anyone. Since I moved, I even travel to see him...and now even my daugther is getting her hair done. I love Carmelo for always being honest and bringing my dull hair to life. Thank you Carmelo! :)  Chatto Center for Natural Hair + SkinBambi W. ratedABOUT ME: I am a black women with natural kinky hair. my hair has allot of strinkage and Im not sure what type hair I have A, B, or C..LOL... All I know is that it's KINKY and I love it!  TESTIMONY: When I went natural a year ago and did my big chop...I became a product JUNKY forreal!!! But after so many trials and errors I came to find out that all you need is the LOC method (Liquid, Oil and Cream). I meet Chatto at Circle of Sisters in NYC in 2014 and boy oooh boy did she know her stuff! I purchased her MOM & DAUGHTER plus ALOE MOISTURE MIST and my hair fell in love! My hair is shiny, SOFT, full of body, and people compliment my hair everytime I step out the door. Dry hair where????????  I wish Chatto had a salon here in NJ:(  Ladies... I AM NOT BEING PAID TO WRITE THIS TESTIMONY. Chatto Products are absolutely delicious for your hair:) You should try it!Chicago Hair Extensions SalonKelsey L. rated I am one of those people that cannot stand having short hair, I need the length and I need the volume to function, so I have dealt with everything possible to TRY to maintain the hair that I desire and, I kid you not, I have not been so happy with my extensions in a long time and it is because of Chicago Hair Extensions Salon. I received my hair extensions through Marlene and she knew what she was doing, it was a great experience, and I have recommended her to my friends already. I have been to so many salon's and had to deal with different tech's and it was all horrible experiences but I have been going here for a little over a year now and I am so grateful and happy that I found this salon and have had such talented people make my hair (something I treasure dearly) look more beautiful than I could have imagined.Elle Beauty SalonNaomi L. ratedI really appreciate it when a hair stylist can work around the fact that I have a cowlick and can actually produce bangs on this head of mine. Also, I liked that the stylist here does not shred and overly layer my hair. I am not a fan of layers; I used to frequent the salon just across from this one, where I'd come out looking like David Bowie. I'd be a gremlin for weeks. But the stylists here know what they're doing and that is key for me considering many other places wreck my bangs and overdo simple trims. The service here is peaceful in contrast to the chaos in most salons and the management is on point. Their hair cataglogs are also up to date (but if you like Bowie styles, fret not, they have those too).  And so, I 've found a new favorite. Gordon In Lakeviewgfds9859 ratedAmanda is always booked and always has several customers there waiting for her. But, the staff you have is always willing to help her out, get people ready or on to the next step, or kill some time with a head/hand massage. My hair is SUPER thick and seriously takes like 30 minutes to blow-dry, but she always does it without getting aggravated or looking like she is in a rush to get to the next person. She is always happy to see/talk to me and even if 3 months went by, she remembers what we talked about last time (that always amazes me). I always love my haircut and/or dye job, and will keep coming back! Thanks! (ps...having free wireless is really nice, and helps with the waiting time!)Gordon In Lakeviewlizablack ratedI had a one hour massage yesterday thanks to the wonderful Groupon that was offered! I arrived and was greeted immediately, shown where the restroom was, asked if I wanted any beverages, etc. Becca was my masseuse, and I cannot say enough great things about her! She offered a foot soak to start and I got to the option to choose my oil aroma for the massage. The ambience, music, lighting, temperature, etc was great. Becca gave me the BEST deep tissue massage I have ever had. She allowed me to relax and enjoy my time, and only spoke if I had a question or needed a change in pressure. I would 100% recommend Gordon Salan and Spa and Becca to anyone, and in fact, I already have!Saka And AssociatesAnne B. ratedI had a very positive experience with Saka & Associates when Sandy and Diane came to take care of my 2-bedroom condo for the first time last week. I found the business via a Groupon, and despite my Groupon rate, this team did not cut any corners but instead took great care with all of the nooks and crannies of my apartment.  Sandy (the owner, I believe) is a retired CPS teacher, and like the best teachers, she is caring, organized, smart, and has a warm demeanor. I felt safe with the two of them in my apartment, and I would not worry to have them here even without me. I recommend them and hope that this business continues to grow.

Description


Product Details




                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.
The Memorial Candle Program has been designed to help offset the costs associated with hosting this Tribute 
Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of James D. Briscoe can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month


Candle will be lit for the limited time of one year


Candle will be lit indefinitely

Candle message preserved on the memorial site for perpetuity
