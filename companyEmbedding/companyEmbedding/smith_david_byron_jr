Byron David Smith killings


Location of Little Falls within the state of Minnesota.



Date
November 22, 2012 (2012-11-22)


Location
Little Falls, Minnesota, U.S.


Deaths
2 (Haile Kifer, Nicholas Brady)


Suspect(s)
1 (Byron David Smith)


Accused
1


Convicted
1


Charges
Two counts of first-degree murder with premeditation and two counts of second-degree murder


Verdict
Smith convicted


Convictions
Two counts of first-degree murder with premeditation and two counts of second-degree murder


The Byron David Smith killings occurred on Thanksgiving Day of 2012, when Haile Kifer, 18, and her cousin, Nicholas Brady, 17, broke into the home of Byron David Smith, 65, in Little Falls, Minnesota, in the United States. Smith, armed with a Ruger Mini-14,[1] shot the teens separately and minutes apart as they entered the basement where he was, later stating to police he was worried about them being armed.
The case sparked debate over the "Castle doctrine", which allows a homeowner to defend his home with lethal force.[2][3] The prosecution alleged that Smith's actions showed aspects of premeditation (see lying in wait) and he used excessive force in relation to the threat. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.[4]

Lead up[edit]
Smith, 64, was retired from the U.S. State Department[5] and had a history of international travel to Moscow, Bangkok and Beijing.[6] Smith's brother described him as a retired security engineering officer.[7]
Prior to the incident, Byron Smith had been burglarized at least half a dozen times over the preceding few months. Among the items stolen were thousands of dollars in cash, the watch his father had received after spending nearly a year as a POW in World War II, medals and ribbons Smith had earned in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, several firearms, and jewelry. Smith began routinely wearing a holster with a loaded gun inside his home. There is some evidence that Kifer and Brady committed at least a couple of the previous break-ins and were being investigated for prior burglaries, including one earlier on the day they were killed.[8][9] Smith installed a security system to protect himself.[8]
Incident[edit]
On November 22, 2012, Kifer and Brady broke into Smith's home. Video surveillance captured the teens casing the property prior to the break-in.[10] By his own account to police, Smith was in the basement when he shot Brady twice at the top of the basement stairs, and once in the face fatally after he fell to the bottom of the stairs. Minutes later when Kifer entered the basement, he shot her at the top of the stairs. Wounded, she fell down the stairs, and after Smith's rifle jammed, he shot her multiple times in the chest with a 22-caliber revolver, dragged her across the floor to set her beside the body of her cousin, and then shot her fatally under the chin.[1] Smith then waited until Friday to have a neighbor call police, saying that he did not want to bother law enforcement on Thanksgiving.[1] Audio and video of the events were recorded by Smith's security system. [11][12]
Investigation[edit]
The deaths were not immediately reported to police. Smith waited until the next day to notify police of the shootings, claiming he didn't want to bother the police on Thanksgiving.[8][13] Morrison County Sheriff Michel Wetzel has acknowledged that Brady and Kifer were there to burgle Smith's residence.[6] Brady's sister claimed Brady stole drugs from her home August 28 in a case that was still under investigation.[7] Evidence recovered from the car driven by Brady was linked to a burglary of the residence of a retired teacher the night before he and Kifer were killed by Byron Smith.[14]
Smith's statements to police describe delivering killing shots to the heads of both victims after he had shot them on the stairs and they had fallen to the basement floor wounded.[15][16] In his statement, Smith said that Kifer had let out a short laugh after she fell down the stairs, saying "If you're trying to shoot somebody and they laugh at you, you go again." The audiotape did not record Kifer laughing; instead she cries "Oh my God!" in fear. In police interviews Smith acknowledged "firing more shots than I needed to" and that he fired "a good clean finishing shot" into Kifer's head.[5]
Castle doctrine debate[edit]
Legal analysts have stated that the initial shootings most likely would have been justified under Minnesota's Castle law, but that the subsequent shots were not justified once any threat had been removed.[17] Sheriff Wetzel said that the law "doesn't permit you to execute somebody once a threat is gone."[7] Hamline University School of Law professor Joseph Olson: "I think the first shot is justified. After the person is no longer a threat because they're seriously wounded, the application of self-defense is over."[6]
A number of aspects of the case were noted by police as being inconsistent with self-defense. Smith moved his truck earlier in the day. He claimed it was in order to clean his garage. Prosecutors argued at his trial that it was an attempt to make the house look abandoned in order to lure the burglars into his home.[18]
In addition to his home surveillance system, Smith also recorded at least 6 hours of audio on a digital recorder in the basement of the residence.[8] He was sitting in a chair at the bottom of the stairs with a loaded rifle and a tape recorder that captured not only the shootings, but also a monologue by Smith. Prior to the break-in, he is heard saying "In your left eye." and "I realize I don't have an appointment but I would like to see one of the lawyers here". The prosecution noted that Kifer was later shot in the left eye by Smith and allege that the other statement is a rehearsal of what he would say after the shooting—an indication that he knew he would soon need an attorney.[19]
Following the shootings, Smith captured a number of statements including: "I am not a bleeding heart liberal. I felt like I was cleaning up a mess - not like spilled food, not like vomit, not even like…not even like diarrhea - the worst mess possible. And I was stuck with it…in some tiny little respect…in some tiny little respect. I was doing my civic duty. If the law enforcement system couldn't handle it, I had to do it. I had to do it. The law system couldn't handle her and if it fell into my lap and she dropped her problem in my lap…and she threw her own problem in my face. And I had to clean it up."[19] Smith's recorded statements, the evidence indicating he had planned the shootings, along with the excessive number of shots fired led to the charge of second degree murder.[19] Smith was initially charged with two counts of second degree murder, however, in April 2013, he was indicted on two counts of first degree murder.[6][15] Bail was later set at $50,000, which Smith posted.[20]
Hamline law professor emeritus Joseph Daly commented that the laws surrounding the case were dividing the Little Falls community. "In some states, somebody breaks into your home you are allowed to shoot them dead. Period," said Daly. He pointed out others states, such as Florida have a "stand your ground" law, but Minnesota has what's known as a reasonable person doctrine. "If a reasonable person would see if you are in fear of great bodily harm of death. That's our statute. It comes down to what would a reasonable person see in this situation for Mr. Smith?" said Daly.[21]
Fox News host Sean Hannity supported Smith's actions on his show citing the fact that the teens broke into Smith's house to commit a robbery. Another guest on the show agreed, stating: "The guy should get a medal of freedom for what he did."[22] Geraldo Rivera also stated that he would have fired the initial shots, but supported the guilty verdict, and expressed disgust over the "finishing" shot of the girl.
Trial[edit]
On April 29, 2014, Byron David Smith was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder with premeditation and on two counts of second-degree murder after three hours of jury deliberations. He was immediately sentenced to life in prison without parole.[4] The audio recordings were named by the jurors as the biggest influence on their decision. "That was the most damning piece of evidence in my mind," Wes Hatlestad, one of 12 jurors, said following the trial. "That audio recording of the actual killings and the audio recording of Mr. Smith's interview immediately after his arrest ... pretty much convinced me that we were dealing with a deranged individual."[23]
Law[edit]
Under Minnesota state statute, "...[R]easonable force may be used upon or toward the person of another without the other's consent when the following circumstances exist or the actor reasonably believes them to exist...when used by any person in lawful possession of real or personal property...in resisting...unlawful interference with such property...[24]
Another state statute states: "The intentional taking of the life of another is not authorized..., except when necessary in resisting or preventing an offense which the actor reasonably believes exposes the actor or another to great bodily harm or death, or preventing the commission of a felony in the actor's place of abode." [25]
According to another state statute: "In criminal trials, the court shall decide questions of law, except in cases of criminal defamation, and the jury shall decide questions of fact."[26]

Location
Little Falls, Minnesota, U.S.


Deaths
2 (Haile Kifer, Nicholas Brady)


Suspect(s)
1 (Byron David Smith)


Accused
1


Convicted
1


Charges
Two counts of first-degree murder with premeditation and two counts of second-degree murder


Verdict
Smith convicted


Convictions
Two counts of first-degree murder with premeditation and two counts of second-degree murder


The Byron David Smith killings occurred on Thanksgiving Day of 2012, when Haile Kifer, 18, and her cousin, Nicholas Brady, 17, broke into the home of Byron David Smith, 65, in Little Falls, Minnesota, in the United States. Smith, armed with a Ruger Mini-14,[1] shot the teens separately and minutes apart as they entered the basement where he was, later stating to police he was worried about them being armed.
The case sparked debate over the "Castle doctrine", which allows a homeowner to defend his home with lethal force.[2][3] The prosecution alleged that Smith's actions showed aspects of premeditation (see lying in wait) and he used excessive force in relation to the threat. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.[4]

Lead up[edit]
Smith, 64, was retired from the U.S. State Department[5] and had a history of international travel to Moscow, Bangkok and Beijing.[6] Smith's brother described him as a retired security engineering officer.[7]
Prior to the incident, Byron Smith had been burglarized at least half a dozen times over the preceding few months. Among the items stolen were thousands of dollars in cash, the watch his father had received after spending nearly a year as a POW in World War II, medals and ribbons Smith had earned in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, several firearms, and jewelry. Smith began routinely wearing a holster with a loaded gun inside his home. There is some evidence that Kifer and Brady committed at least a couple of the previous break-ins and were being investigated for prior burglaries, including one earlier on the day they were killed.[8][9] Smith installed a security system to protect himself.[8]
Incident[edit]
On November 22, 2012, Kifer and Brady broke into Smith's home. Video surveillance captured the teens casing the property prior to the break-in.[10] By his own account to police, Smith was in the basement when he shot Brady twice at the top of the basement stairs, and once in the face fatally after he fell to the bottom of the stairs. Minutes later when Kifer entered the basement, he shot her at the top of the stairs. Wounded, she fell down the stairs, and after Smith's rifle jammed, he shot her multiple times in the chest with a 22-caliber revolver, dragged her across the floor to set her beside the body of her cousin, and then shot her fatally under the chin.[1] Smith then waited until Friday to have a neighbor call police, saying that he did not want to bother law enforcement on Thanksgiving.[1] Audio and video of the events were recorded by Smith's security system. [11][12]
Investigation[edit]
The deaths were not immediately reported to police. Smith waited until the next day to notify police of the shootings, claiming he didn't want to bother the police on Thanksgiving.[8][13] Morrison County Sheriff Michel Wetzel has acknowledged that Brady and Kifer were there to burgle Smith's residence.[6] Brady's sister claimed Brady stole drugs from her home August 28 in a case that was still under investigation.[7] Evidence recovered from the car driven by Brady was linked to a burglary of the residence of a retired teacher the night before he and Kifer were killed by Byron Smith.[14]
Smith's statements to police describe delivering killing shots to the heads of both victims after he had shot them on the stairs and they had fallen to the basement floor wounded.[15][16] In his statement, Smith said that Kifer had let out a short laugh after she fell down the stairs, saying "If you're trying to shoot somebody and they laugh at you, you go again." The audiotape did not record Kifer laughing; instead she cries "Oh my God!" in fear. In police interviews Smith acknowledged "firing more shots than I needed to" and that he fired "a good clean finishing shot" into Kifer's head.[5]
Castle doctrine debate[edit]
Legal analysts have stated that the initial shootings most likely would have been justified under Minnesota's Castle law, but that the subsequent shots were not justified once any threat had been removed.[17] Sheriff Wetzel said that the law "doesn't permit you to execute somebody once a threat is gone."[7] Hamline University School of Law professor Joseph Olson: "I think the first shot is justified. After the person is no longer a threat because they're seriously wounded, the application of self-defense is over."[6]
A number of aspects of the case were noted by police as being inconsistent with self-defense. Smith moved his truck earlier in the day. He claimed it was in order to clean his garage. Prosecutors argued at his trial that it was an attempt to make the house look abandoned in order to lure the burglars into his home.[18]
In addition to his home surveillance system, Smith also recorded at least 6 hours of audio on a digital recorder in the basement of the residence.[8] He was sitting in a chair at the bottom of the stairs with a loaded rifle and a tape recorder that captured not only the shootings, but also a monologue by Smith. Prior to the break-in, he is heard saying "In your left eye." and "I realize I don't have an appointment but I would like to see one of the lawyers here". The prosecution noted that Kifer was later shot in the left eye by Smith and allege that the other statement is a rehearsal of what he would say after the shooting—an indication that he knew he would soon need an attorney.[19]
Following the shootings, Smith captured a number of statements including: "I am not a bleeding heart liberal. I felt like I was cleaning up a mess - not like spilled food, not like vomit, not even like…not even like diarrhea - the worst mess possible. And I was stuck with it…in some tiny little respect…in some tiny little respect. I was doing my civic duty. If the law enforcement system couldn't handle it, I had to do it. I had to do it. The law system couldn't handle her and if it fell into my lap and she dropped her problem in my lap…and she threw her own problem in my face. And I had to clean it up."[19] Smith's recorded statements, the evidence indicating he had planned the shootings, along with the excessive number of shots fired led to the charge of second degree murder.[19] Smith was initially charged with two counts of second degree murder, however, in April 2013, he was indicted on two counts of first degree murder.[6][15] Bail was later set at $50,000, which Smith posted.[20]
Hamline law professor emeritus Joseph Daly commented that the laws surrounding the case were dividing the Little Falls community. "In some states, somebody breaks into your home you are allowed to shoot them dead. Period," said Daly. He pointed out others states, such as Florida have a "stand your ground" law, but Minnesota has what's known as a reasonable person doctrine. "If a reasonable person would see if you are in fear of great bodily harm of death. That's our statute. It comes down to what would a reasonable person see in this situation for Mr. Smith?" said Daly.[21]
Fox News host Sean Hannity supported Smith's actions on his show citing the fact that the teens broke into Smith's house to commit a robbery. Another guest on the show agreed, stating: "The guy should get a medal of freedom for what he did."[22] Geraldo Rivera also stated that he would have fired the initial shots, but supported the guilty verdict, and expressed disgust over the "finishing" shot of the girl.
Trial[edit]
On April 29, 2014, Byron David Smith was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder with premeditation and on two counts of second-degree murder after three hours of jury deliberations. He was immediately sentenced to life in prison without parole.[4] The audio recordings were named by the jurors as the biggest influence on their decision. "That was the most damning piece of evidence in my mind," Wes Hatlestad, one of 12 jurors, said following the trial. "That audio recording of the actual killings and the audio recording of Mr. Smith's interview immediately after his arrest ... pretty much convinced me that we were dealing with a deranged individual."[23]
Law[edit]
Under Minnesota state statute, "...[R]easonable force may be used upon or toward the person of another without the other's consent when the following circumstances exist or the actor reasonably believes them to exist...when used by any person in lawful possession of real or personal property...in resisting...unlawful interference with such property...[24]
Another state statute states: "The intentional taking of the life of another is not authorized..., except when necessary in resisting or preventing an offense which the actor reasonably believes exposes the actor or another to great bodily harm or death, or preventing the commission of a felony in the actor's place of abode." [25]
According to another state statute: "In criminal trials, the court shall decide questions of law, except in cases of criminal defamation, and the jury shall decide questions of fact."[26]

Little Falls, Minnesota, U.S.


Deaths
2 (Haile Kifer, Nicholas Brady)


Suspect(s)
1 (Byron David Smith)


Accused
1


Convicted
1


Charges
Two counts of first-degree murder with premeditation and two counts of second-degree murder


Verdict
Smith convicted


Convictions
Two counts of first-degree murder with premeditation and two counts of second-degree murder


The Byron David Smith killings occurred on Thanksgiving Day of 2012, when Haile Kifer, 18, and her cousin, Nicholas Brady, 17, broke into the home of Byron David Smith, 65, in Little Falls, Minnesota, in the United States. Smith, armed with a Ruger Mini-14,[1] shot the teens separately and minutes apart as they entered the basement where he was, later stating to police he was worried about them being armed.
The case sparked debate over the "Castle doctrine", which allows a homeowner to defend his home with lethal force.[2][3] The prosecution alleged that Smith's actions showed aspects of premeditation (see lying in wait) and he used excessive force in relation to the threat. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.[4]

Lead up[edit]
Smith, 64, was retired from the U.S. State Department[5] and had a history of international travel to Moscow, Bangkok and Beijing.[6] Smith's brother described him as a retired security engineering officer.[7]
Prior to the incident, Byron Smith had been burglarized at least half a dozen times over the preceding few months. Among the items stolen were thousands of dollars in cash, the watch his father had received after spending nearly a year as a POW in World War II, medals and ribbons Smith had earned in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, several firearms, and jewelry. Smith began routinely wearing a holster with a loaded gun inside his home. There is some evidence that Kifer and Brady committed at least a couple of the previous break-ins and were being investigated for prior burglaries, including one earlier on the day they were killed.[8][9] Smith installed a security system to protect himself.[8]
Incident[edit]
On November 22, 2012, Kifer and Brady broke into Smith's home. Video surveillance captured the teens casing the property prior to the break-in.[10] By his own account to police, Smith was in the basement when he shot Brady twice at the top of the basement stairs, and once in the face fatally after he fell to the bottom of the stairs. Minutes later when Kifer entered the basement, he shot her at the top of the stairs. Wounded, she fell down the stairs, and after Smith's rifle jammed, he shot her multiple times in the chest with a 22-caliber revolver, dragged her across the floor to set her beside the body of her cousin, and then shot her fatally under the chin.[1] Smith then waited until Friday to have a neighbor call police, saying that he did not want to bother law enforcement on Thanksgiving.[1] Audio and video of the events were recorded by Smith's security system. [11][12]
Investigation[edit]
The deaths were not immediately reported to police. Smith waited until the next day to notify police of the shootings, claiming he didn't want to bother the police on Thanksgiving.[8][13] Morrison County Sheriff Michel Wetzel has acknowledged that Brady and Kifer were there to burgle Smith's residence.[6] Brady's sister claimed Brady stole drugs from her home August 28 in a case that was still under investigation.[7] Evidence recovered from the car driven by Brady was linked to a burglary of the residence of a retired teacher the night before he and Kifer were killed by Byron Smith.[14]
Smith's statements to police describe delivering killing shots to the heads of both victims after he had shot them on the stairs and they had fallen to the basement floor wounded.[15][16] In his statement, Smith said that Kifer had let out a short laugh after she fell down the stairs, saying "If you're trying to shoot somebody and they laugh at you, you go again." The audiotape did not record Kifer laughing; instead she cries "Oh my God!" in fear. In police interviews Smith acknowledged "firing more shots than I needed to" and that he fired "a good clean finishing shot" into Kifer's head.[5]
Castle doctrine debate[edit]
Legal analysts have stated that the initial shootings most likely would have been justified under Minnesota's Castle law, but that the subsequent shots were not justified once any threat had been removed.[17] Sheriff Wetzel said that the law "doesn't permit you to execute somebody once a threat is gone."[7] Hamline University School of Law professor Joseph Olson: "I think the first shot is justified. After the person is no longer a threat because they're seriously wounded, the application of self-defense is over."[6]
A number of aspects of the case were noted by police as being inconsistent with self-defense. Smith moved his truck earlier in the day. He claimed it was in order to clean his garage. Prosecutors argued at his trial that it was an attempt to make the house look abandoned in order to lure the burglars into his home.[18]
In addition to his home surveillance system, Smith also recorded at least 6 hours of audio on a digital recorder in the basement of the residence.[8] He was sitting in a chair at the bottom of the stairs with a loaded rifle and a tape recorder that captured not only the shootings, but also a monologue by Smith. Prior to the break-in, he is heard saying "In your left eye." and "I realize I don't have an appointment but I would like to see one of the lawyers here". The prosecution noted that Kifer was later shot in the left eye by Smith and allege that the other statement is a rehearsal of what he would say after the shooting—an indication that he knew he would soon need an attorney.[19]
Following the shootings, Smith captured a number of statements including: "I am not a bleeding heart liberal. I felt like I was cleaning up a mess - not like spilled food, not like vomit, not even like…not even like diarrhea - the worst mess possible. And I was stuck with it…in some tiny little respect…in some tiny little respect. I was doing my civic duty. If the law enforcement system couldn't handle it, I had to do it. I had to do it. The law system couldn't handle her and if it fell into my lap and she dropped her problem in my lap…and she threw her own problem in my face. And I had to clean it up."[19] Smith's recorded statements, the evidence indicating he had planned the shootings, along with the excessive number of shots fired led to the charge of second degree murder.[19] Smith was initially charged with two counts of second degree murder, however, in April 2013, he was indicted on two counts of first degree murder.[6][15] Bail was later set at $50,000, which Smith posted.[20]
Hamline law professor emeritus Joseph Daly commented that the laws surrounding the case were dividing the Little Falls community. "In some states, somebody breaks into your home you are allowed to shoot them dead. Period," said Daly. He pointed out others states, such as Florida have a "stand your ground" law, but Minnesota has what's known as a reasonable person doctrine. "If a reasonable person would see if you are in fear of great bodily harm of death. That's our statute. It comes down to what would a reasonable person see in this situation for Mr. Smith?" said Daly.[21]
Fox News host Sean Hannity supported Smith's actions on his show citing the fact that the teens broke into Smith's house to commit a robbery. Another guest on the show agreed, stating: "The guy should get a medal of freedom for what he did."[22] Geraldo Rivera also stated that he would have fired the initial shots, but supported the guilty verdict, and expressed disgust over the "finishing" shot of the girl.
Trial[edit]
On April 29, 2014, Byron David Smith was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder with premeditation and on two counts of second-degree murder after three hours of jury deliberations. He was immediately sentenced to life in prison without parole.[4] The audio recordings were named by the jurors as the biggest influence on their decision. "That was the most damning piece of evidence in my mind," Wes Hatlestad, one of 12 jurors, said following the trial. "That audio recording of the actual killings and the audio recording of Mr. Smith's interview immediately after his arrest ... pretty much convinced me that we were dealing with a deranged individual."[23]
Law[edit]
Under Minnesota state statute, "...[R]easonable force may be used upon or toward the person of another without the other's consent when the following circumstances exist or the actor reasonably believes them to exist...when used by any person in lawful possession of real or personal property...in resisting...unlawful interference with such property...[24]
Another state statute states: "The intentional taking of the life of another is not authorized..., except when necessary in resisting or preventing an offense which the actor reasonably believes exposes the actor or another to great bodily harm or death, or preventing the commission of a felony in the actor's place of abode." [25]
According to another state statute: "In criminal trials, the court shall decide questions of law, except in cases of criminal defamation, and the jury shall decide questions of fact."[26]

"In some states, somebody breaks into your home you are allowed to shoot them dead. Period," said Daly. He pointed out others states, such as Florida have a "stand your ground" law, but Minnesota has what's known as a reasonable person doctrine. "If a reasonable person would see if you are in fear of great bodily harm of death. That's our statute. It comes down to what would a reasonable person see in this situation for Mr. Smith?" said Daly.[21]
Fox News host Sean Hannity supported Smith's actions on his show citing the fact that the teens broke into Smith's house to commit a robbery. Another guest on the show agreed, stating: "The guy should get a medal of freedom for what he did."[22] Geraldo Rivera also stated that he would have fired the initial shots, but supported the guilty verdict, and expressed disgust over the "finishing" shot of the girl.
Trial[edit]
On April 29, 2014, Byron David Smith was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder with premeditation and on two counts of second-degree murder after three hours of jury deliberations. He was immediately sentenced to life in prison without parole.[4] The audio recordings were named by the jurors as the biggest influence on their decision. "That was the most damning piece of evidence in my mind," Wes Hatlestad, one of 12 jurors, said following the trial. "That audio recording of the actual killings and the audio recording of Mr. Smith's interview immediately after his arrest ... pretty much convinced me that we were dealing with a deranged individual."[23]
Law[edit]
Under Minnesota state statute, "...[R]easonable force may be used upon or toward the person of another without the other's consent when the following circumstances exist or the actor reasonably believes them to exist...when used by any person in lawful possession of real or personal property...in resisting...unlawful interference with such property...[24]
Another state statute states: "The intentional taking of the life of another is not authorized..., except when necessary in resisting or preventing an offense which the actor reasonably believes exposes the actor or another to great bodily harm or death, or preventing the commission of a felony in the actor's place of abode." [25]
According to another state statute: "In criminal trials, the court shall decide questions of law, except in cases of criminal defamation, and the jury shall decide questions of fact."[26]

The Byron David Smith killings occurred on Thanksgiving Day of 2012, when Haile Kifer, 18, and her cousin, Nicholas Brady, 17, broke into the home of Byron David Smith, 65, in Little Falls, Minnesota, in the United States. Smith, armed with a Ruger Mini-14,[1] shot the teens separately and minutes apart as they entered the basement where he was, later stating to police he was worried about them being armed.
The case sparked debate over the "Castle doctrine", which allows a homeowner to defend his home with lethal force.[2][3] The prosecution alleged that Smith's actions showed aspects of premeditation (see lying in wait) and he used excessive force in relation to the threat. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.[4]

Lead up[edit]
Smith, 64, was retired from the U.S. State Department[5] and had a history of international travel to Moscow, Bangkok and Beijing.[6] Smith's brother described him as a retired security engineering officer.[7]
Prior to the incident, Byron Smith had been burglarized at least half a dozen times over the preceding few months. Among the items stolen were thousands of dollars in cash, the watch his father had received after spending nearly a year as a POW in World War II, medals and ribbons Smith had earned in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, several firearms, and jewelry. Smith began routinely wearing a holster with a loaded gun inside his home. There is some evidence that Kifer and Brady committed at least a couple of the previous break-ins and were being investigated for prior burglaries, including one earlier on the day they were killed.[8][9] Smith installed a security system to protect himself.[8]
Incident[edit]
On November 22, 2012, Kifer and Brady broke into Smith's home. Video surveillance captured the teens casing the property prior to the break-in.[10] By his own account to police, Smith was in the basement when he shot Brady twice at the top of the basement stairs, and once in the face fatally after he fell to the bottom of the stairs. Minutes later when Kifer entered the basement, he shot her at the top of the stairs. Wounded, she fell down the stairs, and after Smith's rifle jammed, he shot her multiple times in the chest with a 22-caliber revolver, dragged her across the floor to set her beside the body of her cousin, and then shot her fatally under the chin.[1] Smith then waited until Friday to have a neighbor call police, saying that he did not want to bother law enforcement on Thanksgiving.[1] Audio and video of the events were recorded by Smith's security system. [11][12]
Investigation[edit]
The deaths were not immediately reported to police. Smith waited until the next day to notify police of the shootings, claiming he didn't want to bother the police on Thanksgiving.[8][13] Morrison County Sheriff Michel Wetzel has acknowledged that Brady and Kifer were there to burgle Smith's residence.[6] Brady's sister claimed Brady stole drugs from her home August 28 in a case that was still under investigation.[7] Evidence recovered from the car driven by Brady was linked to a burglary of the residence of a retired teacher the night before he and Kifer were killed by Byron Smith.[14]
Smith's statements to police describe delivering killing shots to the heads of both victims after he had shot them on the stairs and they had fallen to the basement floor wounded.[15][16] In his statement, Smith said that Kifer had let out a short laugh after she fell down the stairs, saying "If you're trying to shoot somebody and they laugh at you, you go again." The audiotape did not record Kifer laughing; instead she cries "Oh my God!" in fear. In police interviews Smith acknowledged "firing more shots than I needed to" and that he fired "a good clean finishing shot" into Kifer's head.[5]
Castle doctrine debate[edit]
Legal analysts have stated that the initial shootings most likely would have been justified under Minnesota's Castle law, but that the subsequent shots were not justified once any threat had been removed.[17] Sheriff Wetzel said that the law "doesn't permit you to execute somebody once a threat is gone."[7] Hamline University School of Law professor Joseph Olson: "I think the first shot is justified. After the person is no longer a threat because they're seriously wounded, the application of self-defense is over."[6]
A number of aspects of the case were noted by police as being inconsistent with self-defense. Smith moved his truck earlier in the day. He claimed it was in order to clean his garage. Prosecutors argued at his trial that it was an attempt to make the house look abandoned in order to lure the burglars into his home.[18]
In addition to his home surveillance system, Smith also recorded at least 6 hours of audio on a digital recorder in the basement of the residence.[8] He was sitting in a chair at the bottom of the stairs with a loaded rifle and a tape recorder that captured not only the shootings, but also a monologue by Smith. Prior to the break-in, he is heard saying "In your left eye." and "I realize I don't have an appointment but I would like to see one of the lawyers here". The prosecution noted that Kifer was later shot in the left eye by Smith and allege that the other statement is a rehearsal of what he would say after the shooting—an indication that he knew he would soon need an attorney.[19]
Following the shootings, Smith captured a number of statements including: "I am not a bleeding heart liberal. I felt like I was cleaning up a mess - not like spilled food, not like vomit, not even like…not even like diarrhea - the worst mess possible. And I was stuck with it…in some tiny little respect…in some tiny little respect. I was doing my civic duty. If the law enforcement system couldn't handle it, I had to do it. I had to do it. The law system couldn't handle her and if it fell into my lap and she dropped her problem in my lap…and she threw her own problem in my face. And I had to clean it up."[19] Smith's recorded statements, the evidence indicating he had planned the shootings, along with the excessive number of shots fired led to the charge of second degree murder.[19] Smith was initially charged with two counts of second degree murder, however, in April 2013, he was indicted on two counts of first degree murder.[6][15] Bail was later set at $50,000, which Smith posted.[20]
Hamline law professor emeritus Joseph Daly commented that the laws surrounding the case were dividing the Little Falls community. "In some states, somebody breaks into your home you are allowed to shoot them dead. Period," said Daly. He pointed out others states, such as Florida have a "stand your ground" law, but Minnesota has what's known as a reasonable person doctrine. "If a reasonable person would see if you are in fear of great bodily harm of death. That's our statute. It comes down to what would a reasonable person see in this situation for Mr. Smith?" said Daly.[21]
Fox News host Sean Hannity supported Smith's actions on his show citing the fact that the teens broke into Smith's house to commit a robbery. Another guest on the show agreed, stating: "The guy should get a medal of freedom for what he did."[22] Geraldo Rivera also stated that he would have fired the initial shots, but supported the guilty verdict, and expressed disgust over the "finishing" shot of the girl.
Trial[edit]

He was immediately sentenced to life in prison without parole.[4] The audio recordings were named by the jurors as the biggest influence on their decision.

Chicago's billionaire Smith family anoints its next generation


(Crain's) — Inherited wealth has riven many families, such as Chicago's Pritzkers. But another billionaire clan has just anointed its fifth-generation scion without so much as a public ripple.  The Smith family, whose more-than-$5-billion stock portfolio is rooted in Northern Trust Corp. and Illinois Tool Works Inc., is now represented on these boards by David H. B. Smith Jr., a 44-year-old lawyer and great-great-grandson of Northern's founder, Byron L. Smith. Universally private to the point of Masonic secrecy, the Smiths also are Chicago's most durable corporate dynasty, with a history that dates to a time when the Swifts, Armours and McCormicks were the city's new money. Byron L. Smith's father launched the family's empire in 1857, when he started a forerunner to Continental Bank. Byron L. Smith  started Northern Trust in 1889, and with his sons established ITW in 1912. Today, the scores of descendants share a fortune that is second only to the Pritzkers' locally. David Smith, who declined to be interviewed, has joked with friends about being the black sheep of a family known for its Republican, free-market ideology. He worked for a federal regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, from 1996 to 2005. But his time there as a staff attorney and associate director was part of a career steeped in corporate governance that made him a logical heir to his 77-year-old uncle, Harold B. Smith Jr. “The real trick in fourth, fifth and sixth generations of family businesses is maintaining the pride and identity in the extended family for the business, especially its culture and values,” says John Ward, co-director of the Center for Family Enterprises at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.
STAYING BUSY
One reason the Smiths have remained intact appears to be their work ethic, which squelches any sense of entitlement. David Smith's father and his uncles worked as executives at Glenview-based ITW—in run-of-the mill offices no less—though they easily could have lived on their inheritances. The family's chieftains also seem to ensure no member feels left out. Every year, the entire family is invited to private presentations by the CEOs of Northern and ITW, most recently at the bank on Dec. 22.  Former ITW Chairman and CEO James Farrell says about 50 family members, including some from younger generations, would gather around a conference-room table for about an hour amid coffee and soft drinks. He'd take questions, which he says were generally friendly and supportive. The robust returns on the family's investments undoubtedly have helped maintain the peace, too. Over the past 20 years, Northern's stock has jumped 1,400% in value, while ITW's has soared 1,300%. That's triple the gain of the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index over the same span. The family receives some $130 million in dividends a year. (Northern was the largest bank in the U.S. to retain its dividend during the recent financial meltdown.)
quote|A reason the Smiths remain intact appears to be their work ethic, which squelches any sense of entitlement.
The Smith family trusts, which include holdings of venture capitalist Robert McCormack, 71, a Smith family member who also is a director at Northern and ITW, own about 10% of the Chicago-based bank and 15% of the diversified manufacturer. In turn, their cohesiveness has enabled Northern to survive as Chicago's last major independent bank and ITW to weather economic recessions and make dozens of industrial acquisitions a year.  Since 2005, David Smith has been general counsel of the Mutual Fund Directors Forum, a Washington, D.C.-based group that promotes director independence in a conflict-prone industry targeted by plaintiffs' lawyers. Mr. Smith, a graduate of Harvard Law School, drafts policy papers and legal briefs, contributing “intellectual prowess” to the organization, says co-founder David Ruder, a Northwestern University law professor and former SEC chairman. No taller than 5 feet, 6 inches, Mr. Smith is, by all accounts, an unpretentious suburban Washington dad who never hints at the family wealth and serves as board president of a private grade school in Rockville, Md. He likes to hunt, fish and pick National Football League winners, competing for bragging rights each season.  “When you first meet him, he's an average-looking guy,” says Forum director Gary Wilner, a retired Highland Park cardiologist and chairman of Chicago-based Oakmark Funds. “When you start to know him and expect things of him, he rises to those expectations.”  Mr. Smith grew up in Barrington until he went to boarding school at Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn. He returned to the Midwest to major in philosophy at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn. He earned a master's degree in English at the University of Chicago. After Harvard, he clerked for U.S. Appellate Court Judge Douglas Ginsberg in Washington. When visiting the family homestead in Barrington as a young adult, he would sometimes head to the Loop for beers with a friend, driving as far as the Northwest Side and hopping on the el at Cumberland Avenue. “He wasn't being cheap—that was just the way he was,” says Reid Mackin, executive director of the Belmont-Central Chamber of Commerce. “He still has that persona.”  Mr. Mackin also recalls that Mr. Smith wore a yarmulke when Mr. Smith married Ilene Weinreich, an attorney and Democratic campaign contributor he met when they worked at a Washington law firm in the mid-1990s. Mr. Smith's life hasn't been all smooth sailing: His parents divorced, and a teenage sister was killed in a car wreck near their Barrington home while he was away at Carleton. Passing the accident site later, “I wouldn't say he broke down,” says former college roommate Bill Burkett, a corporate controller in Minneapolis. “He was quiet. I could just see the shadow cross his face.”  Before stepping down as ITW president in 1981, Harold Smith Jr. was the last family member in a top position at either of the Smiths' businesses. His brother and David's father, David Smith Sr., retired later as ITW treasurer. By Smith family standards, Harold was a public figure; he served six years as chairman of the Illinois Republican Party in the 1990s. “We don't seek publicity,” he says, declining further comment.
