You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Excrement in the late Middle Ages : sacred filth and Chaucer's fecopoetics by

                           worldwide
                           This interdisciplinary book integrates the historical practices regarding material excrement and its symbolic representation,
                              with special focus on fecopoetics and Chaucer's literary agenda. Filth in all its manifestations - material (including privies,
                              dung on fields, and as alchemical ingredient), symbolic (sin, misogynist slander, and theological wrestling with the problem
                              of filth in sacred contexts) and linguistic (a semantic range including dirt and dung) - helps us to see how excrement is
                              vital to understanding the Middle Ages. Applying fecal theories to late medieval culture, Morrison concludes by proposing
                              Waste Studies as a new field of ethical and moral criticism for literary scholars--Résumé de l'éditeur

                           What have a deaf nun, the mother of the first baby born to Europeans in North America, and a condemned heretic to do with
                              one another? They are among the virtuous virgins, marvellous maidens, and fierce feminists of the Middle Ages who trail-blazed
                              paths for women today. Without those first courageous souls who worked in fields dominated by men, women might not have the
                              presence they currently do in professions such as education, the law, and literature. Focusing on women from Western Europe
                              between c. 300 and 1500 CE in the medieval period and richly carpeted with detail, A Medieval Woman's Companion offers a wealth
                              of information about real medieval women who are now considered vital for understanding the Middle Ages in a full and nuanced
                              way. Short biographies of 20 medieval women illustrate how they have anticipated and shaped current concerns, including access
                              to education; creative emotional outlets such as art, theatre, romantic fiction, and music; marriage and marital rights; fertility,
                              pregnancy, childbirth, contraception and gynecology; sex trafficing and sexual violence; the balance of work and family; faith;
                              and disability. Their legacy abides until today in attitudes to contemporary women that have their roots in the medieval period.
                              The final chapter suggests how 20th and 21st century feminist and gender theories can be applied to and complicated by medieval
                              women's lives and writings. Doubly marginalised due to gender and the remoteness of the time period, medieval women's accomplishments
                              are acknowledged and presented in a way that readers can appreciate and find inspiring. Ideal for high school and college
                              classroom use in courses ranging from history and literature to women's and gender studies, an accompanying website with educational
                              links, images, downloadable curriculum guide, and interactive blog will be made available at the time of publication

                           worldwide
                           "Establishing the field of Waste Studies, a material ecocritical approach, The Literature of Waste traces literal and figurative
                              waste in the western canon. The materiality of waste - as in landfills, trashcans, garbage dumps, compost piles - inevitably
                              transforms into metaphor. Waste emerges out of various disciplines, such as anthropological codification, psychological repression
                              of bodily decay, sociological civilizing process, historical garbaging of the past, economic conspicuous consumption, urban
                              disposal of bodily waste, religious sin, and philosophical angst. Vibrant materialism disturbs the use of the metaphor of
                              waste used to characterize people as disposable garbage. If we can read waste as possessing dynamic agency, how might that
                              change the ethics of refuse-ing and ostracizing wasted humans? Poets, the ragpickers of litter-ature, cure homeopathically.
                              Waste, Compost, and Gleaning Aesthetics acknowledge the poignancy of materiality by revealing the humanity we share."--

                           "Morrison's historical novel explores the legend of Beowulf. On the shore of the land of the Scyldings arrives a baby found
                              in a boat of foreign make, swaddled in salt-encrusted blankets and accompanied only by a silver spoon, an illuminated book,
                              and a piece of gold jewelry. The foundling is taken in by a local fisherman and his wife, who name her Brimhild. The young
                              king, Hrothgar, sanctions the adoption, though the king's mother is sure that the alien girl will bring only misfortune to
                              the land. From a local "mere-woman" Brimhild learns the lore of the land and its magic. From a traveling Irish monk she learns
                              of a religion that worships a pitiable, gentle god. Brimhild grows to adulthood, rising to a place of prominence among her
                              new people: she becomes the wife of Hrothgar and oversees the construction of Heorot, an immense hall that becomes the pride
                              of the Scyldings. She bears the king a son, Grendel, a sensitive child she raises secretly in the faith of Christ. Yet Brimhild
                              sits at a crossroads between old ideas and new ones, and the truth of her origins threatens her placement at the head of her
                              adopted tribe. Her betrayal and fall from grace give birth to a new set of stories, one in which she and her son are defamed
                              for all time. Morrison writes in alliterative, lyric prose that evokes the Old English of her source text: "There she saw
                              the soft seaweed, barnacled bed, of a marine monster. Leaving her work, approaching with caution, she listened for linnets
                              along the lime lane." An incredible world is spun out of blunt, staccato words: a world of customs and objects, of heroes
                              and faiths, and, of course, monsters. Morrison manages to update the medieval morality of the original poem while preserving
                              its mournful sense of the old ways passing away. An enchanting, poignant reimagining of Beowulf."--Amazon
