The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers today directed a pause nationwide on certain projects authorized but not yet under construction until they can be reviewed. The announcement came as a result of recent questions about the Corps processes. The Corps will take another look at active projects falling into two categories. Those with an economic assessment older than 1999 will have a new economic analysis before they can proceed. The second group of projects includes those where there are credible indications of changes in economic conditions, or engineering, scientific or environmental information since authorization that may have resulted in significant changes in project justification or support since authorization. Documentation for these projects will be reviewed and updated, if necessary.
