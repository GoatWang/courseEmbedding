Joint accounts receive twice the amount of coverage. Balances in excess of these limits will be prompty swept back into the Government & Agency Securitiy Money Market Fund (CAGXX). The BIDP's current rate of interest is 0.04%.*
Please note that banks may be added or removed from the BIDP and that may affect the amount of FDIC insurance. The details of the rate paid by the program as well as the portion of the account balance being held at program banks are provided on monthly Rockfleet customer account statements.  Clients always have the right to opt out of any particular financial institution should they so choose.
