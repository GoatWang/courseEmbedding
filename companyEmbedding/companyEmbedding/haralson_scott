Title: Chief Executive Officer
               Company: First Medica
Job Details
               Since 1991, First Medica has been providing high-quality superior latex powdered and powder-free examination gloves under the brand name of Medflex™ Premium. In response to valuable customer feedback, First Medica began a total redesign process on the exterior packaging of the Medflex™ Premium glove line. At this time, First Medica is proud to introduce the newly packaged Medflex™ Premium, Powdered and Powder-Free Gloves, with easy-to-identify sizing clearly labeled on the front and sides of the box. This product enhancement eliminates dispensing error by allowing for correct size selection every time. The graphic design of the box has been improved to deliver a more aesthetic appeal making it strikingly neat and trim in appearance. This new presence permits the gloves to easily streamline it into any desired field or industry. The size of the box has also been condensed allowing for a more compact carry while also reducing storage capacity needs. Medflex™ gloves have consistently provided proper sizing, effective performance and superior quality at a value driven price.

Move On When Ready Increases Educational Opportunities

Earlier this year, the Move On When Ready Act (MOWR) was signed  into  law.  This program simplifies and expands Georgia's dual enrollment   opportunities so that high school students can simultaneously satisfy   high school requirements and get a jump-start on a postsecondary   credential.  For further information, please see the Frequently Asked   Questions attachments about this new program.

Petition for Diploma

Students who did not pass the graduation test may now petition for their diploma.On Monday, March 30, 2015, Governor Nathan Deal signed House Bill 91 into law, thereby creating a new code section, O.C.G.A. § 20-2-281.1. This law became effective immediately. This law provides that students are no longer required to earn a passing score on any graduation tests to earn a high school diploma. Students, no longer enrolled, whose sole reason for not receiving a high school diploma was due to not passing any part of the graduation tests may petition the local board of education for a diploma by completing the Petition Form found at the link below. Either email a scanned image of the completed form to [email protected], or fax the completed form to (770)574-9679.Click here to access the petition form.
