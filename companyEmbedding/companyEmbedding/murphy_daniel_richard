Murphy, Mark Murphy, Elizabeth Murphy, Phebe Murphy, Zechariah Murphy, Calvin Murphy, D.R. Murphy, Jr.  I remember that my father purchased a farm near Springfield Mo and we moved there and I lived at home with father, near Springfiled, in 1860, but I can not recall the name of the Post Office, and I do not remebmer the name of the Township, but I recall te county as Greene County.

We lived in Greene County Missouri after our marriage near Fair Grove until about 1883when we moved to Arkansas. It may be that we did move to Baxter County till 1885 or six, it is a long time ago and i have no record of the time. Mr. Berry Murphy my late husband and myself never had any quarrels or fights He just quit living with me. He had no cause for quitting. He just seemed not to be well claimed he could not work, and he seemed to like to run around. He would go away and not say where he was going and be gone from a week to a month visiting kin folks and finally he just quit coming back, and thus left the children and myself all alone to take care of our selves."More About BENJAMIN MURPHY and SUSAN STRATTON:Marriage: December 31, 1865, Greene County, MOMarried by:: Dick Winn, Justice of the PeaceSeparation: Abt. 1886More About FLORENCE ELLIE JONES:Residence: Almon, Hickory County, MissouriMore About BENJAMIN MURPHY and FLORENCE JONES:Marriage: December 08, 1888, Polk County, MOMore About BENJAMIN MURPHY and SARAH STOW:Marriage: January 10, 1892, Douglass County, MONotes for MANDY F.

Dear Dena--just noticed your posting of Sept. 8, 2001 re Daniel Richard and William Murpy.  I think you have some wrong information on Jemima Ellen Murphy, daughter of Daniel and Lucy Ann Gore.  Jemima Ellen was my grandmother on my Mom's side of our family.  She married Louis Clark Crank and had 9 children, my grandmother being next to the youngest.  If you wish I can fill you in with more details by e-mail, bjgotoo@aol.com.  Was glad I found your message as you have some information I don't have on dates and burials, etc.  Did you know that Daniel Richard Murphy travelled the country with bibles and preaching?  There is a book written in his honor called "The Wilderness Prophet".  Hope you will e-mail me.   Regards, Betty

Welcome to danmurphydc.com
I want to offer the chiropractic profession the highest quality in whiplash education and to train doctors in the bulletproof management of personal injury cases with both documentation and treatment. We want to show the doctor the scientific validation of the subluxation and its relationship to structure and function mediated through the nervous system.

Description


Product Details




                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.
The Memorial Candle Program has been designed to help offset the costs associated with hosting this Tribute 
Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of Daniel E. Murphy can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month


Candle will be lit for the limited time of one year


Candle will be lit indefinitely

Candle message preserved on the memorial site for perpetuity
