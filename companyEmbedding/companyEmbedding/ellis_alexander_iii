Path to RockPort
Hap’s interest in energy took root during his first job out of college, when he went to work for US Senator Edward Brooke (R-MA) as a Legislative Assistant. In the ensuing four years, Middle East events changed forever both the politics and the economics of the global energy sector. Once in the private sector he formed a boutique insurance brokerage group to work with independent power companies. He was recruited away from the energy space by Knoll International to help re-invigorate this now well known furniture name. After the sale of Knoll to Westinghouse, he was recruited to Kenetech Corporation, the leading wind development and turbine manufacturer at the time, to help globally position this venture-backed company in anticipation of an IPO. After Kenetech and prior to joining RockPort, Hap and a partner developed, permitted and sold two 500+MW gas-fired power plants in the US, among other entrepreneurial ventures. Hap is a graduate of Colorado College with a BA in Political Science and earned an MBA from the Yale School of Management.

PERSONAL INSIGHT


While Hap gets a kick out of the fact that many of RockPort’s companies are contributing to improving the environment, his main motivation is much simpler: "I just want to do my part to help the RockPort team deliver superior results to our LPs. It's a challenge I welcome and it drives me to hit every airport concourse with a smile (well, at least with resolve)."

Family background[edit]
Ellis's father was Alexander B. (Sandy) Ellis II, an insurance executive in Boston who studied at Yale University. Ellis II (1922–1989) was an executive with insurance firm Fairfield & Ellis (which merged into Corroon & Black, now a part of Willis Group Holdings). His mother is Nancy Walker Bush Ellis, a sister of former President George H. W. Bush. Both Ellis II and George Bush were members of Skull and Bones at Yale.[1]:168
Education[edit]
Ellis grew up in Concord, Massachusetts and attended Milton Academy, he later went to Colorado College. He studied business at Yale University receiving a Masters in Business Administration.
Career[edit]
Early in his career Ellis went to work for US Senator Edward Brooke (R-MA) as a Legislative Assistant. While working for Senator Brooke among the issues he studied was the turmoil in the nation's energy supply caused by the change towards a more assertive pricing strategy by members of OPEC. Ellis entered the alternative energy sector upon leaving Brooke's office. Energy efficiency was his specialization. He was hired eventually by the furniture firm Knoll. Knoll was later acquired by Westinghouse. Ellis was recruited to Kenetech Corporation, one of the nation's foremost windpower development and turbine manufacturers. Kenetech obtained venture capital support and quickly achieved an important place in the industry. Subsequent to Kenetech and before joining RockPort, Ellis and a partner formed a company which developed two independent power plants. [2] Since 1998 Alexander Ellis III has been a partner with the firm Rockport Capital Partners. Alexander Ellis III is Chairman of Clean Diesel Technologies Inc.[3]

Incumbent Ellis Alexander of Hahnville easily defeated Milton Allemand Jr. of Hahnville on Tuesday to retain the 1st District seat on the St. Charles Parish School Board. Alexander, first elected to the board in 2006, campaigned on a platform of being fiscally responsible and overseeing continuous improvement in the public school system.
Campaign priorities for Allemand, who lost the same race to Alexander in 2010, included site-based budgeting and ensuring that resources were equally available for all high school graduates whether they were headed to college or the job market.

Ellis Turner Alexander, 64, passed away on Sunday, May 7, 2017 in Georgia after being in declining health for several years. Ellis was born on Nov. 26, 1952 in Salisbury, and was the son of Jacob Franklin and Doris Turner Alexander. He was the grandson of the late Jacob and Kathleen Alexander of St. Petersburg, Fla. and the late William and Dorothy Turner of Forest City. He graduated from Salisbury High School, where he was President of the Student Body and an All Conference football player. He also graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a Morehead Scholar, and three year letterman for the Tar Heel football team. His 53 yard field goal in 1973 was the longest field goal for the Heels for 12 years. Ellis was elected to the Rowan County Sports Hall of Fame in 2016. But more important than sports to Ellis were the lifelong friends he made as part of Salisbury High School and UNC football. Ellis married Nancy Smith in 1977. He worked in the transportation industry in North Carolina for 11 years with Pilot Freight Carriers in Winston-Salem and Youngblood Trucking in Asheville. Ellis was recruited to the printing industry, where he made a career in several senior management positons in New Jersey and Georgia. He retired from RR Donnelly in Atlanta, Ga. in 2009. Community service was an essential part of his involvement in each community where he and Nancy lived. He was active in the Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce, the Buncombe County United Way, and Gwinnett County GA Junior Achievement. He was also Chairman of the Buncombe County Republican Party, and was Secretary to the Board of the Southern Off-Road Bicycle Association. Ellis was an admired husband, father, grandfather and brother, and was a friend and mentor to scores of friends and associates. His integrity, intelligence, humor and wit made for a personality that was a magnet for friends. A former teammate says it was easy to be Ellis's friend. Another friend described Ellis as well-grounded without taking himself too seriously. Before his illnesses he was passionate about mountain biking and hiking. Ellis was an adventure seeker, which led him to competitive kayaking and trips to the Grand Canyon with Nancy. He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Nancy Smith Alexander; his daughters, Kerry Charlotte Cothern (Chad) and Christine Erin Alexander; and his beloved granddaughter, Charlotte Diane Cothern. He is also survived by his sister, Doris Alexander Buley and husband Bruce of Chapel Hill; his brother, Jacob Franklin Alexander III and wife Susan of Salisbury; and numerous nieces and nephews who adored their uncle. He was preceded in death by his parents and his sister, Margaret Alexander Parker.

Jasmine and Marcellus celebrate saying, “I do!”— Photo/Destination Weddings ArrecifeStudio Melia Caribe



















































The former Jasmine Ellis and Marcellus Alexander III were married in a beautiful, late afternoon ceremony on January 18 in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The bride’s aunt, the Rev. Anna L. Cottom, pastor of Providence United Methodist in Elkton, Md., officiated at the couple’s destination wedding, which took place at the Melia Caribe Tropical Resort. Jasmine was escorted down the scenic, tropical aisle by her father, Glenn Ellis Sr., and mother, Janet S. Lynch. The bride was stunning in her David Fielden gown with elegant lace detail and carried a fragrant, blush colored rose bouquet. The Bride
Jasmine, 28, is a native Philadelphian and a graduate of The Philadelphia High School for Girls. Jasmine is also a graduate of the University of Southern California where she studied broadcast journalism and international relations. Jasmine enjoys her career as the news producer of Philadelphia’s own 6abc Action News at 5. The GroomMarcellus, 29, is the son of Linda Joyce Alexander and Marcellus Alexander Jr. He was born in Philadelphia and moved to Columbia, Md. with his family during his teenage years. Marcellus is a graduate of Archbishop Carroll High School. He also earned a degree in business management from Hampton University in Hampton, Va. and enjoys his career as a manager of digital sales at Digital First Media & Main Line News. The Bridal PartyJasmine’s attendants, maid of honor, Zinzi Clemmons and bridesmaids, Dionne Coleman and Zoe Zeigler, were lovely in blush colored gowns. They carried white rose bouquets. Reagan Rollinson was the beautiful flower girl.Marcellus’ handsome best man was Brandon Davenport. The equally handsome groomsmen were Jeffrey Williams and Chris Capers. How They Met…The ProposalJasmine and Marcellus met at a party in Washington, D.C. Both lived in Baltimore, Md. at the time. Following great conversation, they agreed that they should reconnect in Baltimore. They did so and the rest is history.In January 2013, Marcellus and Jasmine were vacationing in Cape Town, South Africa. The couple made Table Mountain the first stop on their itinerary. As they stood on top of the mountain watching an awesome sunset, Jasmine asked two teenagers to take their photo. Jasmine handed them her camera and when she turned around Marcellus was reaching for something. It was her engagement ring. He proposed to her then and there. Jasmine, of course, said “Yes!” Not only was she engaged, but the couple left sharing a very special photo of that moment that they will cherish forever. The ReceptionFamily and guests traveled from far and near for Jasmine and Marcellus’ very special day. Among more than 80 guests were: Jasmine’s friend and Girls High classmate Ayahnna Hines and her husband Martez Hines who travelled from Germany; Carol and Joseph Jones from Philadelphia; Wayne and Renee Holland from Connecticut; Jerdine Bronson from Alabama; Glenn Ellis Jr. and his wife Alexis from Philadelphia; Oliver, Ehrin and Reagan Rollinson from Ohio; Andrea Alexander and Dr. Phil Williams of New York, N.Y.; William Herron from Houston, Texas; Carol and Joseph Jones from Philadelphia; and Wayne and Renee Holland from Connecticut. William Watson, from San Antonio, Texas, did a fantastic job of capturing the occasion with wonderful photos of the ceremony and reception. The bride also enjoyed having a good representation of Girls High girls and USC family who travelled from California, Washington, D.C., Texas, New York and Florida.
Jasmine and Marcellus danced their first dance as husband and wife to, “So Beautiful” by Musiq Soulchild, and Angela Flournoy was the victorious catcher of the wedding bouquet. Everyone had a wonderful time. ReflectionsMarcellus and Jasmine spent one year planning their big day. In the end, everything was perfect. They were overwhelmed by the more than 80 guests who joined them to celebrate their love.Jasmine began to cry with joy as she walked down the aisle and realized how many loved ones were present to witness her union with Marcellus. One of the couples’ most treasured memories of the ceremony was having Jasmine’s Aunt Anna officiate the marriage. Jasmine and Marcellus also enjoyed finally hearing the vows they wrote for each other. They wrote their own vows and kept them a secret until their wedding day.The couple got married on the beach and they could not have asked for more perfect weather. The clear skies continued well into the evening as the bride and groom danced the night away with family and friends during the reception. The HoneymoonMarcellus and Jasmine honeymooned in Costa Rica. They stayed at the Tabacon Hot Springs in Arenal, Costa Rica for three days then spent four days at Hotel Riu Guanacaste. Their favorite part of the honeymoon was relaxing together and also experiencing new adventures like ziplining and horseback riding. They have many amazing memories of the entire experience as they continue to enjoy their lives together in Philadelphia.Congratulations and very best wishes to Mr. and Mrs. Marcellus Alexander III.

It’s hard to say which came first – our partnership or our expertise in clean technologies—they’re so closely interrelated. Our Partners have a long and varied history of working together in energy and cleantech, which predates the company’s founding (in 1998) by 30 years.
We partner with management teams in the same way we partner with each other, drawing on our collective strength. As a result, our portfolio companies have access to our deep and wide-ranging network of innovators, policy makers and business leaders.
