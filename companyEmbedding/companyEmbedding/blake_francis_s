Education and family[edit]
Blake attended Brooks School in North Andover, Massachusetts, class of 1967. He received his bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1971 and a Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School in 1976.
In 1977, Blake married Anne McChristian with whom he had two children. In 2005, he married Elizabeth Lanier (Blake) who works as general counsel for Habitat for Humanity International.[1]
Legal career[edit]
From 1971–1973 Blake was a legislative assistant to the joint committee on Social Welfare of the Massachusetts legislature. He was admitted to the District of Columbia bar in 1978. He served as a law clerk to Judge Wilfred Feinberg and then to Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. Blake also served as general counsel for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), deputy counsel to Vice President George H. W. Bush.
Management[edit]
Delta Board of Directors Francis S. "Frank" Blake as Newest Member
From 1991–1995 he was the general counsel for General Electric. As senior vice president, Corporate Business Development, he led all business development efforts, including worldwide mergers, acquisitions, dispositions and identification of strategic growth opportunities. As GE Power Systems head of business development, he played a key role in expanding that business into new technology and global marketplaces. He also held the position of general counsel at GE Power Systems.
Blake then served as Deputy Secretary for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), a role similar to that of chief operating officer in the private sector. There, he was a leader in departmental policy decisions and managed DOE's annual $19 billion budget.
Blake joined the Home Depot in 2002 as executive vice president for Business Development and Corporate Operations, and vice chairman on the board of directors, reporting directly to chairman and CEO Robert Nardelli. His responsibilities include real estate, store construction and maintenance, credit services, strategic business development, special orders and service improvement, call centers and Installation Services Business.
In April 2004, Blake was elected to serve on the board of directors for Southern Company, a premier super-regional energy company based in Atlanta, Georgia.
CEO of Home Depot[edit]
After Nardelli resigned as Chairman and CEO on January 3, 2007, amid controversy over the company's stagnating stock price, poor customer service and Nardelli's salary, Blake was elevated to these positions. Although a longtime deputy to Nardelli at GE and Home Depot, Blake has been said to lack Nardelli's hard edge and instead prefers to make decisions by consensus. Indeed, Blake repudiated many of his predecessor's strategies, and it has been reported that the two men have not spoken since Nardelli departed Home Depot.[2]
Nardelli had pushed hard to make the company more efficient, instituting many metrics and centralizing operations, while cutting jobs to meet quarterly earnings targets. While this initially doubled earnings and reduced expenses, it alienated many of the store managers and rank-and-file store associates, and by extension the customers, resulting in a drop in same-store sales which is a key metric that analysts used to gauge the company stock. Nardelli, who regarded home improvement store-by-store sales as less important due to market saturation from competition such as Lowe's, aimed to dominate the wholesale housing-supply business though building up HD Supply, a unit that Blake sold for $8.5 billion in August 2007 since it was not part of Home Depot's integrated business.[3]
In comparison to Nardelli whose numbers-driven approach never appreciated the role of the store and its associates, Blake's strategy has revolved around reinvigorating the stores and its service culture (engaging employees, making products readily available and exciting to customers, improving the store environment, and dominating the professional contracting business, an area in which Home Depot's closest rivals trail far behind), as he recognized that employee morale is a more sensitive issue in retail compared to other industry sectors like manufacturing. [4] Blake was given credit for returning to the "Orange Apron Cult — the nearly religious zeal for knowledgeable employees and high levels of customer service that was the secret of the company’s original success", as he believed that customer service was the key to Home Depot to differentiate itself from competitors on aspects other than price. [5]
Under Nardelli's tenure, Home Depot's stock performance lagged behind rival Lowe's, however this situation has been reversed under Blake. [6]
On August 21, 2014, The Home Depot announced that Craig Menear, President of U.S. Retail for The Home Depot, would take over as President and CEO on November 1, 2014. Menear has also been elected to the Board of Directors, effective immediately. Blake will remain Chairman.[7][8]

Total compensation for each chief executive includes the following: salary and bonuses; other compensation, such as vested restricted stock grants, LTIP payouts and perks; and stock gains, the value realized by exercising stock options. Efficiency rank is based on our chief executive's performance/pay score. Ranks are given only to chief executives who have a six-year tenure and six-year compensation history. The most efficient rank is 1 and least efficient is 206.

Footnotes: 
	Compensation data is from the latest available proxy statements filed through Mar. 23, 2012. Total returns and value of stock owned (including all classes) is based on Mar. 14, 2012 stock price. Compensation percent change is based on combined salary and bonus. Annualized total return during tenure covers the tenure of the executive or from the time of the IPO or available stock history. Relative to market is the ending value of $100 invested in the stock, divided by the ending value of $1 invested in the S & P 500 (a score of 100 = the S & P 500). NA: Not available or not applicable.

Blake William Francis's Experience
Title: Senior Account Executive
               Company: Mongonet Inc.
Job Details
               Company Size: $1 mil to less than $5 mil - Employee Range: Less than 25. Founded in 1999, MongoNet® is a privately held corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company has developed a massively-scalable patented technology and communications service called MongoFAXÔ. The service makes paper as versatile, ubiquitous and easy as email, providing a superior new channel of paper delivery over existing options such as courier, overnight, mail and traditional fax. The service leverages a base of 130 Million installed fax machines coupled with the world's 500+ Million email users.  We live in a digital world, yet ironically the Internet itself has fostered increased paper consumption due to unprecedented access to information and the ability to share files that get printed. The United States consumption of office paper increased by 15% from 1995 to 2000. 420 Billion pages of traditional fax were sent worldwide in 2001. It is predicted that traditional fax traffic will increase to 650 Billion pages by the year 2005. This represents approximately $35 Billion in long distance telecom charges paid by fax senders every year.  MongoFAXÔ bypasses these long distance telecom charges while enabling people to digitally deliver paper documents as PDF files from ordinary fax machines* to any email address in the world - with no added hardware and no added software.  MongoFAXÔ is ideal for organizations in paper intensive (contract intensive) market verticals such as insurance, legal, banking, transportation, title companies, trust companies, real estate, financial, health, biotech, government and other organizations.
