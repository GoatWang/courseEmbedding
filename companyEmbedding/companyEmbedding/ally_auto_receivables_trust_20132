Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Rates Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2013-SN1 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2013-SN1
    





June 05, 2013 01:14 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Ally Auto Receivables 
      Trust 2013-SN1:
    

      --$194,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$295,000,000 class A-2 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$395,000,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; and
    

      --$102,036,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The pool consists of strong quality leases 
      with a weighted average (WA) FICO score of 765, seasoning of 11 months, 
      and a well-diversified residual value (RV) maturity schedule. Of 
      concern, the pool does contain heavy concentrations in truck and SUV/CUV 
      collateral.
    

      Sufficient CE Structure: 2013-SN1 incorporates a sequential-pay 
      structure. Initial credit enhancement (CE) to the class A notes is 
      17.50%, building to 20.50%. Hard CE consists of overcollaterization 
      (8.25% building to 11.25% of the initial collateral balance), 
      subordination, and a nondeclining reserve account (0.50%). The 
      transaction will also benefit from 4.38% in per annum excess spread.
    

      Improved Loss Performance: Credit and residual losses on Ally's 
      portfolio have declined significantly from the elevated levels seen in 
      2008 and 2009. This is a result of improved obligor credit quality and a 
      recently solid wholesale used vehicle market, leading to higher recovery 
      rates and residual realization.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates the originator and servicer, Ally 
      Financial Inc., 'BB-' with a Stable Outlook. Fitch believes Ally to be a 
      capable originator, underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by 
      historical performance of its managed portfolio.
    

      Unstable Macroeconomic Conditions: While the current wholesale vehicle 
      market in the U.S. is strong, Fitch remains concerned regarding 
      potential macroeconomic deterioration, which could lead to increased 
      credit and residual loss levels. Potential increases in gas prices in 
      the near term could harm the residual values of older vehicles and less 
      fuel efficient models, particularly SUVs and trucks.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of Ally would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated 
      the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Ally Auto Receivables Trust 
      2013-SN1 to increased credit and residual losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays 
      relatively little sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses, 
      showing downgrades of only one rating category even under Fitch's severe 
      (2.5 times base case loss) scenario. The transaction shows significantly 
      more sensitivity to residual loss volatility, though even under Fitch's 
      severe scenario, the class A notes would be expected to retain an 
      investment grade rating.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated May 28, 2013. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2013-SN1 - Appendix'. This R&W is compared 
      to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.
