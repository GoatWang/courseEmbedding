      Fitch Rates Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2013-1
    





February 27, 2013 01:13 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust (VALET) 2013-1:
    

      --Class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --Class A-2 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The weighted average (WA) FICO of 763 is 
      consistent with recently issued VALET transactions and, combined with 
      the strong internal credit tier distribution, indicates a strong 
      borrower. However, the pool contains a higher concentration of extended 
      term loans, which have experienced greater losses historically.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): 2013-1 incorporates a sequential-pay 
      structure. Initial CE is 3.10% of the initial adjusted pool balance, 
      growing to 3.50% of the initial securitization value. Annual excess 
      spread is expected to be 1.81%. CE is sufficient to cover Fitch's 
      'AAAsf' stressed loss expectation.
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses and delinquency 
      levels on VCI's portfolio and prior securitizations have improved 
      dramatically from peak levels in 2007 and 2008 and stabilized at lower 
      levels.
    

      Unstable Economic Outlook: A slower recovery and potential for 
      volatility could affect delinquencies and losses. Fitch's analysis 
      accounts for this risk by including poorer performing vintages from the 
      recent recession in the base case loss analysis.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of VCI would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes VCI to be a 
      capable originator, underwriter, and servicer. These capabilities are 
      further evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss 
      experience and securitization performance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITY
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to VALET 2013-1 to 
      increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and credit losses, showing a potential downgrade of 
      one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The 
      notes could experience downgrades of up to three rating categories, 
      although still remaining investment grade, under Fitch's severe (2.5x 
      base case loss) scenario.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      For more information about Fitch's comprehensive subscription service

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

Fitch Rates Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2014-1 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2014-1
    





April 30, 2014 04:09 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by 
      Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2014-1 (VALET 2014-1) as follows:
    

      --$288,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$418,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$418,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$126,000,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The weighted average (WA) FICO score of 763 
      is consistent with recently issued VALET transactions and, combined with 
      the strong internal credit-tier distribution, indicates a strong 
      borrower. The concentration of extended term loans has decreased from 
      the previous transactions.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: VALET 2014-1 incorporates a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial credit enhancement (CE) is 3.10% of 
      the initial adjusted pool balance, growing to 3.50% consistent with 
      recent Volkswagen transactions. Annual excess spread is expected to be 
      2.07%. Consistent with expected ratings of 'AAAsf', CE is sufficient to 
      cover in excess of a 5.0x multiple of Fitch's base case expected 
      lifetime cumulative net losses (CNLs) of 1.20%.
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses and delinquencies on 
      Volkswagen Credit Inc.'s (VCI) portfolio and securitizations have shown 
      continued improvement from the peak levels observed in the 2007 and 2008 
      vintages and have stabilized at low levels since 2010.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates the parent Volkswagen Group 'A-' 
      with a Positive Rating Outlook. Volkswagen has recorded positive 
      corporate financial results in recent years, and its overall corporate 
      health has remained strong.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of VCI would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes VCI to be a 
      capable originator, underwriter and servicer. These capabilities are 
      further evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss 
      experience and securitization performance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of VALET 2014-1 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some 
      sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. In fact, they could lead 
      to potential downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's moderate 
      (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of 
      up to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) 
      scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in 
      Fitch's presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com' 
      or by clicking on the link.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 
      2014-1--Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's April 17, 2012 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moodyâs publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and weâll set up your first campaign for you for free. Weâll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. Weâre here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
