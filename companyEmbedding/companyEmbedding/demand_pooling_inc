This prospectus relates to the resale of our common stock that may be offered 
and sold from time to time by the selling stockholders.  We will not receive 
any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock in this offering.


There are no known competitors offering true demand aggregation services on the 
broad and flexible basis which the Company offers.  A variety of companies 
provide services to SLGs for permitting, licensing, RFP posting and surplus 
equipment auctions.  Other companies and associations offer cooperative buying 
opportunities, including “ piggyback contracting ” to SLGs, primarily for lower 
priced items such as office supplies, consumables and small equipment.  At 
least one other entity, the Houston-Galveston Area Council, through its HGACBuy
affiliate, provides cooperative buying opportunities for high-priced capex 
products, but it does so by employing the “piggyback contracting” approach. 
The Company is currently exploring opportunities for sublicensing its platform 
to third parties as a means for more rapidly addressing market segments not 
currently addressed by the Company.  Any such sublicensing agreement would 
incorporate provisions for royalty payments to the Company.


Company Description
From inception (April 29, 2008), Accelerated Acquisitions V, Inc. was 
organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, 
acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of 
being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objectives were to


 
achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business 
rather than immediate, short-term earnings. 

On April 29, 2008, the Registrant sold 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock to 
Accelerated Venture Partners, LLC for an aggregate investment of $4,000.00.  
These shares were issued immediately following the incorporation of the 
Company and were “founder’s shares”.  There were no written or oral agreements
between the parties relevant to the purchase of the founder’s shares and the 
purchaser became the sole shareholder of the Company (which at the time was 
a “shell” corporation.  The Registrant sold these shares of Common Stock 
under the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the 
Securities Act. 

On March 22, 2010 Richard K. Aland agreed to acquire 23,907,138 shares of the 
Company’s common stock par value $0.0001 for a price of $0.0001 per share and 
Donald Kelly agreed to acquire 4,218,907 shares of the common stock par value 
$0.0001 for a price of $0.0001 per share.  This transaction was consummated 
on April 2, 2010. 

At the same time, Accelerated Venture Partners, LLC (“AVP”) agreed to 
tender 1,979,760 of its 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock par 
value $0.0001 for cancellation. Accelerated Venture Partners, LLC tendered 
the shares as a part of a negotiated transaction where it agreed to transfer 
control of the Company to Messrs Aland and Kelly.  The agreed consideration 
for the transaction was that AVP would retain 9.69% of the post-transaction 
shares issued and outstanding.  It was also agreed at the time that the 
Company would enter into a Consulting Services Agreement with AVP.
The entire transaction was the subject of an oral agreement between the 
parties which designated the applicable share amounts and share price and 
was one integrated transaction.  There was no specific consideration 
allocated to any of its elements; i.e. there was no specific consideration 
for the tender of shares apart from the overall consideration paid by Messrs. 
Aland and Kelly for their concurrent purchase of their interest in the 
Company.  By letter dated March 25, 2010, AVP tendered 1,979,760 shares of 
its stock to the Company for cancellation.  A copy of this letter is attached 
as Exhibit 10.3. 

Messrs. Aland and Kelly subsequently made gifts of 136,000 and 110,000 
shares, respectively, to an aggregate of nine donees.  All gifted shares 
were donated prior to April 2, 2010.  All gifts were to members of the 
respective donor’s family as a part of the donor’s ongoing estate planning.  
The relationships are the following:  Robert and Ronald Aland are brothers 
of Richard Aland; Lauren Morr and Erin Spalsbury are daughters of Richard 
Aland.  Chad Kelly and Jessica Kelly are children of Don Kelly; Dominic and 
Wyatt Kelly are grandchildren of Don Kelly; Nina Kelly is the mother of 
Jessica and Chad Kelly and is Don Kelly’s ex-wife).   Following these 
transactions (and the exercise of the AVP Option), Mr. Aland owned 69.12%% 
and Mr. Kelly owned 11.95% of the Company’s 34,391,506 issued and outstanding 
shares of common stock par value $0.0001.  The interest of Accelerated 
Venture Partners, LLC (including shares issued on the exercise of the AVP 
Option) was reduced to approximately 18.19% of the total issued and 
outstanding shares.  Simultaneously with the share purchase, Timothy Neher 
resigned from the Company’s Board of Directors and Messrs. Aland and Kelly 
were simultaneously appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors.  Such 
action represented a change of control of the Company. 

The Company intends to file a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of 
Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware in order to change 
its name to “DEMAND POOLING, INC” following the effective date of this 
registration statement.  A draft of the proposed Certificate of Amendment 
is attached as Exhibit 3(iii). 

On April 15, 2010, the Company entered into a Licensing Agreement 
(“Licensing Agreement”) with Demand Pooling Global Services, LLC (“Licensor”) 
pursuant to which the Company was granted a, non-transferrable license for 
certain territories (an exclusive license for North America and a 
non-exclusive license for all markets outside of North America) for certain 
intellectual property developed by Licensor, principally comprising a 
business concept and related technology which has, as its core product, the 
aggregation of demand for high-ticket capital equipment and selected 
commodities to facilitate cooperative purchases of similar products by a 
significant number of large end-users (the “Technology”).  The Technology 
would also permit and facilitate pooled financing for such purchases in a 
manner which permits greater financial flexibility for the end-users.  
Finally, the Technology permits and facilitates the disposal of older 
equipment and commodities by end-users in order to improve the cost recovery 
on disposal of surplus or dated equipment and commodities.  The License also 
provides for the use of a datacenter through a third-party provider. 

The only relationship between the Company and Licensor is that of a 
licensee/licensor relationship.  Licensor is the developer of the software 
and the Company both markets and operates the platform.  The license is an 
exclusive North American license and a non-exclusive worldwide license, 
permitting the licensor to offer the platform to other marketing firms for 
operation of pools outside of North America.  The two senior-most managers 
of both firms are the same, Richard Aland and Don Kelly. 

The Company establishes certain rules for each pool.  These rules relate 
primarily to the timing of the pool – when it is opened to buyer 
participation, when buyer participation ends and supplier bidding commences 
and the time deadline when the suppliers must submit bids.  Typically, the 
latter occurs at 1:59:59 PM Central time after which time, suppliers can no 
longer submit bids.  One second later (timed according to the U.S. Atomic 
Clock), access reverts to the buyers for capturing their respective bids 
from the supplier.  No timing is imposed upon the buyers for evaluating 
their bids and making a determination of whether to award a contract to one 
or more suppliers or to reject the bids.  Some may award immediately and 
some may take several months to make a determination, but each buyer 
evaluates its own bids and accepts or rejects them as they have in the past. 

The Company provides no examples of invitations for bids (“IFBs”), purchase 
agreements or other documentation since every state or local government must 
reserve the right to employ its own documents which are uploaded onto the 
Company’s platform.  Suppliers must download and acknowledge receipt of those 
documents before they are allowed to progress to pricing. 

The Company imposes no geographic constraints or limitations and the only 
bidding process that is addressed by the platform is the traditional ‘ 
competitive sealed bid ’ process which state and local governments either 
require or with which they are most familiar. 

The Company does not plan to offer opportunities for a reverse auction 
mechanism or for Dutch auctions, or otherwise. 

The Company does not conduct an auction process but rather a very different 
and distinct process referred to as a “competitive sealed bid” process.  
Under the competitive sealed bid process, buyers seek pricing from suppliers 
that are submitted in sealed envelopes, or in our case electronically, and 
opened mechanically or electronically by each buyer at Bid Opening.  There is 
no chance, as would be the case for an auction, for suppliers to submit one 
or more improved bids.  The sealed pricing is the best and final bid and no 
other pricing can be considered. 

The Company does not trade commodities, a process, which as previously 
explained, is very different from the Company’s process of providing a 
platform where state and local governments can post their IFB’s seeking bid 
pricing for their purchases.  In fact, the Company, does not buy, sell, 
inventory or trade any product. 

SLG’s do not hire us, contract with us or pay us a fee.  They simply use our 
platform to post their requirements through an IFB pursuant to the 
traditional sealed bid process and we have not been able to identify any 
entity which is unable to employ our platform. 

Except for the rights granted under the License Agreement, Licensor retains 
all rights, title and interest to the Technology and any improvements 
thereto—although the License includes the Company’s right to utilize such 
improvements. 

The term of the License commences the date of execution of the Licensing 
Agreement (“Execution Date”) and continues for a term of twenty (20) years, 
ending on the twentieth anniversary of the Execution Date.  In addition to 
other requirements, the continuation of the license is conditioned on the 
Company generating net revenues in excess of expenses in the normal course 
of operations or the funding by the Company of a minimum of $10,000,000 for 
"qualifying research, development and commercialization expenses" in 
accordance with the following schedule: 

(a)  a minimum of US$1,000,000 during the period commencing upon the 
     Execution Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Execution 
     Date; or  

(b)  a minimum of US$4,000,000 during the period commencing upon the 
     Execution Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Execution 
     Date; or  

(c)  a minimum of US$10,000,000 during the period commencing upon the 
     Execution Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Execution Date  

Notwithstanding, the License is not subject to immediate discontinuance 
despite the fact that the initial milestone (net revenues in excess of 
expenses in the normal course of operations or receive funding of at least 
$1 million by one year from April 15, 2010) has passed.  The three milestones 
detailed in the License are cumulative and provide that the conditions are 
satisfied if any one of the three milestones is achieved.  In other words, 
although Milestone #1 (raising $1 million or generating revenues in the 
amount of $1 million) has not been met, the requirement can be met by 
achieving Milestone #2 by the second anniversary of the License Agreement 
(raising $5 million or generating $5 million in revenues) and if neither 
is met, then the requirements can be satisfied by achieving Milestone #3 by 
the end of the third year (raising $10 million or generating $10 million in 
revenues).  Neither the Company nor any of its advisors or consultants has 
significant experience in raising funds similar to the $15,000,000 
estimated to be required. 

The Licensing Agreement calls for royalties payable by the Company to the 
Licensor of ten percent (10%) of all gross revenues resulting from the use 
of the Technology by the Company and twenty-five percent (25%) of all 
royalties and fees received from third party sublicensees. 

The license is terminated upon the occurrence of events of default specified 
in the License Agreement. 

The Company played no role in the development of the Technology.  The 
business concept behind the Technology was developed primarily by Richard 
Aland, the Company founder, although he played no role in the actual 
development of the Technology.    Since the Company has just begun to apply 
the Technology commercially, the Company is unable to estimate the commercial 
value of the Technology.   Licensor was created for the purpose of developing 
and implementing the software application necessary for implementation of 
Mr. Aland’s vision of how state and local governments could effectively 
generate large-scale savings on the purchase of capital assets and certain 
commodities (motor fuel and water treatment chemicals).   Licensor has been 
in business since August, 2005 and during the time since its commencement of 
operations through 2009, it developed the software application.  
Notwithstanding, Licensor found that it lacked the capabilities to 
effectively and successfully market the concept.  Licensor therefore 
determined to focus solely on software development with a strategy to 
sell or license the software and to provide support for the software. To the 
best of the Company’s knowledge, Licensor has never been, is not currently 
and has no plans in the future to engage in the demand aggregation pools 
business.  DPGS is strictly a software development company which developed 
the electronic application or platform which is licensed to the Company. 
Further, the Company believes that Licensor has no intent to engage in a
business similar to the Company in the United States (which the Company 
believes would be in violation of the terms of the License). The Company 
believes that Licensor has not generated any revenues to date. 

The Company investigated a variety of software applications as possible 
alternatives to the licensed software, but did not find any alternative 
software which it viewed as being as sophisticated, scalable and flexible 
as the software application licensed from Licensor. 

The Company’s application platform is fully functional in its current state 
and it is currently conducting its first non-beta pooled purchase of products 
for state and local governments.  The process for operating its aggregation 
platform involves posting the opening of a pooled purchase of a specific 
product on its website and allowing buyers to join the pool for 30-45 days.  
At the end of this period, the pool automatically closes for buyer access 
and opens to supplier access for capturing all posted IFBs, evaluating the 
IFBs, formulating and submitting their bids.  The period for supplier bidding 
is also typically 30-45 days and requires that all bids must be submitted 
prior to the end of this period, at which time suppliers no longer are 
permitted access and access returns to the buyers for capturing and 
evaluating their bids and awarding contracts. A determination of award may 
take as long as 180 days from the date that the bids are due from suppliers. 
If a supplier is selected as the winning bidder, it enters into a contract 
negotiation period with the buyer and this is conducted independent of the 
Company’s platform.  If a contract is completed, the suppliers are 
responsible for paying the Company’s platform use fee.  The suppliers of the 
product pay the fees charged by the Company.  The subject product is motor 
fuel and the next product pools will be for water treatment chemicals and 
police and other vehicles.  The Company is currently ascertaining the optimal 
timing for the launch of pooled purchases for these products. The Company 
launched its first non-beta pool in October 2010, which was followed by a 
Winter Motor Fuel Pool the last week in December 2010 and recently launched 
its Spring Motor Fuel Pool.  The Fall Motor Fuel Pool (October 2010 Pool)
was cancelled due to the withdrawal of a buyer with substantial fuel 
requirements, because it could not accept bids solely in an electronic 
format.  Modifications to the Company’s platform now require bids in an 
electronic format, but allow for the buyer to designate that it must also 
receive written copy of the bid.  No assurance can be given that one or more 
awards will be made or revenues will be generated from the award of contracts 
by buyers.

The “business concept” which the Company is currently marketing to state and 
local governments is a streamlined  ”demand aggregation,” or “cooperative 
purchasing” methodology for acquiring high-valued capital assets and selected 
commodities (motor fuel and water treatment chemicals), that comprise a 
significant component of most state and local government budgets as a means 
for producing improved pricing (volume-discount pricing) versus the pricing 
that would be achievable by individual entities in the volumes each would 
typically buy.  The “Technology” supporting the business concept is the 
actual electronic platform that facilitates buyers seeking bid requests in a 
single time window and in a single location, provided they have access to the 
Internet and can login to the Company’s website.  The Company’s initial 
target market is considered highly fragmented, consisting of approximately 
87,000 state and local governments that do not have any natural way of 
leveraging their collective buying power.  These state and local governments 
have common purchase needs, are non-competitive with one another and tend to 
employ the same sealed bid process for obtaining competitive bids. 

In order to market the benefits of demand aggregation (cooperative 
purchasing) to its initial target market customers, and potentially to 
others, and to streamline the cooperative buying process, the Company has 
licensed a web-based, fully-functional electronic platform technology, 
developed in its entirety by the Licensor, to automate various aspects of 
the business concept.  The Company does not intend to be in the software 
development business or to commit the resources to creation, development or 
maintenance of software, but prefers to focus its attention and resources 
upon marketing its services to users that may benefit from those services. 

On April 29, 2010, the Company entered into a Consulting Services Agreement 
(“Consulting Services Agreement”) with AVP, a company controlled by Timothy 
J. Neher.  A copy of the Consulting Services Agreement is attached hereto as 
Exhibit 10.2.  The Consulting Services Agreement required that AVP provide 
the Company with certain advisory services that included reviewing the 
Company’s business plan, identifying and introducing prospective financial 
and business partners, and providing general business advice regarding the 
Company’s operations and business strategy in consideration of (a) an option 
granted by the company to AVP to purchase 3,235,971 shares of the company’s 
Common Stock at a price of $0.0001 per share (the “AVP Option”) (which was 
immediately exercised by the holder, subject to a repurchase option 
(“Repurchase Option”) granted to the Company to repurchase the shares at a 
price of $0.0001 per share upon the occurrence of certain events of default 
as more fully detailed in the Consulting Services Agreement and (b) certain 
cash compensation based on the achievement of certain specific milestones. 

On February 22, 2011, the Company received a letter from AVP giving notice of 
its termination of the Consulting Services Agreement (“Termination Letter”).  
A copy of the Termination Letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.   The 
Company believes that AVP failed to perform the agreed services under the 
Consulting Services Agreement.  Since AVP did not meet the milestones 
required in the Consulting Services Agreement, the Company does not believe 
that it is obligated to pay any amounts to AVP under the terms of the 
Consulting Services Agreement.  The Company exercised on May 24, 2011 the 
Repurchase Option with respect to the 3,235,971 shares of Company Common 
Stock which was issued to AVP under the Consulting Services Agreement at a 
price of $0.0001 per share.  The Company’s management believes that the 
termination of the Consulting Services Agreement will have no impact 
whatsoever on its plan of operation, principally because AVP was not actively 
involved in the Company’s operations prior to such termination. 

On May 3, 2010, the Company filed a Form 8-K Report with the United States 
Securities and Exchange Commission which, among other things, included a 
change in the Company’s Shell Company Status as of April 15, 2010—the date 
the company entered into the License.

On July 2, 2010, the company completed a private offering of its common 
shares under the provisions of the Delaware securities laws and under a 
Regulation D exemption with respect to the federal securities laws. We sold 
a total of 9,250 common shares at a price of $2.00 per share to a total of 
thirty-five investors. We raised a total of $18,500 in this offering.
