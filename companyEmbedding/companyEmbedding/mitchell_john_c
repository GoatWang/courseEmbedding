About
Highly respected for his cutting edge hair styling and iconic cuts and known among industry professionals for having some of the best razor cutting skills, Eric Hauck has certainly made a name for himself as a leader in the competitive hair care business – especially among his biggest critics, other stylists. He has worked backstage at some of Fashion Week’s biggest shows including Dior, Marc Jacobs and Helmut Lang and on the pages of leading fashion and beauty publications in the US and internationally.

After joining Bumble and Bumble in New York City and completing the cutting apprenticeship, Bumble and Bumble saw his raw talent and passion for hair education. Eric traveled extensively with the brand throughout the US and UK as a hair educator and helped open a Bumble and Bumble school in London, training the UK team in cutting curriculum, public speaking and hair demos. An artist and perfectionist, Eric was quickly promoted to Lead Educator at Art Director where he trained the staff in the nuances of razor cutting.

After a long and successful 11 year partnership with Bumble and Bumble, Eric took a position at the respected Cutler Salon in NYC where he continued teaching advanced stylists while cutting hair at the SOHO location.  In 2011, Eric opened a private invite-only studio on the Lower East Side where he cut and styled clients hair.

Eric’s developed eye and mastery of cutting techniques has made him best known for his timeless, classic and wearable hair philosophy. It is this philosophy that captured the attention of Mitch DeRosa, owner of Boston’s renowned Mitchell John Salon and one of the founders of Living Proof®.

Mitch recruited Eric to relocate from New York City to Boston and begin his latest venture as Lead Stylist and Creative Director of Mitchell John Salon, as well as join the education team at Living Proof. As Creative Director, Eric will have the opportunity to demonstrate his vision, artistry and technique among Boston’s stylish and sophisticated residents. Eric will also help develop and lead the training program for the salon.
 
favorite product:
Living proof. Prime. it's perfect for any hair type and is the first step for a beautiful style.
 
one styling secret i'm willing to share:
a great haircut starts with a great consultation. make sure your stylist listens to you and approaches every visit with a fresh set of eyes.

cancellations.
All appointments are secured with either a Visa or MasterCard.  If you must reschedule or cancel your appointment and are unable to provide adequate notice the card on file will be charged for 100% of the services booked.  However, if we’re able to fill the vacant appointment, we’re more than happy to waive any charges.

punctuality.
Please contact a salon coordinator if it appears that you are going to be late to an appointment and we promise to do the same for you if we're running behind!  If you are expecting to be more than fifteen minutes late we cannot guarantee completion of the services booked, but as always, we’ll make every effort to do so.
personal items.
MJS is not responsible for personal items that have been damaged during services.  Smocks are provided prior to appointments to ensure that your clothing looks as great when you leave as it did when you arrived!

payment methods.
Cash, Visa, MasterCard and MJS Gift Cards are acceptable tenders for all services and products.  Unfortunately we are unable to add gratuities for stylists and assistants to credit or gift cards.
revisions.

John Clifford Mitchell is professor of computer science and (by courtesy) electrical engineer at Stanford University. He has published in the area of programming language theory and computer security.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
John C. Mitchell is the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning at Stanford University, the Mary and Gordon Crary Family Professor in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, co-director of the Stanford Computer Security Lab, and Professor (by courtesy) of Education.[7][8] He is a member of the steering committee for Stanford University's Cyber Initiative. Mitchell has been Vice Provost at Stanford University since 2012, first as the inaugural Vice Provost for Online Learning and now in a broader role for Teaching and Learning. Under Mitchell's direction, the Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning (VPTL) is advancing teaching and learning through faculty-driven initiatives and research, transforming education in Stanford's classrooms and beyond.
Mitchell's first research project in online learning started in 2009 when he and six undergraduate students built Stanford CourseWare, an innovative platform that expanded to support interactive video and discussion. CourseWare served as the foundation for initial flipped classroom experiments at Stanford and helped inspire the first massive open online courses (MOOCs) from Stanford that captured worldwide attention in 2011.
The Office of the Vice Provost for Online Learning was as established in August 2012, after Mitchell served as John L. Hennessy's — Stanford University's 10th President — special assistant for educational technology and chaired a faculty committee that established initial priorities for Stanford and developed intellectual property guidelines for publicly released online courses.
To help build faculty experience and a catalogue of online material, Vice Provost Mitchell launched a faculty seed grant program in Summer 2012.[9] This program has helped faculty across campus transform their Stanford campus courses and release public courses to the world, generating informed discussion and debate among faculty in the process.[10][11][12][13]
In addition to supporting delivery of digital course content, the VPTL engineering team is working to expand the features of Lagunita, Stanford's instance of the open-source release of the edX platform. Mitchell and his team, in partnership with edX, announced the release of Open edX[14] in June 2013: an open-source hosting platform, providing a customizable alternative for all colleges and universities and supporting open educational research and innovation.[15][16]
Stanford's online courses are generating a wealth of course participant data. In collaboration with Stanford centers of scholarship such as the Lytics Lab,[17][17] which is jointly supervised by Mitchell, and Mitchell Stevens and Candace Thille of the Graduate School of Education, VPTL is playing a key role in evaluating educational outcomes and improving online learning based on data-driven research and iterative design.
In May 2014, Mitchell's team issued a comprehensive report to share benchmark information with other institutions of higher education.
Mitchell holds a B.S. from Stanford University and a M.S. and Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He has served on the editorial board of ten academic journals, acted as consultant and advisor to numerous companies, and spent sabbaticals at the Newton Institute for Mathematical Science and Coverity, Inc. Mitchell is the author of two books, over 170 research papers, and is among the most-cited scholars in computer science.[18]
Research[edit]
Together with Gordon Plotkin he noted the connection between existential types and abstract data types.[19]
Mitchell's early computer science research focused on programming analysis and design, where he played a pivotal role in developing type theory as a foundation for programming languages, a view that is now dominant in the field. For the past 15 years, his research has focused on computer security, developing analysis methods and improving network protocol security, authorization and access control, web security, and privacy.
Mitchell has been at the forefront of Web and network security research and education for more than a decade and has helped train thousands of students in programming languages and hundreds of expert-level professionals in the area of cyber-security. His efforts have resulted in the development of concepts used in the popular Java programming language, improved the security of widely used wireless networking protocols, contributed to the security architecture of the Chrome browser and other components of the modern web.
In August 2012, Mitchell was appointed by Stanford President John L. Hennessy as the Vice Provost for Online Learning, a newly created position responsible for overseeing Stanford's online learning initiatives.

To help build faculty experience and a catalogue of online material, Vice Provost Mitchell launched a faculty seed grant program in Summer 2012.[9] This program has helped faculty across campus transform their Stanford campus courses and release public courses to the world, generating informed discussion and debate among faculty in the process.[10][11][12][13]
In addition to supporting delivery of digital course content, the VPTL engineering team is working to expand the features of Lagunita, Stanford's instance of the open-source release of the edX platform. Mitchell and his team, in partnership with edX, announced the release of Open edX[14] in June 2013: an open-source hosting platform, providing a customizable alternative for all colleges and universities and supporting open educational research and innovation.[15][16]
Stanford's online courses are generating a wealth of course participant data. In collaboration with Stanford centers of scholarship such as the Lytics Lab,[17][17] which is jointly supervised by Mitchell, and Mitchell Stevens and Candace Thille of the Graduate School of Education, VPTL is playing a key role in evaluating educational outcomes and improving online learning based on data-driven research and iterative design.
In May 2014, Mitchell's team issued a comprehensive report to share benchmark information with other institutions of higher education.
Mitchell holds a B.S. from Stanford University and a M.S. and Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He has served on the editorial board of ten academic journals, acted as consultant and advisor to numerous companies, and spent sabbaticals at the Newton Institute for Mathematical Science and Coverity, Inc. Mitchell is the author of two books, over 170 research papers, and is among the most-cited scholars in computer science.[18]
Research[edit]
Together with Gordon Plotkin he noted the connection between existential types and abstract data types.[19]
Mitchell's early computer science research focused on programming analysis and design, where he played a pivotal role in developing type theory as a foundation for programming languages, a view that is now dominant in the field. For the past 15 years, his research has focused on computer security, developing analysis methods and improving network protocol security, authorization and access control, web security, and privacy.
Mitchell has been at the forefront of Web and network security research and education for more than a decade and has helped train thousands of students in programming languages and hundreds of expert-level professionals in the area of cyber-security. His efforts have resulted in the development of concepts used in the popular Java programming language, improved the security of widely used wireless networking protocols, contributed to the security architecture of the Chrome browser and other components of the modern web.
In August 2012, Mitchell was appointed by Stanford President John L. Hennessy as the Vice Provost for Online Learning, a newly created position responsible for overseeing Stanford's online learning initiatives.

                           For undergraduate and beginning graduate students, this textbook explains and examines the central concepts used in modern
                              programming languages, such as functions, types, memory management, and control. The book is unique in its comprehensive presentation
                              and comparison of major object-oriented programming languages. Separate chapters examine the history of objects, Simula and
                              Smalltalk, and the prominent languages C++ and Java. The author presents foundational topics, such as lambda calculus and
                              denotational semantics, in an easy-to-read, informal style, focusing on the main insights provided by these theories. Advanced
                              topics include concurrency, concurrent object-oriented programming, program components, and inter-language interoperability.
                              A chapter on logic programming illustrates the importance of specialized programming methods for certain kinds of problems.
                              This book will give the reader a better understanding of the issues and tradeoffs that arise in programming language design,
                              and a better appreciation of the advantages and pitfalls of the programming languages they use

                           In recent years, IT application scenarios have evolved in very innovative ways. Highly distributed networks have now become
                              a common platform for large-scale distributed programming, high bandwidth communications are inexpensive and widespread, and
                              most of our work tools are equipped with processors enabling us to perform a multitude of tasks. In addition, mobile computing
                              (referring specifically to wireless devices and, more broadly, to dynamically configured systems) has made it possible to
                              exploit interaction in novel ways. To harness the flexibility and power of these rapidly evolving, interactive systems, there
                              is need of radically new foundational ideas and principles; there is need to develop the theoretical foundations required
                              to design these systems and to cope with the many complex issues involved in their construction; and there is need to develop
                              effective principles for building and analyzing such systems

                           Annotation The importance of visual data mining, as a strong sub-discipline of data mining, had already been recognized in
                              the beginning of the decade. In 2005 a panel of renowned individuals met to address the shortcomings and drawbacks of the
                              current state of visual information processing. The need for a systematic and methodological development of visual analytics
                              was detected. This book aims at addressing this need. Through a collection of 21 contributions selected from more than 46
                              submissions, it offers a systematic presentation of the state of the art in the field. The volume is structured in three parts
                              on theory and methodologies, techniques, and tools and applications

                                 logical and mathematical foundations, through all aspects of rough set theory and its applications, such as data mining, knowledge
                                 discovery, and intelligent information processing, to relations between rough sets and other approaches to uncertainty, vagueness,
                                 and incompleteness, such as fuzzy sets and theory of evidence. This book, which constitutes the ninth volume of the Transactions
                                 on Rough Sets series, providing evidence of the continuing growth of a number of research streams. It includes articles that
                                 are extensions of papers included in the first conference on Rough Sets and Intelligent Systems Paradigms. The 26 papers presented
                                 in this volume introduce a number of new advances in the foundations and applications of artificial intelligence, engineering,

                              It is with great pleasure that we welcome you all to the proceedings of the 2nd InternationalSymposiumonVisualComputing(ISVC2006)heldinLakeTahoe.
                                 Followinga successfulmeeting lastyear, wewitnesseda muchstrongerandmore productive event this year. ISVC o?ers a common umbrella
                                 for the four main areas of visual computing including vision, graphics, visualization, and virtual reality. Its goal is to
                                 provide a forum for researchers, scientists, engineers and practitionersthroughouttheworldtopresenttheirlatestresearch?ndings,
                                 ideas, developments and applications in the broader area of visual computing. This year, the program consisted of 13 oral
                                 sessions, one poster session, ten special tracks, and six keynote presentations. The response to the call for - pers was very
                                 strong. We received more than twice the papers received last year. Speci?cally, we received over 280 submissions for the main
                                 symposium from which we accepted 65 papers for oral presentation (23% acceptance) and 56 papers for poster presentation (20%
                                 acceptance). Special track papers were solicited separately through the Organizing and Program Committees of each track. A
                                 total of 57 papers were accepted for presentation in the special tracks. All papers were reviewed with an emphasis on potential
                                 to contribute to the state of the art in the?eld. Selection criteria included accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and
                                 signi?cance of results, and presentation quality. The review process was quite rigorous, involving two to three independent
                                 blind reviews followed by several days of discussion. During the discussion period we tried to correct anomalies and errors
                                 that might have existed in the initial reviews

The fresh and cool clean feeling it leaves you with is absolutly amazing.  Written by Ben W on December 05, 2016   Was this review helpful?  Yes / No    Be the first to provide feedback on this review.       Paul Mitchell hair gel has a nice fragrence plus it is not heavy feeling on my hair and keeps my hair in place for hours Written by stevek7 on August 21, 2016   Was this review helpful?  Yes / No    Be the first to provide feedback on this review.       I love this product. I've been using Paul Mitchell Sculpting Foam for years and I have no intention of using anything else. It makes my hair full without stiffness. Written by Ellen on June 24, 2014   Was this review helpful?  Yes / No    Be the first to provide feedback on this review.       I ordered the Platinum shampoo, the purple one!! hehe It is awesome! It helps my blond hair not to get orange... it's super affordable and really works. The delivery was on time and it arrived perfectly. Written by Fabiola Conti on April 08, 2014   Was this review helpful?  Yes / No    Be the first to provide feedback on this review.       Ordered the Fast Drying Sculpting Spray - a product that works great on my fine hair to help set soft curls without weighing down my hair. Had a hard time locating the product for a reasonable price in the larger size. FragranceNet not only carries the product, but also sells it for a very competitive price!

	    					Born Cyril Thomas Mitchell in 1936 to a hairdresser, Cyril followed his mother’s footsteps and enrolled in London’s Morris School of Hairdressing in 1952.  By 1954, at age 18, he had won many British and international hairdressing competitions and joined the Park Lane salon where his boss nicknamed him Paul. In 1960, Paul’s joined Vidal Sassoon and his career launched full throttle.    In 1971, he met John Paul DeJoria and shortly thereafter opened his salon on Manhattan’s Madison Avenue. It is here where the Paul Mitchell Cutting Club is born.   After selling his Salon in 1976 and moving to Hawaii he teamed up with Dejoria and for just $700 they started his revolutionary hair care system.Today, the Paul Mitchell line encompasses over 100 products including shampoos, conditioners, styling products and flat irons.   From their very own Awapuhi Farm to Tea Tree extracts, men’s products and products formulated for pets, Paul Mitchell offers something for all hair types and styles.
