BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.

1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:

Scott Boardman, CPCU, President-Hickock & Boardman





We have been working with MarshBerry for five years to help us hire new producers. I find your recruiting tactics very effective. You know how to pre-qualify candidates over the phone and determine if we should pursue them. This process saves us a lot of time and increases our success ratio. We hired six producers so far, two of which are almost validated, two of which are on course to validate, and two that washed out very quickly. We are very pleased with the results and with MarshBerry.

Bruce Basso, CEO-Worldwide Broker Network





The membership of the Worldwide Broker Network represents a spectrum of cultures, economies and insurance markets all in various stages of maturity and all with different service needs and abilities. MarshBerry has helped us bridge that gap and deliver to our membership valued-added learning, metrics and management to make their firms stronger and better equipped to meet the demands of global business. From the beginning, MarshBerry helped us in a process that went nearly exactly as you said it would. You provided guidance to our shareholders and employees, and collaboratively teamed with our legal counsel and accountants. The quality and quantity of your experience was evidenced at every turn, from interviewing potential merger partners to plowing through merger details, creating confidence with all parties involved. You have certainly earned my high praise and endorsement.We do appreciate everything that the MarshBerry team does to help us. I consider you all (thats Southern for the MarshBerry team) a very valuable resource that has been instrumental in turning this agency around. Thank you, Thank you Securities offered through MarshBerry Capital, Inc., Member FINRA and SIPC, and an affiliate of Marsh, Berry

David Kummer, CPCU, AIC, Chief Development Officer-SullivanCurtisMonroe





I can  t point to anything else that has been the catalyst for as much positive change as our relationship with MarshBerry and TASC. Over the past seven years, we have successfully navigated through tremendous change in every facet of our agency. The change has been inspired, led, motivated and held accountable by our relationship with MarshBerry and our participation in TASC. We owe them, and our peer group, a debt of gratitude for first illuminating, and then guiding us, on the path to best practices.

Bruce Denson, Chairman & CEO-CobbsAllen





CobbsAllen is a founding member of APPEX, which began in 1997. At that time, our revenues were $6.5 million. We adopted many of the disciplines espoused by MarshBerry. We also have been exposed to many agencies through our Strategic Issues Group meetings, which have helped the growth and profit of our agency. Since the initial year, our agency has grown to over $30 million in revenue and our profits have increased dramatically. All in all, it has been an awesome experience and I would highly recommend membership to any agency.
