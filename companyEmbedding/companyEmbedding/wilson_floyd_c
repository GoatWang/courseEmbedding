CEO Compensation

Complete Coverage | Complete Rankings



Methodology: 
	Compensation rank is based on total compensation for latest fiscal year. Total compensation for each chief executive includes the following: salary and bonuses; other compensation, such as vested restricted stock grants, LTIP payouts and perks; and stock gains, the value realized by exercising stock options. Efficiency rank is based on our chief executive's performance/pay score. Ranks are given only to chief executives who have a six-year tenure and six-year compensation history. The most efficient rank is 1 and least efficient is 196.

Footnotes: 
	Compensation data is from the latest available proxy statements filed through Mar. 25, 2011. Total returns and value of stock owned (including all classes) is based on Mar. 18, 2011 stock price. Compensation percent change is based on combined salary and bonus. Annualized total return during tenure covers the tenure of the executive or from the time of the IPO or available stock history. Relative to market is the ending value of $100 invested in the stock, divided by the ending value of $1 invested in the S & P 500 (a score of 100 = the S & P 500). NA: Not available or not applicable.  
1Annualized.
	2Four-year total.
	3Three-year total.
	4Less than 0.01%.
	5Prior-year data.
	6New chief executive; compensation may be for another executive office.
	7Less than $100,000.
	8Includes shares indirectly held.

Floyd Wilson aims to turn Halcón into a new Petrohawk – minus the gas








06/01/2012

AN INTERVIEW WITH FLOYD C. WILSON, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT, AND CEO OF HALCóN RESOURCES CORP.
Don Stowers, Editor – OGFJ
EDITOR'S NOTE: Floyd Wilson has not been idle. Last year he oversaw the sale of the tremendously successful Petrohawk Energy, a company he founded, to BHP Billiton for $15.1 billion. He has since recapitalized another company (RAM Energy), changed the name to Halcón Resources, and in April acquired still another company (GeoResources) for over $1 billion in cash and stock. OGFJ Editor Don Stowers recently caught up with Wilson for a short Q&A session.
OIL & GAS FINANCIAL JOURNAL: Why did you decide to go back into business right on the heels of the sale of Petrohawk? Didn't you need a little time for R&R?
FLOYD WILSON: The unconventional business here in the US is growing by leaps and bounds, so I felt there was a good opportunity to build a company similar to Petrohawk but start from scratch basically and build an oil company rather than a largely natural gas company [like Petrohawk]. Having been reasonably successful with this, I thought it would be a good idea to jump right back in and follow up on some ideas I had.
OGFJ: So why did you choose RAM Energy to recapitalize?
WILSON: Well, both RAM and GeoResources came to me, so it was a little different than me going out and looking. In the case of RAM, they had a mature production base, largely oil, low decline, good EBIDA production, non-risky, and access to one of the emerging oil plays in the US – not a shale, but the Mississippi Lime, which is a conventional reservoir being completed in unconventional ways, horizontal drilling, multi-stage fracing, and so on.
And with RAM, you had a company in which a majority of the shareholders were willing to look into the future and allow themselves to be recapitalized and, basically, taken over. So there were a number of attractive elements there – oil, a new play, and speed. With my experience and background, you might notice that speed seems to be important to me and my colleagues, and it is.
OGFJ: What do you see as the upside to the GeoResources acquisition? How is this a good fit for Halcón?
WILSON: On the surface, there were a number of similarities to RAM. There was a mature, solid, largely oil production base. This was a company that was in very good shape financially – very little debt – so this played a part in the decision process as well. GeoResources had taken a look at some of the things that had gone on with Petrohawk with respect to companies that we acquired and what had happened to their shareholders. They saw that the shareholders had been treated very well financially in those transactions, so they decided to talk to us about the possibility of a buyout. The company was attractive to us because it provided access to three really interesting plays: the Eagle Ford, down in Fayette County; the Bakken, which I had been looking at for years but never gotten into; and a large acreage position in the Austin Chalk. All these things combined made the company very interesting to me, and the fact that they were interested in a significant component of stock in the transaction was a major consideration.
OGFJ: If I heard correctly, pursuant to the sale of Petrohawk to BHP, you are prohibited from operating in the Eagle Ford until November of this year. Since the acquisition of GeoResources puts Halcón squarely in that play, what is the status of those assets and must they be divested?
WILSON: I'm not actually constrained from operating in the Eagle Ford, but under the non-compete agreement that we constructed, I'm not supposed to operate within 50 miles of a current BHP Billiton operation in existence at the time of the transaction. Since the GeoResources Eagle Ford assets are within that halo, I contacted BHP. They said to go ahead with the transaction but that we would have to divest the Eagle Ford assets, which I've agreed to do. Having said that, it's a great piece of property and a great location. It's oil. And whether it's a development project in-house or a divestiture project, it's worth a lot of money, and it's in the early stages. So by the time we get the deal closed, we'll have a few more wells drilled by ourselves and by a competitor. It'll bring top dollar, so I wasn't at all dismayed by the fact that BHP preferred that we stick strictly to our agreement. They paid a very fair price for Petrohawk, and they deserve to have us live up to our end of the bargain. We'll divest those properties shortly after closing the deal with GeoResources.








OGFJ: What is the origin of the company's name – Halcón Resources?
WILSON: Halcón is a Spanish word that means hawk or falcon. Most people say HAL-con, but with the accent mark over the "o" it's hal-CONE.
OGFJ: Rumor has it that Halcón has been acquiring a leasehold position in the emerging Tuscaloosa Marine Shale in Louisiana. Would you care to comment on this?
WILSON: There was a blog out there that mentioned that. We've been acquiring land in four announced areas. We added these areas with the GeoResources acquisition, and then we announced that we had been acquiring land in three undisclosed plays. And then we added a fourth on our recent [analyst] conference call. We've been leasing underneath the radar screen, so to speak, because that is very effective in keeping the costs down. We're leasing purely oil-biased reservoirs, and those are very attractive to nearly everyone these days. So we're just keeping quiet about those where we're building our position. Other than that, I'm not really in a position where I can discuss those plays. However, we will be talking about them later this year. We're well on the road toward our acreage target, and we are moving rigs in as we speak, so we'll have a lot to talk about in a couple of months.
OGFJ: Rice University recently released a report about projected oil production in the US and its impact on oil imports. It stated that currently only about 15% of our offshore areas are open to drilling and that the other 85% could add significantly to our reserves. Combine this with our unconventional reserves, and that's a lot of oil. Are you optimistic that the US is headed toward greater self-sufficiency in energy and that we'll be less reliant on oil imports from nations in politically unstable areas?
WILSON: I'm not a big macro economist or anything, but I'm highly confident that the US is headed toward a much higher degree of energy self-sufficiency. When the explosion of gas production from the shales started to hit the market in 2009 and 2010, our system of supply and demand got really out of whack. Supply outdistanced demand quickly, and gas prices fell dramatically. Oil is a little different. We're a significant user and importer of oil. However, I believe I read that we've recently become the largest producer of oil in the world on a daily basis. That's due largely to the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays. Over time, there's a huge opportunity for greater independence. It's hard to say what this will do to prices because oil is a global commodity and globally priced. Other countries will eventually see shale development as well, but right now they're so far behind in terms of infrastructure and technical expertise, it's going to be some time before that occurs. We have plenty of room for US production to increase dramatically over the next five or 10 years, which will be very good for the country. I'm not a politician either, but we seem to be taking very slow steps to take advantage of this explosion of natural gas onshore US. There is a huge opportunity for us to use more of this ample supply of natural gas for power generation, industrial consumption, and transportation.
OGFJ: Is the current low price for natural gas out of whack?
WILSON: It's the supply and demand that is out of whack. The price for natural gas is based on supply and demand, which is a fair enough way to price things. It's a tremendous opportunity for the United States to have all this gas. Also, with the increased production of natural gas liquids and crude from these shales, we're going to see a resurgence of the petrochemical business here in the US due to two things: 1) the feedstock of natural gas is so inexpensive, and 2) all the NGLs being produced also play a part in this. There doesn't seem to be a downside to what is going on.
OGFJ: Unless you're in the coal business.
WILSON: [Laughs] Well, as far as power generation is concerned, natural gas is the only good bridge fuel to other sources of electricity that are not that commercial right now. Low gas prices have put a damper on the outlook for some of these solar and wind projects that require so much development capital and, sometimes, subsidies.
Back to crude though, there is a really solid chance we can achieve or move toward energy independence because of these unconventional reservoirs and conventional reservoirs that are being dealt with in an unconventional manner. That is, through horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. So our target at Halcón is strictly those kinds of formations. In just a few short months, we've acquired hundreds of thousands of acres all geared toward oil and liquids production. It's been not as expensive as you might think even though everyone is interested in those kinds of things. They're still very front-end loaded in terms of technology and geoscience. You have to figure out all these things in advance and then get in there and compete with peers who have the same idea. So it's not an easy business, but we've been able to amass quite a bit of acreage in just a couple of months.
OGFJ: Currently I believe that roughly 65% of your production is in Texas, 25% in Oklahoma, and about 10% in Louisiana. Do you expect these proportions to remain about the same in the next year, and what projects will account for most of your production growth in the next 12 to 24 months?
WILSON: If you'll allow me to think about GeoResources in a pro-forma way, the basic production mix doesn't change that much when you add them to Halcón's current basics except that they've got a couple of thousand barrels per day up in the Rockies. We've recently acquired acreage up in Pennsylvania and Ohio in the Utica-Point Pleasant shale play and are moving a rig in almost as we speak. So this is clearly in a different area for us. We intend to grow the Bakken component that Geo is going to provide us as a starter kit, and that is also in a different area than Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. We'll also see growth in the Mississippi Lime (Oklahoma), the Woodbine (East Texas), and the Wilcox (Central Louisiana), but we're very excited about what's going on in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The Utica is an oily play.
OGFJ: I saw a map somewhere that indicated that the western portion of the Utica in Ohio is the oily area of that play. Is that correct?
WILSON: Well, we've spent a lot of time and money trying to figure that out. I suspect that statement is not quite right. [Laughs] These plays have a tendency to have a dry gas window, a volatile condensate window, then a black oil window, and an area where the oil is immature. The Eagle Ford is that way, and it seems as if the Utica-Point Pleasant is the same way. It's too general to say that the western portion is the oily part. But in any one single area, the western-most part of that specific area is the oilier part, if that makes sense.
OGFJ: Thanks for setting me straight on that. I know you need to go, but I have one final question: Earlier this year, you completed a $400 million equity offering. How will you use the proceeds from that offering and how is the capital being allocated?
WILSON: To keep it in context, we brought $550 million into RAM and then changed the name to Halcón. We added $400 million to that, so in round numbers we have about $1 billion of capital available to us. We paid off a few credit lines, but we established new credit lines, so in terms of liquidity today, we have about $900 million available to us. We will use that money strictly to buy land in the oily shale and conventional plays that we've announced and in ones that we haven't identified yet, and of course some drilling. We have a fairly strong drilling program this year for a company that's only been around a couple of months. I think we're spending well over $300 million this year drilling. So we have quite an appetite for capital.
OGFJ: Would you ever consider forming a joint venture with another company to develop acreage to reduce land and drilling costs?
WILSON: This may be a good strategy for companies that want to pursue that, but we don't. My view is more old school. If someone wants to do a JV with us, they can JV the whole company. We pursue early-stage development projects with decades and decades of drilling ahead of them, and I don't like selling off chunks of that. I'd rather raise money in some other way, and we've always been able to do that. At the end of the day, the value that's created through a transaction such as the one we did at Petrohawk is much more lucrative for the shareholders than the fleeting value created by a JV, which generally is driven by a balance sheet in trouble in terms of liquidity.
OGFJ: Thanks very much for your time.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
