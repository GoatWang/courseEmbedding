Taseko Mines: New Prosperity Remains A Long Shot - Taseko Mines Limited (NYSEMKT:TGB) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Taseko Mines: New Prosperity Remains A Long ShotJul.27.17 | About: Taseko Mines (TGB) Elephant Analytics Long/short equityMarketplaceDistressed Value InvestingSummaryTaseko has received approval for exploratory work at New Prosperity under the outgoing BC government.The new BC government is likely to be less favorable to New Prosperity though, and it still faces challenges at the federal level.Higher copper prices are benefiting Taseko, although 50% offset by the stronger Canadian dollar.Taseko appears to be worth around 1.40 USD to 1.60 USD at current copper prices.Taseko Mines (TGB) recently received approval for exploratory work at New Prosperity. However, I believe that approval of New Prosperity as a producing mine will likely only happen with a court order. As a result, the value of New Prosperity should be still mostly discounted when looking at Taseko. Taseko's stock is now also benefiting from higher copper prices and the removal of the refinancing uncertainty, although it is also somewhat hurt by a stronger Canadian dollar. New Prosperity Remains A Question Mark Although Taseko has received provincial approval to do exploration work at New Prosperity, I do not believe that its chances of becoming a mine have improved. The provincial approval was granted by the outgoing government, and the new government is a left-wing NDP/Green Party coalition that seems unlikely to support further development at New Prosperity. As well, New Prosperity previously failed to get federal approval under a Conservative government, and thus seems challenged to receive federal approval under the current Liberal government despite some changes to New Prosperity's plan. Taseko is also trying to get New Prosperity approved through the courts. While I am not qualified to judge the chances of success through that route, the chances of government approval seem near zero, so a court order is probably Taseko's best chance for New Prosperity. Copper Prices And Exchange Rates Copper prices have recently improved significantly as supply continues to be disrupted by strikes and China's economy has been doing better than expected. As well, reports indicate that China may ban imports of copper scrap metal by the end of 2018, which would lead to increased demand for refined copper imports. This has pushed copper up to around 2.87 USD per pound, the highest it has been since early 2015.
 The effect of higher copper prices on Taseko is significantly offset (around 50% offset during the last month) by a stronger Canadian dollar though. Positive Canadian economic news and a rate hike have contributed to the value of the Canadian dollar increasing by close to 10% versus the US dollar over the last several months. As a result, the price of copper in Canadian dollars remains fairly similar to where it has been since late 2016, a contrast to the large movement of copper prices in US dollars. 

 Source: InfoMine It appears that Taseko can make around 0.95 USD per pound in gross margins using Gibraltar's mine average copper grade and the current USD/CAD exchange rate. This translates into approximately 85 million USD in EBITDA with 135 million pounds of annual copper production (100% share). Conclusion Taseko's situation has improved noticeably over the past few months with its successful debt refinancing and now higher copper prices. Taseko's share price is largely correlated to copper prices and it appears that it is now worth approximately 1.40 USD to 1.60 USD per share, assuming that current copper prices (around 2.87 USD per pound) hold. Taseko's share price in US dollars has benefited more than its share price in Canadian dollars (traded on the TSE) due to the weakening of the US dollar versus the Canadian dollar. Despite the positive news for Taseko of receiving exploration work approval at New Prosperity, I think that it is still unlikely that it receives full approval. New Prosperity has failed to gain approval before and now both the federal and provincial governments are to the left of the former governments.

The company has seen one positive estimate revision in the past 30 days, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate moved higher over the same timeframe. So make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.

Reserves: 2.4 billion pounds of copper and 69 million pounds of molybdenum[2]

1.86 billion lb copper produced 1973-1998

Timeline:

1973 - Placer Development opens mine
1996 - Mine sold to Westmin Resources
1998 - Mine closed
July 1999 - Taseko purchases Gibraltar from Boliden
October 2004 - Mine reopens under Taseko
2006 - Taseko takes over operations at Gibraltar
May 2006 - Phase I expansion of Gibraltar announced. Concentrator capacity increases from 36,750 to 46,000 tpd at a cost of 76 million
May 2007 - Phase II expansion of Gibraltar announced. Concentrator capacity will increase from 46,000 to 55,000 tpd at a cost of 40 million
May 13, 2008 - Phase III expansion of Gibraltar. An additional concentrator will be constructed with an additional output of 30,000 tpd. Which management believes will yield 180 million lb copper per year

Prosperity Mine[edit]
Property includes 85 square km in south central British Columbia. A large copper and gold mineralization has been defined on the property containing around 5.3 billion lb copper and 13.3 million oz of gold. The feasibility for the mine was completed on September 25, 2007 and the environmental review process began in July 2008.
Operations: Large open-pit copper and gold mine with projected production of 108 million lb per year and 247,000 oz of gold per year for 20 years.
Reserves[edit]
Cost: ~800 million[clarification needed]
In 2009, proven reserves for the mine were 481 million tonnes 0.46 gram per tonne of gold and 0.26 per cent copper. Probable reserves were estimated at 350 million tonnes grading 0.35 gram per tonne of gold and 0.18 per cent of copper (based on a $5.50 net smelter return cut-off).[3]
Timeline[edit]

1991 - acquired by Taseko Mines
Sep 25, 2007 - feasibility study completed for 70,000 tonnes per day with 20 year mine life
July 2008 - Environmental assessment begins
November 2010 - initial open-pit proposal rejected by Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency review board. Environment Minister Jim Prentice and the minority Tory government support the rejection.[4]
November 2011 - Taseko President Russell Hallbauer sends a letter to Environment Minister Peter Kent suggesting that the proposal was rejected for "spiritual" rather than environmental reasons.[5]
2014 - Second rejection of mine by Harper government for environmental reasons
January 2017 - Attempted revival of dead project that has no support from local First Nation

Harmony Mine[edit]
The Harmony property is located on Graham Island, the largest island of the Haida Gwaii archipelago, within the Queen Charlotte Islands, off the coast of British Columbia. The property contains a low-grade gold mineralization that can only be mined profitably at historically high gold prices. Teseko has yet to explore this property and values the property at $1 on its balance sheet as of September 2004.[6]
Status: Exploration asset
Reserves:

latest engineering study indicated 64 million tonnes at 1.52 grams per tonne. In place resources are ~3 million oz of gold.

Cost: No projects pending

The Aley asset contains Niobium, a rare metal used in the production of special steel alloys that are corrosion resistant. Currently only 2 mines in the world produce the rare metal.[7] The spot price of this metal has risen significantly in the last 5 years, from has low as $6.70 per lb in 2004 to ~$24.00 currently [1]. The property is located near the shore of the lake, about 30 kilometers from the Camp. The price of

Prosperity Mine[edit]
Property includes 85 square km in south central British Columbia. A large copper and gold mineralization has been defined on the property containing around 5.3 billion lb copper and 13.3 million oz of gold. The feasibility for the mine was completed on September 25, 2007 and the environmental review process began in July 2008.
Operations: Large open-pit copper and gold mine with projected production of 108 million lb per year and 247,000 oz of gold per year for 20 years.
Reserves[edit]
Cost: ~800 million[clarification needed]
In 2009, proven reserves for the mine were 481 million tonnes 0.46 gram per tonne of gold and 0.26 per cent copper. Probable reserves were estimated at 350 million tonnes grading 0.35 gram per tonne of gold and 0.18 per cent of copper (based on a $5.50 net smelter return cut-off).[3]

Prosperity Mine[edit]
Property includes 85 square km in south central British Columbia. A large copper and gold mineralization has been defined on the property containing around 5.3 billion lb copper and 13.3 million oz of gold. The feasibility for the mine was completed on September 25, 2007 and the environmental review process began in July 2008.
Operations: Large open-pit copper and gold mine with projected production of 108 million lb per year and 247,000 oz of gold per year for 20 years.
Reserves[edit]
Cost: ~800 million[clarification needed]
In 2009, proven reserves for the mine were 481 million tonnes 0.46 gram per tonne of gold and 0.26 per cent copper. Probable reserves were estimated at 350 million tonnes grading 0.35 gram per tonne of gold and 0.18 per cent of copper (based on a $5.50 net smelter return cut-off).[3]
Timeline[edit]

1991 - acquired by Taseko Mines
Sep 25, 2007 - feasibility study completed for 70,000 tonnes per day with 20 year mine life
July 2008 - Environmental assessment begins
November 2010 - initial open-pit proposal rejected by Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency review board. Environment Minister Jim Prentice and the minority Tory government support the rejection.[4]
November 2011 - Taseko President Russell Hallbauer sends a letter to Environment Minister Peter Kent suggesting that the proposal was rejected for "spiritual" rather than environmental reasons.[5]
2014 - Second rejection of mine by Harper government for environmental reasons

Harmony Mine[edit]
The Harmony property is located on Graham Island, the largest island of the Haida Gwaii archipelago, within the Queen Charlotte Islands, off the coast of British Columbia. The property contains a low-grade gold mineralization that can only be mined profitably at historically high gold prices. Teseko has yet to explore this property and values the property at $1 on its balance sheet as of September 2004.[6]
Status: Exploration asset
Reserves:

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Cu acting great anything between 2.60 and 2.70 if OK. Any trading below 2.60 may signal another test of support .2.48-49  which is danger zone with straight drop down . The flash crash of futures always makes for nervous time. Silver traded 25M oz in 1 min  with down 10% for day. TGB overhead resistance is within sight so if Cu stays above 2.60 and TGB gets close to 2.34 then any good news should make shorts run and any close above 2.37 will trigger stop .  Wishful thinking but can happenReply10SSteveThis BS manipulation last seconds is killing TGB chances to make a good move at announcement of earnings. If TGB price is not within striking range of overhead resistance area 1.34-37 then speculators likely will not take risk . Shame likely good earnings report and if Cu stays in profit range more confidence for next quarter to continue profits. With less Vol this stock can easily be manipulated , not much can be done to change that. The stock greatly benefited from a computer vol surge so  it goes both ways I guessReply10SStevecorrection- Goldman set 3 month target for Cu at $6,200 mT or $2.81 pound.  They remain bullish !!Reply20SSteveGoldman Sachs explained decline in Cu last month due to cu scap collectors cashing in on higher prices and this caused an increase in supply which drove Cu down. But they are stinking with UP price for Cu above 6, 000 metric ton .  Today closed at 5,966 metric ton .  If Cu breaks clear over 6K will get attention and lay foundation for stronger 3rd quarter for TGB . TGB above 50 and 200 day moving ave.  Shorts beware another 3 M computer buy could happen any day Cu surges.Reply00rrolf2017 June 30 Close reflects:  TGB is in a good position and will be acknowledged in the market when the second quarter performance is announced.  Copper’s Bullish Move - Resurgence in COMEX Copper for September 2017:  Rally topped at $2.71 around 10:07 AM Thursday June 29, 2017 +3 for the morning - from $2.55.9 on May 30, 2017.  The key is for this price to hold.  Copper closed at $2.71 on June 30, 2017.  So, the price is holding.  So right now we are well beyond the $2.66 support level and we may see $2.75 as the next target level as the resistance level rises due to increasing shortages on the supply side globally.  Unrest in some countries increases the likelihood of a continued shortage of supply from those countries.  TGB is insulated from unrest situations by its favorable employment contracts and its mining locations in Canada and the US.  Concurrently, it is working to add its silent pipeline sites to its production processes.  When those major announcements are made, analysts and market makers will speak well and loudly and the market will react positively.  When we see $2.75 Copper hold and become support, then we could see copper around $2.80 in the fourth quarter of 2017 as rising demand is not met.  The Chinese infrastructure demand for copper seems to remain high because most old buildings’ wiring needs to be replaced by copper wire.   This Chinese need alone appears to support an upside demand for copper at this time when supply is short.  The pent-up global non-Chinese demand would exacerbate the supply problem and raise prices. As global copper rises, TGB share price will rise.Copper moves inverse to the Dollar and the dollar is settling versus strong currencies. This may have a positive effect on copper. TGB:   Closed June 30, 2017 at $1.27 on low volume of 353,024. TGB has rallied and recovered from the February run-up to $1.63 on February 13, 2017 against the October 17, 2016 low of $0.41.  It is above its consolidation mid-range and rising. The high volatility and price fluctuations are reflective of the 2.9 to 3.10 Beta signaling greater risk for a higher gain on the swing peaks of the market price.   We are here because we believe in TGB and its inherent value and that management will convert that greater risk perception to a higher gain because the value is present. Granted that the $1.63 may have been an anomaly when copper spiked to $2.80. Yet is a precursor of the correlation between the market prices of copper and TGB. Evidence of the correlation is the rise of TGB to $1.28 when copper at $2.71. Sentiment is now favorable for both TGB and copper.  Recall that the low TGB stock price offers great potential for shareholder appreciation when compared to the majority of US stocks riding high after the recent run-up.  Their share prices are overbought and the percentage of probable increase in value is low when compared to the percentage of probable increase in value of TGB. It appears that those selling TGB now will regret the decision if and when my forecast and analysis is supported by actual market price rises.MoreReplyReplies (1)00SSteveWith low vol and Friday , TGB direction is up to manipulators. But Cu is acting great in up trend and TGB ending 2 quarter with every month in profitable Cu range. Shorts have to be nervous with likely testing 1.34-37 resistance and breakout to test yearly high.  Nice for a computer vol trigger of buying feeding off sell orders .  One thing  is certain  TGB always needed Vol to move up beyond the .01 trading all day until the last min.  When TGB trades 1m and is UP , setting up for a run.  Day traders LOVE low prices stocks that with vol can MOVEReply00SSteveTypical Friday with last seconds move up. What is important is Cu still in up trend. Cu started quarter April 2.65  May 2.66 June 2.58  and July will start at over 2.70 which can't make shorts feel good.  in 3 weeks TGB announce another profitable quarter beating .02 per share * likely at last min will be raised to .04 , but TGB still making profit should produce good move if Cu stays in 2.70 range .Reply10SSteveHave until late July to move TGB up to 1.32-34 price range.  2nd Quarter announcement likely July 20-26th and will beat last year's $3.2 million loss and beat est .02 share . But if TGB price is not closer to resistance area , not likely to have much follow thru up .  Only hope for positive move with good news is Cu stays in profit range and TGB price at announcement is close to test high resistance, other wise wasted opportunity.Reply50rrolfBelow is a link to a Mid-Year Review of Copper dated June 14, 2017.  It appears to be a discussion of probabilities and possibilities simply laid out.  It seems to support my view of TGB potential long-term.  TGB has projects in the pipeline targeted for maturity around the time frames discussed when demand is projected to increase and supply projected to decrease.  Today HG=F shows Copper up 2 at $2.59 and holding its own.  While the debt payoff was expensive, it wisely positions TGB to easily carry itself through to the date of higher copper demand and declining supply.  TGB will be prepared to respond to the demand as the global price of copper rises.  TGB share value is understated at $1.19 today as the potential of the company remains silent to many. TGB is a secret and it is interesting to me that TGB is not mentioned in the nine discussions in this article.   http://marketrealist.com/2017/06/can-copper-reach-6000-per-metric-ton-in-2017/MoreCan Copper Reach $6,000 per Metric Ton in 2017? - Market RealistWhile most metals tend to follow underlying demand-supply dynamics, according to some, copper prices also tend to reflect macro developments.marketrealist.comReplyReplies (1)30Show MoreThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderSolar Eclipse 2017: Stay in the Tualatin ValleyThe Tualatin ValleySponsoredTrump names John F.

Taseko Monetizes By-Product Silver Stream For US$33 Million









PR Newswire




Feb 27, 2017 6:00 AM EST













 


















































  VANCOUVER, Feb. 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Taseko Mines Limited (TSX: TKO; NYSE MKT: TGB) ("Taseko" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has entered into a US$33 million streaming agreement with Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd ("Osisko") for Taseko's 75% share of payable silver production from the Gibraltar Mine.  Russell Hallbauer, President and CEO of Taseko, stated, "Management is continually searching for accretive initiatives to allow the Company to advance its business strategy, while ensuring shareholder's interests are held paramount. Selling this silver stream, which is an unappreciated aspect of our business, was not an obvious source of capital, but turned out to be a very attractive source. With the proceeds from this transaction added to our year end cash balance we have approximately $130 million in available liquidity.  The expected cash generation from Gibraltar will further strengthen our balance sheet this year, providing us with a number of options regarding our debt obligations and project advancement." "While we believe the higher copper prices combined with our strong operational performance will generate significant cash flow in the months ahead, monetizing Gibraltar's modest silver production for C$43 million is a prudent decision for the Company. Silver sales represent approximately 1% of Gibraltar's total revenue and the sale of this small by-product will not materially impact the mine's overall cost structure. Offsetting the impact from the reduced silver revenue is the strong operating performance of our molybdenum plant as well as higher molybdenum prices." "We are very happy to partner with Osisko on this transaction. In less than three years, they have become a world-class precious metal royalty and streaming company, already holding more than 50 royalties. Osisko's investment in Gibraltar's silver stream further endorses our high quality copper mine," concluded Mr. Hallbauer. "The Gibraltar silver stream is Osisko's first streaming transaction," commented Sean Roosen, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Osisko. "Taseko's management team has a history of success, and we are pleased to partner with them as they build a strong platform within the copper sector."  Transaction Details In exchange for an upfront deposit of US$33 million, Taseko will deliver 100% of its share of Gibraltar payable silver production until 5.9 million ounces have been delivered, which is approximately equivalent to Taseko's share of the silver in the current proven and probable reserves. After that threshold has been met, 35% of Taseko's share of all future silver production will be delivered to Osisko. Osisko will pay US$2.75 per ounce for all the silver deliveries made under the contract. Additionally, Osisko will be granted warrants for three million common shares of Taseko with a strike price to be set at a 50% premium to the 10-day VWAP prior to closing. The warrants will expire on April 1, 2020. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in early March 2017 and is subject to the completion of customary conditions.  Russell Hallbauer President and CEO No regulatory authority has approved or disapproved of the information contained in this news release.

                                        Community                                        
Our Commitment to the Community 
At Taseko, we understand the shared value that mining brings. Our employees, the people living within the communities in which we operate, the Provincial and Federal Governments, and finally the Company all benefit from mining. Taseko’s investment in Gibraltar, as well as other potential projects, ensures this shared value continues.
 
Local Jobs, Local Suppliers 
Taseko is committed to providing local jobs and supplier opportunities within the communities in which we operate.
Currently Taseko employs approximately 650 employees. Roughly 93% of Taseko’s wages are paid to those living in Williams Lake, Quesnel, and 100 Mile House, which equates to about $63 million in annual wages.
These high paying, local jobs provide long-term benefits to the Cariboo-Chilcotin, which include (but are not limited to):
Increased local spending, in forms of residential and consumer goods
Increased residential property values
Maintaining population strength
Social program benefits; school, road, hospital upgradesIn addition, based on 12 months ending December 31st 2015, Taseko-Gibraltar spent over $277 million on supplier goods and services. Approximately $92.5 million (38%) was purchased from suppliers and contractors in the BC Interior and Cariboo regions. This spend provides increased economic activity to the Cariboo region. Examples of purchases include:




light vehicle fleet
automotive parts
fuel and greases
propane
tires
pumps and pipes
steel




power transmission parts
safety supplies
catering services
office supplies
mill processing equipment
freight
bus transportation




 
Community Sponsorship 
Not only is Taseko dedicated to giving back to our communities, so are our employees.United Way CampaignSince 2008, Gibraltar and Taseko employees and the Company have donated $660,000 to our Annual United Way Campaign, an employee based program that was implemented as a way to give back to the communities that they call home.Joseph & Rosalie Segal Family Health Centre  In July 2013, Taseko made a $1.5 million commitment to the building of a new Mental Health Facility at Vancouver General Hospital, the largest corporate contribution to mental health in the drive to make the Joseph & Rosalie Segal Family Health Centre a reality.  The funding, to be provided over the course of three years, will aid VGH in building a new state-of-the-art facility, which will provide a therapeutic and healing environment for patients from across the province.  The current facility is 70 years old, worn out, and in desperate need of replacement. “Taseko’s operations are exclusively British Columbia based.  We have over 700 people and their families living in the province, primarily in Williams Lake and the Cariboo region; and although this new facility will exist in Vancouver, it will be available to improve the lives of British Columbians, regardless of where they live.  That is important to us. We are proud to make this contribution to mental health care and recovery on behalf of our employees and shareholders,” says Taseko’s President and CEO Russell Hallbauer.Other InitiativesCombined, the list of donations to charitable and community support groups provided by Gibraltar Mine and Taseko totals $1.3 million Some of the sponsorship and donation programs include:South Cariboo Garlic Festival 2012 SponsorCariboo Challenge Sled Dog Race 2013 Platinum SponsorSouth Cariboo Rodeo Association SponsorBC Children’s Hospital and Ronald McDonald House SupporterWilliams Lake Minor HockeyBoys & Girls Club of Williams LakeKids Running for KidsWilliams Lake Seniors Village SeptemberCentral Cariboo Search & Rescue4H ClubCentral BC Aboriginal Youth HockeyWilliams Lake Studio TheatreQuesnel Rodeo ClubWilliams Lake Dry Grad

                                        Harmony                                        

Harmony is a gold project located on Graham Island off British Columbia's west coast. With deposit estimated of 64 million tonnes of 1.35g/t gold and possible additional mineral resources, it represents a significant component of Taseko's long-term growth strategy. 

Taseko also owns the Harmony gold project, located on the west coast of BC. This project provides a longer-term opportunity for additional development.

The Harmony site covers approximately 177 square kilometers and consists of 58 mineral claims.
 

Project History 

Taseko acquired the project from Misty Mountain Gold Ltd in 2001. Misty Mountain and others had carried out extensive exploration and engineering studies on the project prior to that time.
 

Measured and Indicated Resources 

Measured and indicated resources of 64 million tonnes grading 1.35 g/t gold were outlined at a 0.60 g/t cut-off. There are also additional inferred mineral resources.¹

¹Estimated by M. Nowak, P.Eng., in 1997 and classified by Nowak et al in 2001.
 

Current Status 

Detailed engineering studies are required to fully assess the project's potential. As such, it represents a longer term development opportunity for the Company.

Taseko Mines Ltd.





 Rob Rotzinger of Taseko Mines Ltd.

Power Smart helps bring 'stirred mill' technology to B.C.
In an industry where the energy-intensive activity of breaking rocks is a key part of the production process, a new technology promises to stir things up by cutting energy, improving quality, and reducing costs.
It's called "stirred mill" technology, recently implemented by Taseko Mines Limited in the regrind circuit at its Gibraltar Mine in south central B.C. (For its conservation efforts, Taseko has been selected as a Power Smart Excellence Awards finalist.)
An energy-efficient grind
Stirred mills have been shown to use as little as two-thirds of the energy of conventional grinding equipment.
The difference lies in the way that the stirred mill agitates the grinding media (steel balls) and rock to reduce the size of the rock particles.
Conventional "ball mills" rotate the mill body, a horizontal cylinder, tumbling the rock with steel balls that break up the rock.
In stirred mills, the mill body is stationary. The steel balls and rock are agitated by an internal auger that causes the contents to circulate, reducing the size of the rock particles.
Stirred mill technology was developed in Australia and has been in use for a number of years, but had not been adopted in B.C.
"It's a commercially available technology that has no market penetration in B.C.," says Markus Zeller, an industrial technology innovation manager with BC Hydro.
How Power Smart helped
That meant that the installation of the stirred mill at Gibraltar qualified for support under Power Smart's Conservation Technology Innovation program.  The program also supports near-commercial technologies that are developed in B.C.
The program provided technical support and engineering analysis to quantify the energy savings of the installation.
"With the technology now being used in B.C., we can get better insights into its performance," says Zeller. "For any mine that's expanding or being built new, we can now offer this as a proven energy-efficient technology, where we have a little more knowledge of how it behaves and how it works.
"It lets us validate the energy savings, so we can transfer that knowledge to other sites, or other applications."
Annual savings? $325,000
It's estimated that the stirred grinding mill at Gibraltar will save 4 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity annually. At the Tier 2 rate for BC Hydro's transmission customers, that's a savings of $325,000 per year for the mine.
The total provincial potential for energy savings through the use of stirred mills in regrinding (a second stage grinding circuit where minerals collected in the first stages of the process are further reduced in size to allow physical separation into final product) is 18 to 24 GWh per year.
A better product, too
The energy saving potential is impressive, but it is not the only reasons to shift to stirred mill technology.
"You get a more consistent product out of a stirred mill than a ball mill," says Zeller. "Further, the stirred mill has the potential to achieve finer grind sizes than a conventional ball mill which can offer downstream benefits to separate out the copper or whatever else you're looking for. The stirred mill also requires less floor space and is simple to install and maintain."
"It's almost a no-brainer," he adds. "If a mine is expanding, this technology requires low additional capital, provides annual savings, and gives a better grind."
Capturing all those benefits is important in ensuring the future competitiveness of the B.C. mining industry says BC Hydro industrial marketing manager Steve Quon.
Mining is B.C.'s second largest industrial consumer of electricity after the pulp and paper industry, using 15-17% of all purchased industrial electricity.
"Efficiency innovation is critical in the mining sector because the products that we produce are cyclical in nature," says Quon. "The market prices will go up and down, but if you have energy efficient processes you're able to weather the ups and downs a lot more capably than your competitors."
