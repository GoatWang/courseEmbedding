                                         out of Akron, Ohio. Year-to-date the no-load fund is up 32.5 percent, versus the S & P 500's return of 20.2 percent. And better yet, over the last five years, the fund is up an annualized 28.7 percent compared to the S & P 500's 22.9 percent. The fund is concentrated, holding just 23 names.  White Oak has a turnover rate of just 6 percent and requires a minimum investment of $2,000. Oelschlager says he starts from a top-down perspective, identifying the broad areas of the economy he feels are most attractive. These days it's Technology, Finanical Services and Health Care, as represented by the pharmaceutical companies. "We're certainly not a closet-indexer!" "We think we're in a continued environment of low inflation and low interest rates and huge technology gains that are leading to productivity gains that are putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates," says Oelschlager, who is quick to point out that "in the technology area you have unique products and pricing ability." He says it's key to find companies that are growing well and where the valuations are reasonable. He laughs when you ask him what constitutes a "reasonable valuation."  "Unfortunately, there's no magic formula that will give you the answer. You have to take a lot of factors into consideration. The obvious are the growth rate and the multiple, but then you have to tweak it a little bit based on what you think the company is going to trade for. [Some companies] sell at a premium multiple, and with other companies, they're always selling at a bit of a discount." Okay, then, so is there a checklist he runs down when he looks for companies to buy? "No, this is more of an art form than a science. We don't have any formulas or black boxes. We think it's a common sense business. And we don't have any Nobel Laureates in our firm either. If anybody gets nominated, they're fired!"

                                         , for instance, which came under a lot of pressure with the slowdown in the building of fabricating plants for the semiconductor business. But Oelschlager says the chip market is starting to pick up. "Applied Materials is an example of a stock that just got trashed about a year ago in last year's fourth quarter. They cut the stock in half in the fourth quarter and they gave us a chance to add to the stock, and we're still in it." He says AMAT's numbers "are starting to come in better?and they're just starting to come out of the contraction." "Compaq has been very strong in the PC market and they've recently had a lot of competition from Dell (DELL)

                                         ," he notes, "And Compaq's market share in the latest set of data I saw seems to be picking up, so the momentum seems to be moving in Compaq's favor after getting beaten up a little bit by Dell." Oelschlager also is very strong on Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "They took the stock, I think, from about 96 down to about 37, which is a pretty significant correction. Yes, they lost some money overseas and yes, they had some trading losses, but it's not the end of the world and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is going to be a major force going forward."  And a third favorite is BankAmerica, which came under heavy selling pressure after announcing big losses related to the bank's investment in a hedge fund. "So they took the stock out and shot it," he says, "The loss was huge, and hard to understand from a bank, but we think it's probably been overdone in the marketplace." He says BankAmerica is going to be "a huge force" as consolidation continues among the banks. Oelschalger thinks '99 will be another good year for the market because technology will continue to drive productivity gains that will, in his view, continue to drive interest rates down. A year ago he was looking for the 30-year Treasury bond to trade at 5 percent "and people thought I was nuts." He thinks '99 will see the long bond go to 4.5 percent, which will cause "good multiple expansion and probably a surprisingly good stock market." "But be careful," he says with his tongue firmly in his cheek, "I'm always an optimist."

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.              
              
            

3:47 p.m. July 28, 2017






Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.
