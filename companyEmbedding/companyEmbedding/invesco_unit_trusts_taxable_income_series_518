REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




To the Unitholders of Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 446:



We have audited the accompanying statement of condition (including the
analysis of net assets and the related portfolio schedule) of High Income
Investment Grade Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust," included in Invesco Unit Trusts,
Taxable Income Series 446) as of March 31, 2016, and the related statements of
operations and changes in net assets for the period from April 23, 2013 (date
of deposit) through March 31, 2014 and for each of the two years in the period
ended March 31, 2016, and the financial highlights for the period from April
23, 2013 (date of deposit) through March 31, 2014 and for each of the two years
in the period ended March 31, 2016. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based
on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust's internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned at March 31, 2016 by correspondence with The Bank of New York
Mellon, Trustee. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
High Income Investment Grade Trust, Series 1 (included in Invesco Unit Trusts,
Taxable Income Series 446) as of March 31, 2016, and the results of its
operations and changes in net assets for the period from April 23, 2013 (date
of deposit) through March 31, 2014 and for each of the two years in the period
ended March 31, 2016, and the financial highlights for the period from April
23, 2013 (date of deposit) through March 31, 2014 and for each of the two years
in the period ended March 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

INVESCO UNIT TRUSTS, TAXABLE INCOME SERIES 446





Notes to Financial Statements

March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016





NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Security Valuation - The securities are stated at the value determined by the
Evaluator, a third party valuation provider. The Evaluator may determine the
value of the securities (1) on the basis of current bid prices of the securities
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in securities comparable
to those held by the Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices for comparable
securities, (3) by determining the value of the securities by appraisal or (4)
by any combination of the above.


Security Cost - The original cost to the Trust (High Income Investment Grade
Trust, Series 1) was based on the determination by the Evaluator of the offering
prices of the securities on the date of deposit (April 23, 2013). Since the
valuation is based upon the bid prices, the Trust (High Income Investment Grade
Trust, Series 1) recognized a downward adjustment of $33,688 on the date of
deposit resulting from the difference between the bid and offering prices. This
downward adjustment was included in the aggregate amount of unrealized
depreciation reported in the financial statements for the Trust for the period
ended March 31, 2014.


Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit in the Trust based upon (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or monies in the
process of being collected, (2) the securities in the Trust based on the value
determined by the Evaluator and (3) interest accrued thereon, less accrued
expenses of the Trust, if any.


Federal Income Taxes - For a Trust with a Date of Deposit prior to August 2,
2006, such Trust has been structured to be treated as a grantor trust for
federal income tax purposes. Thus, such a Trust will not be treated as a taxable
entity for federal income tax purposes, and each Unitholder will be considered
to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of such Trust. Accordingly,
no provision has been made for federal income taxes. For a Trust with a Date of
Deposit on or after August 2, 2006, each such Trust has elected and intends to
qualify on a continuous basis for special income tax treatment as a "regulated
investment company" ("RIC") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
If such Trust so qualifies, as expected, it will not be subject to federal
income tax on amounts distributed to Unitholders. Your Trust's Date of Deposit
is listed above in the section entitled "Summary of Essential Financial
Information". For a discussion of the federal tax status of income earned on
Units, see "Federal Tax Status--Grantor Trusts" or "Federal Tax
Status--Regulated Investment Companies", as applicable, in Part II of this
Prospectus.


For each calendar year-end, a RIC trust files an annual tax return, Form
1120-RIC, with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). These returns are subject
to IRS examination under a three-year statute of limitations. To date, the Trust
has no IRS examination pending.


Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ("ASC"), clarifies the appropriate method of accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements
and provides related guidance. There is no material effect on the net asset
value, financial condition or results of operations of the Trust.


Subsequent Events - Events or transactions that have occurred from the
balance sheet date through the date of issuance are evaluated by the Sponsor.


Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are
reported on an identified cost basis.



NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO



Ratings - The source of all ratings, exclusive of those designated NR or * is
Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies ("S&P"). Ratings
marked * are by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") as these Bonds are
not rated by S&P. NR indicates that the Bond is not rated by S&P or Moody's. The
ratings shown represent the latest published ratings of the Bonds. For a brief
description of rating symbols and their related meanings, see "Description of
Securities Ratings" in the Information Supplement.


Redemption Feature - There is shown under this heading the year in which each
issue of Bonds is initially or currently callable and the call price for that
year. Each issue of Bonds continues to be callable at declining prices
thereafter (but not below par value) except for original issue discount Bonds
which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of
original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some
premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years. "S.F." indicates
a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of Bonds. "P.R."
indicates a bond has been prerefunded. Redemption pursuant to call provisions
generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at
times when the redeemed Bonds have an offering side evaluation which represents
a premium over par. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in the Trust at
a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a
loss of capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the
Units. Conversely, to the extent that the Bonds were acquired at a price lower
than the redemption price, this will represent an increase in capital when
compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Distributions
will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have
been paid with respect to redeemed Bonds. Unitholders of record as of the
applicable record date will receive distributions of principal and any premium
received on such redemption on the next applicable distribution date as
described in "Rights of Unitholders--Distributions of Interest and Principal" in
Part II. The Estimated Current Return in this event may be affected by such
redemptions. For the federal tax effect on Unitholders of such redemptions and
resultant distributions, see "Federal Tax Status" in Part II.






NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued)



Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and redemption
pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed
securities have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par.
To the extent that the securities were deposited in the Trust at a price higher
than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a loss of capital
when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Conversely,
to the extent that the securities were acquired at a price lower than the
redemption price, this will represent an increase in capital when compared with
the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Distributions will generally be
reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have been paid with
respect to redeemed securities and there will be distributed to Unitholders the
principal amount in excess of $1 per Unit semi-annually for Trusts with a Date
of Deposit prior to April 23, 2009, or in excess of $5 per Unit monthly for
Trusts with a Date of Deposit on or after April 23, 2009, and any premium
received on such redemption. However, should the amount available for
distribution in the Principal Account exceed $10.00 per Unit for Trusts with a
Date of Deposit prior to April 23, 2009, the Trustee will make a special
distribution from the Principal Account on the next succeeding monthly
Distribution Date to holders of record on the related monthly Record Date. The
estimated current return in this event may be affected by such redemptions. For
the federal tax effect on Unitholders of such redemptions and resultant
distributions, see "Federal Tax Status" in Part II of this Prospectus.


Certain Bonds may have a "make whole" call option and are redeemable in whole
or in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price that is
generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of such Bonds, a "make whole"
amount, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The "make
whole" amount is generally equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate
present value as of the date of redemption of principal being redeemed and the
amount of interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption)
that would have been payable if redemption had not been made, determined by
discounting the remaining principal and interest at a specified rate (which
varies from bond to bond and is generally equal to an average of yields on U.S.
Treasury obligations or municipal obligations, as applicable, with maturities
corresponding to the remaining life of the bond plus a premium rate) from the
dates on which the principal and interest would have been payable if the
redemption had not been made, over (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the
bonds being redeemed.


** indicates that the bond was issued by a foreign company.


Insurance - Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of
all principal and interest on certain of the securities in the Trust may have
been obtained by the Trust or by one of the Preinsured Security Insurers (as
indicated in the security name), however, certain other securities may not be
insured. Such insurance does not guarantee the market value of the securities or
the value of the Units. For securities covered under the Trust's insurance
policy the insurance is effective only while securities thus insured are held in
the Trust and the insurance premium, which is a Trust obligation, is paid on a
monthly basis. The premium for insurance which has been obtained from various
insurance companies by the issuer of the security involved is payable by the
issuer.


ASC states that, for financial reporting purposes, insurance coverage of the
type acquired by the Trust does not have any measurable fair value in the
absence of default of the underlying Bonds or of indications of the probability
of such default.


Fair Value Measurements - As described in Note 1, the Trust utilizes various
methods to measure the fair value of its investments. ASC establishes both a
framework for measuring fair value as well as a hierarchy that prioritizes
inputs to valuation methods. The various inputs that may be used to determine
the value of the Trust's investments are summarized in the three levels
presented below. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not
necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
securities.


Level 1 -- Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.


Level 2 -- Prices determined using other significant observable inputs.
Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing
a security, which may include quoted prices for similar securities, interest
rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk.


Level 3 -- Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In
certain situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable,
unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trust's own
assumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing an
investment, and would be based on the best information available.


The following table summarizes the Trust's investments as of March 31, 2016
based on the inputs used to value them:








                                                    Investments

Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) at March 31, 2016 is as follows:








Unrealized Appreciation                            $       4,287
Unrealized Depreciation                                 (422,401)
                                                   -------------
                                                   $    (418,114)
                                                   =============












NOTE 3 - OTHER



Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor may
maintain a market for Units and continuously offer to purchase Units at prices,
subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid price of the
securities in the portfolio of the Trust, plus interest accrued to the date of
settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for other business
reasons, the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. In the
event that a market is not maintained for the Units, a Unitholder desiring to
dispose of his Units may be able to do so only by tendering such Units to the
Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.


Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on the
Evaluator's determination of the aggregate offering price of the securities per
Unit on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a sales charge of 3.0% of the
Public Offering Price which was equivalent to 3.093% of the aggregate offering
price of the securities for the Trust. The secondary market cost to investors
is based on the Evaluator's determination of the aggregate bid price of the
securities per Unit on the date of an investor's purchase plus a sales charge
based upon the estimated long-term return life of the securities in the Trust.
The sales charge ranges from 1.50% of the Public Offering Price (1.523% of the
aggregate bid price of the securities) for a Trust with an estimated long-term
return life with less than two years to 4.80% of the Public Offering Price
(5.042% of the aggregate bid price of the securities) for a Trust with a
portfolio with an estimated long-term return life of fifteen or more years.


Compensation of Evaluator and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.25 per Unit, not to
exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to the
Trust). In addition, the Evaluator receives an annual fee for regularly
evaluating the Trust's portfolio. Both fees may be adjusted for increases under
the category "Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers.






NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS



During the period from April 23, 2013 (date of deposit) through March 31,
2014 and for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2016, 590
Units, 1,294 Units and 472 Units, respectively, were presented for redemption.

Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., as Sponsor, Standard & Poor's Securities
Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor,
and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, or their predecessors.


Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to
participate in a portfolio of taxable fixed income securities, corporate bonds,
or mortgage-backed securities if investing in Units of a GNMA Income Portfolio,
with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.
Diversification of a Trust's assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always
inherent in the ownership of bonds (as used herein, the term "bonds" shall also
include mortgage-backed securities, as applicable to Unitholders of a GNMA
Income Portfolio). In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the
portfolio of a Trust are often not available in small amounts and may, in the
case of any privately placed bonds, be available only to institutional
investors.


On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited the bonds with the Trustee. The
bonds initially consisted of delivery statements relating to contracts for their
purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued
by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds,
delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the Units. A Trust that holds
primarily long-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is
referred to herein as a "Long-Term Trust". A Trust that holds primarily
intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is
referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". A Trust that holds a
portfolio of bonds with "laddered" maturities, as described on the cover of
Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a "Laddered Trust". A Trust that
holds only insured bonds is referred to herein as an "Insured Trust". A Trust
that holds primarily short-term Floating and Fixed rate corporate bonds, as
described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a
"Variable Rate Trust". Trusts that primarily hold Build America Bonds, as
described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, are referred to herein as "Build
America Bond Trusts". A Trust that holds bonds within the 10-20 year maturity
range, as described in Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a "10-20 Year
Trust". A Trust that holds primarily below investment grade bonds, otherwise
referred to as "junk" bonds, is referred to herein as a "High Yield Trust".
Unless otherwise terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will
terminate at the end of the calendar year prior to the fiftieth anniversary of
its execution in the case of a Long-Term Trust, a Laddered Trust or a 10-20 Year
Trust and at the end of the calendar year prior to the twentieth anniversary of
its execution in the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust, Variable Rate Trust or
a High Yield Trust.


Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the
principal and net income of a Trust. To the extent that any Units are redeemed
by the Trustee, or additional Units are issued as a result of additional
Securities being deposited by the Sponsor only with respect to a GNMA Income
Portfolio, the fractional undivided interest in a Trust represented by each Unit
will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual Units in a Trust will
remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or
until the termination of the Trust Agreement.


With respect only to a GNMA Income Portfolio, additional Units of your Trust
may be issued at any time by depositing in the Trust (i) additional securities,

(ii) contracts to purchase securities together with cash or irrevocable letters
of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter of credit or the equivalent) with
instructions to purchase additional securities. As additional Units are issued
by the Trust, the aggregate value of the securities will be increased and the
fractional undivided interest represented by each Unit will be decreased. The
Sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into the Trust following the
Initial Date of Deposit provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts
which will maintain, as nearly as practicable, the original percentage
relationship among the principal amounts of securities of specified interest
rates and ranges of maturities that existed on the Initial Date of Deposit.
Investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities
between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because
the Trust will pay the associated brokerage and acquisition costs. Purchases and
sales of Securities by the Trust may impact the value of the Securities. This
may especially be the case upon Trust termination or in the course of satisfying
large Unit redemptions.


Objectives and Bond Selection. The objective of a Long-Term Trust is to
provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally
selected portfolio primarily consisting of long-term bonds. The objective of an
Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by
investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of
intermediate-term bonds. The objective of a 10-20 Year Trust is to provide a
high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio
of bonds maturing approximately 10 to 20 years from the Date of Deposit. The
objective of a Laddered Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital
by investing in a professionally selected portfolio consisting of bonds with
laddered maturities of approximately 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 years from the Date
of Deposit. The objective of a Van Kampen BlackRock Corporate Opportunity Trust
("BlackRock Trust") is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve
capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of intermediate-term
corporate bonds. The objective of a GNMA Income Portfolio is to provide an
attractive level of monthly income by investing in a portfolio consisting of
fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities representing pools of mortgages on 1- to
4-family dwellings guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association.
The objective of a Variable Rate Trust is to provide an attractive level of
income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting
of short-term floating and fixed rate corporate bonds. The objective of a High
Yield Trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital
by investing primarily in a portfolio of high yield corporate bonds. There is,
of course, no guarantee that a Trust will achieve its objective. Your Trust may
be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio
of taxable fixed income securities, corporate bonds, or mortgage-backed
securities if investing in Units of a GNMA Income Portfolio, with greater
diversification than they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification
of a Trust's assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the
ownership of bonds.


In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following
factors, among others: (a) the ratings criteria applicable to such Trust; (b)
the prices and liquidity of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable
quality and maturity, (c) the current income provided by the bonds; (d) the
diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer; and (e)
the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk. After
the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced
below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. Neither event requires
elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered in the Sponsor's
determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to dispose of the bond
(see "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration"). In particular, the
ratings of the bonds in a BlackRock Trust, Income Opportunities Trust,
Investment Grade Trust, Long-Term Investment Grade Trust, Long-Term Corporate
Investment Grade Trust, Intermediate Corporate Investment Grade Trust,
Investment Grade Income Trust or Variable Rate Trust could fall below
"investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or "Baa3") during the Trust's life and
the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. The portfolio for a BlackRock Trust
was selected by the Sponsor from a list of corporate bonds researched and
selected by the BlackRock fixed income team. With respect to the selection of
securities for a GNMA Income Portfolio, the Sponsor considered factors including
the following: (i) the types of GNMA securities available, (ii) the prices and
yields of the securities relative to other comparable securities, including the
extent to which the securities were trading at a premium or discount from their
principal value, and (iii) the maturities of the securities. See "The
Trusts--Risk Factors".


Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and
interest on certain bonds in the Trusts has been obtained from bond insurance
company. See "Insurance on the Bonds".


Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment
return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement contains a
more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment.


Current economic conditions. The economic recession in the United States
which began in 2007 technically came to an end in June of 2009, however the U.S.
and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period,
including increased unemployment and below-average levels of economic activity.
The U.S. and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat
the effects of the economic crisis, however the ultimate impact of these
measures is unknown and cannot be predicted. In December of 2013, the U.S.
Federal Reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing
program, however, there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future
changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates
over the previous five years. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's Rating
Services (S&P) downgraded the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United
States of America to AA+ from AAA, citing the prolonged controversy over raising
the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate. Any substantial
change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant
valuation increases or declines in your Trust's holdings.


Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls, or the credit rating
on a bond included in a BlackRock Trust or a Variable Rate Trust is downgraded,
as is possible in a managed fund.


Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest
rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise
in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are
often more sensitive to interest rate changes. Given the historically low
interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are
heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest
rate increases could be swift and significant. With respect only to a Variable
Rate Trust, because the interest rates on floating rate bonds adjust
periodically to reflect current market rates, falling short-term interest rates
should tend to decrease the income payable to a Variable Rate Trust on its
floating rate investments and rising rates should tend to increase that income.
However, investments in floating rate obligations should also mitigate the
fluctuations in a Variable Rate Trust's net asset values during periods of
changing interest rates, compared to changes in values of fixed-rate debt
securities. Nevertheless, changes in interest rates can affect the value of a
Variable Rate Trust's floating rate investments, especially if rates change
sharply in a short period, because the resets of the interest rates on the
investments occur periodically and will not all happen simultaneously with
changes in prevailing rates.


Certain bonds in a High Yield Trust may be subject to interest rate
adjustments if either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") S&P's or Fitch
(or, in certain limited circumstances, another ratings service) downgrades the
rating for such bond (or upgrades the rating after such a downgrade). The
interest rates payable on certain bonds in a High Yield Trust may have already
been increased due to past ratings downgrades. Any future credit rating
improvements on such bonds may result in decreases to the interest rates payable
on such bonds and, consequently, may adversely affect both the income you
receive from the securities in a High Yield Trust and the value of your Units.
On the other hand, increases in a bond's interest rate related to decreases in
such bond's credit rating may place additional financial strain on the bond's
issuer which could result in further decreases in financial condition and
further credit rating decreases. Additionally, an increase in a bond's interest
rate may increase the risk that the bond's issuer will prepay or "call" the bond
before its stated maturity.


Credit risk is the risk that a security's issuer is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on the security. While interest and
principal payments on Ginnie Mae securities are backed by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. government, a GNMA Income Portfolio and the Units thereof are
not guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or any government agency. In
addition, neither the U.S. government nor Ginnie Mae guarantees the market value
or yield on Ginnie Mae securities.


Prepayment risk is the chance that borrowers prepay their mortgage loans
earlier than expected and in particular, may affect the Units of a GNMA Income
Portfolio. This reduces the Trust's life and future interest income. Any payment
of mortgage debt before it is due is called "prepayment". Most mortgage loans
may be prepaid at any time by the borrower without penalty. Each mortgage-backed
security payment includes a return of principal as well as interest. Prepayments
of the entire mortgage occur when borrowers refinance or sell their homes. They
may refinance to consolidate debts or take advantage of lower interest rate
mortgages. As interest rates decrease, the rate of refinancings may increase
significantly, thereby increasing the prepayment risk of mortgage-backed
securities. Extra monthly principal payments made near the Trust's inception may
significantly reduce the interest amount paid by the borrower to the lender and,
therefore, the future amount received by the Trust.


Your Trust will distribute prepayments of principal to you but your future
interest distributions will fall as a result of the prepaid principal. You also
might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. This means that
you could receive less than the amount you paid for your Units. If enough
principal is prepaid on the securities in your Trust, your Trust could terminate
significantly earlier than expected.


Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your
units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate
early. Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or
mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax
laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and various other events.
Build America Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy
Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, in particular, are often
subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions. See
"Taxable Municipal Bonds--Build America Bonds" and "Taxable Municipal
Bonds--Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds
and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds" below. The call provisions are described in
general terms in the "Redemption Feature" column of the "Portfolio" section, and
the notes thereof in Prospectus Part I.


Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating
agency decreases the bond's rating.


Concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified because it
concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of bond makes up
25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be "concentrated" in that
bond type. The different bond types are described in the following sections.


A GNMA Income Portfolio concentrates in mortgage-backed securities. You
should understand these securities before you invest. These securities are
described in detail in the section titled "Ginnie Mae Securities."


Extension risk is the chance that an increase in interest rates or lack of
refinancing opportunities can cause a corresponding increase in the Trust's life
due to a drop in expected prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. As a
result, the securities in your Trust, and in particular, any mortgage-backed
securities in a GNMA Income Portfolio, may become more sensitive to rising
interest rates and may decrease in value.


Foreign securities risk. Investing in foreign securities typically involves
more risks than investing in securities of United States issuers. These risks
can increase the potential for losses in the Trust and affect its Unit price.
These risks may include risks such as losses due to political, economic and
social developments, international trade conditions, foreign taxes (including
withholding taxes), restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of
securities, foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or
repatriation of currencies.


The political, economic and social structures of some foreign countries may
be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S., and investments in
these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts,
currency devaluations, foreign ownership limitations and tax increases. It is
possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company
or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets.
Some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult
for the Trust to exercise investor rights, and pursue legal remedies with
respect to its foreign investments. Diplomatic and political developments,
including rapid and adverse political changes, social instability, regional
conflicts, terrorism and war, could affect the economies, industries, and
securities and currency markets, and the value of the Trust's investments, in
non-U.S. countries. No one can predict the impact that these factors could have
on the Trust's portfolio securities.


Foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure, accounting,
auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as U.S. companies.
Thus, there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies
than about most U.S. companies.


Certain foreign securities may be less liquid (harder to sell) and more
volatile than many U.S. securities. This means the Trust may at times be unable
to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices.


Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller
and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.


High Yield Bond Risk. High Yield Trusts invest primarily in high yield bonds.
Other Trusts may hold bonds currently rated below investment grade following one
or more downgrades. High yield, or "junk" bonds, are frequently issued by
corporations in the growth stage of their development or by established
companies who are highly leveraged or whose operations or industries are
depressed. High yield bonds are rated below BBB- by S&P or Fitch Ratings, or
below Baa3 by Moody's, and are considered speculative as these ratings indicate
a quality below investment grade. For additional information regarding ratings
definitions, see "Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement.


The prices of and yields on high yield bonds may fluctuate to a greater
extent than those of higher rated bonds. Because high yield bonds are generally
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated bonds, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated bonds
and are affected by economic, political, regulatory, company-specific and
short-term credit developments to a greater degree. Their values can decline
significantly over short periods of time or during periods of economic
difficulty when the bonds could be difficult to value or sell at a fair price.


The market for high yield bonds is smaller and less liquid than that for
investment grade bonds. High yield bonds are generally not listed on a national
securities exchange but trade in the over-the-counter markets. Due to the
smaller, less liquid market for high yield bonds, the bid-offer spread on such
bonds is generally greater than it is for investment grade bonds and the
purchase or sale of such bonds may take longer to complete. Further, a Trust may
have difficulty selling certain high yield bonds at the desired time and price.
Less liquidity could adversely affect the price at which a Trust could sell a
particular high yield bond, and could cause significant fluctuations in the net
asset value of a Trust's Units. The lack of a liquid trading market may also
make it more difficult for a Trust to obtain accurate market quotations in
valuing high yield bonds and elements of judgment may play a greater role in
valuation.


High yield bonds are also subject to greater credit risk (including the
possibility of an issuer's default or bankruptcy) than bonds in higher rating
categories. An economic slowdown, or a reduction in an issuer's
creditworthiness, may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings at
a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal payments. The risk of
default among high yield bonds is also enhanced since these securities are
generally subordinated obligations within an issuer's overall capital structure.
Generally, no payment with respect to subordinated indebtedness (such as a high
yield bond in a Trust) may be made while there exists a default with respect to
any senior indebtedness. Thus, in the event of insolvency, holders of senior
indebtedness of an issuer generally will recover more, ratably, than holders of
subordinated indebtedness of that issuer.


Should the issuer of any high yield bond default in the payment of principal
or interest, a Trust may incur additional expenses seeking payment on the
defaulted bond. Because amounts (if any) recovered by a Trust in payment under
the defaulted bond may not be reflected in the value of a Trust's Units until
actually received by a Trust, and depending upon when a Unitholder purchases or
sells his or her Units, it is possible that a Unitholder would bear a portion of
the cost of recovery without receiving any portion of the payment recovered.


Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent, thereby adversely affecting the Trust's net asset
value. The market for certain investments may become less liquid or illiquid due
to adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or due to adverse
market or economic conditions. In the absence of a liquid trading market for a
particular security, the price at which such security may be sold to meet
redemptions, as well as the value of the Units of your Trust, may be adversely
affected. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any
bond because these bonds generally trade in the over-the-counter market (they
are not listed on a securities exchange). Because of the difficulties currently
being experienced by many companies in the financial services industry, many
markets are experiencing substantially reduced liquidity. As a result of such
illiquidity, the Trustee may have to sell other or additional bonds if necessary
to satisfy redemption requests.


Certain Trusts may hold bonds that are "Rule 144A" restricted securities
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("1933 Act"), and may be
subject to enhanced liquidity risk. Rule 144A securities are restricted
securities that may only be resold in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the 1933 Act. Rule 144A establishes a "safe harbor" from the registration
requirements of the 1933 Act for resale of certain securities to qualified
institutional buyers. Subsequently to a Trust's Initial Date of Deposit, the
overall liquidity of the Trust may decrease to the extent the Trust's restricted
securities are not readily marketable or become illiquid at the time the Trust
may be seeking to sell such securities, such as for a request for redemption. An
insufficient number of qualified institutional buyers interested in purchasing
restricted securities held by a Trust may adversely affect the marketability of
such securities, and the Trustee might be unable to dispose of such Trust
securities promptly or at reasonable prices. Since it is not possible to predict
with assurance exactly how the market for a particular Rule 144A restricted
security will develop, the Sponsor will carefully monitor each Trust's
investments in these securities, focusing on such factors, among others, as
valuation, liquidity and availability of information.


Restricted securities may be sold only in privately negotiated transactions
or in a public offering with respect to a registration statement which is in
effect under the 1933 Act. A restricted security in a Trust may not be readily
marketable at the time such a Trust may be seeking to sell such securities, such
as for a request for redemption. An insufficient number of qualified
institutional buyers interested in purchasing restricted securities held by a
Trust may adversely affect the marketability of such securities, and the Trustee
might be unable to dispose of such Trust securities promptly or at reasonable
prices. Where registration is required for the resale of a restricted security,
a Trust may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a
considerable period may elapse from the time the Trustee attempts to sell such
restricted Trust securities and the time the Trustee may be permitted to sell
the restricted Trust securities under an effective registration statement. Due
to the potential for delays on resale and uncertainty in valuation associated
with restricted securities, the Trustee may experience difficulty satisfying
redemptions within three business days.


Insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an Insured Trust could
lose income and/or principal if the issuer and the insurer of a bond both
default in making their payment obligations.


Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.


Taxable Municipal Bonds. Your Trust may invest significantly or exclusively
in taxable municipal bonds. States, municipalities and public authorities issue
these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes. In selecting bonds, the
Sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose. This section briefly
describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment.
The types of bonds in your Trust are listed in Prospectus Part I. These bonds
are also described in greater detail in the Information Supplement.


General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.


Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.


Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.


Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.


Build America Bonds were issued pursuant to The American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act"), authorizing states and local
governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy for
a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by the
United States Treasury Department ("Treasury") and the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS"), in an amount equal to 35 percent of the total coupon interest payable
to investors (45 percent for those Build America Bonds that qualify and are
designated as Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds).


The Recovery Act adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, (the "Code") which authorizes Build America Bonds that meet the
definition of "qualified bonds", as described below, to receive the refundable
credit. The Code section defines the term "qualified bond" to mean a Build
America Bond (a) issued before January 1, 2011, (b) with 100 percent of the
excess of (i) the available project proceeds (as defined to mean sale proceeds
of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay
issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon), over (ii) the amounts in a
reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue, are to be used for
capital expenditures, and (c) where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to
have this subsection of the Code apply.


Should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed on the bonds by the Code, it is possible that such
issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's
ability to make scheduled interest payments. In addition, Build America Bonds
are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to
Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as added by the Recovery Act) or other
federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy
payment for a portion of a Build America Bond issuer's borrowing costs.


Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and
Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (collectively, "Qualified Bonds") are taxable bonds
that are similar to certain Build America Bonds, in that state and municipal
Qualified Bond issuers may elect to receive direct interest-subsidy payments
from the U.S. Treasury if certain conditions are met. The Hiring Incentives to
Restore Employment Act, enacted into federal law on March 18, 2010, permits
issuers of Qualified Bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond interest
payments.


Qualified School Construction Bonds, issued pursuant to provisions in the
Recovery Act, are issued to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or repair
of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a
bond-financed facility will be constructed. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds
and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds are both issued pursuant to the "Energy
Improvement and Extension Act of 2008", and like Qualified School Construction
Bonds, are governed by Section 54A of the Code. Qualified Energy Conservation
Bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes, and Clean
Renewable Energy Bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy
facilities that produce electricity. Although the year of issuance is not
restricted for Qualified Bonds, federal law provides for limits on the dollar
amounts that may be issued for these bond types.


Federal legislation has amended the Code in recent years to provide for
certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of Qualified Bonds, and
to include such bonds under the definition of "qualified tax credit bond" as
found in Section 54A of the Code. Eligible issuers of Qualified School
Construction Bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to 100% of the lesser of
the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal
tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S. Treasury. Eligible issuers of Qualified
Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may receive subsidy
payments equal to 70% of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or
the tax credit rate for municipal tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S.
Treasury.


Should the issuer of a Qualified Bond fail to continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed on any such bond by the Code or other federal laws, it
is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments,
impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments or even
causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds. As provided in Section
54A of the Code, Qualified Bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any
portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after
three years from the date of issuance. This mandatory redemption must be
completed within 90 days after such three-year period, unless an extension is
granted by the Treasury. Additionally, Qualified Bonds may be subject to
extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the
Code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash
subsidy payment for any Qualified Bond issuer's borrowing costs.


Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting
appropriations for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate
future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments
typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their
budgets. If a government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient
funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.


Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments
on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for
services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the
need to reduce costs, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance and
claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).


Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number
of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and
government legislation or regulation.


Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or improving
industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these projects. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as
the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project, revenues
generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or other
regulatory restrictions.


Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.


Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general
risks.


Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use
of the facility.


Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education
financing.


Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates
and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.


Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.


Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds,
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability
to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds.


Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends
on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air,
rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation
modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of
issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.


Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect
operation of a project.


Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal
issuers.


Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand
for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government
regulation and rate approvals.


Ginnie Mae Securities. GNMA Income Portfolios invest exclusively in Ginnie
Mae securities. These securities are backed by mortgage loans. These securities
represent an ownership interest in mortgage loans made by banks and other
financial institutions to finance purchases of homes. Individual loans are
pooled together by Ginnie Mae-approved issuers for sale to investors. Commonly
referred to as "pass-through" certificates, these securities entitle an
investor to an undivided interest in the underlying mortgage loan pool. The
investor receives a proportionate share of the interest (reduced by servicing
and guaranty fees) and principal on the underlying mortgage loans.


Payments on Ginnie Mae securities to investors occur monthly. These payments
are called "modified pass-through" payments because, through Ginnie Mae's
mortgage-backed securities program, money is passed from the borrower through
to the investors in the Ginnie Mae securities. It is "modified" because if the
amount collected from the borrowers is less than the amount due, the issuer
modifies the pass-through to add on an amount from its corporate funds to make
the payment complete.


Each group of Ginnie Mae securities shown in the "Portfolio" section of
Prospectus Part I under a specified range of maturities includes individual
mortgage-backed securities which may have varying maturities within each range.
If there is no difference in price among the individual Ginnie Mae securities
within each group on the basis of the difference in the maturity dates of each
security, a purchase of Ginnie Mae securities with the same coupon rate and a
maturity date within the related range will be considered an acquisition of the
same security. In the future, however, the difference in maturity ranges could
affect the market value of the individual Ginnie Mae securities. If this
happens, any additional purchases by your Trust will take into account the
maturities of the individual securities.


The Government National Mortgage Association, known as Ginnie Mae, was
created in 1968 as a wholly owned corporation within the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. Through its mortgage-backed securities program, Ginnie
Mae seeks to increase the liquidity and efficiency of mortgage loan funding,
making more capital available to low and moderate-income homeowners at
competitive interest rates.


The primary function of Ginnie Mae is to operate its mortgage-backed
securities (MBS) program. Ginnie Mae helps to ensure mortgage funds are
available throughout the United States including in rural and urban areas in
which it has been harder to borrow money to buy a home. Ginnie Mae securities
are issued by Ginnie Mae-approved private institutions. The mortgages are
insured by the Federal Housing Administration, or by the Rural Housing Service,
or they are guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.


Because of the Ginnie Mae guaranty, investors in Ginnie Mae securities are
assured timely payments of scheduled principal and interest due on the pooled
mortgages that back their securities. The payments also include any prepayments
and early recoveries of principal on the pooled mortgages. These payments are
guaranteed even if borrowers or issuers default on their obligation. If the
issuer fails to make the payment, Ginnie Mae will make the payment to the
investor. Neither Ginnie Mae nor the U.S. government guarantees or insures (1)
the market value or yields of Ginnie Mae securities, (2) the Trust or (3) the
Units of the Trust in any way.


State Risk Factors. Your Trust may invest significantly in taxable municipal
bonds of issuers from a particular state. The financial condition of a state
may be affected by various national, economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions. Additionally, limitations imposed by constitutional
amendments, legislative measures, or voter initiatives on a state and its local
governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain
the revenue-generating capacity of the state and its local governments and,
therefore, the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their
obligations.


The economic vitality of a state and its various regions and, therefore, the
ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds, are
affected by numerous factors, such as natural disasters, complications with
exports and industry deregulation.


A state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the state's governmental operations and
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.


Corporate Bond Industry Risks. Your Trust may invest significantly in
certain industries. Any negative impact on the related industry will have a
greater impact on the value of Units than on a portfolio diversified over
several industries. You should understand the risks of these industries before
you invest.


Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. Your Trust may invest
significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell various
consumer products. General risks of these companies include the general state
of the economy, intense competition and consumer spending trends. A decline in
the economy which results in a reduction of consumers' disposable income can
negatively impact spending habits. Competitiveness in the retail industry will
require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout
equipment to control inventory, track the sale of items and gauge the success
of sales campaigns. Retailers who sell their products over the Internet have
the potential to access more consumers, but will require sophisticated
technology to remain competitive. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes
can also affect the demand for, and the success of, consumer products and
services in the marketplace.


Financial Services Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by financial services companies. Companies in the financial services
industry include, but are not limited to, companies involved in activities such
as banking, mortgage finance, consumer finance, specialized finance, industrial
finance and leasing, investment banking and brokerage, asset management and
custody, corporate lending, insurance, and financial investment and real
estate, including real estate investment trusts. In general, financial services
issuers are substantially affected by changes in economic and market
conditions, including: the liquidity and volatility levels in the global
financial markets; interest rates, as well as currency and commodities prices;
investor sentiment; the rate of corporate and consumer defaults; inflation and
unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; exposure to
various geographic markets or in commercial and residential real estate;
competition from new entrants in their fields of business; extensive government
regulation; and the overall health of the U.S. and international economies.


The financial services sector was adversely affected by global developments
stemming from the financial crisis including recessionary conditions,
deterioration in the credit markets and recurring concerns over sovereign debt.
A substantial amount of assets were written down by financial institutions, with
the impact of these losses forcing a number of large traditional banks,
investment banks, broker-dealers and insurers into liquidation, combination or
other restructuring. This also significantly increased the credit risk, and
possibility of default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these
problems. In addition, the liquidity of certain debt instruments has been
reduced or eliminated due to the lack of available market makers. While the U.S.
and foreign governments, and their respective government agencies, have taken
steps to address problems in the financial markets and with financial
institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated with
investment in financial services issuers will decrease as a result of these
steps.


Most financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental
regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a
profit from a given line of business. Challenging economic and political
conditions, along with increased public scrutiny during the past several years,
have led to new legislation and increased regulation in the U.S. and abroad,
creating additional difficulties for financial institutions. Regulatory
initiatives and requirements that are being proposed around the world may be
inconsistent or may conflict with regulations to which financial services
issuers are currently subject, thereby resulting in higher compliance and legal
costs, as well as the potential for higher operational, capital and liquidity
costs. Proposed or enacted regulations may further limit the amounts and types
of loans and other financial commitments certain financial services issuers can
make, and further, may limit the interest rates and fees they can charge, the
prices they can charge and the amount of capital they must maintain. These laws
and regulations may affect the manner in which a particular financial
institution does business and the products and services it may provide.
Increased regulation may restrict a company's ability to compete in its current
businesses or to enter into or acquire new businesses. New regulations may
reduce or limit a company's revenue or impose additional fees, limit the scope
of their activities, increase assessments or taxes on those companies and
intensify regulatory supervision, adversely affecting business operations or
leading to other negative consequences.


Among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial crisis
has been the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the
"Dodd-Frank Act"), enacted into federal law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act
includes reforms and refinements to modernize existing laws to address emerging
risks and issues in the nation's evolving financial system. It also establishes
entirely new regulatory regimes, including in areas such as systemic risk
regulation, over-the-counter derivatives market oversight, and federal consumer
protection. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to cover virtually all participants
in the financial services industry for years to come, including banks, thrifts,
depository institution holding companies, mortgage lenders, insurance companies,
industrial loan companies, broker-dealers and other securities and investment
advisory firms, private equity and hedge funds, consumers, numerous federal
agencies and the federal regulatory structure. In particular, certain provisions
of the Dodd-Frank Act increase the capital requirements of certain financial
services companies supervised by the Federal Reserve, resulting in such
companies incurring generally higher deposit premiums. These types of regulatory
changes may have adverse effects on certain issuers in your Trust, and could
lead to decreases in such issuers' profits or revenues. In many cases the full
impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on a financial institution's business remains
uncertain because of the extensive rule-making still to be completed. The
Sponsor is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, and any
resulting regulation, on the securities in your Trust or on the financial
services industry in general.


Financial services companies in foreign countries are also subject to
regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in
certain foreign countries may include controls on interest rates, credit
availability, prices and currency transfers. Negative developments regarding
Eurozone sovereign debt, including the potential for further downgrades of
sovereign credit ratings, as well as downgrades to the ratings of the U.S.
government's sovereign credit rating, could adversely affect financial services
issuers. Developments in the European Union ("EU") could adversely affect
certain financial services issuers. The departure of any EU member from use of
the Euro could lead to serious disruptions to foreign exchanges, operations and
settlements, which may have an adverse effect on financial services issuers.
More recently, there is uncertainty regarding the state of the EU following the
vote in the United Kingdom to exit the EU ("Brexit"). One of the key global
concerns that may continue to provide uncertainty in the markets is that the
United Kingdom could be just the first of more EU countries to leave the union.
The effect that Brexit may have on the global financial markets or on the
financial services companies in your Trust is uncertain.


The financial condition of customers, clients and counterparties, including
other financial institutions, could adversely affect financial services
issuers. Financial services issuers are interrelated as a result of market
making, trading, clearing or other counterparty relationships. Many of these
transactions expose financial services issuers to credit risk as a result of
the actions of, or deterioration in, the commercial soundness of other
counterparty financial institutions. Economic and market conditions may
increase credit exposures due to the increased risk of customer, client or
counterparty default. Downgrades to the credit ratings of financial services
issuers could have a negative effect on liquidity, cash flows, competitive
position, financial condition and results of operations by significantly
limiting access to funding or capital markets, increasing borrowing costs or
triggering increased collateral requirements. Financial services issuers face
significant legal risk, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings, as
well as private actions. Profit margins of these companies continue to shrink
due to the commoditization of traditional businesses, new competitors, capital
expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally.


Banks face competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory
changes have permitted new entrants to offer various financial products.
Technological advances allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut
overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data. Banks continue to
face tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms and other financial
service providers in the competition to furnish services that were
traditionally offered by banks. Bank profitability is largely dependent on the
availability and cost of capital funds, and may fluctuate significantly when
interest rates change or due to increased competition. Further, economic
conditions in the real estate market may have a particularly strong effect on
certain banks and savings associations. Declining real estate values could
adversely affect financial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other
lending or investing activities directly or indirectly connected to the value
of real estate.


Companies engaged in investment management and broker-dealer activities are
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceed the
volatility of the equity market in general. Adverse changes in the direction of
the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level and
direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely
affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these
companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,
including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium rate caps, a
misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings, competition and
pressure to compete globally, terrorism, weather catastrophes or other disasters
and the effects of client mergers. Individual companies may be exposed to risks
including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance
carriers. Life and health insurance companies may be affected by mortality and
morbidity rates, including the effect of epidemics. Insurance companies are
subject to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of
maximum rate levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business.
Insurance companies may be subject to severe price competition. Proposed or
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy
sales, tax obligations and profitability.


Health Care Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
health care companies. These issuers include companies involved in advanced
medical devices and instruments, drugs and biotechnology, managed care,
hospital management/health services and medical supplies. These companies face
substantial government regulation and approval procedures. General risks of
health care companies include extensive competition, product liability
litigation and evolving government regulation.


On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
(incorporating the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, collectively the
"Act") was enacted into law. The Act continues to have a significant impact on
the health care sector through the implementation of a number of reforms in a
complex and ongoing process, with varying effective dates. Significant
provisions of the Act include the introduction of required health care coverage
for most Americans, significant expansion in the number of Americans eligible
for Medicaid, modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector,
and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families. The Act also
provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers,
including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to pre-existing
conditions. Although the entirety of the Act will not come into effect until
2018, in the interim, health care companies will face continuing and
significant changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased
costs and changes in the health care market. The Sponsor is unable to predict
the full impact of the Act on the Securities in your Trust.


As illustrated by the Act, Congress may from time to time propose
legislative action that will impact the health care sector. The proposals may
span a wide range of topics, including cost and price controls (which may
include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs), incentives for
competition in the provision of health care services, promotion of pre-paid
health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the
health care sector. The government could also reduce funding for health care
related research.


Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, product
obsolescence, increased government regulation, termination of patent protection
for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a product will never come
to market. The research and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical
product to market are substantial. This process involves lengthy government
review with no guarantee of approval. These companies may have losses and may
not offer proposed products for several years, if at all. The failure to gain
approval for a new drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a
company and its stock. The goods and services of health care issuers are also
subject to risks of malpractice claims, product liability claims or other
litigation.


Health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services, the
ability of the facility to provide required services, an increased emphasis on
outpatient services, confidence in the facility, management capabilities,
competitive forces that may result in price discounting, efforts by insurers and
government agencies to limit rates, expenses, the cost and possible
unavailability of malpractice insurance, and termination or restriction of
government financial assistance (such as Medicare, Medicaid or similar
programs).


Industrials Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
industrials companies. General risks of industrials companies include the
general state of the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and
international politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. Capital
goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending
and leverage levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in
modernization, limitations on supply of key materials, labor relations,
government regulations, government contracts and e-commerce initiatives.
Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or
retain government contracts, labor disputes, changes in government budget
priorities, changes in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable
business travel. The number of housing starts, levels of public and
non-residential construction including weakening demand for new office and
retail space, and overall construction spending may adversely affect
construction materials and equipment manufacturers.


Technology Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
companies in the technology sector which includes information technology
companies. These companies include those involved in computer and business
services, enterprise software/technical software, Internet and computer
software, Internet-related services, networking and telecommunications
equipment, telecommunications services, electronics products, server hardware,
computer hardware and peripherals, semiconductor capital equipment and
semiconductors. These companies face risks related to rapidly changing
technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving
industry standards and frequent new product introductions.


Companies in this sector face risks from rapid changes in technology,
competition, dependence on certain suppliers and supplies, rapid obsolescence of
products or services, patent termination, cyclical market pattern, evolving
industry standards, frequent new products and government regulation. These
companies can also be adversely affected by interruption or reduction in supply
of components or loss of key customers and failure to comply with certain
industry standards.


An unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on
a company. The failure of a company to introduce new products or technologies
or keep pace with rapidly changing technology can have a negative impact on the
company's results. Technology companies may also be smaller and/or less
experienced companies with limited product lines, markets or resources. Stocks
of some Internet companies have high price-to-earnings ratios with little or no
earnings histories. Technology stocks tend to experience substantial price
volatility and speculative trading. Announcements about new products,
technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock prices
to fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price and volume
fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of a company. This can
impact your ability to redeem your Units at a price equal to or greater than
what you paid.


Materials Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
companies in the materials industry. Companies in the materials sector could be
adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import
controls and increased competition. Production of materials often exceeds
demand as a result of overbuilding or economic downturns, leading to poor
investment returns. Companies in the materials sector are at risk for
environmental damage and product liability claims. Companies in the materials
sector may be adversely affected by depletion of resources, technical progress,
labor relations, and governmental regulations.


Telecommunications Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by telecommunications companies. These companies are subject to
substantial governmental regulation. For example, the United States government
and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of
services that a company may offer. This industry has experienced substantial
deregulation in recent years. Deregulation may lead to fierce competition for
market share and can have a negative impact on certain companies. Recent
federal legislation governing the United States telecommunications industry
remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation, which may
adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by your Trust.
Competitive pressures are intense and values of telecommunications company
securities can experience rapid volatility. Certain telecommunications products
may become outdated very rapidly. A company's performance can be hurt if the
company fails to keep pace with technological advances.


Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have
illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies.
High debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the
1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt and stock prices to trade at
distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost
of capital for needed additional investment. At the same time, demand for some
telecommunications services has fallen sharply, as several key markets have
become oversaturated, some local customers have switched to substitute providers
and technologies, and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak.
To meet increasing competition, companies may have to commit substantial
capital, particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new
technologies. As a result, many companies have been compelled to cut costs by
reducing their workforce, outsourcing, consolidating and/or closing existing
facilities and divesting low selling product lines. Furthermore, certain
companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged
accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their
financial results, and other companies in the industry may face similar
scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of owning the
securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may
continue to rise.


Certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than
larger, established issuers. Smaller companies may have limited product lines,
markets or financial resources. Their securities may trade in lower volumes
than larger companies. As a result, the prices of these securities may
fluctuate more than the prices of securities of other issuers.


Energy Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by energy
companies. Energy companies can be significantly impacted by fluctuations in the
prices of energy fuels, such as crude oil, natural gas, and other fossil fuels.
Extended periods of low energy fuel prices can have a material adverse impact on
an energy company's financial condition and results of operations. The prices of
energy fuels can be materially impacted by general economic conditions, demand
for energy fuels, industry inventory levels, production quotas or other actions
that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), weather-related disruptions and damage, competing fuel prices, and
geopolitical risks. Recently, the price of crude oil, natural gas and other
fossil fuels has declined substantially and experienced significant volatility,
which has adversely impacted energy companies and their stock prices and
dividends. The price of energy fuels may decline further and have further
adverse effects on energy companies.


Some energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire additional
energy reserves. The exploration and recovery process involves significant
operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy company has no assurance
that it will find reserves or that any reserves found will be economically
recoverable. The energy industry also faces substantial government regulation,
including environmental regulation regarding air emissions and disposal of
hazardous materials. These regulations may increase costs and limit production
and usage of certain fuels. Additionally, governments have been increasing their
attention to issues related to greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions and climate
change, and regulatory measures to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently
in various stages of discussion or implementation. GHG emissions-related
regulations could substantially harm energy companies, including by reducing the
demand for energy fuels and increasing compliance costs. Energy companies also
face risks related to political conditions in oil producing regions (such as the
Middle East). Political instability or war in these regions could negatively
impact energy companies.


The operations of energy companies can be disrupted by natural or human
factors beyond the control of the energy company. These include hurricanes,
floods, severe storms, and other weather events, civil unrest, accidents, war,
earthquakes, fire, political events, systems failures, and terrorist attacks,
any of which could result in suspension of operations. Energy companies also
face certain hazards inherent to operating in their industry, such as accidental
releases of energy fuels or other hazardous materials, explosions, and
mechanical failures, which can result in environmental damage, loss of life,
loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption of operations.


Utility Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
utility companies or in companies related to the utility or energy industries.
Many utility companies, especially electric and gas and other energy related
utility companies, are subject to various uncertainties, including:


o    Risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs;


o    Restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result
of environmental, nuclear safety and other regulations;


o    Regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale
costs along to the retail and business customer;


o    Coping with the general effects of energy conservation;


o    Technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment
or products obsolete;


o    The effects of unusual, unexpected or abnormal local weather


o    Maturing markets and difficulty in expanding to new markets due to
regulatory and other factors;


o    The potential impact of natural or manmade disasters;


o    Difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital, even if
frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions;


o    The high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation;


o    Difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and
equity securities;


o    Increased competition; and


o    International politics.


Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could affect the
supply of or demand for energy, such as electricity or natural gas, or water, or
the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could adversely
affect the profitability of the issuers of the bonds and the performance of the
Trust. Utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal
level in the United States, and many are regulated at the state level as well.
The value of utility company stocks may decline because governmental regulation
affecting the utilities industry can change. This regulation may prevent or
delay the utility company from passing along cost increases to its customers,
which could hinder the utility company's ability to meet its obligations to its
suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures, including the acceleration
of obligations or the institution of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, by its
creditors against such utility company. Furthermore, regulatory authorities,
which may be subject to political and other pressures, may not grant future rate
increases, or may impose accounting or operational policies, any of which could
adversely affect a company's profitability and its stock price.


Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in
recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial
companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been
permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic
regions and their traditional lines of business. These opportunities may permit
certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates of
return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend their core business and
may be less profitable. While regulated providers tend to have regulated
returns, non-regulated providers' returns are not regulated and generally are
more volatile. These developments have reduced stability of cash flows in those
states with non-regulated providers and could impact the short-term earnings
potential of some in this industry. These trends have also made shares of some
utility companies less sensitive to interest rate changes but more sensitive to
changes in revenue and earnings and caused them to reduce the ratio of their
earnings they pay out as dividends.


Certain utilities companies face risks associated with the operation of
nuclear facilities for electric generation, including, among other
considerations, litigation, the problems associated with the use of radioactive
materials and the effects of natural or man-made disasters. In general, certain
utility companies may face additional regulation and litigation regarding their
power plant operations, increased costs from new or greater regulation of these
operations, and expenses related to the purchase of emissions control equipment.


More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds,
other information about the bonds is also included in the "Portfolio" in
Prospectus Part I and notes thereto. This information relates to other
characteristics of the bonds. This section briefly describes some of these
characteristics.


Floating Rate Bonds. A Variable Rate Trust invests in corporate bonds that
have variable or floating interest rates. A floating rate bond is one whose
terms provide for the readjustment of its interest rate whenever a specified
interest rate changes and which, at any time, can reasonably be expected to have
a market value that approximates its par value. The interest rate on a floating
rate bond may be adjusted automatically according to a stated prevailing market
rate, such as a bank's prime rate, the 91-day U.S. Treasury Bill rate, London
Interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") or some other standard. The instrument's rate
is adjusted automatically each time the base rate is adjusted. For floating rate
bonds, the coupon rate is usually reset each time interest is paid. A reset date
is any date on which the reset takes place based on the value of the index on
that date. The coupon rate is calculated as the reference rate plus a fixed
spread, which depends upon the issuer's credit quality and specifics of how the
instrument is structured. Floating rate bonds are frequently not rated by credit
rating agencies and must satisfy the same quality standards as commercial paper
investments. Floating rate bonds may be secured by bank letters of credit.
Generally, the changes in the interest rate on floating rate obligations reduce
the fluctuation in their market value. As interest rates decrease or increase,
the potential for capital appreciation or depreciation is less than that for
fixed-rate obligations of the same maturity.


Some floating rate obligations have a demand feature that allows a Variable
Rate Trust to tender the obligation to the issuer or a third party prior to its
maturity. The tender may be at par value plus accrued interest, according to
the terms of the obligations. Floating rate demand bonds that have a stated
maturity in excess of one year may have features that permit the holder to
recover the principal amount of the underlying security at specified intervals
not exceeding one year and upon no more than 30 days' notice. The issuer of
that type of bond normally has a corresponding right in its discretion, after a
given period, to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the bond plus
accrued interest. Generally the issuer must provide a specified number of days'
notice to the holder.


Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond
before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.


Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type of
bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par
value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par
value.


No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or any other government agency.



ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS





Except for a variable rate trust, the Estimated Current Return and the
Estimated Long-Term Return are set forth in the Prospectus Part I. Estimated
Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest
income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest
income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your Trust and
with the principal prepayment, default (if any), redemption, maturity, exchange
or sale of bonds. The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price
of the bonds. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated
Current Return will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is
calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines
and factors in the relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which
takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts)
and estimated retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses
and sales charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated
retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a Trust will change, and there may
be corporate developments with respect to bonds held by a BlackRock Trust, there
is no assurance that the present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in
the future. The Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are
expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return
reflects the estimated dates and amounts of principal returned on the bonds
while the Estimated Current Return calculation includes only net annual interest
income and Public Offering Price.


In order to calculate estimated returns of a GNMA Income Portfolio and the
estimated average life of the securities, an estimated prepayment rate for the
remaining term of the Trust's mortgage pool must be determined. Each of the
primary market makers in Ginnie Mae securities uses sophisticated computer
models to determine the estimated prepayment rate. These computer models take
into account a number of factors and assumptions including: actual prepayment
data reported by Ginnie Mae for recent periods on a particular pool, the impact
of aging on the prepayment of mortgage pools, the current interest rate
environment, the coupon, the housing environment, historical trends on Ginnie
Mae securities as a group, geographical factors and general economic trends. In
determining the estimated average life of the securities in your Trust, the
Sponsor has relied upon the median of the estimated prepayment rates determined
by primary market makers. No one can be certain that this estimate will prove
accurate or whether the estimated prepayment rates determined by other primary
market makers would have provided a better estimate. Any difference between the
estimate used and the actual prepayment rate will affect the Estimated
Long-Term Return of your Trust.



PUBLIC OFFERING





General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. The secondary
market Public Offering Price is based on the bid prices of the bonds, the sales
charge described below, cash, if any, in the Principal Account plus accrued
interest, if any. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may
differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs
in the calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units
purchased. The minimum purchase is one Unit. Certain broker-dealers or selling
firms may charge an order handling fee for processing Unit purchases.


The maximum secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the
following table based upon the estimated long-term return life in years ("ELTR
Life") of your Trust's portfolio:








ELTR Life (Years)                  Sales Charge
------------------------------------------------
Less than 2 .....................      1.50%
2 but less than 4 ...............      2.00
4 but less than 6 ...............      3.00
6 but less than 8 ...............      3.50
8 but less than 11 ..............      4.00
11 but less than 15 .............      4.50
15 and over .....................      4.80








The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above
table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market Public Offering
Price per Unit. For example, the maximum secondary market sales charge for a
Trust with an ELTR Life of "6 but less than 8" years would be 3.50% of the
Public Offering Price per Unit (3.630% of the aggregate bid price of the bonds).


Reducing Your Sales Charge. Employees, officers and directors (including
their spouses (or the equivalent if recognized under local law) and children or
step-children under 21 living in the same household, parents or step-parents
and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of
Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. and its affiliates and dealers and their
affiliates may purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the applicable
dealer concession. All employee discounts are subject to the policies of the
related selling firm. Only employees, officers and directors of companies that
allow their employees to participate in this employee discount program are
eligible for the discounts.


Offering Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The "Evaluation
Time" is the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that
the Exchange is open for regular trading or earlier on days where the Bond
Market Association recommends an early bond market close. Orders received by the
Trustee or Sponsor for purchases, sales or redemptions after that time, or on a
day when the New York Stock Exchange is closed, will be held until the next
determination of price. The secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit will
be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary
market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. For
secondary market purposes, this computation will be made by the Evaluator as of
the Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is tendered for redemption
and as necessary. The offering price of bonds may be expected to range
approximately from 0.125% to 1.375% more than the bid price.


The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of the
appropriate bid prices or offering prices, as described herein, (a) on the
basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily
deal in bonds comparable to those held by your Trust; (b) if these prices are
not available, on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds; (c)
by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the
practice of evaluation, quoting or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any
combination of the above. Market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate
with changes in market interest rates.


A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid by the bonds semi-annually, although your
Trust accrues interest daily. Because of this, your Trust always has an amount
of interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with
respect to purchases of Units in the secondary market, the proportionate share
of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering
Price of Units of Series other than those described in the following two
sections. You will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on your Units on
the next distribution date. Because of the varying interest payment dates of
the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the
amount of interest actually received by your Trust and distributed to
Unitholders. If a you sell or redeem all or a portion of your Units, you will
be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from
the purchaser of your Units.


Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by broker-dealers
and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest. The Sponsor
intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. Broker-dealers or
others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with the
distribution of Units equal to 80% of the sales charge applicable to the
transaction provided that the Units are acquired from the Sponsor. Certain
commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers on an agency
basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal to the
agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the banks.
Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or
agent. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency
commission to dealers and others up to the entire amount of the sales charge.


Sponsor Compensation. Broker-dealers will receive a gross sales commission
equal to the sales charge applicable to the transaction involved. See "Public
Offering--General". The Sponsor will receive from the broker-dealers the excess
of this gross sales commission over the amounts set forth in the previous
section.


In addition, the Sponsor may have realized a profit or loss, as a result of
the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the Sponsor and the cost
of the bonds to a Trust. The Sponsor or its affiliates may also have realized
profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the Sponsor from
underwriting syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has not
participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the
underwriting syndicates from which the bonds in a Trust were acquired. The
Sponsor may further realize profit or loss as a result of possible fluctuations
in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of
Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency commissions allowed, if any) will
be retained by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will also realize profits or losses in
the amount of any difference between the price at which Units are purchased and
the price at which Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary
market for Units and will also realize profits or losses resulting from a
redemption of repurchased Units at a price above or below the purchase price.


We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of a Trust and our
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities
designed to promote the sale of a Trust and our other products. Fees may include
payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection with
trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars of a
business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for your
Units.


Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to
maintain a market for Units and offer to purchase Units at prices, subject to
change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus
accrued interest and any principal cash on hand, less any amounts representing
taxes or other governmental charges payable out of your Trust and less any
accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of Units exceeds demand or if some other
business reason warrants it, the Sponsor may either discontinue all purchases of
Units or discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not
maintained and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will
be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at
the Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A
Unitholder who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to
current market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in
excess of the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will
notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid
in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per
Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.



RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS





Distributions of Interest and Principal. Unitholders who purchase Units in
the secondary market will receive distributions in accordance with the
election, if any, of the prior owner. Interest received by a Trust, pro rated
on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly unless the prior owner of your
Units elected to receive quarterly or semi-annual distributions. Certain Trusts
offer only monthly distribution options while others offer only monthly and
semi-annual distribution options. A Trust that has elected to be structured as
a "regulated investment company" for federal tax purposes may make additional
distributions at the end of each year.


Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee,
without interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the
Unitholder of record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be
distributed on each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the
preceding record date. All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. The
Trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or
Interest Account (but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits
from the use of these funds).


For a Trust with a Date of Deposit prior to April 23, 2009, funds in the
Principal Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to
Unitholders of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee
is not required to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the
amount available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.
However, should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account
equal or exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution
from the Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders
of record on the related monthly record date.


For a Trust with a Date of Deposit on or after April 23, 2009, should the
amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or exceed
$5.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a distribution from the Principal Account
on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record on the related
monthly record date. However, funds in the Principal Account will be
distributed on the last distribution date of each calendar year to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding record date if the amount available for
distribution shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.


Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, and, with respect only to a Variable Rate Trust, because
the floating rate bonds in a Variable Rate Trust will have varying interest
payment amounts over the life of a Variable Rate Trust, interest distributions
may be more or less than the amount credited to the Interest Account as of the
record date. For the purpose of minimizing fluctuations in interest
distributions, the Trustee is authorized to advance amounts necessary to provide
interest distributions of approximately equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed
for these advances from funds in the Interest Account on the next record date.
Persons who purchase Units between a record date and a distribution date will
receive their first distribution on the second distribution date after the
purchase, under the applicable plan of distribution.


Redemption of Units. All or a portion of your Units may be tendered to The
Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, for redemption at Unit Investment Trust
Division, 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, on any day
the New York Stock Exchange is open. No redemption fee will be charged by the
Sponsor or the Trustee, but you are responsible for applicable governmental
charges, if any. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be canceled. You may redeem
all or a portion of your Units by sending a request for redemption to your bank
or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. No later than three
business days following satisfactory tender, the Unitholder will receive an
amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed after
receipt by the Trustee of the tender of Units. The "date of tender" is deemed
to be the date on which Units are received by the Trustee, except that as
regards Units received after the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the next day on which that Exchange
is open and the Units will be deemed to have been tendered to the Trustee on
that day for redemption at the Redemption Price. Redemption requests received
by the Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption
requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until
after the time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the
next determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the
Trustee on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial
professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee
so they will be received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling
firms may charge an order handling fee for processing redemption requests.
Units redeemed directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.


Under IRS regulations, the Trustee is required to withhold a specified
percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not received the
Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such regulations. Any
amount withheld is transmitted to the IRS and may be recovered by the
Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal circumstances the Trustee
obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number from the selling broker.
However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender Units for redemption, the
Unitholder should provide a tax identification number to the Trustee in order
to avoid this possible "backup withholding".


The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds
as of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on
the date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the
Redemption Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The
Redemption Price per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of

(i) the cash on hand in a Trust or moneys in the process of being collected,

(ii) the value of the bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for
cases in which the value of insurance (if any) has been included, (iii) accrued
interest, less (a) amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges and

(b) the accrued Trust expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the
bonds by employing any of the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Offering
Price". Accrued interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the
Interest Account or, if the balance therein is insufficient, from the Principal
Account. All other amounts will be withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units
so redeemed shall be cancelled.


The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented
by the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When
bonds are sold, the size and diversity of your Trust will be reduced. Sales may
be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result
in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full
or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.


In addition, with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series
119 and subsequent series, the Trustee reserves the right to satisfy any
redemption of 1,000 or more Units with an aggregate redemption price of
$1,000,000 or more in an in kind distribution of bonds. An in kind distribution
of bonds will be made by the Trustee through the distribution of each of the
bonds in the Trust in book-entry form to the account of the Unitholder's
broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company. Amounts representing fractional
portions of a bond will be distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the
bonds included in a Unitholder's in kind distribution to facilitate the
distribution of whole bonds. Special tax consequences will result if a
Unitholder receives an in kind distribution. See "Tax Status".


Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Invesco
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your financial
professional for more information about trusts currently available for
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time. The exchange will
generally be treated as a sale and a taxable transaction for federal and state
income tax purposes.


Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form only and will not
be evidenced by certificates. Units purchased or held through your bank or
broker-dealer will be recorded in book-entry form and credited to the account
of your bank or broker-dealer at the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Units
are transferable by contacting your bank or broker-dealer through which you
hold your Units. Transfer, and the requirements therefore, will be governed by
the applicable procedures of DTC and your agreement with the DTC participant in
whose name your Units are registered on the transfer records of DTC.


Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and other
receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems it to
be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of your Trust will be
audited annually by an independent registered public accounting firm and the
report of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within
a reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will
furnish to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a
statement describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual
Trust distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust
information. Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the
bonds upon request to the Trustee. If you have any questions regarding your
account or your Trust, please contact your financial adviser or the Trustee.
The Sponsor does not have access to individual account information.



INSURANCE ON THE BONDS





Insurance may have been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of some or all of the bonds in your Trust. The
premium for any Preinsured Bond Insurance has been paid by the issuer, by a
prior owner of the bonds and any policy is non-cancelable and will continue in
force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the Preinsured Bond
Insurer remains in business. More detailed information regarding insurance on
the bonds and the Preinsured Bond Insurer is included in the Information
Supplement. See "Additional Information".



TRUST ADMINISTRATION





Sponsor. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The
Sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco Advisers, Inc. ("Invesco
Advisers"). Invesco Advisers is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco
Ltd., a leading independent global investment manager that provides a wide range
of investment strategies and vehicles to its retail, institutional and high net
worth clients around the globe. The Sponsor's principal office is located at 11
Greenway Plaza, Houston, Texas 77046-1173. As of March 31, 2016, the total

provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the
Trust Agreement.


Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor,
Brooklyn, New York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. If you have questions
regarding your account or your Trust, please contact the Trustee at its
principal unit investment trust division offices or your financial adviser. The
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information. The Bank of New
York Mellon is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of
Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional information regarding the
Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement, including the Trustee's
qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the effect of a merger
involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and replace the
Trustee. See "Additional Information".


Portfolio Administration. Your Trust is not a managed fund and, except as
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited
situations to protect your Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited
circumstances, the Trustee will generally reject (and must reject with respect
to any Trust with a date of deposit on or before August 2, 2006) any offer by an
issuer to issue bonds in exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a
refunding or refinancing plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of
any exchange or substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more
detailed description of circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced.
See "Additional Information".


If a Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which,
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for
inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also instruct the
Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust continues to
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and to avoid
imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.


Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must

(i) be long-term, within a 10 to 20 year maturity range, intermediate term or
short-term (as applicable) corporate or taxable municipal bonds, debentures,
notes or other straight debt obligations (whether secured or unsecured and
whether senior or subordinated) without equity or other conversion features,
with fixed maturity dates substantially the same as those of the Failed Bonds
having no warrants or subscription privileges attached; (ii) be payable in
United States currency; (iii) not be when, as and if issued obligations or
restricted securities; (iv) be issued after July 18, 1984 if the interest is
United States source income; (v) be issued or guaranteed by an issuer subject to
or exempt from the reporting requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or similar provisions of law) or guaranteed,
directly or indirectly, by means of a lease agreement, agreement to buy
securities, services or products, or other similar commitment of the credit of
such an issuer to the payment of the substitute bonds; (vi) maintain the
applicable Trust and a ratings; and (vii) be insured by a Preinsured Bond
Insurer an Insured Trust. With respect to a GNMA Income Portfolio, the
Replacement Securities must (i) be mortgage-backed securities of the modified
pass-through type issued by the Government National Mortgage Association which
maintain as far as practicable the original percentage relationship between the
principal amounts of Securities of specified interest rates and ranges of
maturity in the Trust, and (ii) not be "when, as and if issued" obligations or
restricted securities. The Trustee shall notify all Unitholders of a Trust
within five days after the acquisition of a Replacement Bond and shall make a
pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost of the Failed
Bond exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued interest. If Failed
Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales charge attributable to
the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of the Trust and distribute the principal
and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed Bonds to the date of
removal from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds within 30 days after
removal. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated Net Annual Interest
Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current Return and Estimated
Long-Term Return (if applicable) might be lowered. Unitholders may not be able
to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in excess
of the yield of the Failed Bonds.


Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the Trust
Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision which may
be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the
Sponsor and the Trustee) or maintain the tax status of a Trust. The Trust
Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units or to permit the
acquisition of bonds in addition to or in substitution for any of the bonds
initially deposited in a Trust, except for the substitution of certain refunding
bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of any amendment.


Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
maturity, prepayment, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the
Trust. A Trust may also be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of
51% of the Units then outstanding (or with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts,
Taxable Income Series 119 and subsequent series, by consent of Unitholders of
75% of the Units then outstanding, and with respect to a GNMA Income Portfolio,
by consent of Unitholders of 66 2 / 3% of the Units then outstanding) or by the
Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% (or with respect to a GNMA
Income Portfolio less than 40%) of the original principal amount of bonds. A
Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient number of
Units of the Trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to
less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time they were deposited in
the Trust. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder of any termination within a
reasonable time and will then liquidate any remaining bonds. The sale of bonds
upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized
if the sale was not required at that time. For this reason, among others, the
amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination may be less than the principal
amount of bonds per Unit or value at the time of purchase. The Trustee will
distribute to each Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and
Principal Accounts after deduction of costs, expenses or indemnities. The
Unitholder will receive a final distribution statement with this distribution.
When the Trustee in its sole discretion determines that any amounts held in
reserve are no longer necessary, it will distribute these amounts to
Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains further information regarding
termination of a Trust. See "Additional Information".


Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Evaluator, Supervisor and Trustee
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of
any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any
action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not
liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by
the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information
available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor, Supervisor or Unitholders for errors in
judgment.



FEDERAL TAX STATUS






Grantor Trusts



This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of a Trust which has been structured to be taxed as
a grantor trust for federal tax purposes. Please see "Notes to Financial
Statements" in Prospectus Part I. Tax laws and interpretations change
frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to
all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do not describe your
situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a
tax-exempt entity, or other investor with special circumstances. In addition,
this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences of
an investment in a Trust.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. The
Trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its
compliance and reporting obligations.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Assets of the Trust. Each Trust is expected to hold various debt obligations
(the "Debt Obligations") that are treated as debt for federal income tax
purposes. It is possible that the Trust will also hold other assets, including
assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences
different from or in addition to those described in this section. All of the
assets held by the Trust constitute the "Trust Assets." Neither our counsel nor
we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.


Trust Status. If the Trust is at all times operated in accordance with the
documents establishing the Trust and certain requirements of federal income tax
law are met, the Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income
tax purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., interest, accruals of original issue
discount and market discount, and capital gains, if any) from each Trust Asset
when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly
owned the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect to have your
distributions reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income from
Trust Assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is
not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or Trust expenses.


Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss Upon Disposition. If your Trust disposes
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of
your Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize
gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract
your adjusted tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the
total amount received in the transaction. You can generally determine your
initial tax basis in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units,
including sales charges, among the Trust Assets ratably according to their
values on the date you acquire your Units. In certain circumstances, however,
you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your Units (for
example, in the case of accruals of original issue discount, market discount,
premium and accrued interest, as discussed below).


Dividends and net capital gains are subject to a 3.8% federal tax on net
investment income for taxpayers at higher income levels.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as
for ordinary income.


Dividends Received Deduction. Because the Debt Obligations are treated as
debt (not equity) for federal income tax purposes, distributions from the Debt
Obligations are not eligible for the dividends received deduction.


Discount, Accrued Interest and Premium on Debt Obligations. Some Debt
Obligations may have been issued with original issue discount. This generally
means that the Debt Obligations were originally issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. Original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and
generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes. Your
basis of each Debt Obligation that was issued with original issue discount must
be increased as original issue discount accrues.


Some of the Debt Obligations may give their issuers a right to defer
payments on the Debt Obligations. Such Debt Obligations are subject to special
treatment under the original issue discount rules. Among other things, this
treatment may result in you being required to recognize income for federal
income tax purposes in a particular year with respect to a Debt Obligation even
though the actual cash payments on the Debt Obligation have been deferred to a
later year.


Some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
market discount. Market discount is generally the excess of the stated
redemption price at maturity for the Debt Obligation over the purchase price of
the Debt Obligation. Market discount can arise based on the price your Trust
pays for a Debt Obligation or based on the price you pay for your Units. Market
discount is taxed as ordinary income. You will recognize this income when your
Trust receives principal payments on the Debt Obligation, when the Debt
Obligation is disposed of or redeemed, or when you sell or redeem your Units.
Alternatively, you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it
accrues. Whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate
your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions.


Some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
premium. Generally, if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any Debt
Obligation, generally including sales charges, exceeds the amount payable at
maturity, such excess is considered premium. You may elect to amortize premium.
If you make this election, you may reduce your interest income received on the
Debt Obligation by the amount of the premium that is amortized and your tax
basis will be reduced.


If the price of your Units includes accrued interest on a Debt Obligation,
you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that Debt
Obligation. When your Trust receives this accrued interest, you must treat it
as a return of capital and reduce your tax basis in the Debt Obligation.


This discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax
treatment of original issue discount, market discount and premium. The rules,
however, are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances. For
example, the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the
discussion set forth above in the case of Debt Obligations that were issued
with original issue discount.


Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over
into a future Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust, it is considered a sale
for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as
capital gain and, in general, any loss will be treated as capital loss.
However, any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your Units of
your Trust for units of the next series will generally be disallowed with
respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the
two trusts have substantially identical Trust Assets under the wash sale
provisions of the Code.


In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Trust Assets when you
redeem your Units. For an in kind distribution, you will receive Trust Assets
plus, possibly, cash. You will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive
whole Trust Assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata
portion of the same Trust Assets held by your Trust. However, if you also
receive cash in exchange for a Trust Asset or a fractional portion of a Trust
Asset, you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference
between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such Trust Asset
or fractional portion.


Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of
your Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses.
You may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your Trust to the
same extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to treat
some or all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.


Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including
withholding taxes, on some of the income from your Trust or gain from the sale
or redemption of your Units, provided that certain conditions are met. You
should consult your tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in
order to be exempt for U.S. tax purposes. You should also consult your tax
advisor with respect to other U.S. tax withholding and reporting requirements.


Foreign Taxes. Some distributions by your Trust may be subject to foreign
withholding taxes. Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you.
Under the grantor trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your
share of any foreign taxes that are paid. Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you
may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.


The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA"). A 30% withholding tax on
your Trust's distributions, including capital gains distributions, and on gross
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Units generally applies if paid
to a foreign entity unless: (i) if the foreign entity is a "foreign financial
institution" as defined under FATCA, the foreign entity undertakes certain due
diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the
foreign entity is not a "foreign financial institution," it identifies certain
of its U.S. investors or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under
FATCA. If required under the rules above and subject to the applicability of any
intergovernmental agreements between the United States and the relevant foreign
country, withholding under FATCA applies: (i) with respect to distributions from
your Trust and (ii) with respect to certain capital gains distributions and
gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of Units that occur on or after
January 1, 2019. If withholding is required under FATCA on a payment related to
your Units, investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding (or
that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such
payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to
obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. Your Trust will not pay any
additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under FATCA. You should
consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of FATCA based on your individual
circumstances.


New York Tax Status. Under the existing income tax laws of the State and City
of New York, your Trust will not be taxed as a corporation, subject to the New
York State franchise tax and the New York City general corporation tax, and the
income of your Trust will pass through to the Unitholders in the same manner as
for federal income tax purposes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding
potential federal, foreign, state or local taxation with respect to your Units
based on your individual circumstances.


Investors in the Trust may be subject to federal, state, local, or foreign
taxes in connection with their investment in the Trust. Investors are encouraged
to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal, state, local,
and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of an investment
in the Trust.



Regulated Investment Companies



This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of a Trust that has elected to be taxed as a
regulated investment company for federal tax purposes. Please see "Notes to
Financial Statements" in Prospectus Part I. This section is current as of the
date of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and
these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.
For example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are
a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a tax-exempt entity, or other
investor with special circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe
your state, local or foreign tax consequences of an investment in a Trust.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. The
Trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its
compliance and reporting obligations.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Trust Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually as
"regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. If a Trust
qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as
provided in the tax law, the Trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.


Distributions. After the end of each year, you will receive a tax statement
that specifies your amount of exempt-interest dividends, ordinary income
distributions and capital gains dividends. Exempt-interest dividends generally
are excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes. Some or all
of the exempt-interest dividends, however, may be taken into account in
determining your alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences
(e.g., they may affect the amount of your social security benefits that are
taxed). Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your federal tax
rate for ordinary income. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends
as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares. In
addition, the Trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital
for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you. The tax status
of your distributions from your Trust is not affected by whether you reinvest
your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash. The income from
your Trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is
not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws
may require you to treat distributions made to you in January as if you had
received them on December 31 of the previous year.


A distribution paid by your Trust reduces the Trust's net asset value per
Unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution. Accordingly, a
distribution paid shortly after a purchase of Units by a Unitholder would be
subject to income tax even though it may be viewed, in substance, as a partial
return on capital.


Dividends Received Deduction and Qualified Dividend Income. A corporation
that owns Units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received
deduction with respect to dividends received from the Trust because the
dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from
regulated investment companies that do not invest in stock. An individual who
owns Units generally will not be entitled to treat Trust distributions as
qualified dividend income currently taxed at long-term capital gains rates as
it is not expected that Trust distributions will be attributable to qualified
dividend income received by the Trust.


Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain
or loss, you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your Units from the amount
you receive in the transaction. Your initial tax basis in your Units is
generally equal to the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges. In
some cases, however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase
your Units. Further, if you hold your Units for six months or less, any loss
incurred by you related to the disposition of such a Unit will be disallowed to
the extent of the exempt-interest dividends you received, if any.



Capital Gains and Losses.



Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a
capital gain dividend from your Trust and sell your Unit at a loss after holding
it for six months or less, the loss will be disallowed to the extent of the
exempt-interest dividends you received. To the extent, if any, it is not
disallowed, it will be recharacterized as long-term capital loss to the extent
of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates for capital gains realized
from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary
income.


There is no requirement that tax consequences be taken into account in
administering your Trust.


Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over
into a future invesco-sponsored unit investment trust, the exchange would
generally be considered a sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax
purposes. In general, any gain on the sale will be treated as capital gain and
any loss will be treated as capital loss. However, any loss realized on a sale
or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that Units disposed of are replaced
(including through reinvestment of dividends) within a period of 61 days
beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of Units or to
the extent that the Unitholder, during such period, acquires or enters into an
option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities. In
such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the
disallowed loss.


In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Trust Assets when you
redeem your Units. This distribution will be treated as a sale for federal
income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss, generally
based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash
received, and subject to certain limitations on the deductibility of losses
under the tax rules.


Foreign Tax Credit. If your Trust invests in any foreign securities, the tax
statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your Trust
paid to other countries. In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your
share of the taxes your Trust paid to other countries. However, it is not
expected that any such Trust investing in foreign securities will be eligible to
pass through to investors any credits or deductions against U.S. federal income
tax with respect to such foreign taxes paid.


Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax
treaties, distributions from the Trust will be characterized as dividends for
federal income tax purposes (other than dividends which the Trust reports as
capital gain dividends) and will generally be subject to U.S. income taxes,
including withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions. However
distributions received by a foreign investor from the Trust that are properly
reported by the Trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S.
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the Trust
makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met. The amount of
distributions that may be reported as interest-related dividends will be
limited to the amount of qualified net interest income, which is generally the
Trust's U.S.-source interest income less allocable expenses.


Backup Withholding. By law, your Trust must withhold as backup withholding a
percentage of your taxable distributions and redemption proceeds if you do not
provide your correct social security or taxpayer identification number and
certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or if the IRS instructs
your Trust to do so.


Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, expenses incurred by your Trust
will be deducted from the gross income received by your Trust and only your
share of the Trust's net taxable income, if any, will be paid to you and
reported as taxable income to you. However, if the Units of your Trust are held
by fewer than 500 Unitholders at any time during a taxable year, your Trust
will generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income, thus
resulting in your reported share of your Trust's taxable income being increased
by your share of those expenses, even though you do not receive a corresponding
cash distribution. In this case you may be able to take a deduction for these
expenses; however, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as
investment expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all
of these deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income. Such
deductions may be subject to limitation for taxpayers whose income exceeds
certain levels.


Investors in the Trust may be subject to federal, state, local, or foreign
taxes in connection with their investment in the Trust. Investors are
encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal,
state, local, and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of
an investment in the Trust.


The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA"). A 30% withholding tax on
your Trust's distributions, including capital gains distributions, and on gross
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Units generally applies if paid
to a foreign entity unless: (i) if the foreign entity is a "foreign financial
institution" as defined under FATCA, the foreign entity undertakes certain due
diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the
foreign entity is not a "foreign financial institution," it identifies certain
of its U.S. investors or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under
FATCA. If required under the rules above and subject to the applicability of any
intergovernmental agreements between the United States and the relevant foreign
country, withholding under FATCA applies: (i) with respect to distributions from
your Trust and (ii) with respect to certain capital gains distributions and
gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of Units that occur on or after
January 1, 2019. If withholding is required under FATCA on a payment related to
your Units, investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding (or
that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such
payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to
obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. Your Trust will not pay any
additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under FATCA. You should
consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of FATCA based on your individual
circumstances.





EXPENSES





General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account and,
to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation, printing
and execution of the Trust Agreement, legal and accounting expenses, advertising
and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial evaluation fees and other
out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor at no cost to the Trusts.


Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Invesco unit investment trusts will not exceed the total
cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will receive
the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's portfolio. For its
services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be reduced as described
therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its services is expected to
result from the use of the funds being held in the Principal and Interest
Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions since
these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders. These fees are based on
the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on the Date of Deposit for
the first year and as of the close of business on January 1 for each year
thereafter. The Sponsor's, Supervisor's, Evaluator's and Trustee's fees may be
increased without approval of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding
proportionate increases under the category "Services Less Rent of Shelter" in
the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers or, if this category is not
published, in a comparable category.


Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b)
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any special
custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds in a
Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of
the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for advancing funds
to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may be adjusted
periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest rates). A
BlackRock Trust will pay a license fee to BlackRock Financial Management, Inc.
for use of certain trademarks and other property. Each Trust will pay the costs
associated with updating its registration statement each year. The fees and
expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts. When such fees and
expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are secured by a lien on the
portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in the Interest and Principal
Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts payable by a Trust, the Trustee
has the power to sell bonds to pay such amounts.

Risk Factors



The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. Neither the Sponsor
nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect
in any of the bonds.


Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. Certain Trusts may
invest significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell
consumer products. The profitability of these companies will be affected by
various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending
trends. In the past, there have been major changes in the retail environment due
to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in
the retail industry, particularly the department store segment. The continued
viability of the retail industry will depend on the industry's ability to adapt
and to compete in changing economic and social conditions, to attract and retain
capable management, and to finance expansion. Weakness in the banking or real
estate industry, a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in
employment growth, less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked
deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in
significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely
affecting consumer spending habits. In addition, competitiveness of the retail
industry will require large capital outlays for investment in the installation
of automated checkout equipment to control inventory, to track the sale of
individual items and to gauge the success of sales campaigns. Changes in
demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and the success
of, consumer products and services in the marketplace. Increasing employee and
retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry. In many
sectors of the retail industry, competition may be fierce due to market
saturation, converging consumer tastes and other factors. Because of these
factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries,
American retailers are now entering global markets which entail added risks such
as sudden weakening of foreign economies, difficulty in adapting to local
conditions and constraints and added research costs.


Financial Services Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by companies within the bank and financial services sector.


The effects of the sub-prime mortgage crisis that began to unfold in 2007
continue to manifest in nearly all the sub-divisions of the financial services
industry. Sub-prime mortgage related losses and write downs among investment
banks and similar institutions reached significant levels in 2008. The impact of
these losses among traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and
insurers has forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation
or combination, while drastically increasing the credit risk, and possibility of
default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles. Many of
the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance
their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital. In
some cases, the U.S. government has acted to bail out or provide support to
select institutions, however the risk of default by such issuers has nonetheless
increased substantially.


While the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve Board and
Congress have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with
financial institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated
with investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result
of these steps.


Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly
dependent on net interest margin. Bank profitability is largely dependent on the
availability and cost of capital funds, and can fluctuate significantly when
interest rates change or due to increased competition. As initial home
purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest
rates and other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in the real
estate markets have deteriorated and have had a substantial negative effect upon
banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans
secured by real estate. Banks and their holding companies are subject to
extensive federal regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to
state regulation as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements
and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may
pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in
connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may
substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if
deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the
safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as
increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases
in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings
and the ability of a company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of
deposits nor governmental regulations, however, insures the solvency or
profitability of banks or their holding companies, or insures against any risk
of investment in the securities issued by such institutions.


The statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks
and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone
substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes are
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act;
enacted in August 1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. Many of the
regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized
and their impact on the business, financial condition and prospects of the
securities in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act financial-services overhaul legislation allows banks,
securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors.
This legislation has resulted in increased merger activity and heightened
competition among existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to
liberalize interstate banking has been signed into law in recent years, allowing
banks to be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state. Since
mid-1997, banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches.
Consolidation is likely to continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") and the Financial Accounting Standards Board require the expanded use of
market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market
accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for
sale. Adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in
the reported health of the industry, and mandated regulatory intervention to
correct such problems. Additional legislative and regulatory changes may be
forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory authorities have proposed
substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws,
rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as to the effect, if any,
that such changes would have on the bonds in the Trust's portfolio. In addition,
from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by Congress and
federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that system could, among other
things, further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks
or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor.
Such reforms could reduce profitability, as investment opportunities available
to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings
vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face significant competition from other
financial institutions such as mutual funds, credit unions, mortgage banking
companies and insurance companies, and increased competition may result from
legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers. Among
other benefits, such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to
acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their
various bank subsidiaries into one unit. Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter
makes any prediction as to what, if any, manner of bank regulatory actions might
ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the
Trust's portfolio.


The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve,
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.


The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view
that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay
cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in
ways that would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also
may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its
approval of certain applications, including applications for approval of
mergers and acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any
prediction as to the effect, if any, such laws will have on the bonds or
whether such approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.


Companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the
adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and competition
from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes in the direction
of the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level
and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could
adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the prices of the
securities, of these companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including
increased competition with new and existing competitors, the ongoing
commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital
expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of
companies in the investment management and brokerage industries. Companies
involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive
regulation by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and
changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the interpretation of such laws,
regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management
company profits, including but not limited to interest rate movements, the
imposition of premium rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in
given underwritings, competition and pressure to compete globally, weather
catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual
companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the
inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject
to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate
levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy
sales, tax obligations and profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology
and the pressure to compete globally.


In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors,
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:


o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;


o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be
expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;


o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;


o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;


o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;


o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and


o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.


The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come under
increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have considered or
enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. Further, the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and state insurance regulators
are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on
insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new
laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the
condition of the insurance industry in the United States to determine whether to
promulgate additional federal regulation. The Sponsor is unable to predict
whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or
scope of regulation of the insurance industry, or what effect, if any, such
legislation would have on the industry.


All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some
instances, would require divestiture.


Health Care Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
companies within the health care sector. Health care companies involved in
advanced medical devices and instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care,
hospital management/health services and medical supplies have potential risks
unique to their sector of the health care field. These companies are subject to
governmental regulation of their products and services, a factor which could
have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability
of such products or services. Furthermore, such companies face the risk of
increasing competition from new products or services, generic drug sales,
termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the
risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete. The
research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and
include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product
will ever come to market. Many of these companies may have losses and not offer
certain products for several years. Such companies may also have persistent
losses during a new product's transition from development to production, and
revenue patterns may be erratic. The goods and services of health care issuers
are also subject to risks of product liability litigation.


Health care facility operators may be affected by events and conditions
including, among other things, demand for services, the ability of the facility
to provide the services required, physicians' confidence in the facility,
management capabilities, competition with other hospitals, efforts by insurers
and governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing state
rate-setting agencies, expenses, government regulation, the cost and possible
unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of
governmental financial assistance, including that associated with Medicare,
Medicaid and other similar third-party payor programs.


Legislative proposals concerning health care are proposed in Congress from
time to time. These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription
drugs), national health insurance, incentives for competition in the provision
of health care services, tax incentives and penalties related to health care
insurance premiums and promotion of pre-paid health care plans. The government
could also reduce funding for health care related research. The Sponsor is
unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if enacted, on the
issuers of Securities in your Trust.


Industrials Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
industrials companies. General risks of industrials companies include the
general state of the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and
international politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. In
addition, capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall
capital spending levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in
modernization, limitations on supply of key materials, labor relations,
government regulations, government contracts and ecommerce initiatives.
Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or
retain government contracts, labor disputes or changes in government budget
priorities, changes in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable
business travel. The number of housing starts, levels of public and
non-residential construction including weakening demand for new office and
retail space, and overall construction spending may adversely affect
construction equipment manufacturers.


Technology Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
issuers within the technology industry which includes information technology
companies. Your Trust, and therefore Unitholders, may be particularly
susceptible to a negative impact resulting from adverse market conditions or
other factors affecting technology issuers because any negative impact on the
technology industry will not be diversified among issuers within other
unrelated industries. Accordingly, an investment in Units should be made with
an understanding of the characteristics of the information technology industry
and the risks which such an investment may entail.


Technology companies generally include companies involved in the
development, design, manufacture and sale of computers, computer related
equipment, computer networks, communications systems, telecommunications
products, electronic products, and other related products, systems and
services. The market for technology products and services, especially those
specifically related to the Internet, is characterized by rapidly changing
technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving
industry standards and frequent new product introductions. The success of the
issuers of the Securities depends in substantial part on the timely and
successful introduction of new products. An unexpected change in one or more of
the technologies affecting an issuer's products or in the market for products
based on a particular technology could have a material adverse affect on an
issuer's operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the
issuers of the Securities will be able to respond timely to compete in the
rapidly developing marketplace.


The market for certain technology products and services may have only
recently begun to develop, is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an
increasing number of market entrants. Additionally, certain technology
companies may have only recently commenced operations or offered securities to
the public. Such companies are in the early stage of development and have a
limited operating history on which to analyze future operating results. It is
important to note that following its initial public offering a security is
likely to experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that upon redemption of Units or
termination of a Trust a Unitholder will receive an amount greater than or
equal to the Unitholder's initial investment.


Based on trading history, factors such as announcements of new products or
development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have
caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to
fluctuate substantially. Market volatility may adversely affect the market price
of the Securities and therefore the ability of a Unitholder to redeem units, or
roll over Units into a new trust, at a price equal to or greater than the
original price paid for such Units.


Some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently
available only from single sources. There can be no assurance that in the future
suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and cost
effective manner. Accordingly, an issuer's operating results and customer
relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for, or
and interruption or reduction in supply of, any key components. Additionally,
many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base
consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product
vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards.
Any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or
reduction of sales. Because many products and technologies are incorporated into
other related products, certain companies are often highly dependent on the
performance of other computer, electronics and communications companies. There
can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that
an issuer of Securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders
form other customers. Similarly, the success of certain companies is tied to a
relatively small concentration of products or technologies with intense
competition between companies. Accordingly, a decline in demand of such
products, technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse
impact on issuers of the Securities.


Telecommunications Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by telecommunications companies. The telecommunications industry is
subject to governmental regulation, and the products and services of
telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence. These
factors could affect the value of Units. Telephone companies in the United
States, for example, are subject to both state and federal regulations
affecting permitted rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be
offered. Certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in
fierce competition for a share of the market of their products. As a result,
competitive pressures are intense and the values of telecommunications company
securities are subject to rapid price volatility.


Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have
illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies.
High debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the
1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt and stock prices to trade
at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the
cost of capital for needed additional investment. At the same time, demand for
some telecommunications services has fallen sharply, as several key markets
have become oversaturated, some local customers have switched to substitute
providers and technologies, and corporate profits and the economy generally
remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies may have to commit
substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new products and
services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have been
compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing, consolidating
and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines.
Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also faced
scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased
substantially and may continue to rise.


While a portfolio may concentrate on the securities of established suppliers
of traditional telecommunication products and services, a Trust may also invest
in bonds of smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the
development of new products and services. These smaller companies may present
greater opportunities for capital appreciation, and may also involve greater
risk than large, established issuers. Such smaller companies may have limited
product lines, market or financial resources, and their securities may trade
less frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger, more
established companies. As a result, the prices of the securities of such
smaller companies may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of
securities of other issuers.


In addition, recent federal legislation governing the United States
telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional
interpretation, which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are
held by a Trust.


Utility and Energy Issuers. Because certain Trusts may invest significantly
in bonds issued by public utility and energy companies, an investment in Units
of certain Trusts should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of
the public utility and energy industries and the risks which such an investment
may entail. General problems of the public utility and energy industries include
the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on invested capital despite
frequent increases in rates which have been granted by the public service
commissions having jurisdiction, the difficulty in financing large construction
programs during an inflationary period, the restrictions on operations and
increased cost and delays attributable to environmental, nuclear safety and
other regulatory considerations, the difficulty of the capital markets absorbing
utility debt and equity securities, the difficulty in obtaining fuel for
electric generation at reasonable prices, regulatory restrictions on the ability
to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer,
and the effects of energy conservation. There is no assurance that public
service commissions will grant rate increases in the future or that any such
increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating and other expenses and
debt service requirements. All of the public utilities which are issuers of
securities in certain Trusts have been experiencing many of these problems in
varying degrees. Furthermore, utility and energy stocks are particularly
susceptible to interest rate risk, generally exhibiting an inverse relationship
to interest rates. As a result, electric utility stock prices may be adversely
affected as interest rates rise. Similarly, the success of certain companies is
tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with
intense competition between companies. There can be no assurance that these
customers will place additional orders, or that an issuer of Securities will
obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other customers.
Accordingly, a decline in demand of such products, technologies or from such
customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of securities in
certain Trusts.


Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, for example, establish the rates which may be charged and
the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base, which must be
approved by the state commissions. Certain utilities have had difficulty from
time to time in persuading regulators, who are subject to political pressures,
to grant rate increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment.
Any unexpected limitations could negatively affect the profitability of
utilities whose budgets are planned far in advance. In addition, gas pipeline
and distribution companies have had difficulties in adjusting to short and
surplus energy supplies, enforcing or being required to comply with long-term
contracts and avoiding litigation with their customers, on the one hand, or
suppliers, on the other.


Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in
recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial
companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been
permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic
regions and their traditional lines of business. These opportunities may permit
certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates
of return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend their core business
and may be less profitable.


Certain of the issuers of securities in certain Trusts may own or operate
nuclear generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time
review existing, and impose additional, requirements governing the licensing,
construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Nuclear generating projects
in the electric utility industry have experienced substantial cost increases,
construction delays and licensing difficulties. These have been caused by
various factors, including inflation, high financing costs, required design
changes and rework, allegedly faulty construction, objections by groups and
governmental officials, limits on the ability to finance, reduced forecasts of
energy requirements and economic conditions. This experience indicates that the
risk of significant cost increases, delays and licensing difficulties remain
present until completion and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear
project. Also, nuclear generating units in service have experienced unplanned
outages or extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new
regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining
regulatory approval to return to service. A major accident at a nuclear plant
anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation,
construction or licensing of nuclear units.


In view of the uncertainties discussed above, there can be no assurance that
any utility company's share of the full cost of nuclear units under construction
ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a company could
earn an adequate return on its investment in such units. The likelihood of a
significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of concern described
above varies, as does the potential severity of any adverse impact. It should be
recognized, however, that one or more of such adverse events could occur and
individually or collectively could have a material adverse impact on a company's
financial condition, the results of its operations, its ability to make interest
and principal payments on its outstanding debt or to pay dividends.


Other general problems of the electric, gas and water utility industries
(including state and local joint action power agencies) include rising costs of
rail transportation to transport fossil fuels, the uncertainty of transmission
service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions, changes in tax
laws which adversely affect a utility's ability to operate profitably,
increased competition in service costs, recent reductions in estimates of
future demand for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country,
restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to
environmental considerations, uncertain availability and increased cost of
capital, unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices,
including the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with
conversion to alternate fuel sources such as coal, availability and cost of
natural gas for resale, technical and cost factors and other problems
associated with construction, licensing, regulation and operation of nuclear
facilities for electric generation, including, among other considerations, the
problems associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of
radioactive wastes, and the effects of energy and environmental conservation
efforts. Each of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of
the issuers of any utility and energy bonds to make dividend payments and the
value of such issues on redemption of your Units.


Taxable Municipal Issues. Certain bonds in a Trust may consist of taxable
obligations of municipal issuers. Obligations of municipal issuers can be either
general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power
of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or
authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes.


General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.


Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.


Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.


Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.


Build America Bonds were issued pursuant to The American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act"), authorizing states and local
governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy for
a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by the
Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") in an amount equal
to 35 percent of the total coupon interest payable to investors (45 percent for
those Build America Bonds that qualify and are designated as Recovery Zone
Economic Development Bonds).


The Recovery Act adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, (the "Code") which authorizes Build America Bonds that meet the
definition of "qualified bonds", as described below, to receive the refundable
credit. The Code section defines the term "qualified bond" to mean a Build
America Bond (a) issued before January 1, 2011, (b) with 100 percent of the
excess of (i) the available project proceeds (as defined to mean sale proceeds
of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay
issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon), over (ii) the amounts in a
reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue, are to be used for
capital expenditures, and (c) where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to
have this subsection of the Code apply.


Should a Build America Bond issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, it is
possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments,
impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments. In
addition, Build America Bonds are often subject to extraordinary redemption in
the event that changes to Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as added by the
Recovery Act) or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the
federal cash subsidy payment for a portion of a Build America Bond issuer's
borrowing costs.


Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and
Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (collectively, "Qualified Bonds") are taxable
bonds that are similar to certain Build America Bonds, in that state and
municipal Qualified Bond issuers may elect to receive direct interest-subsidy
payments from the U.S. Treasury if certain conditions are met. The Hiring
Incentives to Restore Employment Act, enacted into federal law on March 18,
2010, permits issuers of Qualified Bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond
interest payments.


Qualified School Construction Bonds, issued pursuant to provisions in the
Recovery Act, are issued to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or repair
of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a
bond-financed facility will be constructed. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds
and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds are both issued pursuant to the "Energy
Improvement and Extension Act of 2008", and like Qualified School Construction
Bonds, are governed by Section 54A of the Code. Qualified Energy Conservation
Bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes, and Clean
Renewable Energy Bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy
facilities that produce electricity. Although the year of issuance is not
restricted for Qualified Bonds, federal law provides for limits on the dollar
amounts that may be issued for these bond types.


Federal legislation has amended the Code in recent years to provide for
certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of Qualified Bonds, and
to include such bonds under the definition of "qualified tax credit bond" as
found in Section 54A of the Code. Eligible issuers of Qualified School
Construction Bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to 100% of the lesser of
the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal
tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S. Treasury. Eligible issuers of Qualified
Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may receive subsidy
payments equal to 70% of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or
the tax credit rate for municipal tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S.
Treasury.


Should the issuer of a Qualified Bond fail continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed on any such bond by the Code or other federal laws, it
is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments,
impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments or even
causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds. As provided in Section
54A of the Code, Qualified Bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any
portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after
three years from the date of issuance. This mandatory redemption must be
completed within 90 days after such three-year period, unless an extension is
granted by the Treasury. Additionally, Qualified Bonds may be subject to
extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the
Code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash
subsidy payment for any Qualified Bond issuer's borrowing costs.


Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting
appropriations for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate
future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments
typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their
budgets. If a government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient
funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.


Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments
on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for
services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the
need to reduce costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and
claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).


Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number
of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and
government legislation or regulation.


Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or
other regulatory restrictions.


Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.


Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general
risks.


Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use
of the facility.


Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education
financing.


Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates
and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.


Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.


Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds,
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.


Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends
on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air,
rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation
modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of
issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.


Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect
operation of a project.


Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal
issuers.


Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand
for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government
regulation and rate approvals.


Zero Coupon Bonds. Certain of the bonds in a Trust may be "zero coupon"
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such
income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount
bond, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at
higher rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to
substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market
interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.


Ginnie Mae Securities. The Ginnie Mae securities included in a GNMA Income
Portfolio are backed by the indebtedness secured by underlying mortgage pools of
up to 30 year mortgages on 1- to 4-family dwellings. The securities are often
referred to simply as "Ginnie Maes." The pool of mortgages which is to underlie
a particular new issue of Ginnie Mae securities is assembled by the proposed
issuer of such Ginnie Mae securities. The issuer is typically a mortgage banking
firm, and in every instance must be a mortgagee approved by and in good standing
with the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"). In addition, Ginnie Mae imposes
its own criteria on the eligibility of issuers, including a net worth
requirement.


The mortgages which are to comprise a new Ginnie Mae pool may have been
originated by the issuer itself in its capacity as a mortgage lender or may be
acquired by the issuer from a third party, such as another mortgage banker, a
banking institution, the Veterans Administration ("VA") (which in certain
instances acts as a direct lender and thus originates its own mortgages) or one
of several other governmental agencies. All mortgages in any given pool will be
insured under the National Housing Act, as amended ("FHA-insured"), or Title V
of the Housing Act of 1949 ("FMHA Insured") or guaranteed under the Servicemen's
Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended, or Chapter 37 of Title 38, U.S.C.
("VA-guaranteed"). Such mortgages will have a date for the first scheduled
monthly payment of principal that is not more than one year prior to the date on
which Ginnie Mae issues its guaranty commitment as described below, will have
comparable interest rates and maturity dates, and will meet additional criteria
of Ginnie Mae. All mortgages in the pools backing the Ginnie Mae securities
contained in the Trust are mortgages on 1- to 4-family dwellings (having a
stated maturity of up to 30 years for securities in the Trust but an estimated
average life of considerably less. In general, the mortgages in these pools
provide for equal monthly payments over the life of the mortgage (aside from
prepayments) designed to repay the principal of the mortgage over such period,
together with interest at the fixed rate on the unpaid balance.


To obtain Ginnie Mae approval of a new pool of mortgages, the issuer will
file with Ginnie Mae an application containing information concerning itself,
describing generally the pooled mortgages, and requesting that Ginnie Mae
approve the issue and issue its commitment (subject to Ginnie Mae's satisfaction
with the mortgage documents and other relevant documentation) to guarantee the
timely payment of principal of and interest on the Ginnie Mae securities to be
issued by the issuer. If the application is in order, Ginnie Mae will issue its
commitment and will assign a Ginnie Mae pool number to the pool. Upon completion
of the required documentation (including detailed information as to the
underlying mortgages, a custodial agreement with a Federal or state regulated
financial institution satisfactory to Ginnie Mae pursuant to which the
underlying mortgages will be held in safekeeping, and a detailed guaranty
agreement between Ginnie Mae and the issuer), the issuance of the Ginnie Mae
securities is permitted. When the Ginnie Mae securities are issued, Ginnie Mae
will endorse its guarantee thereon. The aggregate principal amount of Ginnie Mae
securities issued will be equal to the then aggregate unpaid principal balances
of the pooled mortgages. The interest rate borne by the Ginnie Mae securities is
currently fixed at 1/2 of 1% below the interest rate of the pooled 1- to
4-family mortgages, the differential being applied to the payment of servicing
and custodial charges as well as Ginnie Mae's guaranty fee.


Ginnie Mae IIs consist of jumbo pools of mortgages from more than one
issuer. By allowing pools to consist of multiple issuers, it allows for larger
and more geographically diverse pools. Unlike Ginnie Mae Is, which have a
minimum pool size of $1 million, Ginnie Mae IIs have a minimum pool size of $7
million. In addition, the interest rates on the mortgages within the Ginnie Mae
II pools will vary unlike the mortgages within pools in Ginnie Mae Is which all
have the same rate. The rates on the mortgages will vary from 1/2 of 1% to
1.50% above the coupon rate on the Ginnie Mae security, which is allowed for
servicing and custodial fees as well as the Ginnie Mae's guaranty fee. The
major advantage of Ginnie Mae IIs lies in the fact that a central paying agent
sends one check to the holder on the required payment date. This greatly
simplifies the current procedure of collecting distributions from each issuer
of a Ginnie Mae, since such distributions are often received late.


All of the Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust, including the Ginnie Mae IIs,
are of the "fully modified pass-through" type, i.e., they provide for timely
monthly payments to the registered holders thereof (including the Trust) of
their pro rata share of the scheduled principal payments on the underlying
mortgages, whether or not collected by the issuers, including, on a pro rata
basis, any prepayments of principal of such mortgages received and interest
(net of the servicing and other charges described above) on the aggregate
unpaid principal balance of such Ginnie Mae securities, whether or not the
interest on the underlying mortgages has been collected by the issuers.


The Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust are guaranteed as to timely payment
of principal and interest by Ginnie Mae. Funds received by the issuers on
account of the mortgages backing the Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust are
intended to be sufficient to make the required payments of principal of and
interest on such Ginnie Mae securities but, if such funds are insufficient for
that purpose, the guaranty agreements between the issuers and Ginnie Mae
require the issuers to make advances sufficient for such payments. If the
issuers fail to make such payments, Ginnie Mae will do so.


Ginnie Mae is authorized by Section 306(g) of Title III of the National
Housing Act to guarantee the timely payment of and interest on securities which
are based on or backed by a Trust or pool composed of mortgages insured by FHA,
the Farmers' Home Administration ("FMHA") or guaranteed by the VA. Section
306(g) provides further that the full faith and credit of the United States is
pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under
any guaranty under such subsection. An opinion of an Assistant Attorney General
of the United States, dated December 9, 1969, states that such guaranties
"constitute general obligations of the United States backed by its full faith
and credit." Any statement that a particular security is backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States is based upon the opinion of an assistant
attorney general of the United States and should be so construed. Ginnie Mae is
empowered to borrow from the United States Treasury to the extent necessary to
make any payments of principal and interest required under such guaranties.


Ginnie Mae securities are backed by the aggregate indebtedness secured by
the underlying FHA-insured, FMHA-insured or VA-guaranteed mortgages and, except
to the extent of funds received by the issuers on account of such mortgages,
Ginnie Mae securities do not constitute a liability of nor evidence any
recourse against such issuers, but recourse thereon is solely against Ginnie
Mae. Holders of Ginnie Mae securities (such as the Trust) have no security
interest in or lien on the underlying mortgages.


The Ginnie Mae guaranties referred to herein relate only to payment of
principal of and interest on the Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust and not to
the Units offered hereby.


Monthly payments of principal will be made, and additional prepayments of
principal may be made, to each Trust in respect of the mortgages underlying the
Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust. All of the mortgages in the pools relating
to the Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust are subject to prepayment without any
significant premium or penalty at the option of the mortgagors. While the
mortgages on 1- to 4-family dwellings underlying the Ginnie Mae securities have
a stated maturity of up to 30 years for the Trust, it has been the experience of
the mortgage industry that the average life of comparable mortgages, owing to
prepayments, refinancings and payments from foreclosures, is considerably less.


In the mid-1970's, published yield tables for Ginnie Mae securities utilized
a 12- year average life assumption for Ginnie Mae pools of 26-30 year mortgages
on 1- to 4-family dwellings. This assumption was derived from the FHA
experience relating to prepayments on such mortgages during the period from the
mid-1950's to the mid-1970s. This 12-year average life assumption was
calculated in respect of a period during which mortgage lending rates were
fairly stable. The assumption is no longer an accurate measure of the average
life of Ginnie Mae Securities or their underlying single family mortgage pools.
Recently it has been observed that mortgages issued at high interest rates have
experienced accelerated prepayment rates which would indicate a significantly
shorter average life than 12 years. Today, research analysts use complex
formulae to scrutinize the prepayments of mortgage pools in an attempt to
predict more accurately the average life of Ginnie Mae Securities.


A number of factors, including homeowner's mobility, change in family size
and mortgage market interest rates will affect the average life of the Ginnie
Mae securities in the Trust. For example, Ginnie Mae securities issued during a
period of high interest rates will be backed by a pool of mortgage loans bearing
similarly high rates. In general, during a period of declining interest rates,
new mortgage loans with interest rates lower than those charged during periods
of high rates will become available. To the extent a homeowner has an
outstanding mortgage with a high rate, he may refinance his mortgage at a lower
interest rate or he may rapidly repay his old mortgage. Should this happen, a
Ginnie Mae issued with a high interest rate may experience a rapid prepayment of
principal as the underlying mortgage loans prepay in whole or in part.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prepayment levels which will be
actually realized will conform to the estimates or experience of the FHA, other
mortgage lenders, dealers or market makers or other Ginnie Mae investors. It is
not possible to meaningfully predict prepayment levels regarding the Ginnie Mae
securities in the Trust. The termination of the Trust might be accelerated as a
result of prepayments made as described herein.



Insurance on the Bonds



Insurance has been obtained by the issuers of certain bonds in the Trusts
prior to the deposit of such bonds in a Trust, guaranteeing prompt payment of
interest and principal, when due, in respect of such bonds. See "The
Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in the prospectus. The premium for any
insurance policy or policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by
such issuer, and any such policy or policies are non-cancelable and will
continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the
Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. If the provider of an original
issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy
or if the rating assigned to the claims-paying ability of any such insurer
deteriorates, the Preinsured Bond Insurers have no obligation to insure any
issue adversely affected by either of the above described events.


ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty"). ACA Financial
Guaranty is organized and domiciled in the State of Maryland. Since December
2007, ACA Financial Guaranty has not issued any new financial guaranty
insurance policies and is currently operating as a runoff insurance company.


On August 8, 2008, ACA Financial Guaranty and counterparties to its
structured finance products reached an agreement on a restructuring plan for ACA
Financial Guaranty. The plan, approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration,
provided for settlement of the structured finance obligations and protection for
ACA Financial Guaranty's municipal policyholders. The settlement required that
ACA Financial Guaranty make a $209 million cash payment and a distribution of
surplus notes. The surplus notes provide the former collateralized debt
obligation ("CDO") counterparties and certain other counterparties with
approximately a 95% economic interest in ACA Financial Guaranty. ACA Financial
Guaranty continues to operate as a runoff insurance company and focus on
actively monitoring its remaining insured municipal obligations.


As of September 30, 2012, ACA Financial Guaranty had total admitted assets
of $436.3 million and total liabilities of $328.7 million, resulting in a
surplus as regards policyholders of $107.6 million.


On December 15, 2008, S&P raised the financial strength, financial
enhancement, and issuer credit ratings on ACA Financial Guaranty to B from CCC,
with a developing outlook. The upgrade reflected the positive effects of the
restructuring transaction completed in August 2008 that settled all outstanding
CDO and reinsurance exposures of the company, including the significantly
deteriorated CDO of asset-backed securities ("ABS") transactions, eliminating a
requirement to post a significant amount of collateral to the CDO of ABS
counterparties. At the same time, S&P also withdrew the ratings at ACA
Financial Guaranty's request.

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Ambac Financial Group, Inc.
("Ambac"), headquartered in New York City, is a holding company incorporated in
the state of Delaware on April 29, 1991. Ambac's activities are divided into two
business segments: (i) financial guarantee and (ii) financial services. Ambac
provides financial guarantee insurance for public and structured finance
obligations through its principal operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance. As a
holding company, Ambac is largely dependent on dividends from Ambac Assurance to
pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and to pay its operating
expenses.


On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial
strength rating to AA from AAA, with negative implications. On June 19, 2008,
Moody's downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial strength rating from
Aaa to Aa3, with a negative outlook. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of Ambac
Assurance's insurance financial strength rating reflects Ambac Assurance's
overall credit profile in the current environment, including its significantly
constrained new business prospects, its impaired financial flexibility and
increased expected and stress loss projections among its mortgage-related risk
exposures relative to previous estimates. On November 5, 2008, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Aa3
to Baa1, with a developing outlook, as a result of greater than expected
mortgage-related losses in the third quarter. On November 19, 2008, S&P lowered
its insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance to A from AA, with a
negative outlook. The November 19, 2008 rating action on Ambac Assurance
reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance's exposures in the U.S. residential
mortgage sector and particularly the related collateralized debt obligation
structures have been a source of significant and comparatively
greater-than-competitor losses and will continue to expose the company to the
potential for further adverse loss development. On April 13, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Baa1
to Ba3, with a developing outlook, reflecting Ambac Assurance's weakened
business position and very constrained financial flexibility, as well as its
weakened risk adjusted capitalization, as Moody's loss estimates on residential
mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") have increased significantly. In Moody's
view, these higher loss estimates increase the estimated capital required to
support Ambac Assurance's sizable direct RMBS portfolio (including securities
owned as well as securities guaranteed) and also the insurer's large portfolio
of ABS CDO risks. On June 24, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to BBB
from A with negative implications. The June 24, 2009 rating action on Ambac
Assurance reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance is effectively in runoff and
the likelihood of the company continuing as an operating entity capable of
writing new business has decreased significantly. On July 28, 2009, S&P lowered
the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings
of Ambac Assurance to CC from BBB, with a developing outlook. The July 28, 2009
rating action on Ambac Assurance reflects S&P's view of the significant
deterioration in the Ambac Assurance's insured portfolio of nonprime RMBS and
related CDOs, which has required the company to strengthen reserves to account
for higher projected claims. In S&P's view, the additional reserves will have a
significant negative effect on operating results, which will likely cause
surplus to decline to below regulator required minimums. On July 29, 2009,
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance
from Ba3 to Caa2, with a developing outlook, reflecting Moody's belief that, as
a result of Ambac Assurance's recently announced large loss reserve increase and
credit impairment charge estimated for the second quarter of 2009 which would
reduce Ambac Assurance's regulatory capital to levels below the required minimum
threshold, there will be increased pressure on Ambac Assurance's counterparties
to commute outstanding exposures on terms that could imply a distressed
exchange. On March 25, 2010, S&P revised the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to R from CC (an
issuer rated "R" by S&P is under regulatory supervision because of its financial
condition). S&P's March 25, 2010 rating action resulted following a directive by
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac Assurance to
establish a segregated account for certain insured exposure, primarily policies
related to credit derivatives, RMBS, and other structured finance transactions.
On March 26, 2010, Moody's placed the Caa2 insurance financial strength rating
of Ambac Assurance on review for possible upgrade. On November 23, 2010, Moody's
affirmed Ambac's Caa2 insurance financial strength rating, with a developing
outlook. On November 30, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac at the company's request.
The November 30, 2010 rating action followed a directive by the Commissioner of
Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac to establish a segregated account
for certain insured exposure, primarily policies related to credit derivatives,
residential mortgage-backed securities, and other structured finance
transactions. On April 7, 2011, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial
strength rating of Ambac Assurance.


There have been a number of developments with respect to ratings actions by
the rating agencies. As a result of these rating agency actions, as well as
investor concern with respect to these actions, Ambac Assurance and its
operating subsidiaries have been able to originate only a de minimis amount of
new financial guarantee business since November 2007, and no new business in
2009. As a result, Ambac is no longer competing for new business.


On March 25, 2010, Ambac announced that, at the direction of the Office of
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin ("OCI"), Ambac
Assurance had established a segregated account for certain of its liabilities,
primarily policies related to credit derivatives, RMBS and other structured
finance transactions. This action derives from the OCI's view that immediate
action is necessary to address Ambac Assurance's financial position. In
conjunction with the establishment of the segregated account, the OCI has
commenced rehabilitation proceedings with respect to liabilities contained in
the segregated account in order to facilitate an orderly run-off and/or
settlement of those specific liabilities. On June 7, 2010 Ambac announced that
it had commuted all of its remaining CDOs of ABS and that certain other non-CDO
of ABS exposures would be commuted within the next twelve months.


On November 8, 2010, Ambac announced that it has filed for a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Ambac will continue to operate
in the ordinary course of business as "debtor-in-possession" under the
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Ambac
Assurance is subject to insurance regulatory requirements of the States of
Wisconsin and New York, and the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed to
conduct business.


Ambac Assurance's statutory policyholder surplus and qualified statutory
capital were $100.0 million and $628.3 million at September 30, 2012,
respectively as compared to $495.3 million and $684.6 million as of December
31, 2011, respectively. As of September 30, 2012, total stockholders' deficit
was $3.49 billion; at December 31, 2011, total stockholders' deficit was $3.15
billion. This increased deficit was primarily caused by the net loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2012, partially offset by unrealized gains on
investment securities during the period.

Assured Guaranty Corp. ("Assured Guaranty") and Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. ("Assured Municipal") (formerly Financial Security Assurance Inc.
("FSA")). Assured Guaranty, a subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. ("Assured"),
is organized in the State of Maryland and provides financial guaranty insurance
to both the municipal and structured finance sectors. Assured Municipal, also a
subsidiary of Assured, is a separately capitalized company organized in the
State of New York and provides municipal bond insurance.


In January 2009, Assured Guaranty finalized an agreement with CIFG Assurance
North America, Inc. to assume a diversified portfolio of financial guaranty
contracts totaling approximately $13.3 billion of net par outstanding. Assured
Guaranty received $75.6 million, which included $85.7 million of upfront
premiums net of ceding commissions and approximately $12.2 million of future
installments related to this transaction.


On July 1, 2009, Assured completed the purchase of Financial Security
Assurance Holdings Ltd., the parent of financial guaranty insurance company,
FSA, from Dexia Holdings Inc. Effective November 9, 2009, FSA was renamed
Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. In certain states, Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. may operate under its prior name, Financial Security Assurance Inc.


On June 24, 2010, S&P published a Full Analysis in which it affirmed its
"AAA" financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal,
reflecting S&P's view of the companies' dominant market position in the bond
insurance industry and their strong combined capital position. On October 25,
2010, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA+ from AAA, with a stable outlook.
The downgrades reflect S&P's view of a struggling financial guarantee market,
each company's weak statutory operating performance, and also the quality of
each company's capital within S&P's capital adequacy analysis. On November 30,
2011 S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA- from AA+, with a stable outlook.
The November 30, 2011 downgrades reflect S&P's view that Assured Guaranty and
Assured Municipal do not maintain enough capital to mitigate the largest obligor
concentrations for a higher rating.


On November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of Assured Guaranty from Aaa to Aa2, primarily reflecting Moody's
updated view on Assured Guaranty's exposure to weakness inherent in the
financial guaranty business model. Also on November 21, 2008, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FSA from Aaa to Aa3,
reflecting Moody's view of FSA's diminished business and financial profile
resulting from its exposure to losses on U.S. mortgage risks and disruption in
the financial guaranty business more broadly. On November 12, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Assured Guaranty from Aa2
to Aa3, with a negative outlook. Moody's November 12, 2009 downgrade results
from Moody's review of the performance of Assured's RMBS exposures. Moody's
said that adverse trends in RMBS loss estimates have had varying effects on
Assured's main insurance subsidiaries. On March 5, 2010, Moody's confirmed the
insurance financial strength ratings of both Assured Guaranty and Assured
Municipal at Aa3, with a negative outlook. On January 17, 2013, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty to A3
from Aa3 and of Assured Municipal to A2 from Aa3, both with a stable outlook.
The January 17, 2013 downgrade reflects Moody's reassessment of the business
franchise, expected future profitability and financial flexibility of Assured
Guaranty and Assured Municipal.


On April 1, 2015, Assured Guaranty acquired all issued and outstanding
shares of Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. All prior obligations of Radian Asset
are now obligations of Assured Guaranty.


Assured's third quarter 2012 net income declined to $142 million from $761
million in third quarter 2011 due primarily to the effects of changes in credit
spreads on the fair value of credit derivatives, offset in part by a decline in
loss expense, which was significantly higher in the prior year due mainly to
the effects of declining discount rates in the third quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP
operating income in third quarter 2012 was $166 million, an increase from
operating income in third quarter 2011, due primarily to higher net earned
premiums due to refundings, accelerations and terminations, lower loss expense,
and a lower effective tax rate on operating income. As of September 30, 2012,
Assured Guaranty had total assets of $5.28 billion and total liabilities of
$4.13 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of $1.15 billion. As of
September 30, 2012, Assured Municipal had total assets of $10.74 billion and
total liabilities of $7.64 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of
$3.10 billion.


The information contained above relating to Assured Guaranty and Assured
Municipal and their parent company, Assured, is based upon publicly available

Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp ("BHAC"). BHAC is a bond insurance company
created by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. ("Berkshire") in December 2007 and is
licensed to write financial guarantee insurance in 49 states.


On April 11, 2008, S&P assigned an initial rating of AAA to BHAC's insurance
financial strength, with a stable outlook. On April 25, 2008, Moody's assigned
an initial rating of Aaa to BHAC's insurance financial strength, with a stable
outlook. On April 8, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of BHAC from Aaa to Aa1, with a stable outlook. This downgrade reflects
Moody's view concerning "the impact on Berkshire's key businesses of the severe
decline in equity markets over the past year as well as the protracted economic
recession." Moody's noted that Berkshire is also exposed to heightened
volatility in its earnings and capital base related to market value fluctuations
within its large portfolio of equity derivatives. On February 4, 2010, S&P
lowered the financial strength rating of BHAC from AAA to AA+, with a stable
outlook. The February 4, 2010 rating action was taken in anticipation of
Berkshire's acquisition of Northern Santa Fe Corporation reflecting S&P's
expectation that a significant part of the internal cash for the acquisition
will come from Berkshire's core insurance operations and that Berkshire's
overall capital adequacy has weakened to levels no longer consistent with a AAA
rating and is not expected to return to extremely strong levels in the near
term.


As of September 30, 2012, Berkshire had total assets of $424.1 billion and
total liabilities of $235.0 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of
$189.1 billion.

Build America Mutual Assurance Company ("BAM"). BAM is a New York domiciled
mutual insurance company owned by the issuers of municipal bonds who use BAM to
insure their debt obligations. BAM officially launched on July 23, 2012 and
began writing policies in September of 2012.


On July 23, 2012, S&P assigned an initial rating of AA to BAM's financial
strength and counterparty credit ratings, with a stable outlook. These ratings
are based upon S&P's view that BAM holds a very strong competitive position
with low industry risk, along with extremely strong capital adequacy and strong
operating performance.


As of September 30, 2012 BAM had total net admitted assets of $518.9 million
and total liabilities of $27.9 million, resulting in a surplus as regards
policyholders of $491.0 million.


The information relating to BAM contained above has been furnished by BAM or

CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG"). CIFG Holding, Inc. is the
holding company for the CIFG group of financial guaranty insurance and
reinsurance companies ("CIFG Group"), including CIFG Assurance North America,
Inc., a New York corporation and its subsidiaries. The CIFG Group is actively
managing the runoff of a portfolio of insured structured finance, municipal and
infrastructure risks. On September 29, 2010, CIFG and CIFG Guaranty entered
into a merger agreement which resulted in CIFG Guaranty merging into CIFG
(together with related transactions, the "CIFG Merger").


On March 6, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Aaa to A1, with a stable outlook. This rating action reflected
Moody's assessment of CIFG's weakened capitalization, impaired business
opportunities, and uncertain strategic direction, as a result, in part, of its
exposures to the U.S. residential mortgage market. Moody's believed that CIFG's
significant exposure to the mortgage sector, especially ABS CDOs is indicative
of a risk posture far greater than would be consistent with a Aaa rating going
forward. On May 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
ratings of CIFG to Ba2 from A1, with direction uncertain, reflecting the high
likelihood that, absent material developments, the company would fail minimum
regulatory capital requirements in New York and Bermuda due to expected
significant increases in modeled loss reserves on ABS CDOs. In Moody's view, the
breach of such regulatory capital requirements would put the company in a
precarious position, especially in light of the solvency provisions embedded in
its CDS exposures. On October 28, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength rating of CIFG from Ba2 to B3, with direction uncertain,
reflecting Moody's expectation of substantially higher mortgage-related losses
arising from CIFG's insured portfolio, as well as the possibility that certain
troubled exposures could be commuted. On January 22, 2009, Moody's upgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of CIFG from B3 to Ba3, with a developing
outlook, reflecting the strengthened capital adequacy profile of CIFG following
its restructuring and the commutation of substantially all of its ABS CDO risks.
Also on January 22, 2009, S&P raised the insurance financial strength rating of
CIFG to BB from B, with a developing outlook. S&P's January 22, 2009 upgrade
results from the completion of CIFG's restructuring plan involving key
policyholders, creditors, and equity owners (counterparties) who had hedged
their ABS CDO and commercial real estate CDO exposures with CIFG and which were
significantly affected by defaults and downgrades of the underlying collateral.
On June 15, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of CIFG to CC from BB, with a negative outlook,
reflecting S&P's view of the significant deterioration in the company's insured
portfolio of nonprime RMBS which has necessitated that CIFG strengthen reserves
to account for the higher projected claims. On August 20, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of CIFG from Ba3to Caa2,
resulting from significant deterioration in the company's remaining insured
portfolio since January, 2009 when CIFG initiated a broad restructuring. On
November 11, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Caa2 to Ca. Also on November 11, 2009, Moody's announced that it
will withdraw the insurance financial strength rating of CIFG. The November 11,
2009 rating actions reflect Moody's view that material deterioration in CIFG's
insured portfolio adversely affected the guarantor's capital adequacy profile
and Moody's believes that CIFG may no longer have sufficient financial resources
to pay all insurance claims. On February 16, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty
credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of CIFG.


As of September 30, 2012, CIFG had net admitted assets of $742.3 million and
total liabilities of $385.5 million. CIFG's statutory surplus as of September
30, 2012 is approximately $356.7 million, a decrease of approximately $227.8
million from approximately $584.5 million at December 31, 2011. This decrease
is primarily attributable to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves
established for student loans of approximately $252.3 million, which is
partially offset by other income statement balances resulting in a net loss of
approximately $227.0 million and an increase in contingency reserves of
approximately $3.5 million.


The information relating to CIFG and its affiliates contained above has been
furnished by CIFG or the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as
to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.


Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"). FGIC is a wholly owned
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation. The company was engaged in the business of
providing financial guaranty insurance and other forms of credit enhancement
for public finance and structured finance obligations. In January 2008, FGIC
voluntarily ceased writing financial guaranty policies concerning new or
additional risks.


The deterioration in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and the global
credit markets, which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2007 and continued
through the fourth quarter of 2009, has adversely affected the company's
business, results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, the
company incurred significant losses related to its exposure to certain ABS
CDOs, which are backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and to certain RMBS,
primarily backed by first-lien or second-lien mortgages. These losses have
resulted in a substantial reduction of FGIC's statutory policyholders' surplus
over time. On November 24, 2009, the New York State Insurance Department, the
predecessor to the New York State Department of Financial Services, issued an
order pursuant to Section 1310 of the New York Insurance Law requiring FGIC to,
among other things, suspend paying any and all claims. FGIC was subsequently
unable to eliminate the impairment of its policyholders' surplus through an
out-of-court Surplus Restoration Plan. On June 11, 2012, Benjamin M. Lawsky,
Superintendent of Financial Services of the State of New York (the
"Superintendent") filed a verified petition with the Supreme Court of the State
of New York for an order of rehabilitation (i) appointing the Superintendent as
rehabilitator ("Rehabilitator") of FGIC, (ii) directing the Rehabilitator to
take possession of the property and assets of FGIC and to conduct the business
thereof, and (iii) directing the Rehabilitator to take steps towards the
removal of the causes and conditions which have made FGIC's rehabilitation
proceeding (the "Rehabilitation Proceeding") necessary. FGIC consented to the
commencement of the Rehabilitation Proceeding.


Prior to the fourth quarter of 2007, FGIC's financial strength was rated
"Aaa" by Moody's "AAA" by S&P, and "AAA" by Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch").
Moody's, S&P and Fitch have since completed several assessments of FGIC's
capital adequacy in relation to the company's exposure to ABS CDOs which are
backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and its exposure to first-lien and
second-lien RMBS. As a result of these assessments, Moody's, S&P and Fitch
downgraded the financial strength ratings of FGIC. As of March 31, 2008, Fitch
had downgraded FGIC from AA to BBB with Rating Watch Negative; Moody's had
downgraded FGIC from A3 to Baa3; and S&P had downgraded FGIC from A to BB. On
June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
FGIC from Baa3 to B1, reflecting FGIC's severely impaired financial flexibility
and proximity to minimum regulatory capital requirements relative to Moody's
estimates of expected case losses. On November 24, 2008, S&P lowered its
insurance financial strength rating of FGIC to CCC from BB, with a negative
outlook. S&P's November 24, 2008 downgrade results from FGIC's exposure to
nonprime and second-lien mortgages and related CDO of ABS. On December 19, 2008,
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC from B1 to
Caa1, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation of higher
mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio and the
constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of the holding company. On March
24, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC
from Caa1 to Caa3, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation of
higher mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio,
insufficient claims paying resources to cover Moody's estimate of expected loss,
and the constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of FGIC's holding
company. Also on March 24, 2009, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial
strength rating of FGIC. On April 22, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of FGIC to CC from CCC,
with a negative outlook. Also on April 22, 2009, S&P withdrew the ratings on
FGIC and the counterparty credit rating on the holding company, FGIC
Corporation, because of S&P's expectation that timely and comprehensive
financial information will no longer be available.


As of September 30, 2012, FGIC had net admitted assets of approximately $2.1
billion and total liabilities of approximately $5.8 billion.


On August 4, 2010, FGIC Corporation announced that it had filed a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in
the Southern District of New York. None of FGIC Corporation's subsidiaries or
affiliates, including FGIC, are part of the Chapter 11 filing.


The information relating to FGIC and its affiliates contained above has been

corporation providing municipal bond insurance for municipal and infrastructure
bonds. MAC currently guarantees only public finance transactions. MAC is an
Assured Guaranty company owned jointly by its affiliates Assured Guaranty
Municipal Corp. and Assured Guaranty Corp. MAC is part of the Assured Guaranty
Group.


On July 17, 2013, S&P assigned MAC a long-term financial strength and
counterparty credit rating of AA- to MAC with a stable outlook. On March 18,
2014, S&P raised its financial strength and enhancement rating on MAC from AA-
to AA. The rating action reflects S&P's view that MAC's competitive position
remains strong relative to its peers' in the bond industry. S&P continues to
view MAC as having a stable outlook.


As of June 30, 2014, MAC had a total net admitted assets of $1,519,869,768
and total liabilities of $999,277,625 resulting in a surplus as regards

National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation ("National Guarantee")
(formerly MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois ("MBIA Illinois")). MBIA, Inc., a
Connecticut corporation, conducts its financial guarantee business through
though its wholly-owned subsidiaries MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA Corp."),
which writes global structured finance and non-U.S. public finance financial
guarantee insurance, and National Guarantee, which writes U.S. public finance
guarantees.


On February 18, 2009, MBIA, Inc., the parent company of MBIA Corp., announced
the restructuring of its financial guaranty insurance operations following the
approval of the New York and Illinois insurance regulators. The restructuring
involved the segregation of its financial guaranty insurance operations into two
separately capitalized sister companies, with National Guarantee assuming the
risk associated with its U.S. municipal exposures, and with MBIA Corp. insuring
the remainder of the portfolio, including all international and structured
finance exposures. Business ceded to MBIA Corp. from FGIC in 2008 has been
assigned to National Guarantee. To provide additional protection for its
municipal bond policyholders, National Guarantee has also issued second-to-pay
policies for the benefit of the policyholders covered by the reinsurance and
assignment. The second-to-pay policies, which are a direct obligation of
National Guarantee, will be held by The Bank of New York Mellon as insurance
trustee. These policies provide that if MBIA Corp. or FGIC, as applicable, do
not pay valid claims of their policyholders, the policyholders will then be able
to make a claim directly against National Guarantee under the second-to-pay
policies. On March 19, 2009, MBIA Illinois formally changed its name to National
Public Finance Guarantee Corporation. Effective December 1, 2009, National
Guarantee was redomesticated to the State of New York and is subject to
insurance regulations and supervision of the State of New York. National
Guarantee is a wholly owned subsidiary of MBIA, Inc. and independently
capitalized with $5.6 billion in claims-paying resources as of December 31,
2010. In certain states, National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation may
operate under its prior name, MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois.


On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded MBIA Corp.'s insurance financial strength
rating to AA from AAA. On June 19, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength ratings of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from Aaa
to A2. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its insurance
affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s limited financial flexibility and impaired
franchise, as well as the substantial risk within its portfolio of insured
exposures and a movement toward more aggressive capital management within the
group. On November 7, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from A2 to Baa1, with a
developing outlook. Moody's November 7, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its
insurance affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s diminished business and financial
profile resulting from its exposure to losses from U.S. mortgage risks and
disruption in the financial guaranty business more broadly. On February 18,
2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp.
from Baa1 to B3, with a developing outlook, reflecting MBIA Corp.'s substantial
reduction in claims-paying resources relative to the remaining higher-risk
exposures in its insured portfolio, given the removal of capital, and the
transfer of unearned premium reserves associated with the ceding of its
municipal portfolio to MBIA Illinois, as well as the continued deterioration of
MBIA Corp.'s insured portfolio of largely structured credits, with stress
reaching sectors beyond residential mortgage-related securities. Also on
February 18, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB+ from AA, with a negative
outlook. The February 18, 2009 rating action on MBIA Corp. reflects S&P's view
that MBIA Corp.'s retained insured portfolio lacks sufficient sector diversity
and with time could become more concentrated, and that MBIA Corp.'s 2005--2007
vintage direct RMBS, CDO of ABS, and other structured exposures are subject to
continued adverse loss development that could erode capital adequacy. At the
same time, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of
MBIA Illinois to AA- from AA, reflecting MBIA Illinois's uncertain business
prospects and capital. On June 5, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB from
BBB+, with a negative outlook, resulting from MBIA Corp.'s increased loss
assumptions on its 2005--2007 vintage direct RMBS and CDO of ABS and a change in
the assumed tax benefit of tax-loss carryforwards. Also on June 5, 2009, S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement
ratings of National Guarantee to A from AA-, with a negative outlook, reflecting
S&P's view of National Guarantee's uncertain business and capital-raising
prospects. On September 28, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BB+ from BBB, with
a negative outlook, reflecting S&P's view that macroeconomic conditions continue
to contribute to losses on the group's structured finance products. On December
22, 2010 S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial
enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to B from BB+, with a negative outlook,
reflecting increased stress case loss projections. Also on December 22, 2010 S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement
ratings of National Guarantee to BBB from A, with a developing outlook. On
December 19, 2011 Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
National Guarantee from Baa1 to Baa2, with a negative outlook, based upon
weakening of the overall MBIA group's market standing as losses grow at National
Guarantee's affiliated companies and the risk that resources at National
Guarantee could be drawn away to support losses elsewhere within the group. On
May 10, 2013 S&P raised the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of National Guarantee to A from BB, with a stable
outlook. The May 10, 2013 rating action reflects S&P's view that MBIA Corp. no
longer acts as an anchor on the National Guarantee rating following the
settlement with Societe Generale that ends litigation challenging National
Guarantee's split from MBIA Corp. in 2009. On May 21, 2013 Moody's upgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp. to B3 from Caa2, with a
positive outlook, citing MBIA Corp.'s improved capital and liquidity profile
following settlements of putback receivables and insured claims with major
counterparties. Also on May 21, 2013 Moody's upgraded the insurance financial
strength rating of National Guarantee to Baa1 from Baa2, with a positive
outlook. The May 21, 2013 rating action reflects National Guarantee's improved
credit profile following the repayment of the loan from its weaker affiliate,
MBIA Corp., and the termination of the litigation related to the 2009
restructuring.


As of September 30, 2012, National Guarantee had total net admitted assets
of $5.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion, resulting in a surplus
as regard policyholders of $1.8 billion.


As of September 30, 2012, MBIA, Inc. and its subsidiaries had total assets
of $22.1 billion and total liabilities of $19.6 billion. MBIA, Inc.'s total
shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2012 was $2.6 billion, increasing from
$1.7 billion as of December 31, 2011.


The information relating to MBIA and its affiliates contained above has been
furnished by MBIA or the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as
to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.


Syncora Guarantee Inc. ("Syncora Guarantee") (formerly XL Capital Assurance
Inc. ("XLCA")). Syncora Guarantee, a wholly owned subsidiary of Syncora
Holdings Ltd. ("Syncora Holdings"), is a New York domiciled financial guarantee
insurance company which provides credit enhancement and protection products to
the public finance and structured finance markets throughout the United States
and internationally.


In February 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of XLCA to A3 from Aaa. On June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength rating of XLCA from A3 to B2, reflecting XLCA's severely
impaired financial flexibility and proximity to minimum regulatory capital
requirements relative to Moody's estimates of expected case losses. On October
24, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Syncora
Guarantee from B2 to Caa1. On November 18, 2008, S&P lowered its insurance
financial strength rating of Syncora Guarantee to B from BBB- with developing
expectations. S&P's November 18, 2008 downgrade resulted from the Syncora
Guarantee's delay in implementing its restructuring plan and slow progress in
its negotiations with counterparties of its CDO of ABS exposure. On January 29,
2009, S&P lowered the issuer credit and financial strength ratings of Syncora
Guarantee to CC from B, with a negative outlook. S&P's January 29, 2009
downgrade resulted from S&P's recent update to its distressed exchange criteria.
On March 9, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
Syncora Guarantee from Caa1 to Ca, with a developing outlook, as a result of the
large loss reserve and credit impairment charges taken by Syncora Guarantee on
its mortgage-related exposures during the fourth quarter, which have resulted in
a $2.4 billion statutory deficit at Syncora Guarantee as of December 31, 2008.
On April 27, 2009, S&P revised the financial strength and financial enhancement
ratings of Syncora Guarantee to R from CC (an issuer rated "R" by S&P is under
regulatory supervision because of its financial condition). Also on April 27,
2009, S&P revised the counterparty credit rating of Syncora Guarantee to D from
CC (an issuer rated "D" by S&P has failed to pay one or more of its financial
obligation when it became due). S&P's April 27, 2009 rating actions resulted
from Syncora Guarantee's announcement that pursuant to an order of the New York
Insurance Department ("NYID"), the company must suspend any and all claims
payments until it has restored its policyholders' surplus to a level greater
than or equal to $65 million, the minimum the state requires. On July 28, 2010,
S&P withdrew the D counterparty credit rating and the R financial strength and
financial enhancement ratings of Syncora Guarantee. S&P's July 28, 2010 ratings
actions resulted from S&P's belief that there is not sufficient information to
judge Syncora Guarantee's claims paying ability.


As of September 30, 2012, Syncora Guarantee had total assets of $1.17
billion and total liabilities of $639 million, resulting in a policyholders'
surplus of $504.2 million.


On July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced that Syncora Guarantee has
completed its remediation plan sufficient to meet its minimum statutory
policyholder surplus requirements and address previously announced short and
medium term liquidity issues. Also on July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced
that the NYID had approved Syncora Guarantee's plan for the payment of accrued
and unpaid claims and for the payment of new claims as they become due in the
ordinary course of business, resulting in the recommencement of claim payments
by Syncora Guaranty on regularly scheduled payment dates occurring on or after
July 21, 2010.

above has been furnished by Syncora Guarantee or the rating agencies. No

information, or as to the existence of any adverse changes in such information
subsequent to the date hereof.

The extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by
jurisdiction, but New York and most other jurisdictions have laws and
regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of
dividends, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions
or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings.


In order to be in an Insured Trust, bonds must be insured by one of the
Preinsured Bond Insurers. In determining eligibility for insurance, the
Preinsured Bond Insurers have applied their own standards which correspond
generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the insurability of
new issues of bonds and which are not necessarily the criteria used in the
selection of bonds by the Sponsor. To the extent the standards of the Preinsured
Bond Insurers are more restrictive than those of the Sponsor, the previously
stated Trust investment criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds.
This decision is made prior to the Date of Deposit, as debt obligations not
eligible for insurance are not deposited in an Insured Trust. Thus, all of the
bonds in the portfolios of the Insured Trusts are insured by the issuer of the
bonds prior to the deposit of such bonds in a Trust.


Preinsured Bonds in a Trust may or may not have a higher yield than
uninsured bonds. In selecting such bonds for an Insured Trust, the Sponsor has
applied the applicable criteria.


In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in respect of
a bond, a Preinsured Bond Insurer shall make such payment after the respective
insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened
(but not earlier than the date such payment is due). The insurer, as regards
any payment it may make, will succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect
thereof. All policies issued by the Preinsured Bond Insurers are substantially
identical insofar as obligations to an Insured Trust are concerned.


The Internal Revenue Service has issued a letter ruling which holds in effect
that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted municipal
obligations paid to holders of insured bonds, under policy provisions
substantially identical to the policies described herein, will be excludable
from federal gross income under Section 103(a)(1) of the Code to the same extent
as if such payments were made by the issuer of the municipal obligations.
Holders of Units in an Insured Trust should discuss with their tax advisers the
degree of reliance which they may place on this letter ruling. However, counsel
for the Sponsor at the time of the closing of the Insured Trust, had given an
opinion to the effect such payment of proceeds would be excludable from federal
gross income to the extent described under "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus


Part II.


Each Preinsured Bond Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Preinsured Bond Insurer will be able to
perform on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made
thereunder at some time in the future. At the date hereof, it is reported that
no claims have been submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the Bond
Insurers which would materially impair the ability of any such company to meet
its commitment pursuant to any contract of bond insurance.


The information relating to each Preinsured Bond Insurer has been furnished
by such companies. The financial information with respect to each Preinsured
Bond Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory
authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No
representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information
or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such information subsequent
to the dates thereof.



Portfolio Administration



The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units tendered
by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be
available, such of the bonds designated by the Evaluator as the Trustee in its
sole discretion may deem necessary. The Evaluator, in designating such bonds,
will consider a variety of factors, including (a) interest rates, (b) market
value and (c) marketability. To the extent that bonds are sold which are current
in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption requests and
defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve the related
insurance protection applicable to said bonds, the overall quality of the bonds
remaining in the Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. The Sponsor is
empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose of bonds in the
event of an advanced refunding.


The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution for
any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except that the Sponsor
may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other
action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if (1) the issuer is
in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written opinion of the
Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the
reasonably foreseeable future. Any bond so received in exchange or substitution
will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Trust
Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder. Within
five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for
underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each
Unitholder, identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor.
Except as stated herein and under "Trust Administration--Replacement Bonds" in
Prospectus Part II regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds for Failed
Bonds, the acquisition by the Trust of any bonds other than the bonds initially
deposited is not permitted.


With respect to a Preinsured Bond in a Trust, the Trustee shall promptly
notify the Preinsured Bond Insurer of any nonpayment of principal or interest on
such Preinsured Bond and if the Preinsured Bond Insurer should fail to make
payment to the Trustee within thirty days after receipt of such notice, the
Trustee shall take all action against the Preinsured Bond Insurer and/or the
issuer deemed necessary to collect all amounts of principal and interest at that
time due, but not collected.

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs

successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the
Trust Agreement.



Trustee Information



The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal unit
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted
by law.


The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such
records shall include the name and address of every Unitholder of the Trusts.
Such books and records shall be open to inspection by any Unitholder at all
reasonable times during the usual business hours. The Trustee shall make such
annual or other reports as may from time to time be required under any
applicable state or Federal statute, rule or regulation. The Trustee is required
to keep a certified copy or duplicate original of the Trust Agreement on file in
its office available for inspection at all reasonable times during the usual
business hours by any Unitholder, together with a current list of the bonds held
in the Trusts.


Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor.
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any
corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided
profits of not less than $5,000,000.



Termination of the Trust Agreement



A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders representing
51% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding (or, with respect to Van Kampen
Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 119 and subsequent series, by consent of
Unitholders representing 75% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding, and
with respect to a GNMA Income Portfolio, by consent of Unitholders of 66 2/3%
of the Units then outstanding) or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust,
as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% (40% in the case of a
GNMA Income Portfolio) of the original principal amount of bonds.


A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient
number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to
less than 40% of the initial principal amount of the Trust. If the Trust is
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriters, the
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by
such purchaser.


The Trust Agreement provides that the Trust shall terminate upon the
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust, but
in no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth
anniversary of the Trust Agreement (twentieth anniversary for Intermediate Term
Trusts and Variable Rate Trusts). In the event of termination of the Trust,
written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder of the
Trust at his address appearing on the registration books of the Trust
maintained by the Trustee. Within a reasonable time thereafter the Trustee
shall liquidate any bonds then held in the Trust and shall deduct from the
funds of the Trust any accrued costs, expenses or indemnities provided by the
Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of the Trustee and costs of
liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any
applicable taxes or other governmental charges. The sale of bonds in the Trust
upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized
if such sale were not required at such time. For this reason, among others, the
amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination may be less than the principal
amount or par amount of bonds represented by the Units held by such Unitholder.
The Trustee shall then distribute to each Unitholder his share of the balance
of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With such distribution the Unitholders
shall be furnished a final distribution statement of the amount distributable.
At such time as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall determine that any
amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it shall make distribution
thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.



Description of Ratings



Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &
Poor's long-term debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This
opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of
guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to
purchase, sell or hold the debt obligation, inasmuch as they do not comment as
to market price or suitability for a particular investor.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based on current
information furnished by the obligor or obtained by Standard & Poor's from
other sources it considers reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an
audit in connection with any credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on
unaudited financial information. Credit ratings may be changed, suspended or
withdrawn as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or
based on other circumstances.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based, in varying degrees,
on the following considerations:


I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.


II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.


III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangement under the
laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


The credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are
typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has
both senior and subordinate obligations, secured and unsecured obligations or
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.


AAA--An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is extremely strong.


AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is very strong.


A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is still strong.


BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment
on the obligation.


Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


BB--An obligation rated 'BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure
to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the
obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.


B--An obligation rated 'B' is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations
rated 'BB', but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic
conditions will likely impair the obligor's capacity or willingness to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation.


CCC--An obligation rated 'CCC' is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is
dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the
obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely
to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.


CC--An obligation rated 'CC' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.


C--A 'C' rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly
vulnerable to nonpayment, obligations that have payment arrearages allowed by
the terms of the documents, or obligations of an issuer that is the subject of
a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not experienced a payment
default. Among others, the 'C' rating may be assigned to subordinated debt,
preferred stock or other obligations on which cash payments have been suspended
in accordance with the instrument's terms or when preferred stock is the
subject of a distressed exchange offer, whereby some or all of the issue is
either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments
having a total value that is less than par.


Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major
rating categories. r--This symbol is attached to the ratings of instruments
with significant non-credit risks. It highlights risks to principal or
volatility of expected returns which are not addressed in the credit rating.


NR--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is
insufficient information on which to base a rating or that Standard & Poor's
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.


Moody's Investors Service. Municipal long-term rating scale. Moody's
municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of issuers and issues
in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate
Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these
issuers and issues. The default and loss content for Moody's municipal
long-term rating scale differs from Moody's general long-term rating scale.


Municipal ratings are based upon the analysis of five primary factors
relating to municipal finance: market position, financial position, debt
levels, governance, and covenants. Each of the factors is evaluated
individually and for its effect on the other factors in the context of the
municipality's ability to repay its debt.


Aaa--Issuers or issues rated Aaa demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Aa--Issuers or issues rated Aa demonstrate very strong creditworthiness
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


A--Issuers or issues rated A present above-average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Baa--Issuers or issues rated Baa represent average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," "Ca" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


Ba--Obligations rated 'Ba' are judged to be speculative and are subject to
substantial credit risk. B--Obligations rated 'B' are considered speculative and
are subject to high credit risk.


Caa--Obligations rated 'Caa' are judged to be speculative of poor standing
and are subject to very high credit risk.


Ca--Obligations rated 'Ca' are highly speculative and are likely in, or very
near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.


C--Obligations rated 'C' are the lowest rated class of bonds and are
typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or
interest.


Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the
lower end of that generic rating category.


General long-term rating scale. Moody's long-term obligation ratings are
opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed-income obligations with an
original maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a
financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Such ratings reflect both
the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered in the event of
default.


Aaa--Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with
minimal credit risk.


Aa--Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to
very low credit risk.


A--Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to
low credit risk.


Baa--Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are
considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative
characteristics.


Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," "Ca" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the
lower end of that generic rating category.


Fitch Ratings. Long-Term Ratings Scales. Fitch rated entities in a number of
sectors, including financial and non-financial corporations, sovereigns and
insurance companies, are generally assigned Issuer Default Ratings ("IDRs").
IDRs opine on an entity's relative vulnerability to default on financial
obligations. The "threshold" default risk addressed by the IDR is generally that
of the financial obligations whose non-payment would best reflect the uncured
failure of that entity. As such, IDRs also address relative vulnerability to
bankruptcy, administrative receivership or similar concepts, although the agency
recognizes that issuers may also make pre-emptive and therefore voluntary use of
such mechanisms.


In aggregate, IDRs provide an ordinal ranking of issuers based on the
agency's view of their relative vulnerability to default, rather than a
prediction of a specific percentage likelihood of default. For historical
information on the default experience of Fitch-rated issuers, please consult the
transition and default performance studies available from the Fitch Ratings
website.


o    The ratings do not predict a specific percentage of default likelihood
over any given time period;


o    The ratings do not opine on the market value of any issuer's
securities or stock, or the likelihood that this value may change;


o    The ratings do not opine on the liquidity of the issuer's securities
or stock;


o    The ratings do not opine on the possible loss severity on an
obligation should an issuer default;


o    The ratings do not opine on the suitability of an issuer as a
counterparty to trade credit;


o    The ratings do not opine on any quality related to an issuer's
business, operational or financial profile other than the agency's
opinion on its relative vulnerability to default;


AAA--Highest credit quality. 'AAA' ratings denote the lowest expectation of
default risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally strong capacity
for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be
adversely affected by foreseeable events.


AA--Very high credit quality. 'AA' ratings denote expectations of very low
default risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial
commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable
events.


A--High credit quality. 'A' ratings denote expectations of low default risk.
The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This
capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic
conditions than is the case for higher ratings.


BBB--Good credit quality. 'BBB' ratings indicate that expectations of default
risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is
considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely
to impair this capacity.


BB--Speculative. 'BB' ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to default
risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic
conditions over time; however, business or financial flexibility exists which
supports the servicing of financial commitments.


B--Highly speculative. 'B' ratings indicate that material default risk is
present, but a limited margin of safety remains. Financial commitments are
currently being met; however, capacity for continued payment is vulnerable to
deterioration in the business and economic environment.


CCC--Substantial credit risk. Default is a real possibility.


CC--Very high levels of credit risk. Default of some kind appears probable.


C--Exceptionally high levels of credit risk. Default is imminent or
inevitable, or the issuer is in standstill. Conditions that are indicative of a
'C' category rating for an issuer include:


a.   the issuer has entered into a grace or cure period following
non-payment of a material financial obligation;


b.   the issuer has entered into a temporary negotiated waiver or
standstill agreement following a payment default on a material
financial obligation; or


c.   Fitch Ratings otherwise believes a condition of 'RD' or 'D' to be
imminent or inevitable, including through the formal announcement of a
coercive debt exchange.


Note: The modifiers "+" or "-" may be appended to a rating to denote relative
status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to the 'AAA'
Long-Term IDR category, or to Long-Term IDR categories below 'B'.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0034)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.The trust is more susceptible to political, economic, regulatory, or other factors affecting issuers of California municipal securities than a trust that does not limit its investment to such issues. The state of California is currently in the midst of a severe economic recession.

This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.The trust is more susceptible to political, economic, regulatory, or other factors affecting issuers of California municipal securities than a trust that does not limit its investment to such issues. The state of California is currently in the midst of a severe economic recession.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0034)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.The trust is more susceptible to political, economic, regulatory, or other factors affecting issuers of California municipal securities than a trust that does not limit its investment to such issues. The state of California is currently in the midst of a severe economic recession.

This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.

The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee.

Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data

There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.The trust is more susceptible to political, economic, regulatory, or other factors affecting issuers of California municipal securities than a trust that does not limit its investment to such issues.
