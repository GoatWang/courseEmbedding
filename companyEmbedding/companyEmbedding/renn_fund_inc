RENN Capital Group, Inc.
				    PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
These policies are reviewed periodically by RENN Capital Group, Inc. (Group) and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.  A summary of Groups proxy voting policies are set forth below.  
Voting Procedures 

Groups assigned designee will determine which of its clients holds the security to which the proxy relates. In accordance with Groups voting guidelines, the assigned designee will determine how Group should vote routine proxies and will see that such is done in a timely and appropriate manner. The assigned designee will, prior to voting, consult Group portfolio managers regarding non-routine matters.  
Voting Guidelines 

In the absence of specific voting guidelines from the client, Group will vote proxies as it deems in the best interests of each particular client.  Group's policy is to vote all proxies from a specific issuer the same way for all clients holding such issue, except with regard to a client who has given specific instructions to the contrary.  Clients are permitted to place reasonable restrictions on Group's voting authority in the same manner that they may place restrictions on the actual selection of account securities. 
In reviewing proposals, Group will consider the opinion of management, the effect on managements effectiveness, and the effect on shareholder value and the issuers business practices. 
Group will generally vote in favor of routine corporate housekeeping proposals, such as the election of directors and selection of auditors, absent potential or asserted conflicts of interest raised by the portfolio managers or others. 
The assigned designee will consult with Group records, the Chief Compliance Officer and/or portfolio managers to try to verify whether there are any conflicts that exist between the interests of the client and Group or any of its employees as to any financial, business or personal relationship with the issuer. 
If a material conflict of interest exists, the assigned designee will consult the Chief Compliance Officer, who will determine whether it is appropriate to disclose the conflict to the affected clients, to give the clients an opportunity to vote the proxies themselves, or to address the voting issue through other objective means such as voting pursuant to a predetermined voting directive or obtaining an independent third-partys voting recommendation. 
Group will maintain a record of the voting resolution of any conflict of interest.

Finding Midas by Russell Cleveland

Written by Russell Cleveland, the principal founder and majority stockholder of RENN Capital Group,
Inc., Finding Midas focuses on a revolutionary and highly effective method for choosing the best
possible companies. His secret: look at the leadership. This unique approach highlights the impact of
a key individual on a companys successan excellent leader who believes in his or her organization,
has a personal stake in the business, and possesses the abilities and vision the market demandswhile
grounding the strategy with quantifiable, comparable and easily accessed measures to analyze the CEO
and the company.


Finding Midas explains Clevelands CEO assessment strategy in a manner that is accessible to
beginners, while containing insights that can benefit the most experienced investor. Filled with
plenty of relevant anecdotes, Finding Midas convincingly argues that the companies with the strongest
and most involved leaders are the ones that bring in the biggest profits for their investors.

What they are saying about Finding Midas
Every serious student of investing should read this book. It should be required reading for every
broker and advisor in business. Exposure to the ideas set forth would be invaluable to students in
helping jumpstart their knowledge and investing experience. Its a great read.
Don Hodges, chairman, Hodges Fund
Awarded 2006 Best Fund Manager by Lipper Analytical for three years among all U.S. multi-cap funds


As founder of the 30-year-old www.ceoclubs.org, with chapters around the world, I claim to know more
CEOs than anyone I know. But Russell Cleveland knows more about CEO wealth creation than anyone I
know. In this book, Russell tells you more about wealth creation focusing on CEOs than I have done in
25 books. Russell makes it understandable how the USAs entrepreneurial system could create the
extremes of Donald Trump and Warren Buffet. And its quick and easy to read. Enjoy.

--Joe Mancuso, chairman, CEO Clubs

Finding Midas addresses the most critical element of investing in fast-growing companiesthe
dedication and financial involvement of the CEO. Russell Clevelands book could become an investing
classicoriginal thought, simply put, backed up then by concrete illustrations that demonstrate how
this thesis works. As a CEO of a fast-growing public company, I aspire to the principles that the
Midas CEOs run their companies by. In this way, Finding Midas is also an excellent handbook for
entrepreneurial CEOs.

--Jonathan Merriman, chairman and CEO
Merriman Curthan Ford & Co., U.S. investments firm

  INTERVIEW
RENN Capital Group President and CEO Russell    Cleveland talks with the Opportunist’s Managing Editor Leslie Stone about his company’s      Founder-Owner concept of investing, which market sectors hold the most      promise and what it takes for entrepreneurs to succeed in today’s economy.
 
  

 
 
During his 50-year career in the  investment business, Russell Cleveland has learned that if the people at the  top of a publicly traded company are significant owners in the company’s stock,  that stock could possibly be a big winner. “I call it the Founder-Owner concept  and it’s real simple: invest only in companies where your senior management are  major stock owners because their interest and your interest are aligned,” he  explains. “Take Apple for example. If you had invested in Apple in 1997 when  Steve Jobs came back and it was trading at $3 per share, just think of the  gains you would have made at $3 to $600. If you made a $1,500 investment in  about 100 Walmart shares when Sam Walton took the company public in the 1970s,  you would own over 200,000 shares today worth over $10 million. We are talking  about mega gains with any amount of money you would have put in. It’s the same  with Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, Larry Ellison and Oracle Corp.,  Phil Knight and Nike and Starbucks with Howard Schultz. What I found is if  you’re patient and have a portfolio—and I say portfolio because if you pick  just one Founder-Owner stock it invariably will be the wrong one.” In other  words, if the Founder-Owners of a company are heavily invested in the company’s  stock they are going to do everything in their power to ensure the company’s  success. “Think back to when we had the big financial meltdown in 2008,”  Cleveland continues. “Only one automotive company didn’t need a bailout and  that was Ford Motor Co. Why? Because when times got tough the family-owners,  i.e., Ford family came through and the company didn’t need a bailout.  Meanwhile, the professional management at GM failed miserably. If I had my life  to do over again I would buy a portfolio of maybe 10 to 20 Founder-Owner stocks  and not really worry about what the Federal Reserve and the economists are  saying. I would be very patient and go with these people who continue to do  well. If in 1968 I had just invested say $25,000 into Berkshire Hathaway when  Warren Buffett took it over—and that was kind of a reverse takeover—I would  have over $100 million today.”
 
His concept does require due  diligence, Cleveland says, because management will often show up as owners when  they really only have stock options. “Founder-Owners are people who have their  own money at stake. People take care of their own money better than other  people’s money. Founder-Owner is a very interesting concept. It’s something  that, just like with anything else, you’ve just got to know how to do it. You  cannot be scared out of your stocks. You have to be patient because it’s a  long-term strategy, but it does work.”
 
Cleveland and associate, Eric  Stephens, have been running an index at RENN Capital that is based on the  Founder-Owner concept.  He says as of June 30, 2013 it is up 144 percent  over the past three years when compared to the Russell 2000 at 75 percent and  the S&P at 68 percent. “We don’t publish our index but we could,” he says.  “We have 279 companies in the index, including big companies, mid-size and  small. If you had been investing with this index over 10 years you would be up  228 percent. You would have done best in midcaps because the last 10 years  haven’t been as good for the smaller companies. The point I want to make is if  you are patient and invest in a portfolio as opposed to simply picking the  popular stock of today, then you have the probability of doing well.”
 
Opportunist: How  did you get into the investment business?
 
Russell Cleveland: I  grew up in El Paso and attended El Paso High School, where I played tennis and  music. Quite by luck, a gentleman from the University of Pennsylvania came to  town and said he thought I would do great at the Wharton School and offered to  help me get a scholarship. As fate would have it, I ended up there and was  captain of the tennis team and graduated in 1961 with a plan to go on to law  school. Then I took an introductory course on the study of law and thanked the  professor because I decided I definitely wasn’t going into law. After  graduation I went to work for Kidder, Peabody & Co., an old-line brokerage  firm that had underwritten AT&T and companies like that. That was back in  the old partnership days. I had a good experience there and met a lot of  interesting people and learned a lot. In 1964, after several years at Kidder,  Peabody & Co., I came to Dallas and I have been here ever since. I joined  several regional firms, the largest of which was Rauscher Pierce—now part of  the Royal Bank of Canada—where I was head of the research department.   It’s astounding how few firms that were around 50 years ago are still here  today.
 
Opportunist: Please  tell us about RENN Capital Group.
 
Russell Cleveland:  I founded  Renaissance Capital Group, which is now RENN Capital Group, in 1972. We have  been around for 41 years and have always been an investor manager, primarily  handling private partnerships for wealthy families and individuals in the $5  million to $20 million range. This has been very successful for us. We would  get X dollars and we would invest and work with these companies and five years  later we would liquidate and everybody would go to the bank. In recent years  our focus has been on closed-end funds. We have been involved in a substantial  fund in Great Britain for a number of years. We have never been a mutual fund  manager company in the sense of open-end funds; we tend to focus on smaller  entrepreneur funds that invest in 10, 20 or 30 companies and then liquidate and  pay our investors cash returns. Our main business here has always been  investment management and helping companies go from point A to point B. Of  course, we have had some companies that haven’t succeeded. Our specialty is  small-cap growth areas or microcap companies—early stage or later stage—under  $500 million. That is all we really do—and turnarounds too. We have never  invested in large caps such as AT&T.
 
Opportunist: You  are known for your optimistic approach to the market. Why is that?
 
Russell Cleveland: I  think optimism always works better than pessimism—unless you are writing a  book.  I prefer the word realist. If you want to start companies  and make money and succeed in this world, you have to be optimistic to make  things happen. Pessimism has very rarely worked in the stock market or in  business.
 
Opportunist: What  are some of your best-performing small-cap stocks?
 
Russell Cleveland: One  of our best-performing stocks in the 1970s and early 1980s was a company called  Service Corporation. This was an NYSE listed company in the business of  acquiring funeral homes all over the U.S. Service Corp. eventually became the  largest provider of funeral and cemetery services in the country and its share  price went from $3 to over $300—100 times your money—and even became Peter  Lynch’s favorite stock at one point. We have been out of it a long time now,  but it was a very successful company for us. Another big winner for us in the  last decade was Laserscope, a California-based company that provides minimally  invasive surgical systems. We joined the party and invested money when the  stock was about $1.20 on the board. The stock went as high as $40 and the  company sold for $34 a share.
 
Opportunist: What  is your favorite market sector?
 
Russell Cleveland: We  have always been interested in technology—particularly medical technology—and  Laserscope is an example of something that worked very well for us. I could go  on and on … we have obviously had some companies that were unsuccessful—usually  due to a management problem. We are looking for companies that can grow rapidly  given X amount of money.
 
There are new entrepreneurs coming  in all the time and lots of them are in the connected world of Facebook and  Google and things of that nature.  I believe we have moved from the  Industrial Age to the Knowledge Age, meaning computers and software, and now we  are in the Connect Age. This is very important when looking at investments. The  Internet is something very new and exciting.
 
Opportunist: What does it take for an entrepreneur and/or small business to succeed in      today’s market?
 
  Russell Cleveland: First,      you need a good idea and a unique product or service that has some special      advantage in the marketplace. What’s great about today is the Internet and      this whole Internet connected world that gives companies the ability to      grow rapidly through worldwide distribution.  To be successful, you have to know how to run a business,  generate revenues and control costs. Most of all, you have to be willing to  meet challenges because there’s some type of challenge almost every single day.  The late British historian Arnold Toynbee said all history is about meeting challenges—challenge  and response. Your success is dependent upon how willing you are to do whatever  it takes in terms of commitment and challenges. Some entrepreneurs can meet  challenges and others cannot, but the most successful entrepreneurs meet  challenges head on.  Failing is part of winning and if you’re afraid to  fail you will never do anything. You have to fail sometimes before you can win.  Think of it as a game where sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. Nobody  wins 100 percent of the time in sports. I have never lost a golf tournament and  there’s one reason why: I have never played one. 
You must give value in your product  or service and you also must receive value back, i.e., positive cash flow  because, no matter what Wall Street says, from time to time profits do  matter.  Making a dollar and losing a nickel won’t make you  successful. Most successful entrepreneurs I know also have a knack for working  with and managing other people. They understand that their most valuable asset  is their team and they reward their team.
 
Opportunist: As a  portfolio manager and investor, what’s your greatest fear in the markets right  now?
 
Russell Cleveland: Well,  the greatest fear is government itself. At the Federal level, we are spending a  whole lot more than we are taking in. The government is out of control. There’s  a litany of agencies that keep getting bigger and bigger and are a drain on the  economy. Look at the IRS, the FCC and the EPA, for example. And then there is  the whole entitlements program, such as retirements and so forth, and many of  those are good programs and necessary, but we need to balance the money we take  in. Obamacare is a bad threat and the average person has no idea how bad that  will become. We really must get control of government spending.  Bigger  deficits and bigger government means that economic growth is going to be  stifled.
 
Opportunist: Do you  believe America’s manufacturing base can make a comeback?
 
Russell Cleveland: My  view is that we probably aren’t ever going back to where we were because our  labor costs are just way too high. Take Apple, for example. Apple products are  designed in California but made in China. I have traveled extensively in China  and visited a lot of factories there, and I seriously doubt we could make an  Apple product in California and remain competitive. It would be great to get  manufacturing back and if you can manufacture with automation then we can  certainly be competitive. We do have people who know how to do automation. In  terms of the connected economy, we are the leaders in the whole Internet space  and I believe we can continue to dominate that.
 
Opportunist: What  inspired you to write your book Finding Midas: The Way to Mega Stock Gains  and how long did it take to complete the project?
 
Russell Cleveland: My  book came out in 2007, and it’s a very quick read based upon the idea of CEO  investing. I don’t think we used the term Founder-Owner in the book, but we do  prefer that term because most people think entrepreneur means venture  capitalist. But Warren Buffett is not in venture capital. It took me quite a  while to get all these ideas down on paper. If I could start life over again, I  would focus on the central theme of entrepreneur investing and use a checklist.
 
Opportunist: What  type of checklist?
 
Russell Cleveland: I  would find out if the CEO and the management team are significant owners in the  company. Is the company profitable and reasonably priced? You only need four or  five items on your checklist to be successful … but you need patience. If  you’re the type of investor who gets up every morning and reads the headlines  and listens to the economists, you will be scared right out of your  investments.  Investing based on a Founder-Owner approach has become a  labor of love and I only wish I had known this many years ago.
 
Opportunist: Who  inspired your success?
 
Russell Cleveland: I  would say there are many people who gave me a real start in life. My mother was  one of them. My father flew in a B-24 in World War II and never really  recovered. I was never a good student until a teacher in the fourth grade  recognized my work and gave me a star on a little project. It’s hard to believe  that something so trivial made me realize that it’s much easier to succeed,  whether in college or business or life in general, but it did and I just kept  on going. There is a music professorship in my name at the University of Texas  at Dallas. I became involved in the guitar world and got to know most of the  great classical guitarists like Pepe Romero, David Russell and Eliot Fisk. In  1981, when I had been in business for 20 years, I sent thank-you notes and an  inexpensive gold watch to the Top 20 people who had helped me—people from my  college days as well as Kidder, Peabody & Co. and Rauscher Pierce and  everywhere in between. I could come up with 20 more people to thank in the last  10 years alone.  On October 1, 2013, I am launching World Connect Day. The  concept is to appreciate and thank those who have helped you.
 
Opportunist: What  are your thoughts on America’s economic recovery?
 
Russell Cleveland: I  believe there will likely be some downdrafts where people will be shocked that  we aren’t doing better, but I still see the U.S. economy kind of muddling  through until we get a better handle on government spending and government growth.  The country has fallen into this whole idea that fairness means socialism and  is so focused on taxing people that it doesn’t have a clue how to get  entrepreneurs going. It’s hard to create jobs when you hate the job creators.  That’s the mindset we’ve got in Washington, and that’s hampering economic  growth. What we need are opportunities for everybody. I believe the American  Dream is intact.  People need to be proactive and start thinking about  hiring someone else instead of someone hiring them. Be a job creator.  I  am quite optimistic about where we are, and I believe there are great  opportunities. You just have to think differently and stay attuned to new  industries.
 
I believe we are in a 10-year  primary bull market that started about 2008 and will continue with periodic  downdrafts. We spent about 10 years in a bear market—NASDAQ hit 4,800 in 2000  and it’s only up to 3,600 more than a dozen years later. We are nowhere near  where we were a decade ago. The trick is to make sure you ride along and don’t  get scared out of your stocks. I am seeing the market very optimistically  during the next two or three years.
 
Opportunist: We  understand you do a lot of work with entrepreneurs.
 
Russell Cleveland: Yes,  I do an annual Entrepreneurial Leadership Seminar at Southern Methodist  University for MBA graduate students. It’s all about starting businesses, how  to get going and what to look for and so forth. I put this on with several  other gentlemen, and it is such an interesting topic that we are among the  highest ranked speakers at SMU.
 
I also serve on a number of boards.  One of the successful companies I am associated with is AnchorFree. They offer  a service that protects your privacy online and make sure that no one, from  Google to the government, will know who you are. Go to their website, 
Zwww.anchorfree.com, and check it  out. Once we became involved, the company started thinking about making money  every day, they became very successful and currently have about 150 million  downloads worldwide. Many users are in the Middle East and China. During that  recent ordeal in Turkey where the government was going after people in the  park, 120,000 downloads were made in just one day.  The company’s  Founder-Owner is David Gorodyansky. He came from Russia and founded the company  in the Silicon Valley at age 23.
 
Opportunist: What  do you enjoy most about your work?
 
Russell Cleveland: Working  with companies that are succeeding.  I believe I have gotten better at  meeting challenges. I love working with companies and making money for  investors, including myself—but I must tell you that I am not attached to money  in terms of owning yachts and other expensive toys.  What inspires me the  most is seeing things succeed and working with management. I admit that it’s  fun to go to the bank every once in a while—it’s all part of the game—and I  love playing the game. I really do.  I have always said my epitaph should  read: ‘Lifetime Student.’  Let’s all keep being students.

Invest Like a Fund ManagerRussell Cleveland, Closed-End Fund Director, Shares Secrets of CEO Investing


Russell Cleveland, the author of Finding Midas, explains his investment strategies in a video that can be accessed by clicking on his picture. 

Dallas, Texas, September 25, 2007 (Business Wire) As a Chartered Financial Analyst with over 35 years of experience specializing in small cap companies, Russell Cleveland is uniquely qualified to author a book on investing. His new book, Finding Midas: Investing in Entrepreneurial CEOs with the Golden Touch, should be "required reading for every broker and advisor in the business," according to Don Hodges, Chairman of the Hodges Fund.
No matter the experience level, anybody with an interest in investing is sure to get much out of this book. Mr. Cleveland has developed a revolutionary method of analyzing companies - look at the CEO. He contends that the companies with the strongest and most involved leaders are the ones that will prevail in both good times and bad. He calls these "mega-stocks" that can return tens to hundreds of times your investment.
"The key to mega-stock investing is not focusing on the industry, but rather on the entrepreneurial leadership characteristics of the CEO. . . You might just find the next Wal-Mart, Starbucks, or eBay," according to the author.


How does one determine if the CEO is investment worthy? Cleveland outlines four major criteria that must be met:
·         The CEO and management must have a major stake in the business. 
·         There must be a clear vision with above-average growth prospects. 
·         The company must be profitable. 
·         The valuation must be reasonable.
One of the keys of this investment method is performing due diligence on the management team. Are their goals aligned with those of the shareholders? If they are shareholders themselves, then the answer is yes. Mr. Cleveland makes a distinction between CEOs who are rewarded with options and those who actually use their own dollars to invest in the company - those who have "skin in the game."
Leadership is a key trait exhibited by all successful entrepreneurial CEOs. The ability to get the entire company to buy in can make the difference between success and failure. In the book there are numerous suggestions on how to find strong entrepreneurial CEOs today as well as some red flags to be cautious of.  
The book also identifies common traps that investors fall into, such as buying stocks that are overvalued and having a short-term investment mentality. The author likens these investment tactics as the equivalent of shooting craps in Las Vegas.  
The book concludes with 10 case studies of winning entrepreneurs who have driven their companies and their valuations - to the top. By analyzing the case studies and applying the principles and strategies detailed in the book, investors may have an opportunity to improve the performance of their investment dollar.
