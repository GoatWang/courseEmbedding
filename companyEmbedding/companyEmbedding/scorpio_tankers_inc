Scorpio Tankers Merges with Navig8 Product Tankers  

By Aiswarya Lakshmi
May 24, 2017




Photo: Scorpio Tankers Inc


 Scorpio Tankers has entered into definitive agreements to merge with Navig8 Product Tankers  and acquire Navig8’s 27 operating product tankers.  
Subject to the terms and conditions of these agreements, Scorpio will acquire four LR1 tankers prior to the closing of the Merger (the LR1 Vessel Acquisitions) and the remaining 23 tankers upon the closing of the merger in exchange for the issuance of 55 million shares of Scorpio common stock to the Navig8 shareholders. 
 
In connection with the LR1 vessel acquisitions, Scorpio will pay cash consideration of $42.2 million, which is net of assumed debt. This cash is expected to remain with Navig8 through closing and will form part of the balance sheet of the combined company, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement.
 
Through the merger, Scorpio is acquiring an operating fleet of 27 eco-design product tankers, comprised of 15 LR2s and 12 LR1s with a weighted average age of 0.9 years and an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately 2.6 million dwt. 
 
Following the completion of the merger, on a fully delivered basis, Scorpio’s operating fleet will consist of 105 owned or finance leased tankers (38 LR2 tankers, 12 LR1 tankers, 41 MR tankers and 14 Handymax tankers) with a weighted average age of approximately 1.9 years, and 19 time or bareboat chartered-in tankers (one LR2 tanker, nine MR tankers and nine Handymax tankers). 
 
In addition, Scorpio has contracts for the construction of six newbuilding MR product tankers expected to be delivered to them throughout the remainder of 2017 and first quarter of 2018. Scorpio has also entered into an agreement to sell two MR product tankers, which is expected to close in June 2017. 
 
According to Scorpio, certain Navig8 shareholders have agreed to vote their Navig8 shares in favor of the merger, subject to certain exceptions. These shareholders constitute a majority of Navig8’s  outstanding common shares and, accordingly, it is expected that the merger will be approved.

Scorpio said it will appoint one additional independent director that will be selected by Scorpio’s board of directors and to be effective at the closing of the merger.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Scorpio Tankers Announces Information on Its Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release




















July 26, 2017 16:15 ET

 | Source: Scorpio Tankers Inc.






MONACO, July  26, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scorpio Tankers Inc. (NYSE:STNG) (“Scorpio Tankers” or the “Company”) announced today that it will release its second quarter 2017 earnings later in the third quarter as a result of the pending merger with Navig8 Product Tankers Inc (“NPTI”).    Prior to the release of second quarter earnings, the Company will issue a press release announcing the date of the second quarter earnings release and the related quarterly conference call. On May 23, 2017, the Company announced that it had entered into definitive agreements to merge with NPTI (the “Merger”).  In conjunction with the Merger, the Company agreed to purchase four subsidiaries of NPTI, each of which owned an LR1 tanker (the “LR1 Vessels”), and on June 14, 2017, the Company completed the purchase of the entities that own the LR1 Vessels. The Merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017 and is subject to the completion of certain customary conditions, including without limitation, the approval of the Merger by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of NPTI, the registration statement filed with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by Scorpio Tankers to register its shares of common stock to be issued as consideration in the Merger becoming effective under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the listing of such shares on the New York Stock Exchange. About Scorpio Tankers Inc.Scorpio Tankers is a provider of marine transportation of petroleum products worldwide. Scorpio Tankers currently owns 82 product tankers (23 LR2, four LR1, 41 MR and 14 Handymax tankers) with an average age of 2.4 years and time or bareboat charters-in 20 product tankers (two LR2s, nine MRs and nine Handymax tankers). Scorpio Tankers has contracted for four newbuilding MR product tankers, which are expected to be delivered throughout the remainder of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. The Company has also entered into a merger agreement with NPTI to acquire 23 product tankers (eight LR1 and 15 LR2 tankers), which is expected to close during the third quarter of 2017.  Additional information about Scorpio Tankers is available at Scorpio Tankers’ website www.scorpiotankers.com, which is not a part of this press release. About Navig8 Product Tankers IncNPTI is a Marshall Islands corporation formed for the purpose of acquiring and operating LR1 and LR2 tankers with fuel-efficient specifications and carrying capacities between 74,000 dwt and 113,000 dwt in the international product tanker market. Following the sale of 4 LR1 tankers to Scorpio Tankers, NPTI currently has a fleet of 23 eco-design product tankers (15 LR2 and 8 LR1 tankers). These vessels were financed through bank debt, sale leaseback transactions and cash on hand. All of NPTI’s vessels are operated in pools managed by the Navig8 Group. Forward-Looking StatementsMatters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts. Scorpio Tankers desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “project,” “likely,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “could” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management’s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in company records and other data available from third parties. Although management believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond the company’s control, there can be no assurance that Scorpio Tankers will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections. The Company undertake no obligation, and specifically decline any obligation, except as required by law, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition to these important factors, other important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the ability of Scorpio Tankers to successfully complete the proposed merger on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining required shareholder and regulatory approvals, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the new combined company’s operations and other conditions to the completion of the acquisition, risks relating to the integration of NPTI’s operations and the possibility that the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the proposed acquisition will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframe, the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the merger, the failure of counterparties to fully perform their contracts with us, the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions, including fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values, changes in demand for tanker vessel capacity, changes in our operating expenses, including bunker prices, drydocking and insurance costs, the market for our vessels, availability of financing and refinancing, charter counterparty performance, ability to obtain financing and comply with covenants in such financing arrangements, changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities, potential liability from pending or future litigation, general domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents or political events, vessels breakdowns and instances of off-hires, and other factors. Please see Scorpio Tankers’ filings with the SEC for a more complete discussion of certain of these and other risks and uncertainties. Scorpio Tankers Inc. 212-542-1616

About Navig8 Product Tankers Inc. NPTI is a Marshall Islands corporation formed for the purpose of acquiring and operating LR1 and LR2 tankers with fuel-efficient specifications and carrying capacities between 74,000 dwt and 113,000 dwt in the international product tanker market. Following the sale of 4 LR1 tankers to Scorpio Tankers, NPTI currently has a fleet of 23 eco-design product tankers (15 LR2 and 8 LR1 tankers). These vessels were financed through bank debt, sale leaseback transactions and cash on hand. All of NPTI’s vessels are operated in pools managed by the Navig8 Group. Forward-Looking Statements Matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts. Scorpio Tankers desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “project,” “likely,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “could” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management’s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in company records and other data available from third parties. Although management believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond the company’s control, there can be no assurance that Scorpio Tankers will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections. The Company undertake no obligation, and specifically decline any obligation, except as required by law, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition to these important factors, other important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the ability of Scorpio Tankers to successfully complete the proposed merger on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining required shareholder and regulatory approvals, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the new combined company’s operations and other conditions to the completion of the acquisition, risks relating to the integration of NPTI’s operations and the possibility that the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the proposed acquisition will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframe, the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the merger, the failure of counterparties to fully perform their contracts with us, the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions, including fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values, changes in demand for tanker vessel capacity, changes in our operating expenses, including bunker prices, drydocking and insurance costs, the market for our vessels, availability of financing and refinancing, charter counterparty performance, ability to obtain financing and comply with covenants in such financing arrangements, changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities, potential liability from pending or future litigation, general domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents or political events, vessels breakdowns and instances of off-hires, and other factors. Please see Scorpio Tankers’ filings with the SEC for a more complete discussion of certain of these and other risks and uncertainties. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR INVESTORS In connection with the proposed Merger of Scorpio Tankers and NPTI, Scorpio Tankers has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a registration statement on Form F–4(File No. 333-218478) that constitutes a prospectus of Scorpio Tankers and includes a proxy statement of NPTI.  Scorpio Tankers also plans to file other relevant documents with the SEC regarding the proposed Merger. INVESTORS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC IF AND WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE, BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION. You may obtain a free copy of the proxy statement/prospectus (if and when it becomes available) and other relevant documents filed by Scorpio with the SEC at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

Scorpio Tankers To Delay Second Quarter Results Announcement on Pending Merger with Navig8 Product Tankers

in  International Shipping News
28/07/2017




Scorpio Tankers Inc. announced that it will release its second quarter 2017 earnings later in the third quarter as a result of the pending merger with Navig8 Product Tankers Inc (“NPTI”). Prior to the release of second quarter earnings, the Company will issue a press release announcing the date of the second quarter earnings release and the related quarterly conference call.
On May 23, 2017, the Company announced that it had entered into definitive agreements to merge with NPTI (the “Merger”). In conjunction with the Merger, the Company agreed to purchase four subsidiaries of NPTI, each of which owned an LR1 tanker (the “LR1 Vessels”), and on June 14, 2017, the Company completed the purchase of the entities that own the LR1 Vessels.

The Merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017 and is subject to the completion of certain customary conditions, including without limitation, the approval of the Merger by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of NPTI, the registration statement filed with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by Scorpio Tankers to register its shares of common stock to be issued as consideration in the Merger becoming effective under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the listing of such shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Scorpio Tankers is a provider of marine transportation of petroleum products worldwide. Scorpio Tankers currently owns 82 product tankers (23 LR2, four LR1, 41 MR and 14 Handymax tankers) with an average age of 2.4 years and time or bareboat charters-in 20 product tankers (two LR2s, nine MRs and nine Handymax tankers). Scorpio Tankers has contracted for four newbuilding MR product tankers, which are expected to be delivered throughout the remainder of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. The Company has also entered into a merger agreement with NPTI to acquire 23 product tankers (eight LR1 and 15 LR2 tankers), which is expected to close during the third quarter of 2017.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Finance & Economy, Headlines, Tankers, The Wire, Top Stories 





 



Scorpio Tankers expanded its board from eight to nine members with the addition of Merrick Rayner, who has served over forty years in the tanker brokering business.
The relevant SEC filing reads:
On July 17, 2017, Scorpio Tankers Inc. (the “Company”) increased the size of its Board of Directors from eight to nine members and appointed Mr. Merrick Rayner to serve as a Class I Director, effective upon the closing of the Company’s previously announced merger with Navig8 Product Tankers Inc.
