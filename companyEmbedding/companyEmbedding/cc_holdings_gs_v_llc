                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

         10-Q: CC HOLDINGS GS V LLC

Published: Nov 8, 2013 5:26 p.m. ET

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the response to Part I, Item 1 of this report and the 2012 Financial Statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" ("MD&A") included in the Prospectus. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Form 10-Q have the same meaning given to them in the Prospectus. Unless this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q indicates otherwise or the context requires, the terms "we," "our," "our company," "the company," or "us" as used herein refer to CC Holdings GS V LLC and its subsidiaries. General Overview   We expect wireless carriers will continue their focus on improving network quality and expanding capacity by adding additional antennas and other equipment on our wireless infrastructure. We expect existing and potential new wireless carrier demand for our towers will result from (1) next generation technologies, (2) continued development of mobile internet applications, (3) adoption of other emerging and embedded wireless devices, (4) increasing smartphone penetration, (5) wireless carrier focus on expanding data coverage and capacity and (6) the availability of additional spectrum. Substantially all of our towers can accommodate another tenant, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the structure.   U.S. wireless carriers are expected to continue to invest in their networks.   Our site rental revenues grew $10.0 million, or 2%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2012 to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Our site rental revenue growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was impacted by the fact that we have effectively pre-sold via a firm contractual commitment a significant portion of the modification of the existing installations relating to certain LTE upgrades. We have done so by increasing the future contracted revenue including a higher than typical escalation over a period of time, typically a three to four year period (as evidenced by a weighted average escalation (weighted on revenues) of approximately 4%). As a result, for any given period, the increase in cash rental receipts may not translate into a corresponding increase in reported revenues from the application of straight-line revenue recognition. We do not expect any of our customers' network enhancement deployments, recent customer consolidations and any related non-renewal of customer contracts anticipated in 2014 and 2015, including Sprint's Network Vision and corresponding non-renewal of iDEN leases, will have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows for 2013 and subsequent periods.   Organizational Structure  Nov 08, 2013  (c) 1995-2013 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
