Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

 Educational Background



Undergraduate Degree 


Michigan State University

                  Michigan State University (MSU) is a public research university located in East Lansing, Michigan, United States and is the first land-grant institution that was created to serve as a model for future land-grant colleges in the country under the 1862 Morrill Act. Michigan State has been labeled one of the "Public Ivies," a publicly funded university considered as providing a quality of education comparable to those of the Ivy League.
Following the introduction of the Morrill Act, the college became coeducational and expanded its curriculum beyond agriculture. Today, MSU is the ninth-largest university in the United States, with 47,800 students and 2,954 faculty members.

Neogen Corp.


                  Founded in 1982, Neogen Corporation (NASDAQ: NEOG) has grown to more than 600 employees in multiple U.S. and international locations, and a worldwide presence. Neogen develops, manufactures and markets a diverse line of products dedicated to food and animal safety.

The Company’s Lansing, Mich.-based Food Safety Division develops and markets dehydrated culture media, and rapid diagnostic test kits to detect foodborne bacteria, spoilage organisms, mycotoxins, food allergens, genetic modifications, drug residues, plant diseases, and sanitation concerns. Neogen’s Lexington, Ky.-based Animal Safety Division develops and markets a complete line of diagnostics, veterinary instruments, veterinary pharmaceuticals, nutritional supplements, disinfectants, and rodenticides. Neogen’s GeneSeek subsidiary based in Lincoln, Neb., is the leading global provider of DNA testing for animal agribusiness and veterinary medicine.

Neogen understands that its customers face serious consequences if their products are contaminated with any of a number of well-established or emerging threats, including dangerous bacteria, natural toxins, veterinary drug residues, unlabeled food allergens, rodent filth, sanitation concerns, broken veterinary needles or other contaminants. Neogen excels at helping to identify safety concerns in the vast and changing landscape of food and animal safety.

Neogen sales representatives can help customers address a wide array of concern with a “one-stop shop” approach that is a big advantage in a business climate trending toward single-source suppliers. The company now has more than 200 diagnostic tests to offer customers, and a comprehensive line of complementary products and services, such as dehydrated culture media to go with unmatched customer support and training. Neogen employs a similar marketing strategy for its veterinary products, offering customers a wide variety of animal safety solutions.

Neogen believes that maintaining earned trust is a combination of innovation and a continuous commitment to quality. Neogen’s quality management system is ISO 9001 certified, which communicates to the company’s worldwide customer base that it understands the quality standards customers expect, and is firmly committed to achieving those quality standards.

In recognition of this success, Neogen has been repeatedly named to Forbes Magazine’s list of the Best Small Companies in America, and was chosen by the NASDAQ National Market to be included in its top tier of listed companies, the Global Select Market.

Michigan State University

                    Michigan State University (MSU) is a public research university located in East Lansing, Michigan, United States and is the first land-grant institution that was created to serve as a model for future land-grant colleges in the country under the 1862 Morrill Act. Michigan State has been labeled one of the "Public Ivies," a publicly funded university considered as providing a quality of education comparable to those of the Ivy League.
Following the introduction of the Morrill Act, the college became coeducational and expanded its curriculum beyond agriculture. Today, MSU is the ninth-largest university in the United States, with 47,800 students and 2,954 faculty members.
