Stonebriar Launches SCF Realty Capital, Mavoides to Lead

APR 19, 2016 - 7:23 am













 
 
 
Stonebriar Commercial Finance expanded its range of capital solutions with the creation of SCF Realty Capital, hiring Pete Mavoides as president of the new venture.
“Adding real estate financing and sale-leaseback capabilities to our capital solutions was the next logical step in the evolution of our company into a full-service capital provider” said Dave Fate, president and CEO of Stonebriar. “I am very pleased that an executive of Pete’s caliber and reputation has joined Stonebriar to help us build a market leading real estate capital solutions platform.”
Mavoides has more than 18 years of experience in the single tenant, net lease industry. He is the former president and COO of Spirit Realty Capital, a public company traded on the NYSE, where he helped to lead the company through its IPO while building the portfolio to over $8 billion in assets. Prior to that, he spent seven years as president and CEO of Sovereign Investment Company, a private equity firm focused on net leased real estate assets.
“In seeking to find a partner to grow a business focused on financing and owning single tenant operational real estate, Stonebriar stood out as having a clear competitive advantage due to the flexibility and availability of its capital and the ability to deliver a full range of financing products to its clients,” said Mavoides.
“I am very excited for Pete to be a part of the Stonebriar team” said Paul Bossidy, chairman of Stonebriar. “With his real estate and team building expertise, I am confident that Stonebriar will quickly become a leading, full-service capital provider to our target market, which is currently starved for creative capital solutions.”
Stonebriar is a privately held commercial finance company established in 2015 and based in Plano, TX. Since its inception in April 2015, Stonebriar has committed to in excess of $850 million in financings with over $700 million funded to date.
