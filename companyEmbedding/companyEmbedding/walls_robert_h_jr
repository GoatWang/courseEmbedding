Robert H. Walls, Jr. Joins Clear Channel as General Counsel | Business Wire
























































Robert H. Walls, Jr. Joins Clear Channel as General Counsel






December 29, 2009 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Clear Channel Communications, Inc. today announced that it has named 
      Robert H. Walls, Jr. as Executive Vice President and General Counsel, 
      effective January 1, 2010. Walls will oversee the Company’s legal and 
      government affairs activities and will report to Mark Mays, President 
      and CEO.
    


      Walls joins Clear Channel from Post Oak Energy Capital, a private equity 
      firm dedicated to investing equity and debt in energy and energy service 
      companies, where he is a Managing Director and a founding partner.
    

      “Rob is a seasoned legal professional who has the breadth and depth of 
      experience required to lead Clear Channel’s legal affairs,” said Mays. 
      “I am delighted to welcome Rob to the senior executive team and look 
      forward to having the benefit of his counsel and expertise.”
    

      “I am excited to join Clear Channel and work with Mark Mays and the 
      management team at this formative time for the Company. I look forward 
      to being part of the effort to help guide the Company’s key business 
      initiatives, meet legal requirements, and manage government affairs,” 
      said Walls.
    

      Previously, Walls was Executive Vice-President and General Counsel at 
      Enron Corp., and a member of its Chief Executive Office. In this role, 
      Walls helped lead a restructuring that dealt with approximately 25,000 
      claims in excess of $900 billion, the coordination of two 
      court-appointed bankruptcy examiners, the selection and transition of 
      two boards of directors, and the confirmation of a Plan of 
      Reorganization within three years of the filing. From 1999 until Enron's 
      bankruptcy, Walls was Managing Director and General Counsel of Enron 
      Global Assets and Services and Deputy General Counsel of Enron, where he 
      was responsible for the legal affairs of all of Enron's domestic and 
      international energy infrastructure assets. Prior to his Enron 
      experience, Walls was a lawyer at Vinson & Elkins LLP where he practiced 
      energy, finance and international law.
    

      Walls serves on the boards of The Texas Children's Cancer Center, West 
      Houston Young Life and The Chinquapin School. He received both his 
      Bachelor of Business Administration and his Juris Doctor, with honors, 
      from the University of Texas. He will be based in the Company’s 
      headquarters in San Antonio, TX.
