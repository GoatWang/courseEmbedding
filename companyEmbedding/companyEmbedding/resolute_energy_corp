Short Interest Drops 10.8% For REN
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 06/30/2017 settlement date, which shows a 706,149 share decrease in total short interest for Resolute Energy Corp , to 5,827,654, a decrease of 10.81% since 06/15/2015. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

In recent trading, shares of Resolute Energy Corp have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $44.67, changing hands for $45.01/share.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Corporate profile	

Resolute Energy Corporation is a leading operator in the Delaware Basin of West Texas, one of the most prolific and economic oil producing basins in the United States.




Our 16,300 net acres and 375 plus potential development locations in Reeves County Texas are concentrated, operated and have been substantially de-risked by drilling.  We focus on drilling mid and long length laterals in the Wolfcamp formation and Resolute wells have been recognized as some of the best in the basin.
Our first quarter production makes us one of the larger producers in the basin and with the completion of recently announced or planned divestitures Resolute will be one of a very few pure play Delaware Basin producers with industry leading organic production growth and well level economics.  Resolute is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “REN”.
