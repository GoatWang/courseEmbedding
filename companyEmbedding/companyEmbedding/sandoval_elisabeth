LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--KYTHERA 
      Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (KYTHERA), a privately-held biotechnology 
      company focused on the development and commercialization of prescription 
      products in aesthetic medicine, today announced the appointment of 
      Elisabeth Sandoval as Chief Commercial Officer.
    


      Elisabeth brings more than 25 years of pharmaceutical and medical device 
      experience to KYTHERA. She spent more than 20 years at Allergan, where 
      she held roles of increasing responsibility that spanned from research 
      and development to sales and marketing. Her tenure at Allergan included 
      the role of Vice President of Global Strategic Marketing for Allergan 
      Medical where she built a high performance marketing team and drove the 
      launch of JUVÉDERM®, the market-leading dermal filler, and 
      led the global marketing team for BOTOX® Cosmetic, LATISSE®, 
      Natrelle® breast implants and LAP-BAND®1. Her 
      extensive aesthetic marketing leadership expertise is grounded by early 
      career experience in Field Sales Management and as a Clinical Research 
      Associate. Elisabeth joins KYTHERA from Bausch + Lomb Surgical where she 
      most recently served as Vice President, Global Marketing & Strategy. She 
      began her career in research and development at Johnson & Johnson’s 
      Ethicon division. Elisabeth earned a BS in Biology from the University 
      of California, Irvine, and an MBA from Pepperdine University.
    

      “Elisabeth’s depth of aesthetics industry experience coupled with her 
      proven leadership in marketing strategy and execution make her ideally 
      suited to lead the KYTHERA commercial team,” said Keith Leonard, 
      KYTHERA’s President and CEO. “We hope our continued clinical 
      investigation of ATX-101 will ultimately lead to a safe, effective and 
      approved treatment for the reduction of facial fat under the chin, known 
      as submental fat. We are excited to welcome Elisabeth to KYTHERA, and 
      are confident she will be a valuable addition to our already strong 
      management team.”

BOTHELL, Wash., Sept.  06, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALDR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing monoclonal antibody therapeutics, today announced the appointment of Elisabeth A. Sandoval as chief commercial officer. Ms. Sandoval will be responsible for the further development and execution of the commercial strategy for ALD403, the company’s pivotal-stage product candidate for the prevention of migraine. “We are delighted to welcome Elisabeth as our chief commercial officer. She is a proven executive with extensive experience building and leading commercial teams and programs for physicians and consumers and she is also accomplished in launching into a new market segment with a novel drug product,” said Randall C. Schatzman, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer. “As we progress ALD403 toward an FDA submission and our goal of marketing a best-in-class migraine prevention antibody therapy, we look forward to leveraging Elisabeth’s creativity and expertise to advance our commercialization strategy, build a specialty sales force and successfully market ALD403, if approved, to the millions of migraine sufferers in the U.S. that are candidates for prevention therapy.” Ms. Sandoval brings 30 years of experience in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry spanning research and development, sales management, marketing strategy, and commercial launch planning and execution. Most recently, she served as the chief commercial officer of Kythera Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. where she built a commercial team from the ground up for the successful U.S. launch of KYBELLA, a first in class drug product that created a new market segment. Prior to joining Kythera in 2012, Ms. Sandoval served as vice president of global marketing and strategy at Bausch + Lomb Surgical. From 1988 to 2010, she held roles of increasing responsibility at Allergan including global vice president, strategic marketing and senior director of global strategic marketing, which included responsibility for multiple products including Botox® for neurological and other disorders. She began her career in research and development at Ethicon, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. Ms. Sandoval holds a bachelor’s degree in biology from the University of California, Irvine, and an MBA from Pepperdine University. About Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and seeks to commercialize genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies with the potential to meaningfully transform current treatment paradigms. Alder's lead pivotal-stage product candidate, ALD403, is being evaluated for migraine prevention. ALD403 is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a protein that is active in mediating the initiation of migraine. Alder is additionally evaluating ALD1910, a preclinical product candidate also in development as a migraine prevention therapy. ALD1910 is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38), another protein that is active in mediating the initiation of migraine.
