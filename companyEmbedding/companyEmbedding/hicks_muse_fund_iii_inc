History[edit]
Hicks & Haas[edit]
The son of a Texas radio station owner, Tom Hicks became interested in leveraged buyouts as a member of First National Bank's venture capital group. Hicks and Robert Haas formed Hicks & Haas in 1984; the next year that firm bought Hicks Communications, a radio outfit run by Hicks' brother Steven. (This would be the first of several media companies bought or created by the buyout firm that involved Steven Hicks.)
Hicks & Haas' biggest coup was its mid-1980s acquisition of several soft drink makers, including Dr Pepper and 7 Up. The firm took Dr Pepper/7 Up public just 18 months after merging the two companies. In all, Hicks & Haas turned an $88 million investment funding into $1.3 billion. The pair split up in 1989; Hicks wanted to raise a large pool to invest, but Haas preferred to work deal by deal. Robert Haas went on to form Haas Wheat & Partners a middle market private equity firm based in Dallas.
Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst (HMTF)[edit]

Hicks raised $250 million in 1989 and teamed with former Prudential Securities banker John Muse to form Hicks Muse. Early investments included Life Partners Group (life insurance, 1990; sold 1996). In 1991 Morgan Stanley's Charles Tate and First Boston's Jack Furst became partners.
As part of its buy-and-build strategy, Hicks Muse bought DuPont's connector systems unit in 1993, renamed it Berg Electronics, added six more companies to it, and doubled its earnings before selling it in 1998. Not every acquisition was successful for Hicks Muse. Less-than-successful purchases included bankrupt brewer G. Heileman Brewing Company of La Crosse, Wisconsin, bought in 1994 and sold two years later for an almost $100 million loss.
The buyout firm's Chancellor Media radio company went public in 1996. That year Hicks Muse gained entry into Latin America with its purchases of cash-starved Mexican companies, including Seguros Commercial America, one of the country's largest insurers. That year also brought International Home Foods (Jiffy Pop, Chef Boyardee) into the Hicks Muse fold.
In 1997 Chancellor and Evergreen Media merged to form Chancellor Media (renamed AMFM in 1999). The next year Hicks Muse continued buying US and Latin American media companies, as well as a few oddities (a UK software maker, a Danish seed company, and US direct-seller Home Interiors and Gifts). Hicks Muse and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts merged their cinema operations to form the US's largest theater chain, Regal Cinemas. Regal would file for bankruptcy protection in 2001. The company that year also moved into the depressed energy field (Triton Energy) and formed a $1.5 billion European fund.
Acquisitions in 1999 included UK food group Hillsdown Holdings, one-third of Mexican flour maker Grupo Minsa, and (just in time for millennial celebrations) popular champagne brands Mumm and Perrier-Jouët (it quadrupled its investment when it sold the champagne houses in late 2000). Lured by low stock prices on real estate investment trusts (REITs), the company agreed to buy Walden (formerly Walden Residential Properties) that year.
Hicks Muse, along with UK-based Apax Partners, bought British Telecom's yellow page directory business Yell Group for roughly $3.5 billion, making it the largest non-corporate LBO in European history. Yell subsequently acquired US directories publisher McLeodUSA for about $600 million, and floated in 2003.
Hicks Muse acquired Nestlé's Ambient Food Business in 2002, which added well-known UK brands Crosse & Blackwell, Branston Pickle, Chivers (marmalade), Sun-Pat (peanut butter), Gale's (honey), Sarson's (vinegar) and Rowntree's (jelly) to the Premier Foods stable. Cereal maker Weetabix Limited and Unilever's cast-offs Ambrosia (creamed rice and puddings) and Brown & Polson, rounded out Premier Foods' portfolio in 2003.
Acquisitions in 2004 included Kerns Oil & Gas (renamed Blackbrush Energy -- natural gas production), Persona (Canadian cable television company), Regency Gas Services (gas processing and distribution), and Centennial Puerto Rico Cable TV (Puerto Rican cable television company). It also agreed to buy a majority stake in trendy luxury shoemaker Jimmy Choo.[1] Disposals during the year included the company's remaining stake in Yell and its stake in Premier Foods.
In May 2005, Sturm Foods was acquired by HM Capital Partners. Located in Manawa, Wisconsin, Sturm Foods specializes in manufacturing of bulk goods such as oatmeal and markets several sugar free products under private labels.
HM Capital and Successors[edit]
Hicks Muse struggled in the years immediately following the bursting of the internet and telecom bubbles was often cited with Forstmann Little as the highest profile private equity casualties, having invested heavily in technology and telecommunications companies.[2] The firm's reputation and market position were both damaged by the loss of over $1 billion from minority investments in six telecommunications and 13 Internet companies at the peak of the 1990s stock market bubble as well as several traditional buyouts that ended in bankruptcy (e.g., Regal Cinemas, Viasystems Group, International Wire.[3][4][5]
Tom Hicks resigned from Hicks Muse at the end of 2004 and was replaced at the helm by co-founder John Muse. Hicks would go on to found Hicks Holdings LLC. Charles Tate resigned from Hicks Muse in 2002.[6]
In January 2005, the company's European arm, separated from Hicks Muse to form Lion Capital LLP, which has since raised over $4 billion across two private equity funds.
In March 2006, Hicks Muse Tate & Furst changed its name to HM Capital reflecting the departure of Tom Hicks and the new group of partners heading the firm.[7] HM Capital appears to be overcoming initial obstacles, raising new capital from institutional investors for a $1 billion private equity fund, its first in more than five years.[8]
In 2013, HM Capital began dissolving. The energy group spun out as Tailwater Capital and the food group spun off as Kainos Capital.[9][10]

CALPERS BLASTS HICKS, MUSE FUND - Pensions & Investments














































































































































































CALPERS BLASTS HICKS, MUSE FUND
 



      By Steve Hemmerick
 · September 15, 1997



The $2.5 billion Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc. Equity Fund III, a leveraged buy-out fund popular with institutional investors, was blasted by CalPERS' staff.Newly released documents reveal staff at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, Sacramento, believe Hicks, Muse overpaid for radio stations and has little alignment of fees with performance.They said executives at Dallas-based Hicks, Muse have limited investment experience in one key potential investment area, Latin America, and no experience with a fund as large as Fund III.

But other pension fund investors in Equity Fund III dismissed CalPERS' criticism as almost incomprehensible bitterness.Several of them described it as a case of "sour grapes."In recently released transcripts of a closed-door discussion earlier this year, Barry Gonder, CalPERS' senior investment officer for alternative investments, said he was concerned about Hicks, Muse buying into radio stations "when multiples for radio stations are at an all-time high. I think it would be a better strategy to be exiting radio stations."Mr. Gonder also expressed concern about "organizational issues," such as how much time Hicks, Muse executives "will be dedicated to the fund vs. other activities by the general partner."Another issue was fees.Hicks, Muse "could lose all the money (in Equity Fund III) and they would still make $40 million to $45 million in profit per year over a 10-year period. That is a lot of money," said Mr. Gonder.The way the Hicks, Muse fund is currently structured, said Sheryl Pressler, chief investment officer, the general partners make a profit whether or not CalPERS does.In response, Dan H. Banks, a senior vice president with Hicks, Muse, said:	"We have to perform well enough that we repay the fee before we get anything."If we just do well enough to generate returns that equal the management fee of 1.5% a year, we would have to repay that, and we end up getting nothing," said Mr. Banks.CalPERS staff also raised these concerns:	 The fund's expected internal rate of return was not as high as other partnerships already in the CalPERS portfolio. The fund employs a higher risk strategy than comparable partnerships because it paid relatively higher prices for its acquisitions and exercised lower levels of direct control over operations.Hicks, Muse does not have a long track record in foreign investments, though 20% of the funds assets could be invested in Latin America. Equity Fund III is almost triple the amount Hicks, Muse has invested in the past.The transcript also showed Hamilton Lane Advisors, Philadelphia, one of CalPERS' alternative investment consultants, recommended against the investment.Investors in Equity Fund III include the $12 billion pension fund of American Airlines Inc., Fort Worth; the $4 billion pension fund of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Akron; the $62 billion Florida State Board of Administration, Tallahassee; $34.4 billion Michigan State Employees' Retirement System, Lansing; the $25 billion Oregon Public Employes' Retirement Fund, Salem; $34 billion Washington State Investment Board, Olympia; $58 billion New York State Teachers' Retirement System, Albany; $19 billion Colorado Public Employees Association, Denver; and the $8 billion Louisiana State Teachers' Retirement System, Baton Rouge.In March, a vote to delay a relatively small $100 million investment by CalPERS in Hicks, Muse's Equity Fund III failed by one vote. A subsequent 7-4 vote approved the investment.Meantime, Equity Fund III became so popular with investors that it grew from the original planned size of $1 billion to $2 billion and, finally, to $2.5 billion.William F. Quinn, president of AMR Investment Services Inc., which oversees American Airlines' pension fund investments, dismissed criticism of the fund as being bad information, and described Equity Fund III as an excellent investment.Hicks, Muse "may not buy at the cheapest price, but they buy at a fair price and then they build businesses around that, and the synergy of those businesses add value and good returns," he said.Mr. Quinn said the partners have had substantial success in Latin America.On fees, he said general partners receiving fees regardless of the profit of a partnership is true of any similar partnership."It (the CalPERS criticism) sounds like sour grapes," he said.Officials at both the Colorado and Oregon funds said they have been happy with Hicks, Muse's performance.Tom Hicks, chairman of Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc., said the CalPERS staff criticism was "unfortunate" and results from "an agenda that I don't understand.""We have most of the prestigious investment groups and pension funds in the country," said Mr. Hicks.He said compound annual return for Hicks, Muse's Equity Fund I was about 30%; Fund II will be over 40%; and Fund III, he believes, will be over 40%."We operate in a high-priced environment very successfully because we have been among the most successful in the country to use operating strategy where we buy a core business and use it to buy other companies as a way of lowering our prices at effective multiples," said Mr. Hicks.Fund II, he said, had a cost basis of $6 per share and is worth $43 per share today; investments in Fund III already have doubled in the last year.Mr. Hicks also said the partnership has invested in Latin America for more than five years and is now "the leading investor in Latin America of all U.S. investment firms."
