						Bring beauty, style and warmth into your home with Dixie Home carpets.  Dixie Home offers an array of high fashion, trend setting residential broadloom carpets which includes traditional velvets,  contemporary patterns and 
                        a wide range of interesting textures all in exciting, fashion forward colors.


                        Dixie Home was founded on the premise that fashion and design do not have to be limited to the high end of the market. Although a relatively new company, Dixie Home draws upon its association with the Dixie Group, a leader in textiles for over 90 years, to fulfill that need. We use premium materials throughout the manufacturing process featuring an extensive array of Stainmaster® products. The difference in our products goes beyond the visual. It’s inherent in every step of the manufacturing process insuring you fashion that will stand the test of time.
