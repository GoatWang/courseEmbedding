PHILADELPHIA, June 27, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Leonard "Lenny" Comma, President and Chief Operating Officer of Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ:   JACK), has joined the Board of Directors of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.  Serving more than 600,000 children, parents/guardians and volunteers, Big Brothers Big Sisters makes meaningful, closely monitored, long-term one-to-one mentoring matches, helping children overcome adversity to achieve success in school and in life.

"Jack in the Box® supports and encourages our employees and franchisees to take active roles in supporting their communities," Comma said. "As the parents of three amazing boys, my wife and I know how important it is for children to have positive role models in their lives. For those children who may not benefit from the active involvement of both parents or adult guardians, Big Brothers Big Sisters can really make a positive difference in their lives. I've enjoyed supporting Big Brothers Big Sisters in various capacities over the years and am looking forward to increasing my involvement as a member of its national board of directors."
"Lenny's decision to accept this prominent position with Big Brothers Big Sisters underscores our company's commitment to community service and to the importance of youth mentoring," said Brian Luscomb, president of The Jack in the Box Foundation, a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit organization funded by donations from Jack in the Box Inc., its employees, franchisees, vendors and Jack in the Box®guests. "Since 1998, The Jack in the Box Foundation has donated more than $4 million to the national Big Brothers Big Sisters organization and its affiliated local agencies through financial support and in-kind contributions. We're pleased with the positive impact we've had on Littles served through the organization's various programs, especially its military mentoring programs."
A long-time supporter of military families, San Diego-based Jack in the Box helped launch Big Brothers Big Sisters' Operation Bigs military mentoring program in 2004. The program initially served children and volunteer mentors from military families at Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base. In partnership with Jack in the Box, Big Brothers Big Sisters has expanded its mentoring services to military communities across the U.S.
"Lenny's appointment comes at a critical time for Big Brothers Big Sisters when national corporate and foundation partners are a growing part of how we serve children, families and volunteers with school- and community-based mentoring services," said Big Brothers Big Sisters of America President and Chief Executive Officer Charles Pierson. "On the heels of the release of our first ever Big Brothers Big Sisters Youth Outcomes Survey, we know our programs have proven, positive academic, socio-emotional and behavioral outcomes for youth.  Big Brothers Big Sisters is an investment that promises tangible rewards for employers, including improvements in high school graduation, juvenile delinquency prevention and job readiness."
Comma, who joined Jack in the Box Inc. in 2001, was promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer in May of this year. He is responsible for the operations of all company and franchised Jack in the Box locations, which comprises more than 2,200 restaurants in 20 U.S. states, as well as marketing and restaurant development. Comma has an MBA from Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and a bachelor's degree in finance from Drexel University in Philadelphia.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Jack in the Box Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being broadcast live over the Internet. A replay of the call will be available on the Jack in the Box corporate website starting today.
At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Carol DiRaimo, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Jack in the Box. Please go ahead.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Chairman and CEO, Lenny Comma; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Jerry Rebel. During this morning's session, we'll review the company's operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 as well as some of the guidance we updated yesterday for the third quarter and fiscal 2016.
In our comments this morning, per share amounts refer to diluted earnings per share and operating earnings per share is defined as diluted EPS from continuing operations on a GAAP basis, excluding restructuring charges and gains or losses from refranchising. Following today's presentation, we'll take questions from the financial community.
Since I received a few questions about comparisons to other companies' reported same-store sales results, it should be noted that there is no benefit in our numbers for leap day, because of our fiscal period. The NPD results included in our press release also exclude the extra day.
Please be advised that during the course of our presentation and our question-and-answer session today, we may make forward-looking statements that reflect management's expectations for the future, which are based on current information. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations based on risks to the business.
The Safe Harbor statement in yesterday's news release and the cautionary statement that accompanies the most recent Form 10-K are considered a part of this conference call. Material risk factors as well as information relating to company operations are detailed in our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and other public documents filed with the SEC. These documents are available on the Investors section of our website at www.jackinthebox.com.
A few calendar items to note. As you know, we'll be hosting an Investor and Analyst Meeting on May 24 and May 25 in Kansas City. The presentations on May 25 will be webcast. Jack in the Box management will be attending Oppenheimer's Annual Consumer Conference in Boston on June 21 and Jefferies Consumer Conference in Nantucket on June 22.
Our third quarter ends on July 3, and we tentatively plan to announce results on Wednesday, August 3 after market close. Our conference call is tentatively scheduled to be held at 8:30 AM. Pacific Time on Thursday, August 4.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry – Lenny, sorry. I can't read this one.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. This is Lenny. After the slow start to the second quarter, we ended with a 23% increase in operating EPS, which exceeded our expectations and guidance. The improvement was largely driven by healthy margins and cost controls, along with some benefits from mark-to-market adjustments and a lower tax rate. We were especially pleased with the solid sales performance at Qdoba company restaurants, which was driven by traffic growth, as well as with improvement in labor costs and margins at that brand as compared to the first quarter.
More on Qdoba in a bit. First, I want to talk about our Jack in the Box brand, where we continue to focus our efforts on delivering higher quality burgers, drinks and breads, which is what our consumer research identified in 2014, was the top priority for our brand. The first major quality change we made was the introduction of our Buttery Jack burgers in Q2 of last year, which contributed to our best same-store sales performance in more than 15 years. And in quarter two of this year, we upgraded nearly 30 core products in one of the biggest initiatives we've undertaken to improve quality.
Our most frequent guests are noticing all the improvements we're making. Over the past year, we've seen a significant increase in top Box scores, are how our burgers, drinks and fries taste, on average, a nearly 10% improvement. This kind of response is key to driving higher levels of customer loyalty over the long-term.
In the short-term, we recognized the need to be more aggressive on the value front, given the amount of competitive discounting activity we're seeing. Midway through the most recent quarter, we began promoting value price combos, featuring our new improved burgers. It is to increasing trial of those products, we slowed the transaction decline we've been experiencing and our GAAP to NPD narrowed.
Importantly, the way we approach value enable the company and our franchisees to preserve margins in the quarter, which remained above 20%. We also focused on the breakfast day part in the quarter, with a breakfast croissant value message and our new triple cheese and hash brown breakfast burrito, the latest in our popular line of Breakfast Burritos. Encouragingly, despite a lot of competitive promotional activity in the quarter and some continued weakness in the 10:30 to noon period, sales were positive during the entire breakfast day part with mix reaching an all-time high of 23%. Looking ahead, our promotional calendar will continue to balance both value and quality related messages with compelling new products.
Now, let's take a look at our Qdoba brand. Second quarter sales were strong, on top of difficult comparisons for the year ago quarter. In the second quarter, we reformulated our Mexican Gumbo, and reintroduced these guests favorite as Loaded Tortilla Soup. With TV support in certain markets, we positioned it as the perfect antidote to the doldrums of winter. The promotion triggered a nice increase in product mix.
Looking ahead, we're bringing back a seasonal favorite next week, Mango Salsa. Over the summer, expect us to encourage our guests take advantage of our new pricing structure, enjoy the refreshing flavor of mango across our entire menu. Q3 also features two of the year's biggest catering events, Cinco de Mayo and Graduations. Growing catering sales remains an important focus of ours, so expect us to continue to message catering opportunities with our guests.
Moving on to our restaurant facilities, since last year, we've been testing various design elements at new company locations. More recently, we added some franchise restaurants and remodels to the tests. When we're in Kansas City, in a few weeks – in a few days, excuse me, for our Investor and Analyst Meeting, we'll have a lot to talk about regarding the future look and feel of our restaurants. I don't want to front run that discussion today, but we'll also be very clear on how we plan to expand both brands and drive sustainable sales growth in the coming years. Additionally, we'll be sharing our initiatives that are intended to deliver returns for our shareholders.

On that note, I'll turn the call over to Jerry, for a more detailed look at the second quarter, and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2016. Jerry?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Lenny. Good morning, everyone. After a slow start to the quarter, with operating EPS roughly flat after the first two months, we finished with a 23% increase in operating earnings. A number of items contributed to the beat, including mark-to-market adjustments of about $0.04, which resulted in a lower tax rate that benefited the quarter by about $0.02. There was also an annual adjustment to rent for certain markets that had been previously refranchised. And based on their higher sales levels, approximately $0.03 of the additional net rental income was recognized in the quarter.
In addition, margins at both brands came in better than we anticipated. Despite additional promotional activity, due in part to continued favorable commodity markets. We also saw the benefit of good cost controls with more of an austerity mindset throughout the organization. For Jack in the Box, the 1% decrease in company same-store sales was comprised of pricing of 3.2% which was offset by a 1.8% decline in mix and a 2.4% decline in transactions.
As Lenny mentioned, midway through the quarter, we got more aggressive on the value front, with price point messages running in the majority of our markets. Despite the additional promotional activity, Jack in the Box margins decreased by only 70 basis points compared to last year, as favorable commodity cost largely offset the impact of minimum wage increases that went into effect in January and higher cost related to equipment upgrades. For Qdoba, Q2 company same-store sales increased 3.1%, driven by transaction growth of 3.7% and catering, which contributed 0.5%, partially offset by a 1.1% decline in the average check.
In addition to the solid sales performance at Qdoba, we were pleased with the sequential improvement in margins compared to Q1, as the labor staffing issues we talked about were largely addressed. A greater number of new openings in the last two quarters affected margins but we remain pleased with the new store volumes we are experiencing. Through the first two quarters of the year, we've opened 19 company Qdoba restaurants versus three in the first two quarters of last year.
Favorable commodity cost helped margins and we expect that to continue for the balance of the year. We now expect commodity deflation of approximately 2% to 3% at Jack in the Box versus our prior guidance of 2% deflation. We also expect deflation of roughly 5% at Qdoba versus our prior guidance of approximately 4%.
Given the annuity-like cash flows of our business model, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased $150 million of stock during the quarter and now have a $150 million available under current board authorizations. Our outstanding shares decreased by more than 11% versus last year's second quarter, which will continue to contribute to our EPS growth. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9 times.
Here is our current thinking on guidance for other key items for the balance of the year. Our Q3 sales guidance for Jack in the Box ranges from approximately down 2% to flat at company restaurants versus a 5.5% increase in the year ago quarter. It is worth noting that franchise same-store sales, which has less of an impact from Houston are currently running at 0.4% quarter-to-date. Our Q3 sales guidance for Qdoba ranges from approximately down 1% to up 1% at company restaurants versus a 6.6% increase in the year ago quarter. We lowered our full year same-store sales guidance for Jack in the Box company restaurants to flat to up 1% and for Qdoba company restaurants to up 1.5% to 2.5%, reflecting our performance through Q2 and our outlook for Q3.

Based on our lower same-store sales expectations, offset in part by the mark-to-market and rental income adjustments in Q2, we continue to expect operating earnings per share to range from $3.50 to $3.63 in fiscal 2016, compared to $3 in fiscal 2015. I will make one other note, our guidance excludes the impact of any potential restructuring charges in 2016, driven by our plans to increase Jack in the Box franchise ownership and reduce overhead costs.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn the call back over to Lenny.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jerry. I just want to take a moment in light of the recent changes with Tim Casey leaving the organization and Keith Guilbault taking over as President. I first want to recognize Tim Casey for his contribution in leading the Qdoba brand over the past three years. I think he's a great brand builder and he has really helped to reinvigorate that brand and we want to wish him well.
I also want to take an opportunity to welcome Keith Guilbault to the position. Keith, I think, brings a unique skill set and balance across many different disciplines starting with his operations background as Regional Vice President of Operations and Division Vice President of Operations Initiatives for the Jack in the Box brand, also spending time running the Franchise Group as VP of Franchising, also working as VP of Marketing Innovation and CMO of the Jack in the Box brand and then most recently Chief Operating Officer for Qdoba. I think he brings a wealth of experience and a balanced approach that will help to lead this brand forward and I just want to wish him well and I'm looking forward to what he will do to write the next chapter for the Qdoba brand.
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kate and ask her to queue up for Q&A. Thank you.

All right. Great (14:02). Thank you. Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Brian Bittner. Your line is open now.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Question on your sales so far in the third quarter. We know that the industry has been weak in April based on the industry data, based on what a lot of competitors have said. But is there a way to – I know you just told us what the franchise comps were, but is there a way to quantify how your company-owned trends look at Jack in the Box outside of Houston and look at Qdoba outside of Denver so far in the quarter?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Brian, what I can tell you is when we look at the Houston market for the company restaurants – by the way, we have about 17% of our company units are in the Houston market. When we look at the weather impacted weeks and how that's impacting the overall total, it looks like that is impacting the total comp by about 60 basis points during the first four weeks of the quarter. And that would be compared to what normal trends were for the Houston market. We had a couple of weeks in the first four weeks here where Houston was tracking down near the 10% range.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. And what about Qdoba outside of the Colorado, Denver region?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I would say less of an impact directly with Denver as I would say the – it's been a broader weather impact given the overall footprint with some late snowstorms and weather across the country.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. And just a follow-up. What gives you guys the confidence on the implied fourth quarter comp guidance, because that suggests that you have solidly positive comps in the fourth quarter, what's driving that confidence?

Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Brian, this is Lenny. First, I would tell you that the lineup of new product introductions and promotions for the fourth quarter supported by media for both brands is going to be exceptional compared to what we've done in the first three quarters. So that's given us a lot of confidence that we should have a strong fourth quarter. We're looking forward to seeing those things hit the marketplace.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Andrew Charles at Cowen and Company. Your line is open now.
Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. Lenny, just following up on that, as we think about the balance of the year and menu opportunities at Jack, do you expect to see more lasting product upgrades as a continuation of the Declaration of Deliciousness which are presumably more beneficial to operations, or more around the LTOs such as the recent sourdough bacon ranch and new Breakfast Burritos?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think what you'll see in the form of LTOs is the continued push toward the Declaration of Deliciousness. So I guess the way to say that is when you take a look at the type of products that we launch, for example, the Buttery Jack line, that's the type of quality that you should expect to see in the LTOs coming forward. And that will be complemented by some aggressive value oriented promotion as well. So, we think it will be a nice one-two punch.
Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC
And I am just curious as well, just given your California exposure, about your perspectives on lower income consumer and what I would expect to be an outside benefit for Jack from increased California minimum wage, did you see California outperform the rest of the system as we looked at 2Q?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, California did outperform most of the rest of the system.
Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Joseph Buckley of Bank of America. Your line is open now.
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Can I ask a similar regional question about Texas? Several companies and brands have called out some weakness in Texas. And ex the Houston rains, is Texas lagging this system?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think the rains are probably the biggest current driver. We've been paying close attention to this and we do see that California is outperforming Texas, but what we're not seeing yet is any confirmation that Texas has a major economic slowdown. So, we're looking really at the most recent weather impact as the bigger contributor.
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And then kind of a broader question about value, you made the adjustments mid-quarter, we can back into what the Jack in the Box comp was for the last eight weeks of the quarter. But did you see sales get better as the quarter progressed? Do you think the value messaging you have done so far is gaining some traction or do you need to do more?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think where we saw the biggest impact is we slowed down the negative trend on transactions, that's probably the thing that we're most concerned about. So, from a value perspective, I think certainly we'd love to see the top line sales, and we'd also like to see the transaction impact. And that was, what we think we achieved the back half of the quarter by putting those promotions in place. I think going forward what we'll be looking to do is make sure that we have the right balance of premium LTOs that helps to sustain the margins and the average check while we have the aggressive promotions – site promotions in there that help to allay any of the erosion of the transaction.

Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open now.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi, good morning. Lenny, just a quick follow-up to that last comment. I was wondering if you think you're satisfied with the impact of the promotional approach that you are using on the value side. Or if you think you need to be any more aggressive in terms of whether it's the discount or price point that you are offering as you move into the rest of this year and into next year.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think, if you pay attention to our two-year comparisons, it was strongest in the last period. And that's probably the best indication of how well those value promotions are working for us. And taking a balanced approach to holding onto some margin while also driving some transaction and sales. So, it's a competitive marketplace. We're trying to walk the fine line both profitability and sales. It seems like there's a lot of aggressive activity out there that is willing to sacrifice a lot of the margin. We're trying to make a balanced approach on our end that retain some of the gains that we've had in this premium positioning, while at the same time make sure that we're being competitive in the marketplace and not just allowing the bottom side of our menu – the value side of our menu to completely erode.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Great. That makes sense. And, Jerry, I was wondering if you could help us – I think it was helpful that the components you gave on the upside for Q2. But you mentioned a couple of factors, margins came in better than anticipated and you had some good cost controls. So, I was wondering if you can elaborate on what the drivers of those are and whether you think you are able to continue those as you look into the next couple of quarters?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. A couple of things, so one, on the margins, the promotional activity at both brands, actually saw improving sales, but was really good flow-through on those sales, driven in part by, I think, just overall good expense control in the restaurant, but also we were helped by the continued deflationary nature of the commodity markets. And so – and you can see that reflected in our guidance as we continue to forecast commodity to be more deflationary and what we had in the prior quarter. So, I think that's part of that and I think you'd expect to see that going forward.
The other, I think, is just related to some of the work that we're doing with – that we'll talk about in much more detail when we see you guys at the Investor and Analyst Day with our overall cost control. So, we've been – has been very visible throughout the organization and I think it's just natural that with that conversation and the level of activity that we're seeing here that you're going to have folks that are a bit more cost conscious than they might otherwise be. And I think we're seeing some of that flow through, although I can tell you it's very difficult to put your finger on exactly what that is and how much it is. But it would be odd to not have that bleed through the numbers. And I think that's also reflected in the guidance going forward.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open now.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks. Thanks very much. Jerry, you alluded to the fact that you might see some costs of the restructuring and stuff coming through later this year or that the guidance was exclusive of that. Where are you maybe in that process? I know you are going to give probably more detail in a few weeks, but where – is some of this refranchising underway now? Is it reasonable to expect any refranchising transactions in the calendar year? And can you get ahead of those with the G&A cuts or those lagged (24:16) just by their nature of need to cut the stores first?

Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, I won't give a lot of color on that. What I will tell you is, one, we will give a lot of detail around that in, what, 10 days. But the corporate level G&A cuts are independent of the refranchising. I don't think you need to do a refranchising to start all of the G&A cuts.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. That's helpful, I guess. And your guidance for the year, this quarter had some – you mentioned some unexpected puts and takes. Is there anything else that is notable in your thinking about the current earnings guidance that we wouldn't see, movement in the G&A line or lack of assumptions in G&A? Are there any underlying assumptions we need to know about now just to reconcile that with our own forecasts?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Let me see if I can make this answer a bit more helpful to you than what my last answer was.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thank you.
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, the way I would look at this, just walking through the math, John. So, we're at $1.77 in Q2, year-to-date EPS. If you just take the midpoint of our guidance, call it, $3.57, that implies $1.80 in the back half of the year rolling over $1.38 last year, roughly a 30% increase. The way I would look at this is when you look at the 53rd week impact which I think we've identified as being $0.08 a share previously. Then you look at the lower share count based upon what we've purchased offset a bit by some higher interest expense and lower SG&A which is primarily related to the ongoing lower pension expense and lower incentive compensation, because this year's performance isn't nearly as good as last year's performance was. That makes up about two-thirds of that 30% increase.
The other one-third or roughly 10% of that earnings growth is related to sales and margin activities or the four walls of the restaurant, if you will.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thank you. You made good. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Keith Siegner of UBS. Your line is open now.
Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. And, Jerry, that was very helpful, that last bit of clarity. So I appreciate that as well. Switching gears a little bit, if we think about some of the things we have learned through this earnings seasons, right, we have learned about loyalty programs, kiosks, mobile order and pay, delivery tests. Basically all of the major mainstream quick service brands have a lot of tests in place and a lot of this we're going to see even before year end at some of these big chains. And I know I ask you this a lot but, Lenny, if you could just give us an update about what tests do you have in place, maybe just what's your philosophy about how you are thinking about these things. Just some form of update. And again, we've really learned so much about all the other brands this earnings season, so just like to know the latest about you too. Thanks.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So, when you look at the list of potentially all things digital in delivery, we understand that in order for us to be competitive going forward, we will have to play in that space. What we've been able to evaluate and get some information on is really this understanding of how much of that business is being led by the aggregators that are out there or the third-party folks that do digital for major organizations and how much of that is being done internally. And what we see is, there is going to be a pretty decent contest with the aggregators versus the internal investment. Either way what you're going to see is every major brand including us will play in that space, whether we do it all ourselves or partially ourselves, we'll be involved in everything from delivery to apps and digital applications that allow us to manage everything from CRM programs to mobile payment.

I can't tell you that we have decided on the path forward as far as how much of that we want to handle internally versus how much of that we want to use the aggregators for but we have lined up several tests using both internal and external resources to sort that out within the coming years. So, our plan is to wade into that water pretty deeply and get a good understanding of the path forward and make a firm commitment to use that path.
So, Keith, I know there is not a ton of detail there on all that we'll be doing specifically about the Qdoba brand. As I've talked about in the past, is a little further ahead than the Jack in the Box brand, we built an infrastructure for an app and a digital test there and we currently have that in test. We know that there will be some learnings that come out of that we will be able to apply to the Jack brand as well. And I would say, in the next six months to 12 months, we should feel a lot more sure about where we want to place those investments and how we want to move forward. But I don't feel like we're behind and I feel like the information we have and the testing we've done is right on par with where everybody else is from the standpoint of understanding and figuring out how we move forward. I don't think anybody has got it sorted out, but I do think that everybody's making that commitment right now.
Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC
That's great, thanks. And then maybe just one follow-up to an earlier question. You mentioned that product and promo for 4Q is exceptional versus 1Q to 3Q, which is really exciting considering that we had the Declaration of Delicious, Million Burger Giveaway, 29 new product updates. Should I think of it as the 1Q through 3Q in total or is this even exciting compared to those promos and products?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I really don't think that we've done anything in the first three quarters that was as exciting as what we expect to happen in the fourth quarter from a product perspective. The core product improvements that we did earlier in the year, I think, have got an exceptional results from the standpoint of the consumer recognizing the quality improvement, but I also recognize that, that's not a new product and getting attention to that in a short-term is harder to do, so that's more of a long-term play, and it really flew in the face of a lot of short-term discounting that was going on out there. In the fourth quarter, I feel like we have both some exciting discounting and some exciting new premium products hitting, and I think that's probably from a competitive environment standpoint going to stack up a little bit better.
Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC
That's great. Thank you very much.

Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Chris O'Cull of KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, guys. My question relates to the revamped menu at Jack. Lenny, you mentioned that food quality scores have risen with the core guest, but I am wondering if the changes have increased their likelihood to return or whether you have seen that score increase in the survey work.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, great question. You could be a fly on the wall to our consumer insights conversation. And yes, the likelihood to return has increased. And we saw even in the original taste testing that we did that the likelihood to return would increase, then we had to go prove it out by actually launching the product and we're happy to report that we're seeing that now in the real world. So, pretty pleased with that. We think that the long-term ramifications for the core product improvements are positive. And we're looking forward to seeing all that we'll do.

Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. And then – that's good to hear. And then just a question on Qdoba. I mean the comps and the transactions clearly made a nice rebound, but the profit dollars per store were flat to down, it looks like, year-over-year. Is this a sacrifice the brand is intentionally making to build awareness and trial? And if so, how long do you plan to use this kind of promotional strategy at Qdoba?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Chris, I'm going to jump in and address this at least in the beginning here. So, if you look at the restaurants that are the non-new restaurants, those margins were actually up year-over-year even with the additional promotional activity and that's where I was getting to earlier when I mentioned that the flow-through on those promotional sales were actually quite good. We've opened up over the last three quarters 28 new units, which is 8% of our overall company store base for Qdoba. And so that is impacting the margins down a bit, although the average unit volumes on an annualized basis are over $1.1 million in those new units. And then if you look at the areas in which there would be a margin drag, it would be the areas that you would expect a new restaurant to have a margin drag, so they have a little higher labor, which is shorter-term, not longer-term, so you'd expect that to improve. They have a little higher food cost because of just the extra waste, again, more of a learning standpoint. And then you'd expect that to go away. The other piece that's driving a little higher operating cost is the depreciation because they're all brand new restaurants. And so they're going to have a little higher depreciation on that. But other than that, the restaurants are performing very well. And I would say other than the depreciation and perhaps a little occupancy cost you'd expect these restaurants to begin to perform similarly to what the longer-term openings are.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
That's helpful. So the margin percent of the comparable base, Jerry, then is it up year-over-year with...
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
It is. It's up. It's up a bit, Chris. It's not up a ton but it is up a little bit.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
That's helpful. Thank you.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Chris, you asked about the promotion strategy for Qdoba and whether we were intentionally sacrificing margin, I think that Jerry addressed the margin information that you needed, but I will, from a strategic standpoint, say that when we look back at Q1 and what we learned as the Jack in the Box brand committed a lot of resources to roll out a core products improvement initiative that was one of the biggest initiatives we've had in years. Once we committed to that, we were not able to pivot as quickly to the competitive activity that was in the marketplace and negatively impacted our results. When we took a look at what was happening with one of our major competitors in the fresh Mexican Grill space, we didn't want to have the promotional activities that we were seeing from that major competitor negatively impacting Qdoba brand. So in fact, we did pivot and make sure that we had significant amount of promotional activity in the marketplace at this time. And we'll stick with that strategy as long as the environment requires it.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay, thank you. That's very helpful.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Alex Slagle of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Alexander Russell Slagle - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. A question on the Qdoba media strategy and if you can update us on the TV advertising tests, sort of how they performed versus your expectations and how we should think about the strategy through the rest of the year.

Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, we tested TV alongside several other things and what we actually found is that some of the other things we were doing outside of television actually drove better results. So although TV was a great way for us to bring attention to the brand and some of the innovation that was happening. We didn't feel like after the test it was the best go-forward strategy. So, we're going to use other media type platforms, online and also promotional activities intended to put offers in front of the consumers' face very directly and we'll use those types of things to bring that messaging alive and essentially get food in people's mouth, that strategy seems to be playing well for us. So, we're going to stay more on that side of the things versus television.
Alexander Russell Slagle - Jefferies LLC
Okay. And as a follow-up on the Qdoba development, the fact that you have already built a good bit of the potential 25 to 30 Qdoba company stores expected this year. And it sounds like those are not non-traditional. Just seemingly it's a bit front-end loaded, more than expected. I mean, is it merely that or is there some potential upside to your implied guidance for company owned builds this year?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No. I'd say it is a little frontend loaded, but that was more by design, not by surprise. The 28 restaurants that I mentioned, though, was inclusive of late fourth quarter openings. So, we've actually opened up 19 restaurants this year versus three restaurants last year at this time. And last year's restaurants happened to be more backend loaded.
Alexander Russell Slagle - Jefferies LLC

And our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. First, maybe, Lenny, on the broader category as was discussed earlier. It seems like there are some easing trends in recent weeks. I'm wondering whether you would say it's fair to say you have seen that at both brands beyond the weather which was noted for both brands. But just wondering if you would care to opine to what you attribute that to. It does seem like the value push remains across the industry, so perhaps it is something more macro. But you have got a whole lot better data than we do. So just wondering your opinion on the slowdown and then I had a follow-up.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We've got a couple hypotheses on that, but the one that seems to be playing out the most right now is the regional impacts that are driven by the weather. There have been some questions as to whether or not something is impacting us here in the tax season, but we're not quite sure that that's a place we want to go yet. I don't know that it's completely clear that there is a softening that's happening outside of a regional impact, we're going to keep a close eye on it. But at the end of the day, the pieces that are very clear is that the industry continues in a deflationary commodities environment to be aggressive. And we're going to stay focused on those things that are pretty easy to see at this point in time, and keeping a balanced mix of both promotional activity and new product introductions into the marketplace. But I'm not so sure that there is anything we're seeing, Jeff, that has us in a place where we would say, here is the right response to a softening in the industry or some long-term economic impact, we're just going to have to keep a close eye on it.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Got it. And then just at the Jack brand specifically, I think you noted in the press release that the comp was lagging that quick service sample set by 270 bps, which I guess was slightly worse than the 240 bps in fiscal 1Q. Maybe that's – maybe just month-to-month within the quarter things got meaningfully better perhaps, I don't know if you would offer color on that. But it seems like maybe you have stemmed the tide, but I'm just wondering how you go about taking share. Or whether you think just the competition of both breakfast and with value is just proving more challenging in the near-term, so we shouldn't expect any meaningful reversal in that trend. Maybe that fourth quarter excitement you are talking about might do it, but just wondering your outlook on being able to once again take share when the competitive pressures are so intense.

Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Yes, Jeff. I'll actually take that one. If you look at the NPD data for the quarter, keep in mind our GAAP last year this time was up 760 basis points. So, on a two-year basis, we clearly took a significant amount of share and based on our eight, nine – 8.9% system comp. So, on a two-year basis, we took significant share as compared to the last quarter.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And is the expectation that you would go back to taking share as we perhaps look out to fiscal 2017? Or again, does competitive pressure just make it more difficult for anybody to be running away with meaningful share?
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Yeah. I don't have my crystal ball out today. However, I would say that we did see the gap narrow as we got more active on the promotional front in the back half of the quarter.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks. Actually just following up on Jeff's question and it was touched on earlier. But just in terms of the same-store sales trends you are seeing from 10:30 to noon, any color there? I would assume it peaked several months ago, but has it begun to moderate? What are you seeing there?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, it has begun to moderate, we can see that quarter-to-quarter. Additionally, we had mentioned back when we reported first quarter results that the breakfast items that were being sold outside of that 10:30 to noon timeframe had taken a hit, which we thought was largely due to the rollover from prior year's promotions for Jack in the Box. And it was certainly compounded though by the aggressive marketing of the breakfast all day promotion from one of our major competitors.
But as we move here into Q2 and Q3, we do see that the 10:30 to noon timeframe, which is the timeframe we set was most impacted has waned. And we also see that the impact outside of that timeframe has been negated. So, we feel pretty good about where we are right now. We are able to isolate it to the 10:30 to noon timeframe and able to think about strategies that would help us to protect that timeframe and restore it going forward.
Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That's helpful. And then, Jerry, I think the franchise revenue margin, almost 54% in the quarter, looks like according to my model the highest it's been in five years or six years, something along those lines. So two questions. Do you expect to be able to hold on to that margin level? And could we perhaps even see that margin level move higher as we get into FY 2017?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. So, let me give you the quick answer on the 54% margin sustainable, short answer is no, at least not in the short-term anyway. Let me give a little color around this rent adjustment and I'm going to try and make this brief and understandable. I think I'm going to fail on both of those targets. But this is somewhat technical and it's all accounting. When we sold the Southeast markets, we did analysis with outside real estate folks determined the rent that we should charge to those franchise operators, it was determined that the rent that we were paying under our lease was above market rates of rent. And so we decided to charge the franchisee in those markets, market rates of rent because they were lower performing restaurants, I mean one of them to be healthy in terms of cash flow. So, we basically created a rent subsidy not a technical term, but that's pretty much what we did and we had to then set up a reserve and a core (44:24) liability for that, which represented the subsidy for the entire lease term for all the restaurants in which we provided that subsidy.

But what we did also in those contracts with the franchisees, we indicated that if sales improved, the rent could go up and either reduce the subsidy or wipe out the subsidy completely. And so we look at that on an annual basis which is what you saw on the second quarter. Good news is that we are seeing significant improvements in sales in many of those locations and in some of those markets, which necessitated us to effectively reduce the amount of that liability or that subsidy and therefore we got a $1.9 million benefit in the quarter.
You won't expect to see any improvement or anything similar or even close to that in Q3 and Q4. And we'll look at it again next year and we'll adjust as appropriate. But if it were me, I wouldn't model anything for that adjustment because I don't know if that will go up or that will go down and if it does either, I don't know how much it's going to go up or down. So – but it will be based upon sales performance in those markets. It's technical accounting. We're happy that we have the adjustment. It is sales based again, so that is the good news, but it wouldn't be something I would rely on going forward.
Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Nick Setyan of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Nick, hello?
Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
(46:13) questions. And then I do have kind of a bigger question. First, what was the deflation? I guess we have seen in Q2 and Q1? So, should we think about maybe that food and packaging going – taking another step down in Q3 and Q4? How should we think about the cadence there?
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
So in the press release, we shared what the deflation was for each brand in the quarter.
Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Yes.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
And if you look at that on a go-forward basis, obviously, we increase our expected deflation numbers. So in the quarter Jack deflation was 2.9%, I believe. I'd say you're somewhere sort of in the same ranges of that 2% to 3% for the back half of the year.
Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. And under occupancy and other, we did see a big jump as a percent of sales year-over-year at the Jack in the Box brand. Is that just deleverage on the comp? Or are there some kind of one-time items that will go away and we should see less of a headwind in the second half?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No, Nick, good question. Let me give you guys a little color on that. We mentioned in the press release about equipment upgrades impacting margin. So we've done a number of things in the Jack in the Box brand to improve the restaurants and technology and also equipment. We've improved lighting across many of our restaurants to drive same-store sales growth in the late night hours. We've also upgraded our POS hardware. We've also completely installed the Coke Freestyle systems and we've upgraded our restaurant computer network systems, which will both improve security but will also enable us to offer free Wi-Fi to all of our guests at all of our locations. So, the combination of all of those things adds about 60 basis points in costs, about 40 basis points is depreciation of that.
Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's great color, thank you. And then I guess the bigger question is, since we saw the change over in the ad agency, it does seem like there has been a little bit of an evolution in how Jack as a character is portrayed and I guess how your – I don't know if is the right word is as memorable, the commercials in terms of the kind of comedy that's used, et cetera. Is there a way that you guys maybe have measured the impact of the newer commercials versus how impactful they were, memorable they were in prior years? Or I guess what is the overall strategy of how this evolution or how you guys are thinking about the evolution of how you guys plan on portraying Jack in the Box's brand?

Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Good question. Good insights too, Nick. We do monitor that constantly. We'll talk about that at the Analyst Day. We do have measurements that tell us when we need to make adjustments and I think in the marketplace you're already seeing some of the types of adjustments that we make based on the feedback that we've been given. So, we see what you see and just like any promotional period, we've got to freshen the advertising periodically to keep it noticeable. So you probably already noticed that Jack's voice has come back. His voice had taken a little bit of a hiatus and he was on a journey, trying to discover new, wonderful ingredients to help to declare this deliciousness and now he's back to talk about all the things that he has discovered, so more to come on that.
Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Thank you. I have one follow-up question and then an original one. So, just curious on the specific product items towards the end of the quarter and a lot of the comp focus and your trends and how you are doing versus your peers have been focused on sort of improving into the back half of the year or the implied improvement narrowing that gap with the peers. I wonder the Jumbo Jack and the product there mid-March being launched. Is that now – can you give us some color on how much of the percentage of your menu that is? Or is that a driving force, sort of the value, and that's going to be the thing that's driving the narrowing of the gap?
And I guess – or should we start to see then the improvement also in the non-breakfast day part comp wise and did you see that in the month of March? And then I have a follow-up question or a real question on growth as well and development.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Just to share why we featured the Jumbo Jack and several other products, they were all associated with the core product improvements that we've made. It wasn't any specific strategy to use one particular product to drive sales. It was really promotional in nature to get the new food in people's mouth. So, wouldn't want you to imply anything from that other than what it was, it was just – because we were going to be on promotion and we had just improved a bunch of core products. We didn't want to have promotions out there that weren't featuring those products.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
But I meant more so the value bundle also towards mid-March there being launched. Is that representing a larger portion of your menu as it progresses and gains some notoriety and builds part of identifying with your brand?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I guess I'd say that's probably in the short-term, yes. But if you look at what Jack in the Box has done historically, we've used value bundles, just like the ones we just did when we needed to get aggressive in the marketplace with promotions. I think probably what's changed today is that everybody has some form of a value bundle out there. And so, it's not so unique to Jack in the Box, but this – what you see us doing today is very much in line with what we've always done and the type of products that we've always done it with.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Great. And then just a question on development. You said in the press release here 20 Jack in the Box for the full year or for the full fiscal year primarily being franchised stores. It looks like you've – is that a net number or a gross number? Because you have opened it looks like maybe two net and then five in total year-to-date. So, I was just curious – or in gross. That seems like a big ramp-up in the back half of the year. Is that still a strong target, the 21? Or I guess if we have those coming that you must have some visibility around them if they are going to be done by September.

Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Yeah, Matt, it's Carol, I'll take that question. So, yes, you're right on, it's five gross stores and our guidance on openings is always gross. And, yes, we have high visibility into the projected number of openings for the franchise and company restaurants for the balance of the year.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
So, we should see those fees also flow through, I guess, in the third quarter primarily because that seems like when they will be opening?
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
No, third quarter or fourth quarter, right.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Yep. Okay. Thank you.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Operator, I think we'll – if you can prompt for additional questions.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore. Your line is open.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a quick follow-up on the rental income benefit of $0.03 that you had. I don't need you to get into all the accounting details of what happened, but was that a benefit that helped the revenue line? Or was that a reduction on the cost side that you would have had in the quarter?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, it benefited the cost side. I'm not saying that makes logical sense, but that's where we're required to put it given the accounting rules.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC
Okay.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
But it impacted net rental income, okay? So, that was a reduction of the expense.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC
Okay, got it. And then I have a follow-up on the Qdoba comp in the quarter. Can you comment on that regional weakness that you saw out of the gate with Qdoba in the third quarter? Was that just the same kind of Houston type impact that you saw with Jack in the Box or was that something broader than that? And then, on the comment on the promotional activity in the quarter, was that a timing issue or are you doing something incremental that's later in the quarter that you didn't do in the prior year?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
From the Qdoba front, it was broad-based impact. It was really – it's really based on late winter storms throughout the country, more so than any particular region. And we don't have stores in Houston. So, it's certainly wasn't based on that, but 17% are in Denver.
And you had a second part to your question, if you don't mind.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC
Yeah. The second was on the promotional cadence in the quarter. You said that it would be later in the quarter and that would accelerate the comps. So I'm wondering if that is just a timing issue or if that is something incremental that you didn't do in the prior year?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
It's the timing of the promotional activity in Q3 versus where we are currently. So, lower promotional activity first four weeks, we'll have that ramp up going forward.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Operator, I think we have time for...
Operator
Thank you. Yes, ma'am, go ahead.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Yes. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Okay. Yes. Our next question is from the line of Jake Bartlett of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.
Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hi, thanks for taking the question. My question was on your expectations for the promotional environment for the rest of the year. Do you expect it to remain as intense as it is now? And just kind of wanted to dig into your confidence that consumers are going to be receptive to – it sounds like more the higher end LTOs that you are going to be promoting in the fourth quarter that you feel good about.

Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I think your first question on the competitive environment, I fully expect it to stay as is and it potentially could get more aggressive just depending on whether or not some of the major competitors that have suffered some losses in sales most recently, whether or not they're seeing any type of resurgence, if not, I would expect them to continue to get even more aggressive than they are today. So, that's sort of a week-by-week view of the marketplace that we have and in all of our promotional lineup, we have contingency plans in place to pivot to more aggressive promotional activities if necessary if we see the marketplace try to get more aggressive than it is today. So, I think that's the first piece.
And the second part of your question which I wish I could recall at this time.
Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
It was really, I think, part of the same answer. But just the confidence that you have that consumers are going to be receptive to more of a more premium or quality message by the fourth quarter. It seems like they haven't been as much year-to-date.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Here is the way I would look at that. If we're doing a premium message on a completely new product, the odds of them being receptive are much higher than when we do a premium message on an existing product. So, where we feel the confidence is that, when it comes to the discount oriented things that we'll do, those are products that are familiar to people and they will instantly see the value when they see the comparison in the everyday price to the LTO price. When we look at the premium products that we're putting in the marketplace, they'll be completely new news to the consumer and we think that increases the likelihood of success there.
Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And lastly real quick and I – forgive me if I missed it. But if you could give what your pricing was, the menu price increases for both concepts. And I think it's going to imply a negative mix at Jack in the Box. I am wondering whether that – we should expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Yeah. So, the pricing for both brands, I think, we've said this on the call in Jerry's comments, the price for Jack was 3.2% for the quarter. And for Qdoba, it was 1%. And yes, we did have negative mix at both brands. We don't talk about our forward pricing, price enrolls in and out all the time. And keep in mind, we obviously had a minimum wage increases in California that we did take some pricing for.
Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
But it is fair to think that we assume that mix could possibly even get more negative given that you will have kind of a full quarter of the value bundle?
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
It will really depend on what the activity is and what's the balance is on the other products that we are running.
Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Got it. Thank you very much.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking to you all on the 24th and 25th in Kansas City.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Jack in the Box, Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being broadcast live over the Internet. A replay of the call will be available on the Jack in the Box corporate website starting today.
At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Carol DiRaimo, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Jack in the Box. Please go ahead.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Chairman and CEO, Lenny Comma, and Executive Vice President and CFO, Jerry Rebel. During this morning's session we'll review the company's operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as well as some of the guidance we updated yesterday for the second quarter and fiscal 2016.
In our comments this morning, per share amounts refer to diluted earnings per share and operating earnings per share is defined as diluted EPS from continuing operations on a GAAP basis, excluding restructuring charges and gains or losses from refranchising. Following today's presentation, we'll take questions from the financial community.
Please be advised that during the course of our presentation and our question-and-answer session today, we may make forward-looking statements that reflect management's expectations for the future which are based on current information. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations based on risks to the business.
The Safe Harbor statement in yesterday's news release and the cautionary statement that accompanies the most recent Form 10-K are considered a part of this conference call. Material risk factors as well as information relating to company operations are detailed in our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and other public documents filed with the SEC. These documents are available on the Investors section of our website at www.jackinthebox.com.
A few calendar items to note. Jack in the Box management will be attending the UBS Global Consumer Conference in Boston on March 9, and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Consumer and Retail Conference in New York on March 15.
Our second quarter ends on April 10 and we tentatively plan to announce results on Wednesday, May 11 after market close. Our conference call is tentatively scheduled to be held at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time on Thursday, May 12.
As a reminder, we'll be hosting an investor and analyst meeting on May 24 and May 25 in Kansas City. We'll provide more details as the date nears, but if you did not receive the save-the-date email we sent out previously, please contact me.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lenny.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to use my time this morning to address what happened in the first quarter and discuss some of the broader strategic initiatives we're pursuing to drive profitable sales growth and long-term brand loyalty at both Jack in the Box and Qdoba.

Let's start with Jack in the Box and why we weren't as aggressive as we could have been. In our pursuit to improve quality across a huge cross-section of our menu, we focused our field operations and marketing teams on the launch of what we referred to as the Declaration of Delicious, which we kicked off on Super Bowl Sunday. I'll say more about that in a moment, but the major takeaway is that we chose to focus on this effort and not to promote value deals to the same degree as quarter one last year.
Although we stand behind our decision to invest in long-term quality improvements, we paid the price in the quarter as we struggled to roll over last year's two for $3.50 breakfast croissant promotion. Additionally, we experienced the effects of both the heightened competitive focus on value and the impact of McDonald's all-day breakfast, primarily between the hours of 10:30 a.m. to noon.
In recent quarters including quarter one, you've seen us move away from discounting and heavy promotion of our value offerings as we focused on improving the quality of our burgers, drinks and fries. We're not willing to sacrifice profitability for the company or our franchisees by promoting low-margin deals that are not sustainable, but you can expect us to adjust the balance of value and quality-related messages in the future as we respond to the competitive environment.
Moving past quarter one, I'd like to discuss some of the longer-term strategic initiatives for the Jack in the Box brand. Extensive consumer research we conducted in FY 2014 told us that consumers would reward us for serving better burgers, and they have. Last year we hit a home run with our new Buttery Jack platform and we're just now beginning to roll over some of the high sales numbers we saw when we introduced the first two burgers in that line.
Our guests are recognizing us for upgrading the quality of our burgers, according to our proprietary research. When fiscal 2016 got underway, our operations teams began focusing on a major initiative that we believe will continue the upward trends we've seen in guest perceptions around quality. And at the end of January, when we launched the Declaration of Delicious initiative, we improved the quality of 29 burgers, sandwiches and breakfast items. That's over 50% of the products in those three categories. We knew this would be a huge undertaking, but we believe well worth it.
As I stated earlier, we introduced our Declaration of Delicious initiative during the Super Bowl and are now supporting it with a robust multi-media campaign. New menu boards have been installed across our system to highlight improvements, like our new toasted buttery bakery buns and other ingredients that signify freshness.
Key to the initiative is driving trial. Recognizing that putting food in people's mouth is the best way to convince customers that our burgers are better, we announced on Super Bowl Sunday and via social media that we were giving away up to 1 million burgers with no purchase required.
How confident are we that guests will notice a difference? When we tested those upgraded products at more than 300 restaurants in two major markets, we saw a two-to-one preference for the new builds versus the previous one.
We believe these menu changes are right in line with our strategy of introducing higher-quality, more crave-able food, which we believe is the best way to drive profitable sales growth and brand loyalty. To that end, we are encouraged by the steady sequential improvement in two-year sales trends we've seen in each of the first five periods of the year.
Now let's take a look at the Qdoba brand. First quarter sales were strong on top of double-digit comparisons, although earnings were hampered by lower than expected margins and some non-repetitive costs. Over the last two years, we've been transitioning away from some of the more value and discount oriented deals that we've featured in the past to promotions more focused on freedom of choice and mouthwatering flavors. Last year, we rolled out a new pricing structure and became the only major fast casual Mexican brand that doesn't nickel-and-dime its guests by charging extra for things like our hand-smashed guacamole or queso.

In 2016, we expect to continue driving sales and transactions with a combination of great new products and enhanced communication. A great example of that is the new Knockout Tacos platform we introduced in late October. To promote Knockout Tacos, we increased our advertising support, which generated both trial and traffic growth. Also expect us to continue leveraging some of the existing equities that we have on our menu to create line extensions and LTOs that we believe will further drive sales.
Speaking of existing equities, one of our most crave-able items is Mexican Gumbo, but that name has been a bit confusing to our guests, so we're reintroducing it this quarter as Loaded Tortilla Soup, a piping hot option that guests can load with their choice of meats, rice, beans and flavors like sour cream, 3-Cheese Queso and of course, our hand-smashed guacamole, all loaded into a crunchy, edible tortilla bowl.
We believe that the change in name, freedom to add flavorful ingredients and the new edible tortilla bowl will be a much better presentation and product for our guests to enjoy. As a continuation of the marketing test we mentioned to you last quarter, we will further evaluate television advertising with the on-air promotion of our Loaded Tortilla Soup. You can view the commercial by linking to the home page of Qdoba's website.
Last year we began testing various design elements at new company restaurants and more recently at franchise locations. We've also begun testing remodels that feature various components of the redesign. We expect to finalize the restaurant designs this quarter and release them to the system. The approved designs for both new construction and remodels will have multiple options. Think of them as a palette or kit of parts so that each restaurant can be unique, yet still similar enough that the guests know it's the same brand. All of these initiatives are designed to increase sales, traffic and the unit growth as we drive brand awareness.
Before turning the call over to Jerry, I want to reiterate my disappointment in our performance for the first quarter and emphasize that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering results. Furthermore, as we have discussed previously, we've been evaluating various levers to enhance shareholder value. At our May investor meeting in Kansas City we'll discuss our long-term strategies to grow sales and expand both brands.
In the meantime, we have made a couple of key decisions, including plans to increase Jack in the Box franchise ownership to at least 90% and reduce G&A to approximately 3% of consolidated system-wide sales. We're targeting completion of these initiatives over the next two years. We will share more specifics at the meeting, including the potential implications of these changes to our capital structure.
On that note, I'll turn the call over to Jerry for a more detailed look at the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Jerry?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Lenny, and good morning. Operating EPS was flat in Q1 as margin expansion at Jack in the Box offset lower than expected sales at the brand, while sales and traffic growth at Qdoba were offset by lower than expected margins and some non-repetitive costs. For Jack in the Box, the 0.5% increase in company same-store sales was comprised of mixed benefits of 0.6% and pricing of approximately 2.8%, offset in part by a 2.9% decline in transactions.
Transactions were most negative at the breakfast and lunch day parts, driven by the rollover of the very successful two for $3.50 croissant promotion in the prior year, as well as McDonald's launch of all-day breakfast. In addition, heightened competitive discounting in the latter part of the quarter hurt our results. Despite sales being below our expectations, Jack in the Box restaurant margins increased by 150 basis points compared to last year, offsetting the impact of sales that were lower than our expectations.

For Qdoba, Q1 same-store sales increased 1.8% system-wide. The 1.5% increase in company same-store sales included transaction growth of 1.3%, a 0.8% decline in the average check, and catering contributed 1%, driven by 14% sales growth. Qdoba margins were negatively impacted in Q1 by some labor staffing issues, which we are addressing. In addition, a greater number of new openings in the last two quarters affected margins, but we are pleased with the new store sales volumes we are experiencing.
Favorable commodity costs helped margins and we expect that to continue for the balance of the year. We now expect commodity deflation of approximately 2% at Jack in the Box versus our prior guidance of 1% inflation. We also expect deflation of roughly 4% at Qdoba versus our prior guidance of approximately 3%. The biggest drivers of our improved outlook are lower beef and egg prices.
Given the annuity-like cash flows our business model generates and the greater flexibility of our new credit facility, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased $100 million of stock during the quarter and now have $200 million available under current board authorizations. Our outstanding shares decreased by more than 9% versus last year's first quarter, which will continue to contribute to our EPS growth.
I think we covered the rest of the comparisons to last year in the press release, so I won't repeat them here. But here's our current thinking on guidance for other key items for the balance of the year. Our Q2 sales guidance for Jack in the Box ranges from approximately down 3% to flat at company restaurants versus a 7.4% increase in the year-ago quarter. The low end of guidance for the second quarter reflects trends through the first four weeks compared to the same period of the prior year, when sales growth exceeded 10%.
Our Q2 sales guidance for Qdoba ranges from approximately flat to up 3% at company restaurants versus a 7% increase in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the first week of the current quarter, which was negatively impacted by weather and was down 10%, sales trends are tracking at the low end of the guidance range compared to the first four weeks of the prior year, when sales growth exceeded 14%.
The only changes we made to our full-year guidance other than commodities were as follows: we lowered our full-year same-store sales guidance for Jack in the Box company restaurants to 1% to 2% and for Qdoba company restaurants to 2% to 3%, reflecting our performance in Q1 and our outlook for Q2. Based on our lower same-store sales expectations offset in part by lower commodities and additional share repurchases, we now expect operating earnings per share to range from $3.50 to $3.63 in fiscal 2016 compared to $3 in fiscal 2015.
We plan on providing updated long-term goals at the May Investor and Analyst Meeting, including the impact of our plan to increase Jack in the Box franchise ownership to at least 90% and our plan to reduce overhead down to 3% of system-wide sales.
That concludes our prepared remarks. I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator to open it up for questions. Sean?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our first question is from Joe Buckley. Sir, your line's open. You may begin.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Hello?
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. It's Joe Buckley. Can you hear me?
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
We can.
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Sorry about that, I had myself on mute. I wanted to ask a question on the value front. You mentioned the mismatch in the first quarter, the negative mismatch. How does it look for the balance of the year? Are you adjusting upward the value component of your message based on the current environment?

Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, Joe, first off, just looking back on the first quarter, when we gave guidance, we were within the range, and we did expect with some of the promotional activity at the end of the quarter that we'd be able to stay there, but what we saw happen was the competitive input environment just got even worse for us in the back half of the quarter. And our promotions were not as aggressive as the prior year same quarter, so that came back to bite us. So as we look forward now through quarter two, back half of quarter two and also into quarters three and four, you can expect us to essentially get in that game a lot more aggressively. We just don't have a choice with what's going on out there.
But at the same time that we're doing that, I also want folks to recognize that Jack in the Box has placed some big bets on the long-term play, which is really investing in quality. So we're not going to back away from that while we play the discount game. If we could have it our way, it would be mostly a focus on quality. But we won't be able to control that, so we're going to compete a little more aggressively here going forward. But I do think it's worth recognizing the two-year trend that I mentioned in my script because at the end of the day, we are seeing some favorable things associated with what we're implementing strategically, which is more of a long-term play. But in the short term, what the investors can bank on is that we will get significantly more aggressive on the discounting side to be competitive.
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Was the coupon promotion with the new menu launch in your plans originally or was that somewhat of a reaction to the environment?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think what you'd see is everything that's happened early in Q2 was planned and the things that happened mid-Q2 and at the end of Q2 are reactionary.
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And just one more question. How did you do with coupons? Did you see good redemption? Do you share the comps for the first four weeks but presumably that includes the effect of the coupons which would be some traffic without sales or traffic with side item sales only, presumably?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So maybe Jerry and I can both talk about this. What I would say first off is that between the television ad and the social media work that our marketing teams did, we generated a significant amount of interest in the Million Burger Giveaway. So we feel like from the standpoint of us cutting through the clutter of all the advertising out there, we were very successful on that front and generated a significant amount of trial. So from that standpoint we feel like it was a huge success and Jerry can take you through some of the numbers.
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Joe. So the total redemptions as a percentage of weekly transactions since this was launched on Super Bowl Sunday are 6.1%. So a significant amount of the transactions are there. What that did to the average check, if you look at the redemptions which did not require a purchase along with it, the average check on those redemptions was $1.76 versus the normal average check which would be about $7.50. So almost a $6 delta on that which certainly hurt same-store sales, which is reflected in the lower guidance range of down 3%, which is where we're currently tracking. But I think it drove exactly what we wanted it to do which is to put the new improved burgers in a lot of people's mouths. So I don't – you know, we're not disappointed with that at all. Now we want to see if they come back time and time again for the new improved burgers.

Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, sir. For the next question, this is coming from the line of Mr. Brian Bittner. Your line is open. You may begin.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. Thanks very much. I know you'll give us more context around the refranchising activity that you announced in May. But will you be able to achieve this in a way where it is not a headwind to earnings and EBITDA? And secondarily to that, when you talk about your new G&A target, does this assume just core G&A reductions or is this also taking into account the advertising expenses that go away as you sell company-owned stores?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So Brian let me give a little color. And I don't really think I could talk about refranchising without talking about the G&A, so I'll talk about them together. The last part of your question first; the G&A reduction targets have nothing to do with the advertising that will shift over to the franchisees once we refranchise. So this is just pure cost outside of advertising that we would plan to take out.
When you look at holistically the refranchising and the G&A reduction along with share repurchases we would expect for that to be well accretive to operating EPS. We'll provide a bit more detail on the impact to EBITDA, be it somewhat negative or positive, in the May meeting, as a lot of that will be determined on exactly which restaurants we decide to sell and at what price and at what royalty rates, and so some of that is yet to be determined.
But one of the things that we are looking at with the refranchising transactions is perhaps a little different than what we have done in the past, is we're looking to sell restaurants to either existing or new franchisees who have a willingness and ability and a wherewithal to be able to grow new units, and we fully intend to include development agreements for new restaurant growth into these transactions, which we weren't very successful at doing in the prior tranches of refranchising. And then clearly we'll look at geographic considerations and G&A efficiencies there also.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay.
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
On the – let me just make one more comment about the G&A piece, is the G&A that we're targeting, for every 10 basis points worth of reduced G&A as a percent of system-wide sales, it's about $4.4 million, or about $0.08 a share. And I know I was reading a bunch of notes this morning that seemed to be perhaps a little confusion with perhaps how we communicated that yesterday. So I wanted to just lay that out there directly. These are significant reductions in our overall cost structure which the G&A reductions by itself will obviously have a significant impact on EPS going forward as well as EBITDA going forward, with respect to that.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
That makes sense. And following-up on that, why did your 2016 EPS guidance come down by such a small amount? You had flat earnings in the first quarter, lower sales trends going forward than you're expecting. I would have expected it come down a little bit more. Is that all related to the lower commodity outlook? Or are you including some of these G&A reductions and pulling them into 2016 guidance?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No. Great question. And let me give a little clarity there. So the fairly minor reduction in our guidance is fueled by a couple things. One is our first half of the year in terms of our expectations weren't perhaps as high as the Street may have had in their expectations. So I know we missed $0.10 versus the Street consensus. We didn't miss our budget by that amount. So we headed a little toward the back-end loaded anyway, in large part because our last year's fourth quarter was fairly soft.

In addition to that, or I guess on the other side, the other components of the improved margin, or excuse me, of the EPS guidance are lower commodity costs, the correction to what happened on the controllable aspects of the Qdoba margin in Q1, specifically around payroll and some other restaurant-level controllables, and then also share buybacks, which we had in our plan, which we plan to do a bit more of, and obviously we are buying them at lower share prices than what we had originally initially intended to do. So I think all those things considered are baked into the fairly modest reduction in EPS guidance for the year.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question on queue coming from the line of Mr. David Tarantino. Your line's open. You may begin.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Good morning. My question's on the refranchising strategy and I guess, Jerry, I think the message that you've been giving over the past year or so is that selling additional Jack in the Box units would not be accretive to profitability, and therefore, wasn't interesting to you. And now we're hearing that you're planning to do it. So I guess the question I have is what changed in your mind or what is the kind of philosophical difference between how you're looking at it today versus maybe how you've looked at it over the past year or so?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hey, David. This is Lenny, and I'm sure Jerry will have some feedback for you on that question, but I just wanted to reiterate what we have been saying about the refranchising effort. We've consistently said that we would refranchise additional restaurants if they would be accretive. So when we evaluate what we can do, all things considered, including our G&A, the picture starts to get a lot brighter for us and potentially puts us in a place where our earnings going forward have a lot less volatility. So if you look at this thing holistically it starts to look like a very, very good thing for us to do.
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And then, David, when you look at, say, refranchising at the average unit volume that our company restaurants are currently achieving in the, call it, 1.8 to 1.9 level with 20% to 21% margins, those probably would not be accretive. But if you break our 400-plus company-operated units into some quartiles of performance and you look at those first two quartiles, or the lower-performing two quartiles, there are restaurants in there, particularly in that first quartile and half of the second quartile, that get much more attractive for us to refranchise. And then combined with the G&A reductions that Lenny described, can make these things be accretive or certainly be much more close to accretive when you consider repurchasing some stock with the proceeds.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe a point of clarification on the G&A reductions. Are those tied specifically to the refranchising effort? In other words, are there not G&A savings that can be accomplished without the refranchising effort, or are the two interconnected?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
David, when we look at the refranchising effort and G&A, there are obviously some direct G&A implications associated with refranchising. However, there's a significant amount of G&A reductions that are actually targeted beyond what would be directly associated with refranchising. So this really comes down to us looking at the corporate overhead as a major place where we're going to have to bring down costs.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)

Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from the line of Mr. Chris O'Cull. Your line's open and you may begin.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Thanks. My question relates to refranchising. Jerry, in the past, you guys have really focused on the return analysis based on cash flows rather than earnings per share when you evaluate these transactions. Is it safe to assume that you still view free cash flow per share accretion as part of the metric when you decide whether to sell these stores to franchisees?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Chris, there's no question about that. We certainly have that as part of the consideration set. And we have ongoing maintenance CapEx every year for these restaurants, that'll go away. And then any future remodels that would come in, that would also go away with that. So we would certainly expect these transactions to be free cash flow positive going forward.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
And historically they've been EBITDA accretive, if I remember right. I'm just trying to figure out why this would not be accretive to EBITDA or what's changed that could prevent it from being that.
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Great question. Some of, particularly, Chris, the more recent locations were in the Southeast and some of the much lower performing units. So it was fairly easy to get those to be EBITDA accretive. These will be a bit more difficult to do that because they're not performing at that level that some of those later transactions were. But I think when we get through the full analysis and identify all of the packages of restaurants that we would assemble, we'll have more information for you on that in the May meeting. But we're not targeting these things to be dilutive overall.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. And then just one last one. In the quarter, SG&A was 14% of revenue. I'm trying to figure out how do you get to the 13% to 13.5% target for the year?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Great question. You're looking at Qdoba's advertising was about $2.1 million higher in this year's quarter, as they were rolling out some of the TV advertising. They also had some direct mail out there. So that's just the shift in that. And then remember also, we had mark-to-market unfavorable compares of $800,000 compared to last year and it cost us $1 million within this year. And then Qdoba also had a brand conference that was in our budget for Q1 this year that obviously will not continue going forward. And that was about $800,000 that was in the G&A. Those things will not continue going forward. In fact, the advertising timing will actually go the other way for us.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from the line of Mr. Jeffrey Bernstein. Your line is open. You may begin.
Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. Just one, as we think about the comps going for the rest of the year for the core Jack brand, presumably we're talking negative in the first half. Just trying to get maybe somewhat of a qualitative feel for your confidence in actually still achieving the 1% to 2% for fiscal 2016. I say that when I reflect on the fact that you're still lapping the mid-single digit comps the rest of the year. And then in terms of the factors that really hurt you thus far, it's still hard to tell how low on the QSR competitive discount is going to last. It's still kind of hard to see whether your breakfast business will take back the share with the promotion you're running and still early to read on the menu upgrades. I'm just wondering what gives you the confidence to assume that the softness that ensued of late that you can reverse that in the back half of this year?

Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Jeff, I think a couple of things. One, keep in mind we've got a pretty big franchise system. And I think early in the year, the franchise sentiment about our performance was quite good as compared to the competitors when you looked at their comps. And as they've seen some of the competitive activity start to impact them as well, as we have with our company operations, you have a greater appetite across the entire organization to be aggressive in the marketplace with the offers that we think will combat all the discounting that's going on. So I think in the back half of the year, you can expect more of that activity.
But the other side of it, which is the bigger bet and this is where obviously we have some risk, but it's a risk we think is worth taking, is that we have upgraded 29 items on the menu and made them significantly better than they were. In fact, two-to-one liking for the consumer as compared to the old products. And we do expect to get some traction with those products in the back half of the year.
So if you look at all that we've done in the first half of the year, you can essentially bring the Super Bowl launch as sort of the kick off point. And you can essentially see that February, March and April we will do a lot to put food in people's mouths, whether through the Million Burger Giveaway, couponing or aggressive deals that we'll have throughout this quarter that again are focused on the products where we've improved quality. We would expect as we get past that focus here that folks would have a much higher take rate on those products going forward and we would get some more traffic out of that. So that combined with the aggressive discounting that we'll need to do to stay competitive is what gives us confidence.
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Jeff, one other item is that while we have been certainly disappointed with the Q1 sales, if you look at the core periods in Q1 and the first four weeks in Q2, we have seen a steady acceleration in our two-year trends period-to-period here. So I think that also gives us some comfort that we are heading in the right direction here.
Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Understood. And then just specific to breakfast, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about – and it seems like now this quarter you're going to do a promotion to presumably take back some lost share. Are you concerned that maybe some of the traffic doesn't come back because maybe consumers have found an alternative and, therefore, you wouldn't make back your full share? Or how do you think about that? Maybe you could size it up in terms of what your breakfast mix is or what the breakfast margin is? Just the risk that the consumer doesn't come back, where are you most vulnerable?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Good question. And it gives me opportunity to talk about the day parts. So breakfast and lunch day parts were down slightly but dinner, snack and late night were all up. And so, when we look at this and sort of put into context what our major competitor is doing with breakfast all day and we look at the impact of that as compared to our own rollover of breakfast promotions year-over-year in quarter one, we're more concerned with the rollover of our own breakfast promotion, which primarily impacted our breakfast day part.
So when we put in context what the impact would be, we think that we can isolate breakfast to being something that we owned the results for Q1. We chose not to discount heavily and as a result we did a poor job of rolling over the success we saw in Q1 of last year. We don't attribute that to the competitive activity.

When we look at lunch, particularly from the 10:30 to noon timeframe, that's really the impact of the competitive activity on breakfast all day, and there are multiple ways that we would approach that. One is when we offer breakfast promotions, as well as any other promotion on our menu those things are available all day, regardless of whether they are breakfast or lunch/dinner items. As compared to the competitors who are doing a breakfast all day type promotion, but you cannot get their other lunch and dinner products at breakfast. So some of the ways that we combat this is that when we put things out there, we're able to get a fair share of sales outside of any day part with nontraditional items because they're offered 24/7.
Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Understood. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from the line of Mr. Alex Slagle. Your line is open. You may begin.
Alexander Russell Slagle - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk to the magnitude of the impact on Jack in the Box same-store sales in the first quarter and in the first four weeks of the second quarter from the three factors listed on the press release. And to what degree any of these headwinds diminished during the second quarter?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well I think let me just speak in general about what's happening with the competitive space on discounting. We do see that some of the major competitors are rolling off of some of the heavily discounted, low-margin promotions that they've had out there. And they're going to bigger bundles that are a little more attractive from the margin perspective. We're happy to see that that is much more in alignment with the types of things we put out in the marketplace, and we think we can compete well there. We don't think the heavy discounting of low-margin items is sustainable. Although, we took the hit in Q1, strategically even if we were to combat that going forward, it wouldn't be by copying the types of offers that they're doing. It'll be bundling high-quality food at a very competitive price point.
And then when you look at our promotional calendar, it did have a lot of mismatches really up until this timeframe that going forward we don't think will be or have the magnitude of impact that it's had so far. So we think we're not going to run into that type of situation. And then as far as the breakfast all day, I just spoke to that on the last question, but I think the most important thing that folks need to understand is that we look at the rollovers of our prior year promotions as the leading factor to our sales performance in Q1. And we look at the heavy discounting and the breakfast all day is really secondary to that. Those are things that we do have a lot of confidence that we can combat directly.
Alexander Russell Slagle - Jefferies LLC
Got it. Thanks. And a follow-up on the Super Bowl, if you could kind of talk to the magnitude, the impact on that related to the shift in timing for the Super Bowl this year versus last year and the TV media support?
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
I'll just say, Alex because the Super Bowl was a week later our promotion is a week later than the Buttery Jack. So our first four weeks of this period have only one week of the burger launch with media behind it, whereas last year's quarter that we've been talking about had two weeks out of the four weeks.
Alexander Russell Slagle - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from line of Mr. Keith Siegner. Your line's open, you may begin.
Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. I want to ask a question about the Million Burger Giveaway. And Lenny, you discussed how one of the main purposes of this was to get some trial going so people could get the taste of that new burger in their heads. What about the opportunity to acquire customer data? You know it seems like the other silver lining of this is you get this data. Maybe now you can use it as a marketing tool. Are you happy with the customer data you got through that? I mean, I just ask because I live in Connecticut and I got the burger discount by only giving my phone number, which surprised me a little bit. Are you happy with the customer data you acquired?

Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, we are. And obviously, the consumers had a choice to take it the easy way or give us more information. But we collected quite a bit of information which we think will be extremely valuable to us going forward. And that was one of the reasons why we set this thing up this way so that we did have an opportunity to collect that data.
Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC
And then just a question on Qdoba, quickly if I may. The quarter obviously very good two-year trends improved. But it came at some expense. You talked about advertising and launch supporting that trend. The guidance for next quarter is a little bit of a decel and you know the product launch is still there but we're going to back off a lot of the advertising and launch expenses. How much of last quarter's success do you attribute to the product launch itself, meaning the advertising spend, etcetera versus the product itself? Like, how do we think about those trends as the year progresses? Thanks.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I think, one thing to recognize is that Qdoba, even though we ramp up and advertising spend Qdoba is still a pretty small weight as compared to what some of the major competitors do in the advertising space. So from our standpoint it's, and we have seen this pretty clearly in the past, if the food doesn't ring true we don't see the results. And so we feel pretty confident when we see the results because we don't look at the advertising as the driver. The primary driver is the food itself. So from that standpoint it gives us a lot of confidence that we now have a whole new line of products that can help carry us throughout the remainder of the year and it's not just the one-time sort of flash in one particular quarter.
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And then, Keith, we won't tell you what the mix is for competitive reasons, but we were very happy with the mix of the Knockout Tacos. And if memory serves correct, it was better than what the test was.
Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from the line of Mr. Jeff Farmer. Your line is open. You may begin.
Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you. It was touched on, but given what could be a greater level of free cash flow with that 90% franchise mix, do you expect your two to three times leverage target to move higher as well?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
That's a great question and we plan on addressing that at the May Investor and Analyst Day meeting. But at this point in time, we haven't assessed that yet, Jeff.
Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. I'll take that and then just one more. A lot of G&A questions, but I'll offer one more. So just further drilling down along the G&A line I'm sure we could find it in the filings, but what was the G&A component of your SG&A number in 2015? And what does your target for reducing that G&A number to 3% of system sales imply on a pro forma basis? And I know it's going to be a ballpark number, but anything would be helpful.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
So here's what I'll say, Jeff. The G&A dollars last year ex-advertising were $161 million, and G&A as a percent of system-wide sales was 3.9% last year.
Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
So it depends on obviously what your system-wide sales assumptions are but as Jerry said every $4.4 million of reduction is about $0.08 per share as we go forward.
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And first quarter we did get some pension reduction coming into 2016 that we didn't have the benefit of last year. So I think we're currently tracking in the 3.6 range right now as far as G&A as a percent of system-wide sales for Q1.
Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Next question on queue; this one is coming from the line of Mr. Bob Derrington. Your line is open. You may begin.
Bob M. Derrington - Telsey Advisory Group LLC
Yeah. Thank you. My question, Lenny, is around Qdoba. Directionally, I guess over the last two or three years it seems like development of the brand is a little bit slower than what had been talked about I guess several years ago. I'm just wondering as you look at the business can you give us any kind of an update on your enthusiasm around the brand, particularly as it certainly seems that some of the new elements of the concept look to be very attractive from a consumer standpoint, but likely also increase the investment in the box. Can you give us a little bit of color on how you feel about that? And directionally, will we see development begin to pick up in future years? Or how should we think about that?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I'll answer the last part of your question first. Yeah, we do expect development to pick up in future years. The things that we've learned are basically as follows. One, we need to look at development – or remodels, and putting these new elements in play in existing markets, different from how we would approach it in completely new markets. And that's really the thing that we need to work out to get to the place where we can accelerate new unit growth. So I'll give you a little more specifics on that. In the existing market, the focus is primarily going to be food, within what is an existing platform for service. And also, in the existing markets, there are some limitations about how much we'd want to invest in those existing boxes to change the image. But we need to do enough for them to be noticed.
When we get to new markets, part of the reason for the delay is we're testing some things that are far from what we do today in existing markets. And I think our initial impression on the change, or the amount of change, or the magnitude of change, was that it was going to be a little bit less. I don't want to give away the things that we're doing, but we do have franchisees and company locations doing some things that are a far cry from the way we approached our existing businesses. And those are where we think the biggest opportunities are going to come from for growth in new markets. But we do have to test those things out.
So that's sort of the stage we're in. I think when we get into the May meeting we'll be able to share with folks more details on those things that we're testing and how they're working out so far. And that I think will show everyone why we're enthusiastic, and confident in our ability to grow. But the way that I would tell you to internalize it now is – if the magnitude of change, on a scale of 1 to 10, was initially thought to be a 3 or 4. We're looking at more of a 7 or 8 now in the way we might approach the changes in new markets to accelerate new growth.
Bob M. Derrington - Telsey Advisory Group LLC
One follow-up on that, if I may. As we look at the concept itself, originally, I think the discussion was around 50/50 company and franchise. Do you anticipate a change in that event, more towards franchise possibly?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We're going to evaluate that over the next couple of months and we'll give you an update on that in May.
Bob M. Derrington - Telsey Advisory Group LLC
Terrific. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, sir. The next question on queue. This one is coming from the line of Mr. Matthew DiFrisco. Your line is open. You may begin.

Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about any of the regional disparities that you might have seen between your two biggest states, California and Texas? Some of the data suggests that California was one of the stronger areas. So I think you're coming in a little shy.
And then also your quarter-to-date guidance was a little bit of more than a surprise to us, considering what California was trending at. When you mention the industry and the gap versus the industry, I'm assuming the industry number that you're referring to is a national number and not just purely the regional. And then is there anything to read into that that those regions are impacting you versus that national average? Thank you.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
I'll take the last one, Matt. So the data we are comparing to in the press release is the NPD QSR sandwich segment, which is the entire nation. And that's our historical number that we've continued to report on that front.
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So, Matt, just something to think about here. We're 82% franchise, but the number that we guide to is company operations. So first, we're lapping 10% number on the company side currently. And when you look at it through the lens of the question you asked, really the way I interpret it is how healthy is the brand both regionally and across all of our markets. And I think when you look at what we're achieving in the biggest part of our business, which is franchise today, which does span across all the markets, it gives us a reason to be confident in the plans that we've put in play.
So some of the higher volume sites that we run on the company side struggled to roll over some of the aggressive promotions more so than in our franchise markets. But franchise was up 1.8%. So I think that's probably a better indication seeing that it's the lion's share of our restaurants of how we're doing across the markets and maybe that helps to give you some confidence in how the brand is resonating with the guests.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Well, really what I'm asking is the industry is implied to be over 3% and even the franchisees did 1.8%. So you're on a national basis that would imply to be losing share. I'm wondering, are we missing the point, though, are we comparing apples to apples? Is Texas and California in your SKU there, is the industry growing in line with the national average so you are losing share, or is the industry not growing at that pace in those regions so perhaps your share losses on a like-to-like basis by region might not be as bad as the national average. That's what I'm trying to decipher.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Right. So here's what I'd say, Matt. NPD does not give us the regional data like Knapp-Track or some of the other indexes do. We only have it in total for the 16 brands, so I don't know how our regional results compare to those.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Do you have anything that would tell you that you're not being hurt, that it's not brand specific but it's just the category or your peers within that Texas or California regions are feeling that same trend?
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Here's what I'd say. We outperformed the industry for eight plus quarters by a pretty significant amount. This was obviously the first quarter we've underperformed in quite a while for all the factors that we've talked about, the aggressive discounting, our own promotional rollovers. And obviously we do have a higher breakfast mix than some of our other competitors out there.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC

That's helpful. Thank you.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Next question?
Operator
Thank you, ma'am. Next question on queue coming from the line of Nick Setyan. Your line is open. You may begin.
Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thanks for taking my question. You guys mentioned a $6 delta in that last week with the burger giveaway. I guess we can do some approximations to what that means. But can you just tell us, it would be really helpful, what that impact was in the context of that negative 3% in the first four weeks in Jack? If you would have backed that out, what would the comp be in the quarter-to-date period for Jack?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So here's what I can tell you. I really didn't want to tell you this because you don't know when people come in with the free coupon whether they were going to come there or not. You don't know whether this is incremental or not incremental. So having said that, so I do not know if this is incremental or not incremental, but if the people who came in were buying a normal, average check type of a purchase, sales would have been 4.9% better. But, again, let me just caveat that. I don't know how much of these are incremental or they're just traits. So I'm not sure if what I just told you was very useful, but it's the data that we have.
Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
What if we just take out that whole week in terms of the comparison from last year and this year?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And the other thing is we have the week mismatch also, Nick. But here's what I would say is part of the reason that we went to a wider range of guidance from a typical 1-point or 2-point range of a quarterly guidance to a 3-point range on a quarterly guidance including the down 3 points, is reflective of that week, which we know had impact because we were giving burgers away.
Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Then switching on Qdoba. Your competitor is going to get a lot more competitive here to try to get some of that share back that they lost presumably. So I guess we have the easier comparisons going forward on Qdoba and we are doing flat on a 14% comparison here quarter-to-date. But what's your thinking around all the different moving parts? You've got the easier comparisons. You've got a more competitive competitor. Perhaps you're opening out more stores, so there's some more cannibalization. You've got some remodels that potentially could benefit the second half if the timing is right. Can you just maybe walk through some of the different drivers, the puts and takes of the Qdoba comp for the rest of the year?
Leonard A. Comma - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So a couple things to think about. When Chipotle ran into some of their difficulties, we didn't see an immediate change in our sales that would tell us that there was a direct impact. And I think we shared that in previous communications. And then more recently as they've gotten more aggressive in the marketplace, we also didn't see an impact that would tell us that that is having a direct impact. Now, I'm sure there is some impact, but it's not to the degree that we are seeing a huge shift in our sales trends. So I would say that the risks to our comps going forward would be some aggressive activity that we didn't foresee that did start to have an impact.
And obviously we can't predict that, but what we can do is have our own aggressive promotions in the marketplace which is what we have set up, anticipating that there would be this type of activity from our major competitor. And we hope that, that would cancel out any type of impact that we might see.
So that's probably the best we can do is anticipate it, plan and put those promotions in place. But we do have some confidence based on current trends that we're not seeing an immediate shift in our own sales trends.

And then the other risk factor I think for Qdoba is always weather because we do run into more severe weather in the markets where Qdoba is dominant so there can be some week mismatches sometimes caused by weather. We don't talk about that very often. We know it's there, so it is a risk factor. But all-in-all, we're feeling good about our trends.
Carol A. DiRaimo - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Operator I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Yes, ma'am. We have a question on queue coming from the line of Mr. Jake Bartlett. Your line is open. You may begin.
Jake Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking the question. A real quick clarification on the pace or the timing of the refranchising. You mentioned over the next couple years but it was unclear to me whether that included 2016. Is this really a 2017 and 2018 program or initiative?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So it's, first of all the two years is two years from today. And presumably there could be some activity in 2016. I don't know if there will be or not. We'll know more about that for the May conversation, but at this point in time I can't answer the question any better than to say it'll be within two years.
Jake Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. So it sounds like the – I mean, it doesn't look like the refranchising here are impacting your 2016 guidance in terms of restaurant-level margins, or even G&A. As we model this, should we put any in 2016? Is that what your guidance is contemplating or not?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No. None of the refranchising or the G&A reductions are in the guidance. I would say that these are our targets that we felt were meaningful and substantial enough that we wanted to communicate them to the investing public. However, we don't have enough detail of the impact of these to put them in guidance at this point in time, either on the refranchising or on the G&A. But again, we thought they were material enough . We wanted people to know since we had made decisions to move in that direction.
Jake Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Got it. And a real quick question on Qdoba. I was also trying to see the negative mix. I know you're lapping big mix last year, but I believe that the Knockout Tacos should have been accretive to the mix is my impression. What are the moving pieces that drove that mix? Was it discounting, or couponing, or something else that drove that negative mix and what should we expect going forward?
Jerry P. Rebel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, so, a couple things. One is the mix last year was up 9.8%. So on a two-year basis, we're still up 9%. So I think that probably had the biggest impact. There was some level of trial to get the Knockout Tacos in people's mouths also, which had a little bit of an impact on the food cost. We saw a modest increase in discounting, but I'll emphasize the word modest again. And the other thing that we're seeing is that – which we really view as a good thing because it is a competitive advantage, is we are seeing a greater take rate on consumers adding the guac and the queso to their order, which is hurting the overall mix a bit because we're not getting credit for that sale piece that you normally would if they were ordering that separately. But we're happy to take that, because that's exactly what we wanted to have happen with us offering that as part of the pricing structure that we have.
Jake Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Great. Thanks a lot.
