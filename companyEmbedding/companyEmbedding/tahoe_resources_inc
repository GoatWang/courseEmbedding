Tahoe Resources Inc. (TSX: THO, NYSE: TAHO) is a mining company and intermediate precious metals producer with silver and gold mines in Canada, Guatemala and Peru. It was founded in Vancouver, BC by Kevin McArthur, former CEO of Glamis Gold and Goldcorp. Incorporated in British Columbia, Canada, the company's U.S. headquarters is located in Reno, Nevada.
In 2016, the company acquired Lake Shore Gold in Ontario, valued at $945 million CAD, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of Tahoe Resources and effectively adding Lake Shore's Timmins West and Bell Creek gold mines in Ontario to Tahoe Resources' assets,[4] which include mines in Guatemala and Peru. The company employs more than 2,000 people worldwide.[5] Tahoe Resources is a publicly traded company in the Industrial Metals and Minerals industry, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange.[6]
In 2017, Tahoe Resources was accused of using the "Guatemalan police and army violence to force its mining operation on the local communities."[7] Tahoe is facing a criminal trial in Guatemala and a civil lawsuit in Canada for previous cases of alleged repression.

Operations[edit]
Tahoe Resources has five operating mines: Escobal mine in southeast Guatemala, La Arena gold mine in northern Peru, Shahuindo gold mine in northern Peru, and the Timmins West and Bell Creek mines in Ontario, Canada.
In 2016 Tahoe achieved record silver production by producing 21.3 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $8.06 per ounce. The Company also produced 385,100 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $943 per ounce. [8]
In Q1 2017 Tahoe produced 5.7 million ounces of silver and 119,000 ounces of gold. The Company generated record earnings and cash flow from higher sales revenue and lower operating costs. [9]
Escobal Silver Mine[edit]
The Escobal project is a high-grade silver discovery located in southeast Guatemala approximately 40 km. east-southeast of Guatemala City. In addition to silver, the mine contains sizable reserves of gold, lead, and zinc.[10] Tahoe Resources acquired the project in mid-2010 from Goldcorp for $505 million (USD) in stock and cash. In November 2010, Tahoe Resources released a Preliminary Assessment[11] of the project completed by M3 Engineering. In 2015, the Escobal mine produced a record 20.4 million ounces of silver in concentrate. As of January 2016, it was estimated that the Escobal mine contained indicated resources of 389 million silver ounces at an average grade of 332 grams per tonne (g/t), along with significant quantities of lead, zinc, and gold. Proven and Probable reserves are 29.1 million tonnes at an average grade of 332 g/t silver, containing 310.4 million ounces of silver.[12] Figures such as these have caused mining experts to suggest that the Escobal mine could become one of the largest silver producers in the world.[13]
Underground development on the mine began in May 2011, and the exploitation license was granted in April 2013. Roughly 500 construction jobs were created with the mine's development. Mining operations began in September 2013, and the first precious metal concentrate shipment was sent on October 15, 2013. For the year ending December 31, 2013, Tahoe Resources announced that its net earnings for the year were $65.6 million ($0.45/share). During 2013, the company incurred $36.4 million in expenses for the Escobal mine project.[14] Commercial operations began in January 2014.[10]
Regional exploration in Guatemala was suspended in 2013 following the government's proposed moratorium on new exploration licenses. Exploration since that date has focused only on the 79.9 km2 granted concessions surrounding the Escobal mine. Dialogue continues with the Ministry of Energy and Mines to grant additional exploration licenses while community work continues in areas of exploration interest.[15]
In July 2017 Tahoe announced that the Supreme Court of Guatemala had issued a decision to temporarily suspend its Escobal mining license in response to action brought by an anti-mining organization that claimed Guatemala's Ministry of Energy and Mines had violated the Xinca Indigenous people's right of consultation in advance of granting the permit. [16]
La Arena Gold Mine[edit]
On February 9, 2015, Tahoe Resources announced a merger with Rio Alto Mining, owner of the La Arena gold mine in northern Peru, for $1.12 billion. The merger was completed on April 1, 2015.[17]
La Arena produced a company record 222,255 ounces of gold in 2014, beating estimates,[18] which was followed in 2015 with production of 230,436 ounces of gold, exceeding that previous record.
La Arena is located 480 km. north-northwest of Lima, in the eastern slope of the Western Cordillera, close to the Continental Divide, at approximately 3,400 meters above sea level. It contains two types of deposits: oxide gold in brecciated sandstone as well as copper-gold sulfide mineralization.
In January 2016, Measured and Indicated oxide resources totaled 120.8 million tonnes with an average gold grade of .32 g/t and Proven and Probable oxide reserves of 80.3 million tonnes, with an average gold grade of .36 g/t containing 919,000 ounces of gold. Meanwhile, Measured and Indicated sulfide resources for the La Arena deposit totaled 274 million tonnes with average gold and copper grades of .24 g/t and .33 percent, respectively. Proven and Probable sulfide reserves are 63.1 million tonnes with average gold and copper grades of .31 g/t and .43 percent, respectively.[19]
Shahuindo Gold Mine[edit]
In the merger between Tahoe Resources and Rio Alto Mining, Tahoe Resources took ownership of Shahuindo gold project, which Rio Alto had acquired from Sulliden Gold in August 2014.[20] Construction began on the project in mid-2015, with commercial production anticipated to begin in the second quarter of 2016.
Shahuindo is located in a prolific gold-producing area in northern Peru, 30 km. north of the La Arena mine, on the west side of the Condebamba River Valley. With topography varying from rolling hills to steep ravines, its elevation ranges from 2,400-3,600 meters above sea level. The World Wildlife Fund has designated this area as neo-tropical Peruvian "Yungas."
The mine's technical report dated January 2016 reflects Measured and Indicated oxide resources of 143.1 million tonnes with an average gold grade of .50 g/t, containing 2.28 million ounces of gold. Proven and Probable oxide reserves total 111.9 million tonnes with an average grade of .53 g/t, containing 1.91 million ounces of gold. Mineral reserves increased 87 percent over the previous technical report.[21]
Timmins West Gold Mine[edit]
In the 2016 merger between Tahoe Resources and Lake Shore Gold, Tahoe Resources acquired the Timmins West mine, located 18 km. west of Timmins, Ontario, Canada, which in 2013 was ranked the 8th largest gold-producing region in the world.[22] The mine contains three deposits: the Timmins deposit, which has been in commercial production since January 2011; the Thunder Creek deposit, which achieved commercial production in January 2012; and the 144 Gap deposit, approximately 600 meters from the Thunder Creek deposit, which is under development as of this writing, with commercial production expected in 2017. All three deposits are connected by underground drifts.
The mine is located on one of the world's most prolific gold camps, and the mine property comprises an area of about 14.5 square km. Ore from the mine is accessed using mobile equipment via internal ramps both from the surface and the main shaft. The mine currently produces 2,700 tonnes per day of ore, which is trucked to the Bell Creek mill, 42 km. away, for processing.
In 2015, the mine produced 139,000 ounces of gold from 1,011,000 tonnes processed at an average gold grade of 4.4 g/t. In January 2016, Probable mineral reserves came to 2.9 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.2 g/t, containing 392,000 ounces of gold.[23]
In January 2017 Tahoe reported it had discovered significant extensions of mineralization in the 144 Trend, deep Timmins West, Bell Creek, Vogel, Whitney and Gold River zones in the Timmins district of Canada.[15]
Bell Creek Complex[edit]
The Bell Creek Complex was acquired by Tahoe Resources, Inc. in the merger with Lake Shore Gold in 2016. It is located approximately 20 km. northeast of Timmins, Ontario, and consists of an underground gold mine and a processing facility.
In January 2015, the mine produced 39,700 ounces of gold from processing 296,200 tonnes at an average grade of 4.4 g/t. As of January 1, 2016, Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources for the Bell Creek deposit totaled 4.8 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.4 g/t containing 680,000 ounces of gold. Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves (inclusive of Mineral Resources) are 2.1 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.5 g/t containing 309,000 ounces of gold. A large resource at depth indicates a near-term opportunity to expand production and extend the mine's life.
The mill features a conventional gold mill circuit, with crushing and grinding followed by carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp processes for gold recovery. A portion of gold is recovered by gravity before the leaching process.[24]
Awards[edit]
Tahoe Resources has received the following awards:

Mid-cap winner, Best sustainability, ethics and environmental governance program, Canadian Society of Corporate Secretaries (CSCS), 2015[25]
Precious Metals and Mining TopGun CEO awarded to Kevin McArthur, Brendan Wood International, 2015/2016[26]

Precious Metals and Mining TopGun Board, Brendan Wood International, 2015/2016[28]

Alleged Role in Violence Related to Escobal Mine in 2013[edit]
Local residents' resistance to the Escobal silver mine project led to violent clashes in Spring 2013. Fears about pollution and water contamination, and about potentially damaging effects to the way of life in the area, which is primarily agricultural, caused many local residents to protest the mine's development. The surrounding communities voted against the project in 2011, but the vote was non-binding, and development proceeded.[29]
In April 2013, a series of protests began among residents of San Rafael on the public road near the mine. On April 27, seven people were shot when security guards working at the Escobal mine opened fire on 20 protesters. In a release issued on May 1, 2013, Tahoe Resources stated that the protesters were armed with machetes.[30] The media reported that Alberto Rotondo, Tahoe Resources' Security Chief for the Escobal project, was caught in a wiretap giving direct orders to murder local opponents of Tahoe's mining project.[31] On April 30, Rotondo was arrested at La Aurora Airport in Guatemala City, apparently trying to flee. Rotondo was criminally charged in Guatemala with obstruction of justice, causing minor and serious injuries, and mistreatment of a minor.[32]
Rotondo no longer works for Tahoe Resources.[33]
The seven men who were shot filed a civil lawsuit (Garcia v. Tahoe Resources Inc.) against Tahoe Resources in June 2014, alleging that Rotondo ordered the shooting and that Tahoe Resources was legally responsible for the shooting. The suit alleged assault, aggravated assault, and obstruction of justice, and that the shooting was premeditated.[34] On November 9, 2015, the Supreme Court of British Columbia stayed a judgment in favor of Tahoe Resources.[35]

Proven and Probable oxide reserves total 111.9 million tonnes with an average grade of .53 g/t, containing 1.91 million ounces of gold. Mineral reserves increased 87 percent over the previous technical report.[21]
Timmins West Gold Mine[edit]
In the 2016 merger between Tahoe Resources and Lake Shore Gold, Tahoe Resources acquired the Timmins West mine, located 18 km. west of Timmins, Ontario, Canada, which in 2013 was ranked the 8th largest gold-producing region in the world.[22] The mine contains three deposits: the Timmins deposit, which has been in commercial production since January 2011; the Thunder Creek deposit, which achieved commercial production in January 2012; and the 144 Gap deposit, approximately 600 meters from the Thunder Creek deposit, which is under development as of this writing, with commercial production expected in 2017. All three deposits are connected by underground drifts.
The mine is located on one of the world's most prolific gold camps, and the mine property comprises an area of about 14.5 square km. Ore from the mine is accessed using mobile equipment via internal ramps both from the surface and the main shaft. The mine currently produces 2,700 tonnes per day of ore, which is trucked to the Bell Creek mill, 42 km. away, for processing.
In 2015, the mine produced 139,000 ounces of gold from 1,011,000 tonnes processed at an average gold grade of 4.4 g/t. In January 2016, Probable mineral reserves came to 2.9 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.2 g/t, containing 392,000 ounces of gold.[23]
In January 2017 Tahoe reported it had discovered significant extensions of mineralization in the 144 Trend, deep Timmins West, Bell Creek, Vogel, Whitney and Gold River zones in the Timmins district of Canada.[15]
Bell Creek Complex[edit]
The Bell Creek Complex was acquired by Tahoe Resources, Inc. in the merger with Lake Shore Gold in 2016. It is located approximately 20 km. northeast of Timmins, Ontario, and consists of an underground gold mine and a processing facility.
In January 2015, the mine produced 39,700 ounces of gold from processing 296,200 tonnes at an average grade of 4.4 g/t. As of January 1, 2016, Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources for the Bell Creek deposit totaled 4.8 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.4 g/t containing 680,000 ounces of gold. Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves (inclusive of Mineral Resources) are 2.1 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.5 g/t containing 309,000 ounces of gold. A large resource at depth indicates a near-term opportunity to expand production and extend the mine's life.
The mill features a conventional gold mill circuit, with crushing and grinding followed by carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp processes for gold recovery. A portion of gold is recovered by gravity before the leaching process.[24]

Alleged Role in Violence Related to Escobal Mine in 2013[edit]
Local residents' resistance to the Escobal silver mine project led to violent clashes in Spring 2013. Fears about pollution and water contamination, and about potentially damaging effects to the way of life in the area, which is primarily agricultural, caused many local residents to protest the mine's development. The surrounding communities voted against the project in 2011, but the vote was non-binding, and development proceeded.[29]
In April 2013, a series of protests began among residents of San Rafael on the public road near the mine. On April 27, seven people were shot when security guards working at the Escobal mine opened fire on 20 protesters. In a release issued on May 1, 2013, Tahoe Resources stated that the protesters were armed with machetes.[30] The media reported that Alberto Rotondo, Tahoe Resources' Security Chief for the Escobal project, was caught in a wiretap giving direct orders to murder local opponents of Tahoe's mining project.[31] On April 30, Rotondo was arrested at La Aurora Airport in Guatemala City, apparently trying to flee. Rotondo was criminally charged in Guatemala with obstruction of justice, causing minor and serious injuries, and mistreatment of a minor.[32]
Rotondo no longer works for Tahoe Resources.[33]
The seven men who were shot filed a civil lawsuit (Garcia v. Tahoe Resources Inc.) against Tahoe Resources in June 2014, alleging that Rotondo ordered the shooting and that Tahoe Resources was legally responsible for the shooting. The suit alleged assault, aggravated assault, and obstruction of justice, and that the shooting was premeditated.[34] On November 9, 2015, the Supreme Court of British Columbia stayed a judgment in favor of Tahoe Resources.[35]

Tahoe Resources Inc. (TSX: THO, NYSE: TAHO) is a mining company and intermediate precious metals producer with silver and gold mines in Canada, Guatemala and Peru. It was founded in Vancouver, BC by Kevin McArthur, former CEO of Glamis Gold and Goldcorp. Incorporated in British Columbia, Canada, the company's U.S. headquarters is located in Reno, Nevada.
In 2016, the company acquired Lake Shore Gold in Ontario, valued at $945 million CAD, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of Tahoe Resources and effectively adding Lake Shore's Timmins West and Bell Creek gold mines in Ontario to Tahoe Resources' assets,[4] which include mines in Guatemala and Peru. The company employs more than 2,000 people worldwide.[5] Tahoe Resources is a publicly traded company in the Industrial Metals and Minerals industry, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange.[6]
In 2017, Tahoe Resources was accused of using the "Guatemalan police and army violence to force its mining operation on the local communities."[7] Tahoe is facing a criminal trial in Guatemala and a civil lawsuit in Canada for previous cases of alleged repression.

Operations[edit]
Tahoe Resources has five operating mines: Escobal mine in southeast Guatemala, La Arena gold mine in northern Peru, Shahuindo gold mine in northern Peru, and the Timmins West and Bell Creek mines in Ontario, Canada.
In 2016 Tahoe achieved record silver production by producing 21.3 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $8.06 per ounce. The Company also produced 385,100 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $943 per ounce. [8]
In Q1 2017 Tahoe produced 5.7 million ounces of silver and 119,000 ounces of gold. The Company generated record earnings and cash flow from higher sales revenue and lower operating costs. [9]
Escobal Silver Mine[edit]
The Escobal project is a high-grade silver discovery located in southeast Guatemala approximately 40 km. east-southeast of Guatemala City. In addition to silver, the mine contains sizable reserves of gold, lead, and zinc.[10] Tahoe Resources acquired the project in mid-2010 from Goldcorp for $505 million (USD) in stock and cash. In November 2010, Tahoe Resources released a Preliminary Assessment[11] of the project completed by M3 Engineering. In 2015, the Escobal mine produced a record 20.4 million ounces of silver in concentrate. As of January 2016, it was estimated that the Escobal mine contained indicated resources of 389 million silver ounces at an average grade of 332 grams per tonne (g/t), along with significant quantities of lead, zinc, and gold. Proven and Probable reserves are 29.1 million tonnes at an average grade of 332 g/t silver, containing 310.4 million ounces of silver.[12] Figures such as these have caused mining experts to suggest that the Escobal mine could become one of the largest silver producers in the world.[13]
Underground development on the mine began in May 2011, and the exploitation license was granted in April 2013. Roughly 500 construction jobs were created with the mine's development. Mining operations began in September 2013, and the first precious metal concentrate shipment was sent on October 15, 2013. For the year ending December 31, 2013, Tahoe Resources announced that its net earnings for the year were $65.6 million ($0.45/share). During 2013, the company incurred $36.4 million in expenses for the Escobal mine project.[14] Commercial operations began in January 2014.[10]
Regional exploration in Guatemala was suspended in 2013 following the government's proposed moratorium on new exploration licenses. Exploration since that date has focused only on the 79.9 km2 granted concessions surrounding the Escobal mine. Dialogue continues with the Ministry of Energy and Mines to grant additional exploration licenses while community work continues in areas of exploration interest.[15]
In July 2017 Tahoe announced that the Supreme Court of Guatemala had issued a decision to temporarily suspend its Escobal mining license in response to action brought by an anti-mining organization that claimed Guatemala's Ministry of Energy and Mines had violated the Xinca Indigenous people's right of consultation in advance of granting the permit. [16]
La Arena Gold Mine[edit]
On February 9, 2015, Tahoe Resources announced a merger with Rio Alto Mining, owner of the La Arena gold mine in northern Peru, for $1.12 billion. The merger was completed on April 1, 2015.[17]
La Arena produced a company record 222,255 ounces of gold in 2014, beating estimates,[18] which was followed in 2015 with production of 230,436 ounces of gold, exceeding that previous record.
La Arena is located 480 km. north-northwest of Lima, in the eastern slope of the Western Cordillera, close to the Continental Divide, at approximately 3,400 meters above sea level. It contains two types of deposits: oxide gold in brecciated sandstone as well as copper-gold sulfide mineralization.
In January 2016, Measured and Indicated oxide resources totaled 120.8 million tonnes with an average gold grade of .32 g/t and Proven and Probable oxide reserves of 80.3 million tonnes, with an average gold grade of .36 g/t containing 919,000 ounces of gold. Meanwhile, Measured and Indicated sulfide resources for the La Arena deposit totaled 274 million tonnes with average gold and copper grades of .24 g/t and .33 percent, respectively. Proven and Probable sulfide reserves are 63.1 million tonnes with average gold and copper grades of .31 g/t and .43 percent, respectively.[19]
Shahuindo Gold Mine[edit]
In the merger between Tahoe Resources and Rio Alto Mining, Tahoe Resources took ownership of Shahuindo gold project, which Rio Alto had acquired from Sulliden Gold in August 2014.[20] Construction began on the project in mid-2015, with commercial production anticipated to begin in the second quarter of 2016.
Shahuindo is located in a prolific gold-producing area in northern Peru, 30 km. north of the La Arena mine, on the west side of the Condebamba River Valley. With topography varying from rolling hills to steep ravines, its elevation ranges from 2,400-3,600 meters above sea level. The World Wildlife Fund has designated this area as neo-tropical Peruvian "Yungas."
The mine's technical report dated January 2016 reflects Measured and Indicated oxide resources of 143.1 million tonnes with an average gold grade of .50 g/t, containing 2.28 million ounces of gold. Proven and Probable oxide reserves total 111.9 million tonnes with an average grade of .53 g/t, containing 1.91 million ounces of gold. Mineral reserves increased 87 percent over the previous technical report.[21]
Timmins West Gold Mine[edit]
In the 2016 merger between Tahoe Resources and Lake Shore Gold, Tahoe Resources acquired the Timmins West mine, located 18 km. west of Timmins, Ontario, Canada, which in 2013 was ranked the 8th largest gold-producing region in the world.[22] The mine contains three deposits: the Timmins deposit, which has been in commercial production since January 2011; the Thunder Creek deposit, which achieved commercial production in January 2012; and the 144 Gap deposit, approximately 600 meters from the Thunder Creek deposit, which is under development as of this writing, with commercial production expected in 2017.

In January 2017 Tahoe reported it had discovered significant extensions of mineralization in the 144 Trend, deep Timmins West, Bell Creek, Vogel, Whitney and Gold River zones in the Timmins district of Canada.[15]
Bell Creek Complex[edit]
The Bell Creek Complex was acquired by Tahoe Resources, Inc. in the merger with Lake Shore Gold in 2016. It is located approximately 20 km. northeast of Timmins, Ontario, and consists of an underground gold mine and a processing facility.
In January 2015, the mine produced 39,700 ounces of gold from processing 296,200 tonnes at an average grade of 4.4 g/t. As of January 1, 2016, Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources for the Bell Creek deposit totaled 4.8 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.4 g/t containing 680,000 ounces of gold.

Operations[edit]
Tahoe Resources has five operating mines: Escobal mine in southeast Guatemala, La Arena gold mine in northern Peru, Shahuindo gold mine in northern Peru, and the Timmins West and Bell Creek mines in Ontario, Canada.
In 2016 Tahoe achieved record silver production by producing 21.3 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $8.06 per ounce. The Company also produced 385,100 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $943 per ounce. [8]
In Q1 2017 Tahoe produced 5.7 million ounces of silver and 119,000 ounces of gold. The Company generated record earnings and cash flow from higher sales revenue and lower operating costs. [9]
Escobal Silver Mine[edit]
The Escobal project is a high-grade silver discovery located in southeast Guatemala approximately 40 km. east-southeast of Guatemala City. In addition to silver, the mine contains sizable reserves of gold, lead, and zinc.[10] Tahoe Resources acquired the project in mid-2010 from Goldcorp for $505 million (USD) in stock and cash. In November 2010, Tahoe Resources released a Preliminary Assessment[11] of the project completed by M3 Engineering. In 2015, the Escobal mine produced a record 20.4 million ounces of silver in concentrate. As of January 2016, it was estimated that the Escobal mine contained indicated resources of 389 million silver ounces at an average grade of 332 grams per tonne (g/t), along with significant quantities of lead, zinc, and gold. Proven and Probable reserves are 29.1 million tonnes at an average grade of 332 g/t silver, containing 310.4 million ounces of silver.[12] Figures such as these have caused mining experts to suggest that the Escobal mine could become one of the largest silver producers in the world.[13]
Underground development on the mine began in May 2011, and the exploitation license was granted in April 2013. Roughly 500 construction jobs were created with the mine's development. Mining operations began in September 2013, and the first precious metal concentrate shipment was sent on October 15, 2013. For the year ending December 31, 2013, Tahoe Resources announced that its net earnings for the year were $65.6 million ($0.45/share). During 2013, the company incurred $36.4 million in expenses for the Escobal mine project.[14] Commercial operations began in January 2014.[10]
Regional exploration in Guatemala was suspended in 2013 following the government's proposed moratorium on new exploration licenses. Exploration since that date has focused only on the 79.9 km2 granted concessions surrounding the Escobal mine. Dialogue continues with the Ministry of Energy and Mines to grant additional exploration licenses while community work continues in areas of exploration interest.[15]
In July 2017 Tahoe announced that the Supreme Court of Guatemala had issued a decision to temporarily suspend its Escobal mining license in response to action brought by an anti-mining organization that claimed Guatemala's Ministry of Energy and Mines had violated the Xinca Indigenous people's right of consultation in advance of granting the permit. [16]
La Arena Gold Mine[edit]
On February 9, 2015, Tahoe Resources announced a merger with Rio Alto Mining, owner of the La Arena gold mine in northern Peru, for $1.12 billion. The merger was completed on April 1, 2015.[17]
La Arena produced a company record 222,255 ounces of gold in 2014, beating estimates,[18] which was followed in 2015 with production of 230,436 ounces of gold, exceeding that previous record.
La Arena is located 480 km. north-northwest of Lima, in the eastern slope of the Western Cordillera, close to the Continental Divide, at approximately 3,400 meters above sea level. It contains two types of deposits: oxide gold in brecciated sandstone as well as copper-gold sulfide mineralization.
In January 2016, Measured and Indicated oxide resources totaled 120.8 million tonnes with an average gold grade of .32 g/t and Proven and Probable oxide reserves of 80.3 million tonnes, with an average gold grade of .36 g/t containing 919,000 ounces of gold. Meanwhile, Measured and Indicated sulfide resources for the La Arena deposit totaled 274 million tonnes with average gold and copper grades of .24 g/t and .33 percent, respectively. Proven and Probable sulfide reserves are 63.1 million tonnes with average gold and copper grades of .31 g/t and .43 percent, respectively.[19]
Shahuindo Gold Mine[edit]
In the merger between Tahoe Resources and Rio Alto Mining, Tahoe Resources took ownership of Shahuindo gold project, which Rio Alto had acquired from Sulliden Gold in August 2014.[20] Construction began on the project in mid-2015, with commercial production anticipated to begin in the second quarter of 2016.
Shahuindo is located in a prolific gold-producing area in northern Peru, 30 km. north of the La Arena mine, on the west side of the Condebamba River Valley. With topography varying from rolling hills to steep ravines, its elevation ranges from 2,400-3,600 meters above sea level. The World Wildlife Fund has designated this area as neo-tropical Peruvian "Yungas."
The mine's technical report dated January 2016 reflects Measured and Indicated oxide resources of 143.1 million tonnes with an average gold grade of .50 g/t, containing 2.28 million ounces of gold. Proven and Probable oxide reserves total 111.9 million tonnes with an average grade of .53 g/t, containing 1.91 million ounces of gold. Mineral reserves increased 87 percent over the previous technical report.[21]
Timmins West Gold Mine[edit]
In the 2016 merger between Tahoe Resources and Lake Shore Gold, Tahoe Resources acquired the Timmins West mine, located 18 km. west of Timmins, Ontario, Canada, which in 2013 was ranked the 8th largest gold-producing region in the world.[22] The mine contains three deposits: the Timmins deposit, which has been in commercial production since January 2011; the Thunder Creek deposit, which achieved commercial production in January 2012; and the 144 Gap deposit, approximately 600 meters from the Thunder Creek deposit, which is under development as of this writing, with commercial production expected in 2017. All three deposits are connected by underground drifts.
The mine is located on one of the world's most prolific gold camps, and the mine property comprises an area of about 14.5 square km. Ore from the mine is accessed using mobile equipment via internal ramps both from the surface and the main shaft. The mine currently produces 2,700 tonnes per day of ore, which is trucked to the Bell Creek mill, 42 km. away, for processing.
In 2015, the mine produced 139,000 ounces of gold from 1,011,000 tonnes processed at an average gold grade of 4.4 g/t. In January 2016, Probable mineral reserves came to 2.9 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.2 g/t, containing 392,000 ounces of gold.[23]
In January 2017 Tahoe reported it had discovered significant extensions of mineralization in the 144 Trend, deep Timmins West, Bell Creek, Vogel, Whitney and Gold River zones in the Timmins district of Canada.[15]
Bell Creek Complex[edit]
The Bell Creek Complex was acquired by Tahoe Resources, Inc. in the merger with Lake Shore Gold in 2016. It is located approximately 20 km. northeast of Timmins, Ontario, and consists of an underground gold mine and a processing facility.
In January 2015, the mine produced 39,700 ounces of gold from processing 296,200 tonnes at an average grade of 4.4 g/t. As of January 1, 2016, Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources for the Bell Creek deposit totaled 4.8 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.4 g/t containing 680,000 ounces of gold. Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves (inclusive of Mineral Resources) are 2.1 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.5 g/t containing 309,000 ounces of gold. A large resource at depth indicates a near-term opportunity to expand production and extend the mine's life.
The mill features a conventional gold mill circuit, with crushing and grinding followed by carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp processes for gold recovery. A portion of gold is recovered by gravity before the leaching process.[24]
Awards[edit]
Tahoe Resources has received the following awards:

Mid-cap winner, Best sustainability, ethics and environmental governance program, Canadian Society of Corporate Secretaries (CSCS), 2015[25]

Alleged Role in Violence Related to Escobal Mine in 2013[edit]
Local residents' resistance to the Escobal silver mine project led to violent clashes in Spring 2013. Fears about pollution and water contamination, and about potentially damaging effects to the way of life in the area, which is primarily agricultural, caused many local residents to protest the mine's development. The surrounding communities voted against the project in 2011, but the vote was non-binding, and development proceeded.[29]
In April 2013, a series of protests began among residents of San Rafael on the public road near the mine. On April 27, seven people were shot when security guards working at the Escobal mine opened fire on 20 protesters. In a release issued on May 1, 2013, Tahoe Resources stated that the protesters were armed with machetes.[30] The media reported that Alberto Rotondo, Tahoe Resources' Security Chief for the Escobal project, was caught in a wiretap giving direct orders to murder local opponents of Tahoe's mining project.[31] On April 30, Rotondo was arrested at La Aurora Airport in Guatemala City, apparently trying to flee. Rotondo was criminally charged in Guatemala with obstruction of justice, causing minor and serious injuries, and mistreatment of a minor.[32]
Rotondo no longer works for Tahoe Resources.[33]
The seven men who were shot filed a civil lawsuit (Garcia v. Tahoe Resources Inc.) against Tahoe Resources in June 2014, alleging that Rotondo ordered the shooting and that Tahoe Resources was legally responsible for the shooting. The suit alleged assault, aggravated assault, and obstruction of justice, and that the shooting was premeditated.[34] On November 9, 2015, the Supreme Court of British Columbia stayed a judgment in favor of Tahoe Resources.[35]

Meanwhile, Measured and Indicated sulfide resources for the La Arena deposit totaled 274 million tonnes with average gold and copper grades of .24 g/t and .33 percent, respectively. Proven and Probable sulfide reserves are 63.1 million tonnes with average gold and copper grades of .31 g/t and .43 percent, respectively.[19]
Shahuindo Gold Mine[edit]
In the merger between Tahoe Resources and Rio Alto Mining, Tahoe Resources took ownership of Shahuindo gold project, which Rio Alto had acquired from Sulliden Gold in August 2014.[20] Construction began on the project in mid-2015, with commercial production anticipated to begin in the second quarter of 2016.
Shahuindo is located in a prolific gold-producing area in northern Peru, 30 km. north of the La Arena mine, on the west side of the Condebamba River Valley. With topography varying from rolling hills to steep ravines, its elevation ranges from 2,400-3,600 meters above sea level. The World Wildlife Fund has designated this area as neo-tropical Peruvian "Yungas."
The mine's technical report dated January 2016 reflects Measured and Indicated oxide resources of 143.1 million tonnes with an average gold grade of .50 g/t, containing 2.28 million ounces of gold. Proven and Probable oxide reserves total 111.9 million tonnes with an average grade of .53 g/t, containing 1.91 million ounces of gold. Mineral reserves increased 87 percent over the previous technical report.[21]
Timmins West Gold Mine[edit]
In the 2016 merger between Tahoe Resources and Lake Shore Gold, Tahoe Resources acquired the Timmins West mine, located 18 km. west of Timmins, Ontario, Canada, which in 2013 was ranked the 8th largest gold-producing region in the world.[22] The mine contains three deposits: the Timmins deposit, which has been in commercial production since January 2011; the Thunder Creek deposit, which achieved commercial production in January 2012; and the 144 Gap deposit, approximately 600 meters from the Thunder Creek deposit, which is under development as of this writing, with commercial production expected in 2017. All three deposits are connected by underground drifts.
The mine is located on one of the world's most prolific gold camps, and the mine property comprises an area of about 14.5 square km. Ore from the mine is accessed using mobile equipment via internal ramps both from the surface and the main shaft. The mine currently produces 2,700 tonnes per day of ore, which is trucked to the Bell Creek mill, 42 km. away, for processing.
In 2015, the mine produced 139,000 ounces of gold from 1,011,000 tonnes processed at an average gold grade of 4.4 g/t. In January 2016, Probable mineral reserves came to 2.9 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.2 g/t, containing 392,000 ounces of gold.[23]
In January 2017 Tahoe reported it had discovered significant extensions of mineralization in the 144 Trend, deep Timmins West, Bell Creek, Vogel, Whitney and Gold River zones in the Timmins district of Canada.[15]
Bell Creek Complex[edit]
The Bell Creek Complex was acquired by Tahoe Resources, Inc. in the merger with Lake Shore Gold in 2016. It is located approximately 20 km. northeast of Timmins, Ontario, and consists of an underground gold mine and a processing facility.
In January 2015, the mine produced 39,700 ounces of gold from processing 296,200 tonnes at an average grade of 4.4 g/t. As of January 1, 2016, Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources for the Bell Creek deposit totaled 4.8 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.4 g/t containing 680,000 ounces of gold. Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves (inclusive of Mineral Resources) are 2.1 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 4.5 g/t containing 309,000 ounces of gold. A large resource at depth indicates a near-term opportunity to expand production and extend the mine's life.
The mill features a conventional gold mill circuit, with crushing and grinding followed by carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp processes for gold recovery. A portion of gold is recovered by gravity before the leaching process.[24]
Awards[edit]
Tahoe Resources has received the following awards:

Alleged Role in Violence Related to Escobal Mine in 2013[edit]
Local residents' resistance to the Escobal silver mine project led to violent clashes in Spring 2013. Fears about pollution and water contamination, and about potentially damaging effects to the way of life in the area, which is primarily agricultural, caused many local residents to protest the mine's development. The surrounding communities voted against the project in 2011, but the vote was non-binding, and development proceeded.[29]
In April 2013, a series of protests began among residents of San Rafael on the public road near the mine. On April 27, seven people were shot when security guards working at the Escobal mine opened fire on 20 protesters. In a release issued on May 1, 2013, Tahoe Resources stated that the protesters were armed with machetes.[30] The media reported that Alberto Rotondo, Tahoe Resources' Security Chief for the Escobal project, was caught in a wiretap giving direct orders to murder local opponents of Tahoe's mining project.[31] On April 30, Rotondo was arrested at La Aurora Airport in Guatemala City, apparently trying to flee. Rotondo was criminally charged in Guatemala with obstruction of justice, causing minor and serious injuries, and mistreatment of a minor.[32]
Rotondo no longer works for Tahoe Resources.[33]
The seven men who were shot filed a civil lawsuit (Garcia v. Tahoe Resources Inc.) against Tahoe Resources in June 2014, alleging that Rotondo ordered the shooting and that Tahoe Resources was legally responsible for the shooting. The suit alleged assault, aggravated assault, and obstruction of justice, and that the shooting was premeditated.[34] On November 9, 2015, the Supreme Court of British Columbia stayed a judgment in favor of Tahoe Resources.[35]

Tahoe Resources Inc. (TSX: THO, NYSE: TAHO) is a mining company and intermediate precious metals producer with silver and gold mines in Canada, Guatemala and Peru. It was founded in Vancouver, BC by Kevin McArthur, former CEO of Glamis Gold and Goldcorp. Incorporated in British Columbia, Canada, the company's U.S. headquarters is located in Reno, Nevada.
In 2016, the company acquired Lake Shore Gold in Ontario, valued at $945 million CAD, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of Tahoe Resources and effectively adding Lake Shore's Timmins West and Bell Creek gold mines in Ontario to Tahoe Resources' assets,[4] which include mines in Guatemala and Peru. The company employs more than 2,000 people worldwide.[5] Tahoe Resources is a publicly traded company in the Industrial Metals and Minerals industry, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange.[6]
In 2017, Tahoe Resources was accused of using the "Guatemalan police and army violence to force its mining operation on the local communities."[7] Tahoe is facing a criminal trial in Guatemala and a civil lawsuit in Canada for previous cases of alleged repression.

Operations[edit]
Tahoe Resources has five operating mines: Escobal mine in southeast Guatemala, La Arena gold mine in northern Peru, Shahuindo gold mine in northern Peru, and the Timmins West and Bell Creek mines in Ontario, Canada.
In 2016 Tahoe achieved record silver production by producing 21.3 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $8.06 per ounce. The Company also produced 385,100 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $943 per ounce. [8]
In Q1 2017 Tahoe produced 5.7 million ounces of silver and 119,000 ounces of gold. The Company generated record earnings and cash flow from higher sales revenue and lower operating costs. [9]
Escobal Silver Mine[edit]
The Escobal project is a high-grade silver discovery located in southeast Guatemala approximately 40 km. east-southeast of Guatemala City. In addition to silver, the mine contains sizable reserves of gold, lead, and zinc.[10] Tahoe Resources acquired the project in mid-2010 from Goldcorp for $505 million (USD) in stock and cash. In November 2010, Tahoe Resources released a Preliminary Assessment[11] of the project completed by M3 Engineering. In 2015, the Escobal mine produced a record 20.4 million ounces of silver in concentrate. As of January 2016, it was estimated that the Escobal mine contained indicated resources of 389 million silver ounces at an average grade of 332 grams per tonne (g/t), along with significant quantities of lead, zinc, and gold. Proven and Probable reserves are 29.1 million tonnes at an average grade of 332 g/t silver, containing 310.4 million ounces of silver.[12] Figures such as these have caused mining experts to suggest that the Escobal mine could become one of the largest silver producers in the world.[13]
Underground development on the mine began in May 2011, and the exploitation license was granted in April 2013. Roughly 500 construction jobs were created with the mine's development. Mining operations began in September 2013, and the first precious metal concentrate shipment was sent on October 15, 2013. For the year ending December 31, 2013, Tahoe Resources announced that its net earnings for the year were $65.6 million ($0.45/share). During 2013, the company incurred $36.4 million in expenses for the Escobal mine project.[14] Commercial operations began in January 2014.[10]
Regional exploration in Guatemala was suspended in 2013 following the government's proposed moratorium on new exploration licenses. Exploration since that date has focused only on the 79.9 km2 granted concessions surrounding the Escobal mine. Dialogue continues with the Ministry of Energy and Mines to grant additional exploration licenses while community work continues in areas of exploration interest.[15]
In July 2017 Tahoe announced that the Supreme Court of Guatemala had issued a decision to temporarily suspend its Escobal mining license in response to action brought by an anti-mining organization that claimed Guatemala's Ministry of Energy and Mines had violated the Xinca Indigenous people's right of consultation in advance of granting the permit. [16]
La Arena Gold Mine[edit]
On February 9, 2015, Tahoe Resources announced a merger with Rio Alto Mining, owner of the La Arena gold mine in northern Peru, for $1.12 billion. The merger was completed on April 1, 2015.[17]
La Arena produced a company record 222,255 ounces of gold in 2014, beating estimates,[18] which was followed in 2015 with production of 230,436 ounces of gold, exceeding that previous record.
La Arena is located 480 km. north-northwest of Lima, in the eastern slope of the Western Cordillera, close to the Continental Divide, at approximately 3,400 meters above sea level. It contains two types of deposits: oxide gold in brecciated sandstone as well as copper-gold sulfide mineralization.
In January 2016, Measured and Indicated oxide resources totaled 120.8 million tonnes with an average gold grade of .32 g/t and Proven and Probable oxide reserves of 80.3 million tonnes, with an average gold grade of .36 g/t containing 919,000 ounces of gold. Meanwhile, Measured and Indicated sulfide resources for the La Arena deposit totaled 274 million tonnes with average gold and copper grades of .24 g/t and .33 percent, respectively. Proven and Probable sulfide reserves are 63.1 million tonnes with average gold and copper grades of .31 g/t and .43 percent, respectively.[19]
Shahuindo Gold Mine[edit]
In the merger between Tahoe Resources and Rio Alto Mining, Tahoe Resources took ownership of Shahuindo gold project, which Rio Alto had acquired from Sulliden Gold in August 2014.[20] Construction began on the project in mid-2015, with commercial production anticipated to begin in the second quarter of 2016.
Shahuindo is located in a prolific gold-producing area in northern Peru, 30 km. north of the La Arena mine, on the west side of the Condebamba River Valley. With topography varying from rolling hills to steep ravines, its elevation ranges from 2,400-3,600 meters above sea level. The World Wildlife Fund has designated this area as neo-tropical Peruvian "Yungas."
The mine's technical report dated January 2016 reflects Measured and Indicated oxide resources of 143.1 million tonnes with an average gold grade of .50 g/t, containing 2.28 million ounces of gold. Proven and Probable oxide reserves total 111.9 million tonnes with an average grade of .53 g/t, containing 1.91 million ounces of gold. Mineral reserves increased 87 percent over the previous technical report.[21]
Timmins West Gold Mine[edit]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The average true range (ATR) was fashioned to allow traders to more precisely evaluate the daily volatility of an asset by using straightforward calculations. However the indicator does not specify the price direction, rather it is used first and foremost to measure volatility caused by gaps and limit up or down moves. The ATR is fairly simple to calculate and only needs historical price data.
ATR is counted for different periods, like 9-day, 14-day, 20-day, 50-day and 100-day. At the moment, the 14-day ATR for TTM Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTMI) is noted at 0.47.

Escobal Mine
Key Facts


One of the largest silver mines in world
Intermediate sulfidation silver-gold-lead-zinc vein deposit hosted in Tertiary andesite and volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks
January 2017 Proven & Probable mineral reserves of 23.7 million tonnes with an average silver grade of 351 g/t containing 267.5 M ounces of silver
Completed three years of production
2016 production of 21.2 million ounces of silver in concentrate


Description
The Escobal mine is located in southeast Guatemala, approximately 40 km east-southeast of Guatemala City. The deposit is an intermediate-sulfidation silver-gold-lead-zinc vein deposit hosted in Tertiary andesite and volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks. Continuous precious- and base-metal mineralization extends over wide (10m to locally 50m) zones defined over 2,400m laterally and 1,200m vertically. As of January 1, 2017, Measured and Indicated mineral resources for the Escobal deposit totaled 368 million silver ounces at an average grade of 323 grams per tonne (g/t), with significant quantities of lead, zinc and gold. Proven & Probable Reserves are 23.7 million tonnes at an average grade of 351 g/t silver, containing 267.5 million ounces of silver.
Tahoe is mining the Escobal deposit by underground longhole stoping methods with processing by differential flotation to produce precious metal-rich lead and zinc concentrates. In 2016, the Escobal mine produced a record 21.2 million ounces of silver in concentrate at total cash costs per ounce of silver produced net of byproduct credits of $5.84, with all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) of $8.06.per ounce produced net of byproduct credits. The mine is currently operating at the expanded design rate of 4,500 tonnes per day (tpd).
About the Region
Escobal is approximately three km from San Rafael las Flores, a town of approximately 3,000 people and approximately 70 km southeast of Guatemala City by paved road. Access to the area also is possible from the northeast on a paved highway via the town of Mataquescuintla. The local climate consists of two major seasons; a rainy season between May and November and a dry season between November and May. Mining activities are conducted year-round.
The project area lies within mountainous terrain interspersed with rolling hills and valleys. Elevations range from 1,300 m in the valley on the west end of the Escobal Vein to 1,800 m at the easternmost portion of the vein identified to date. The high mountain range of Montaña Soledad Grande north and east of Escobal rises to an elevation of 2,600 m.
Vegetation is characterized by natural mountain forest species that consist of oak, pine and cypress varieties and lower strata scrub brush species. Agricultural products in the area include corn and beans for local consumption and commercial production of onions, tomatoes and coffee.

Tahoe Resources Inc. And Lake Shore Gold Corp. Complete Business Combination; Announce Election To Redeem Convertible Debentures

Tahoe Resources Inc.

VANCOUVER, April 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Tahoe Resources Inc. ("Tahoe") (TSX: THO, NYSE:    TAHO) and Lake Shore Gold Corp. ("Lake Shore Gold") (TSX, NYSE MKT: LSG) are pleased to announce that the business combination between Tahoe and Lake Shore Gold by way of a plan of arrangement (the "Arrangement") has been completed effective April 1, 2016.








Pursuant to the Arrangement, Tahoe acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Lake Shore Gold ("Lake Shore Gold Shares") for consideration consisting of 0.1467 common shares of Tahoe ("Tahoe Shares") for each outstanding Lake Shore Gold Share (the "Exchange Ratio"), such that Lake Shore Gold is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tahoe. On closing of the Arrangement, Tahoe issued an aggregate of 69,239,629 Tahoe Shares to former Lake Shore Gold shareholders, who now hold approximately 23.32% of the 296,900,457 Tahoe Shares issued and outstanding, on an undiluted basis. 
Additionally, outstanding options to acquire Lake Shore Gold Shares have been exchanged for options of Tahoe and will entitle the holders to receive, upon exercise thereof, Tahoe Shares based on the Exchange Ratio.  
The Lake Shore Gold Shares are expected to be de-listed from both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE MKT as soon as practicable. The outstanding $103,181,000 principal aggregate amount of 6.25% convertible unsecured debentures of Lake Shore Gold ("Debentures") will remain listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol "LSG.DB".  
Lake Shore Gold's convertible debenture indenture dated September 7, 2012 (the "Indenture") governs the terms of the Debentures. As a result of the Arrangement and in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, on conversion of the Debentures each debentureholder will be entitled to receive Tahoe Shares (in lieu of Lake Shore Gold Shares), based on the Exchange Ratio. Tahoe and Lake Share Gold have entered into a supplement to the Indenture with Computershare Trust Company of Canada, as trustee, to, among other things, evidence Tahoe's agreement to issue Tahoe Shares to any debentureholder upon conversion of the Debentures. 
The completion of the Arrangement constitutes a change of control under the terms of the Indenture. Pursuant to its obligations under the Indenture, Lake Shore Gold today gave notice of its offer to purchase all of the Debentures at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Indenture (the "Change of Control Offer"). In accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Change of Control Offer will expire at 5:00 pm (Toronto time) on April 18, 2016, and debentureholders who accept the Change of Control Offer will be paid on May 13, 2016. 
Additionally, as the current market price of the Lake Shore Gold Shares is greater than 130% of the conversion price (as determined in accordance with the Indenture), Lake Shore Gold today gave notice of its election to redeem the Debentures on May 16, 2016 (the "Redemption Date") at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. Pursuant to the Indenture, Lake Shore Gold has elected to satisfy its obligation to repay the principal amount of the Debentures by issuing Tahoe Shares to the holders of the Debentures. The number of Tahoe Shares to be issued will be determined by dividing the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures which are to be redeemed by 95% of the volume weighted average trading price of Tahoe Shares for the 20 trading days ending on and including May 9, 2016. The accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures will be paid in cash.
Debentureholders maintain the right to convert the Debentures at any time prior to 5:00 pm (Toronto time) on May 13, 2016 at a conversion price of $9.5433 per Tahoe Share, being a conversion rate of 104.7856 Tahoe Shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Debentures. If all of the outstanding Debentures are converted by debentureholders at this conversion price, a total of approximately 10,811,895 Tahoe Shares will be issued on conversion. 
For additional details on the terms and conditions of the Change of Control Offer and the redemption of the Debentures, debentureholders should refer to the notice of change of control and redemption being mailed to them, a copy of which is available under Lake Shore Gold's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.

Better Buy: Coeur Mining Inc. vs. Tahoe Resources Inc.
With both silver stocks tumbling by double digits in recent months, which one should you buy?











                Neha Chamaria
            

                (Nehams)



            
            Mar 21, 2017 at 9:14AM
            
            





If you're a precious-metals investor, you've no doubt heard of silver-mining stocks Coeur Mining Inc. (NYSE:CDE) and Tahoe Resources Inc. (NYSE:TAHO) right now. Both stocks look delectably attractive, with Coeur shedding almost 36% and Tahoe nearly 45% in the past six months, as of this writing.
Both Coeur and Tahoe have kicked off their 2017 financial year on a strong note in terms of operational performances and are aggressively expanding their businesses. I'd consider now a great entry point; and if I were to choose one of the stocks, I'd go with Coeur despite Tahoe's solid numbers and dividends. Here's why.

Image source: Getty Images

Coeur Mining: stupendous turnaround in 2016
President and CEO Mitchell J. Krebs perfectly summed up 2016 for Coeur Mining during the company's last earnings call when he said that "2016 marked a key inflection point for Coeur." Coeur has, indeed, stepped into 2017 on solid footing, having achieved record silver equivalent production of 36.3 million ounces in 2016. Not one to rest on its laurels, Coeur aims to take its production to yet another level next year as it ramps up its primary mine at Palmarejo, Mexico. Coeur is also guarding its position as the largest primary silver producer in the United States.

Image source: Coeur's presentation at 2017 Annual ROTH Conference, March 2017

Palmarejo's expansion is perfectly timed -- and it isn't just about silver. Just last year, Coeur struck a new agreement with precious-metals streaming and royalty company Franco Nevada Corp. (NYSE:FNV), wherein Franco-Nevada will buy 50% of the gold produced at Palmarejo at a cash price of $800 an ounce, almost twice what it paid Coeur under the old agreement. So Palmarejo should boost Coeur's cash flows substantially going forward.
Meanwhile, Coeur cut its cost of sales by almost 15% last year despite higher revenue. More importantly, a focus on higher-grade metal in recent years has helped Coeur bring down its all-in-sustaining cost substantially: Its AISC came in at only about $16.08 per silver equivalent ounce in 2016, compared with $19.93 per ounce in 2013. Thanks to rising production and lower costs, Coeur ended 2016 with adjusted net profits (excluding impairment charges) of $47.8 million, versus an adjusted net loss of $103.6 million in 2015.
That's not all. Coeur also cut down its total debt by more than half in 2016, using proceeds from non-core asset sales and stock issue, even encouraging Moody's to upgrade the miner's debt ratings last September. Granted, a stock issue dilutes shareholders' capital, but it isn't uncommon for precious-metals miners to tap capital markets for funds.
Can a company do any better to attract investors' attention? Maybe not, but there's one important area where Coeur disappoints: dividends. Unlike Tahoe, which pays a monthly dividend and boasts a current yield of 3.3%, Coeur doesn't pay a dividend at all. And that isn't the only impressive thing about Tahoe.
Tahoe Resources: a young, growing miner
While Coeur's history dates to 1928, Tahoe was incorporated in 2009. In fact, Tahoe's primary mine Escobal in Guatemala -- also the world's third largest silver mine -- commenced production only about three years ago. Does that make you wary about investing in Tahoe? Well, it might be a young company, but Tahoe has a solid team backing it up.
Here's an interesting tidbit: Tahoe was founded by former Goldcorp Inc. (NYSE:GG) CEO Kevin McArthur, and several members on Tahoe's current board of directors and management teams were with Goldcorp at some point. In fact, Goldcorp even owned a substantial stake in Tahoe until about 2015, and it was from Goldcorp that Tahoe bought the Escobal silver deposit. Tahoe CEO Ron Clayton also brings with him several years of mining experience with companies such as Hecla Mining and Stillwater Mining.
You wouldn't expect such a competent management to disappoint. Thankfully, it doesn't. In 2016, Tahoe made huge strides as it started operations at the Shahuindo gold mine in Peru and acquired Lake Shore Gold in Ontario, taking its number of mines in operation to five. 2016 was, in fact, a significant year for Tahoe for several reasons, including: 

Record silver and gold production.
An all-time-low AISC of $8.06 per ounce of silver on a by-product basis. AISC for gold came in at $943 per ounce.
Record operating cash flow and positive free cash flow.

Tahoe's prospects look even brighter as it aims to increase its gold production by nearly 36% at the midpoint from 2016 levels by 2019. 

Image source: Tahoe's presentation at the BMO Capital Markets Global Metals & Mining Conference.

With capital expenditures also expected to taper by then, Tahoe should be able to generate strong cash flows in coming years to support, and even raise, its dividends. Tahoe has been paying a consistent monthly dividend of $0.02 per share since December 2014.





Foolish bottom line: Tahoe is great, but...
Tahoe Resources looks promising, but it faces big risks at its key place of operation: Guatemala. Put simply, the country has a history of political and social unrest. While things have been quiet lately, Tahoe may face hurdles obtaining or retaining licenses and raising funds later. That's a huge threat, as Tahoe is a relatively young company with a lot at stake in Escobal. Coeur, on the other hand, operates in relatively safer zones. And that, combined with the potential that Palmarejo holds, makes Coeur a better bet for now.
