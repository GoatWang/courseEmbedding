NOT YOUR FATHER’S SINGLE MALT
Not even close. But please don’t think we have something against Dad’s scotch—we’re known to take a sip every now and then. But our vision for single malt whiskey is what we call a contemporary classic. A complex spirit that is delicious neat or with a cube—that also brings new life to your favorite cocktail. Some call it a better-than-Scotch alternative; we call it Old Line American Whiskey.









SOME STORIES ARE BETTER OVER WHISKEY
A great whiskey drinks best in the company of friends and like a good story, is timeless. And while it enjoys revisiting the past, is also full of optimism for the future. Our single malt whiskeys make the story better, the room warmer, and the bonds of fellowship stronger. We’d like to invite you and your friends to make Old Line part of your story.









WELCOME TO OUR READY ROOM
This is the meeting place on an aircraft carrier for the aviators—where missions are planned and stories of adventure and misadventure are told and retold. Your Ready Room can be a campfire, a dining room table, or the corner of your favorite bar—a place to enjoy friends and family, to laugh about the day’s successes and missteps, and to plan for future journeys.

Gold medal-winning whiskey finds a new generation of distillers

Mark McLaughlin and Arch Watkins, former Naval Flight Officers with a lifelong love of whiskey met Bob Stilnovich, a founder of Golden Distillery while on a trip to Seattle. Bob, a fellow veteran, was ready to retire, so a deal was struck to pass on his recipes—and more importantly, his extensive whiskey-making knowledge.
Mark and Arch set off for Washington State, where they mastered the art of distilling under Bob’s guidance. With their apprenticeship complete, they acquired Golden, and with his blessing, moved the distillery to their hometown of Baltimore.
“We’re proud to be making great whiskey here with the same commitment to quality instilled by our mentor. When you have a chance, come by to a take a tour, learn the process, share some stories, and have a taste of some great whiskey.”
Cheers – Mark & Arch

Single Malt

Our flagship spirit embodies the best aspects of the new school of American whiskey—strong traditional roots infused with innovation. Made entirely of American barley that is grown and malted in the Pacific Northwest, this whiskey is distilled in copper and then aged in new, charred American White Oak casks that impart a complex nose of aromas that you might expect from bourbon. The initial taste is a nice balance of malt with maple, vanilla, and a hint of apple, culminating in a strong finish of toasted toffee and caramel. It’s great sipped neat, with a cube or two, or in your favorite cocktail.











Aged Caribbean Rum

We love rum- particularly aged rum from the Caribbean.  The warm, humid weather provides an ideal climate for the naturally sweet rum distillate to mature in used bourbon barrels- something hard to emulate in North America.  We worked for more than a year with master rum blenders to develop a ‘whiskey drinker’s rum’: slightly drier and less sweet than typical Caribbean rums, but nicely mellow after 7 years in the used bourbon cask.  It’s full, rich flavor has notes of vanilla and butterscotch which are wholly derived from the sugarcane and barrel.  Easy to drink neat or on ice, it works perfectly in your favorite rum or whiskey cocktail!











Navy Strength Aged Caribbean Rum

Our Navy Strength Aged Caribbean Rum is made from the same rum used in our standard Aged Caribbean Rum, but being a couple of former Navy guys, we wanted something with a little more horsepower.  At traditional ‘navy strength’ (114 proof), this rum has strong natural notes of vanilla and butterscotch with a much warmer finish.  It’s perfect over a large ice cube or in a cocktail.  Enjoy!

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

                About Old Line Spirits
              

Mark McLaughlin and Arch Watkins, who were Naval Flight Officers, decided to change their career paths: due to their love of whiskey, they became distillery owners. This was possible thanks to their mentor, who taught them everything there is to know about the art of distilling and from whom they inherited the distillery. Their flagship spirit is an award-winning single-malt whiskey, made entirely of American barley, that balances maple, vanilla, and apple flavors with toffee and caramel finish.
