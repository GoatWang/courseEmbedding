Corporate Governance

As Trustee of the Common Retirement Fund, Comptroller DiNapoli has the responsibility to protect the interests
			of the Fund and voice concerns and propose changes that are in the best interest of the companies in which
			the Fund invests.
The Fund reviews corporate governance practices including how a company is directed, administered and operated, recognizing that firms that adopt good governance practices have greater potential for corporate success and sustainable econonic growth.
With an emphasis on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, DiNapoli and the Fund help shape corporate policies and practices in ways that safeguard the Fund’s investments and promote
			corporate responsibility.
		
The Fund engages portfolio companies in one or more of the following ways:

Opening a dialogue with the company to seek greater transparency or to improve
                corporate policies and practices; 
Proposing shareholder resolutions seeking information or a change in company policy that are
                subject to a vote by fellow shareholders; 
Voting on shareholder resolutions; and
Voting for or against board director nominees.

Our more recent engagements have concentrated on the following issues:



Climate Change
A company should evaluate and adapt its business strategy to meet the
				impacts of climate change, whether they be environmental
				(loss of infrastructure and resources) or regulatory (new restrictions
				on carbon emissions).								
                Learn more




Political Spending
A company should fully disclose its corporate spending for political
                purposes so its shareholders can determine whether
                such spending furthers the company’s long-term financial goals.
            	Learn more




Diversity and Non-Discrimination
A company should strive for diversity within its leadership and workforce
                and prevent discrimination based on non-job related criteria. Diversity
                enables the company to draw on a broad pool of talent and
                a wide range of viewpoints, backgrounds, skills and experience, all of
                which can strengthen a company’s competitive position. 
                Learn more




2016 Portfolio Engagements
Our efforts in the past year have resulted in a number of key
				improvements in corporate behavior, including voluntary disclosure on
				political spending, commitments to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and inclusion of racial and gender diversity to corporate leadership.
View 2016 Portfolio Engagements


We also engaged companies  by voting for or against shareholder resolutions, 
               board nominees and other motions. In all, we cast a vote in over 2,000 shareholder 
               meetings from October 2015 to September 2016.

U.S. Attorney’s Office
Southern District of New York



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 
Former Portfolio Manager At The New York State Common Retirement Fund Charged In “Pay-For-Play” Bribery Scheme 
Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and William F. Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), announced today the unsealing of an Indictment charging NAVNOOR KANG, the former Director of Fixed Income and Head of Portfolio Strategy at the New York State Common Retirement Fund (“NYSCRF”), and DEBORAH KELLEY, a managing director of institutional fixed income sales at a New York-based broker-dealer (“Broker-Dealer-1”), with participating in a “pay-for-play” bribery scheme involving the NYSCRF.  KANG was arrested today in Portland, Oregon, and will be presented later today before a U.S. Magistrate Judge in Portland.  KELLEY is expected to surrender today to authorities in San Francisco, California.  The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken. 
Mr. Bharara also announced today the unsealing of charges against GREGG SCHONHORN, a vice president of fixed income sales at a New York-based broker-dealer (“Broker-Dealer-2”), who pled guilty and admitted to his participation in the scheme. 
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said:  “Today, we allege a classic, quid-pro-quo bribery scheme at the New York State Common Retirement Fund, the third largest pension fund in the country.  Navnoor Kang, a former portfolio manager at the fund, allegedly steered billions of dollars of business to broker-dealers who bribed him with luxury vacations, high-priced watches, drugs, cash, and more. The hard-earned pension savings of New Yorkers should never serve as a vehicle for corrupt, personal enrichment. The intersection of public corruption and securities fraud appears to be a busy one, but it's one that we are committed to policing.”
FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. said:  “Instead of upholding his fiduciary duty, Kang was allegedly paid in bribes for diverting business to two separate brokerage firms.  When it comes to retirement funds, fixed-income investments are often thought of as a reliable choice.  Members of the New York State Common Retirement Fund likely also relied on the belief that the man directing their investments was an honest public servant. Unfortunately, as alleged, that is not the case here today.”
According to the allegations in the Indictment[1] and Information, which were unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:
The NYSCRF
The NYSCRF was a pension fund administered for the benefit of public employees of the State of New York.  The third largest pension fund in the United States, the NYSCRF held approximately $184 billion in assets in trust for a total of more than one million retirees and other beneficiaries.
From January 2014 through February 2016, KANG served as Director of Fixed Income and Head of Portfolio Strategy for the NYSCRF.  In that capacity, KANG was responsible for investing more than $53 billion in fixed-income securities and was entrusted with discretion to manage those investments on behalf of the NYSCRF.  KANG owed a fiduciary duty to the NYSCRF and its members and beneficiaries, and was required to make investment decisions in their best interests and free of any conflict of interest.  New York State law and NYSCRF policies prohibited KANG and other NYSCRF employees from receiving any bribes, gifts, benefits, or consideration of any kind.
The Scheme to Steer NYSCRF Fixed-Income Business in Exchange for Secret Bribes
From 2014 through 2016, KANG, KELLEY, and SCHONHORN participated in a scheme to defraud the NYSCRF and its members and beneficiaries, and to deprive the NYSCRF of its intangible right to KANG’s honest services.  The scheme involved, among other things, an agreement among KANG, KELLEY, SCHONHORN, and others to pay KANG bribes – in the form of entertainment, travel, lavish meals, prostitutes, nightclub bottle service, narcotics, tickets to sports games and other events, luxury gifts, and cash payments for strippers and KANG’s personal expenses – in exchange for fixed-income business from the NYSCRF.  Such bribes – which totaled more than $100,000 – were strictly forbidden by the NYSCRF, and were paid secretly and without any disclosure to the NYSCRF and its members and beneficiaries concerning the conflicts of interests inherent therein. 
In exchange for the bribes paid by KELLEY, SCHONHORN, and others, KANG used his position as Director of Fixed Income and Head of Portfolio Strategy at the NYSCRF to promote the interests of KELLEY, SCHONHORN, and their respective brokerage firms.  KANG, in exchange for the bribes he received, agreed to steer fixed-income business to Broker-Dealer-1 and Broker-Dealer-2.  In fact, KANG steered more than $2 billion in fixed-income business to Broker-Dealer-1 and Broker-Dealer-2, from which KELLEY, SCHONHORN, and their respective employers earned millions of dollars in commissions from the NYSCRF.  In so doing, KANG, with the knowledge and approval of KELLEY and SCHONHORN, breached his fiduciary duty to make investment decisions in the best interest of the NYSCRF and its members and beneficiaries, and free of conflict, and deprived the NYSCRF of its intangible right to KANG’s honest services.
As the bribes paid by SCHONHORN to KANG increased, so too did Broker-Dealer-2’s fixed-income business with the NYSCRF.  The value of the NYSCRF’s domestic bond transactions with Broker-Dealer-2 skyrocketed from zero in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, to approximately $1.5 million in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014, to approximately $858 million in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015, and to approximately $2.378 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016.  Broker-Dealer-2 became the third largest broker-dealer with which the NYSRCF executed domestic bonds transactions for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, having not even been on the approved list in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013.  As the NYSCRF’s third largest broker-dealer in this asset class, Broker-Dealer-2 brokered approximately eight percent of the total value of the NYSCRF’s domestic bond transactions – a figure greater than that of all but two of the major international banks and brokerage houses on the list.  Similarly, the value of NYSCRF’s domestic bond transactions with Broker-Dealer-1 increased from zero in the fiscal year ending March 1, 2014 to approximately $156 million in the fiscal year ending March 1, 2015, and to approximately $179 million in the fiscal year ending March 1, 2016. 
KANG’s trades resulted in the payment of millions of dollars in commissions to Broker-Dealer-1 and Broker-Dealer-2, of which KELLEY and SCHONHORN personally earned approximately 35 to 40 percent.
The Obstruction of Justice
In late 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) opened an investigation into the entertainment and benefits that KELLEY had provided KANG, and the SEC subpoenaed both KANG and KELLEY for their testimony.  In advance of their testimony, KANG and KELLEY agreed to align their stories and testify falsely before the SEC in order to conceal their scheme.  In late 2015 and early 2016, KANG and KELLEY each falsely testified under oath before the SEC about expenses KELLEY had paid for KANG.  Moreover, after a federal grand jury investigation was opened, KANG instructed SCHONHORN to testify falsely before the grand jury, and KANG admitted that he had hidden relevant evidence. 
*                      *                      *
KANG, 38, of Portland, Oregon, and KELLEY, 58, of Piedmont, California, are charged with the offenses set forth in the chart attached to this release.  
On December 15, 2016, SCHONHORN, 45, of Short Hills, New Jersey, pled guilty in Manhattan federal court before Judge Paul G. Gardephe to six counts: conspiracy to commit securities fraud; securities fraud; conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud; honest services wire fraud; bank fraud; and conspiracy to obstruct justice in the SEC investigation.  Count One carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.  Counts Two, Three, Four, and Six each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  Count Five carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.  The charges also carry a maximum fine of $5 million, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. 
The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the judge.
Mr. Bharara praised the investigative work of the FBI and noted that the investigation is continuing.   He also thanked the SEC, which filed civil charges against KANG, KELLEY, and SCHONHORN in a separate civil action today, and the Office of Inspector General for the Office of the New York State Comptroller.
The charges were brought in connection with the President’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force.  The task force was established to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes.  With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. attorneys’ offices, and state and local partners, it is the broadest coalition of law enforcement, investigatory and regulatory agencies ever assembled to combat fraud.  Since its formation, the task force has made great strides in facilitating increased investigation and prosecution of financial crimes; enhancing coordination and cooperation among federal, state and local authorities; addressing discrimination in the lending and financial markets; and conducting outreach to the public, victims, financial institutions and other organizations.  Since fiscal year 2009, the Justice Department has filed over 18,000 financial fraud cases against more than 25,000 defendants.  For more information on the task force, please visit www.StopFraud.gov.       
This case is being handled by the Office’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Edward A. Imperatore and Joshua A. Naftalis are in charge of the prosecution.   
The allegations contained in the Indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

         America's 6 biggest public pensions Forget the rich.

But that's not to say he doesn't pull his weight.  Earlier this month, he delved into a standoff between LG Electronics and residents of Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, over the South Korean company's planned North American headquarters that will include a 143-foot office tower that critics say will obstruct views in the area. With his pension fund owning over $10 million of LG stock, DiNapoli asked LG's management to consider a redesign of the building, arguing that the "potential for reputational harm and protracted legal expenses" for LG could hurt his fund's investment.

This article is about the government of the state of New York. For the government of the city of New York, see Government of New York City.
The Government of the State of New York, headquartered at the New York State Capitol in Albany, encompasses the administrative structure of the U.S. state of New York, as established by the New York State Constitution. Analogously to the United States federal government, it is composed of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The head of the executive is the Governor, the Legislature consists of the Senate and the Assembly, and the Unified Court System consists of the Court of Appeals and lower courts. The state is also divided into counties, cities, towns, and villages, which are all municipal corporations with their own government.

Executive[edit]
The elected executive officers are:













Andrew Cuomo (D)
Governor 













Kathy Hochul (D)
Lieutenant Governor 













Eric Schneiderman (D)
Attorney General 













Thomas DiNapoli (D)
Comptroller 






There are several (limited to twenty[1]) state government departments:

Department of Agriculture and Markets
Department of Audit and Control
Department of Civil Service
Department of Corrections and Community Supervision




The State Education Building in Albany



Department of Economic Development
Education Department
Department of Environmental Conservation
Executive Department
Department of Family Assistance
Department of Financial Services
Department of Health
Department of Labor
Department of Law
Department of Mental Hygiene
Department of Motor Vehicles
Department of Public Service
Department of State
Department of Taxation and Finance
Department of Transportation

Regulations are promulgated and published in the New York State Register and compiled in the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR).[2] There are also numerous decisions, opinions, and rulings of state agencies.[3]
Legislature[edit]




The New York State Assembly Chamber of the New York State Capitol in Albany


The New York State Legislature is bicameral and consists of the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly. The Assembly consists of 150 members; the Senate varies in its number of members, but currently has 63.[4] The Assembly is headed by the Speaker; the Senate is headed by the President, a post held ex officio by the Lieutenant Governor, who only has a tie-breaking "casting vote", but more often it is presided over by the Temporary President or by a senator of the Majority Leader's choosing.
The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the Governor's power to veto a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a two-thirds majority in favor of overriding in each House. Furthermore, it has the power to propose amendments to the New York Constitution by a majority vote and then another majority vote following an election. If so proposed, the amendment becomes valid if agreed to by the voters at a referendum. The session laws are published in the official Laws of New York.[5][6] The permanent laws of a general nature are codified in the Consolidated Laws of New York.[5][7]
Judiciary[edit]
Further information: Judiciary of New York
The New York State Unified Court System interprets and applies the law of New York, ensures equal justice under law, and provides a mechanism for dispute resolution. The court system in New York tends to produce mild confusion for outsiders.[8][9] In general, the judicial system is composed of the trial courts, consisting of the superior courts and the local courts, and the appellate courts.[10]
The appellate courts are the:[10]

Court of Appeals
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court




The New York County Courthouse in Manhattan



appellate terms of the Supreme Court
appellate sessions of the County Court

The superior courts are the:[10]

Supreme Court
County Court
specialized courts (Family Court, Surrogate's Court, Court of Claims)

And the inferior courts are the local courts:[10]

District Court
New York City courts (NYC Criminal Court, NYC Civil Court)
city courts
justice courts (town and village courts)

The highest court of appeal is the Court of Appeals (instead of the "Supreme Court") whereas the primary felony trial court is the County Court (or the Supreme Court in New York City). The Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters and are the starting point for all criminal cases. The New York City courts make up the largest local court system. The system is administered by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, also known as the Chief Judge of New York, the Chief Administrative Judge, the Office of Court Administration and other agencies.
Local government[edit]




New York City Hall in Manhattan


Further information: Administrative divisions of New York
See also: Government of New York City
The state is divided into counties, cities, towns, and villages, which are all municipal corporations with their own government that provide most local government services.[11] Whether a municipality is defined as a city, town, or village is not dependent on population or land area, but rather by the form of government selected by the residents and approved by the New York State Legislature.[12][13][14] Each such government is granted varying home rule powers as provided by the New York Constitution,[15] and a local law has a status equivalent with a law enacted by the Legislature (subject to certain exceptions and restrictions).[16] New York also has various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school and fire districts as well as New York state public-benefit corporations, frequently known as authorities or development corporations.[15] New York has 62 counties,[17][18] which are subdivided into 932 towns[14] and 62 cities;[13] it also has 10 Indian reservations.[19] In total, the state has over 3400 active local governments and over 4200 taxing jurisdictions.[20][21]
In 1898, when New York City was consolidated into its present form, all previous town and county governments within it were abolished in favor of the present five boroughs and unified, centralized city government (the New York City government).[22]
Other governments[edit]
Tribal government[edit]
Further information: List of American Indian Reservations in New York
Native Americans' governments are significantly independent of the state and its local governments. New York cannot interfere with tribal self-government, but may regulate conduct on tribal territory concerning non-Native Americans.[23] For example, federal law forbids states and local authorities to tax Indian lands; however, the state can and does tax sales on tribal territory of cigarettes to non-tribe members.[23][24]

Government of New York

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from New York State Common Retirement Fund)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about the government of the state of New York. For the government of the city of New York, see Government of New York City.
The Government of the State of New York, headquartered at the New York State Capitol in Albany, encompasses the administrative structure of the U.S. state of New York, as established by the New York State Constitution. Analogously to the United States federal government, it is composed of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The head of the executive is the Governor, the Legislature consists of the Senate and the Assembly, and the Unified Court System consists of the Court of Appeals and lower courts. The state is also divided into counties, cities, towns, and villages, which are all municipal corporations with their own government.

Executive[edit]
The elected executive officers are:













Andrew Cuomo (D)
Governor 













Kathy Hochul (D)
Lieutenant Governor 













Eric Schneiderman (D)
Attorney General 













Thomas DiNapoli (D)
Comptroller 






There are several (limited to twenty[1]) state government departments:

Department of Agriculture and Markets
Department of Audit and Control
Department of Civil Service
Department of Corrections and Community Supervision




The State Education Building in Albany



Department of Economic Development
Education Department
Department of Environmental Conservation
Executive Department
Department of Family Assistance
Department of Financial Services
Department of Health
Department of Labor
Department of Law
Department of Mental Hygiene
Department of Motor Vehicles
Department of Public Service
Department of State
Department of Taxation and Finance
Department of Transportation

Regulations are promulgated and published in the New York State Register and compiled in the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR).[2] There are also numerous decisions, opinions, and rulings of state agencies.[3]
Legislature[edit]




The New York State Assembly Chamber of the New York State Capitol in Albany


The New York State Legislature is bicameral and consists of the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly. The Assembly consists of 150 members; the Senate varies in its number of members, but currently has 63.[4] The Assembly is headed by the Speaker; the Senate is headed by the President, a post held ex officio by the Lieutenant Governor, who only has a tie-breaking "casting vote", but more often it is presided over by the Temporary President or by a senator of the Majority Leader's choosing.
The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the Governor's power to veto a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a two-thirds majority in favor of overriding in each House. Furthermore, it has the power to propose amendments to the New York Constitution by a majority vote and then another majority vote following an election. If so proposed, the amendment becomes valid if agreed to by the voters at a referendum. The session laws are published in the official Laws of New York.[5][6] The permanent laws of a general nature are codified in the Consolidated Laws of New York.[5][7]
Judiciary[edit]
Further information: Judiciary of New York
The New York State Unified Court System interprets and applies the law of New York, ensures equal justice under law, and provides a mechanism for dispute resolution. The court system in New York tends to produce mild confusion for outsiders.[8][9] In general, the judicial system is composed of the trial courts, consisting of the superior courts and the local courts, and the appellate courts.[10]
The appellate courts are the:[10]

Court of Appeals
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court




The New York County Courthouse in Manhattan



appellate terms of the Supreme Court
appellate sessions of the County Court

The superior courts are the:[10]

Supreme Court
County Court
specialized courts (Family Court, Surrogate's Court, Court of Claims)

And the inferior courts are the local courts:[10]

District Court
New York City courts (NYC Criminal Court, NYC Civil Court)
city courts
justice courts (town and village courts)

The highest court of appeal is the Court of Appeals (instead of the "Supreme Court") whereas the primary felony trial court is the County Court (or the Supreme Court in New York City). The Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters and are the starting point for all criminal cases. The New York City courts make up the largest local court system. The system is administered by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, also known as the Chief Judge of New York, the Chief Administrative Judge, the Office of Court Administration and other agencies.
Local government[edit]




New York City Hall in Manhattan


Further information: Administrative divisions of New York
See also: Government of New York City
The state is divided into counties, cities, towns, and villages, which are all municipal corporations with their own government that provide most local government services.[11] Whether a municipality is defined as a city, town, or village is not dependent on population or land area, but rather by the form of government selected by the residents and approved by the New York State Legislature.[12][13][14] Each such government is granted varying home rule powers as provided by the New York Constitution,[15] and a local law has a status equivalent with a law enacted by the Legislature (subject to certain exceptions and restrictions).[16] New York also has various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school and fire districts as well as New York state public-benefit corporations, frequently known as authorities or development corporations.[15] New York has 62 counties,[17][18] which are subdivided into 932 towns[14] and 62 cities;[13] it also has 10 Indian reservations.[19] In total, the state has over 3400 active local governments and over 4200 taxing jurisdictions.[20][21]
In 1898, when New York City was consolidated into its present form, all previous town and county governments within it were abolished in favor of the present five boroughs and unified, centralized city government (the New York City government).[22]
Other governments[edit]
Tribal government[edit]
Further information: List of American Indian Reservations in New York
Native Americans' governments are significantly independent of the state and its local governments. New York cannot interfere with tribal self-government, but may regulate conduct on tribal territory concerning non-Native Americans.[23] For example, federal law forbids states and local authorities to tax Indian lands; however, the state can and does tax sales on tribal territory of cigarettes to non-tribe members.[23][24]

Government of New York

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from New York State Common Retirement Fund)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about the government of the state of New York. For the government of the city of New York, see Government of New York City.
The Government of the State of New York, headquartered at the New York State Capitol in Albany, encompasses the administrative structure of the U.S. state of New York, as established by the New York State Constitution. Analogously to the United States federal government, it is composed of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The head of the executive is the Governor, the Legislature consists of the Senate and the Assembly, and the Unified Court System consists of the Court of Appeals and lower courts. The state is also divided into counties, cities, towns, and villages, which are all municipal corporations with their own government.

Executive[edit]
The elected executive officers are:













Andrew Cuomo (D)
Governor 













Kathy Hochul (D)
Lieutenant Governor 













Eric Schneiderman (D)
Attorney General 













Thomas DiNapoli (D)
Comptroller 






There are several (limited to twenty[1]) state government departments:

Department of Agriculture and Markets
Department of Audit and Control
Department of Civil Service
Department of Corrections and Community Supervision




The State Education Building in Albany



Department of Economic Development
Education Department
Department of Environmental Conservation
Executive Department
Department of Family Assistance
Department of Financial Services
Department of Health
Department of Labor
Department of Law
Department of Mental Hygiene
Department of Motor Vehicles
Department of Public Service
Department of State
Department of Taxation and Finance
Department of Transportation

Regulations are promulgated and published in the New York State Register and compiled in the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR).[2] There are also numerous decisions, opinions, and rulings of state agencies.[3]
Legislature[edit]




The New York State Assembly Chamber of the New York State Capitol in Albany


The New York State Legislature is bicameral and consists of the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly. The Assembly consists of 150 members; the Senate varies in its number of members, but currently has 63.[4] The Assembly is headed by the Speaker; the Senate is headed by the President, a post held ex officio by the Lieutenant Governor, who only has a tie-breaking "casting vote", but more often it is presided over by the Temporary President or by a senator of the Majority Leader's choosing.
The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the Governor's power to veto a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a two-thirds majority in favor of overriding in each House. Furthermore, it has the power to propose amendments to the New York Constitution by a majority vote and then another majority vote following an election. If so proposed, the amendment becomes valid if agreed to by the voters at a referendum. The session laws are published in the official Laws of New York.[5][6] The permanent laws of a general nature are codified in the Consolidated Laws of New York.[5][7]
Judiciary[edit]
Further information: Judiciary of New York
The New York State Unified Court System interprets and applies the law of New York, ensures equal justice under law, and provides a mechanism for dispute resolution. The court system in New York tends to produce mild confusion for outsiders.[8][9] In general, the judicial system is composed of the trial courts, consisting of the superior courts and the local courts, and the appellate courts.[10]
The appellate courts are the:[10]

Court of Appeals
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court




The New York County Courthouse in Manhattan



appellate terms of the Supreme Court
appellate sessions of the County Court

The superior courts are the:[10]

Supreme Court
County Court
specialized courts (Family Court, Surrogate's Court, Court of Claims)

And the inferior courts are the local courts:[10]

District Court
New York City courts (NYC Criminal Court, NYC Civil Court)
city courts
justice courts (town and village courts)

The highest court of appeal is the Court of Appeals (instead of the "Supreme Court") whereas the primary felony trial court is the County Court (or the Supreme Court in New York City). The Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters and are the starting point for all criminal cases. The New York City courts make up the largest local court system. The system is administered by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, also known as the Chief Judge of New York, the Chief Administrative Judge, the Office of Court Administration and other agencies.
Local government[edit]




New York City Hall in Manhattan


Further information: Administrative divisions of New York
See also: Government of New York City
The state is divided into counties, cities, towns, and villages, which are all municipal corporations with their own government that provide most local government services.[11] Whether a municipality is defined as a city, town, or village is not dependent on population or land area, but rather by the form of government selected by the residents and approved by the New York State Legislature.[12][13][14] Each such government is granted varying home rule powers as provided by the New York Constitution,[15] and a local law has a status equivalent with a law enacted by the Legislature (subject to certain exceptions and restrictions).[16] New York also has various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school and fire districts as well as New York state public-benefit corporations, frequently known as authorities or development corporations.[15] New York has 62 counties,[17][18] which are subdivided into 932 towns[14] and 62 cities;[13] it also has 10 Indian reservations.[19] In total, the state has over 3400 active local governments and over 4200 taxing jurisdictions.[20][21]
In 1898, when New York City was consolidated into its present form, all previous town and county governments within it were abolished in favor of the present five boroughs and unified, centralized city government (the New York City government).[22]
Other governments[edit]
Tribal government[edit]
Further information: List of American Indian Reservations in New York
Native Americans' governments are significantly independent of the state and its local governments. New York cannot interfere with tribal self-government, but may regulate conduct on tribal territory concerning non-Native Americans.[23] For example, federal law forbids states and local authorities to tax Indian lands; however, the state can and does tax sales on tribal territory of cigarettes to non-tribe members.[23][24]
