The final round of a golf tournament is often described as a putting contest.



 


There’s a way to avoid that, though: Hit it close enough to take putting out of the equation — the way J.D. Dickerson and Michael Pruitt did Sunday at LakeRidge Country Club.
In the last seven holes, Pruitt and Dickerson hit three sparkling approach shots, not to mention a chip-in, to wrap up a four-shot victory in the Stampede partnership.
“It was 100 percent stress-free golf,” Dickerson said.
They sure made it look that way, and on the second nine on Sunday, no less, when the nerves are supposed to tighten up.
Dickerson holed a chip at No. 3 and stuck a wedge pin high for birdie on No. 5. Then Pruitt plopped a soft wedge 2 feet from the hole on No. 8 and Dickerson pitched to about the same distance on No. 9 to close out an 8-under 64.
“Mine was 2 feet (on No. 8). His was, uh … 23 inches,” Pruitt said jokingly.
Pruitt and Dickerson finished 54 holes at 19-under, using the sizzling finish to pull away from Ben Greene and Beau Burgess, who shot 67 and came in second.
“We played solid,” Burgess said. “There’s just nothing we can do. They played better.”
On second thought, Burgess and Greene noted, there was something they could have done.
“We played the par-5s terrible all weekend,” Burgess said. “More than anything, I was happy we had a bogey-free weekend. We didn’t have any bogeys. We just didn’t make enough birdies.”
The margin was two strokes after the leaders played holes 10 through 18. Burgess birdied No. 1 to bring his team back within one, and the turning point came right after. Pruitt two-putted the par-5 No. 2 for birdie while their nearest pursuers, playing in the same group, couldn’t convert birdie putts.
At No. 3, Dickerson’s approach came up short of the green in the rough — nowhere near his ideal spot behind the hole. But his chip hit the flagstick and dropped in. That made the lead three and they had more shots in the bag.
Burgess made an 18-footer at the par-4 No. 5, but Dickerson countered with an excellent wedge shot, a dart to 10 feet right of the flag and rolled it in. 
“We both played solid,” Pruitt said. “Individual round, we both would have shot way under par, so it was an easy, good ride. It’s always easy with J.D.”
The victory was Dickerson’s fifth Stampede title, the other four all coming in a five-year period from 2003-07 with Junior Ashmore as a partner.
Asked if he played the last three days like the old J.D., he said, “It was pretty good for me. I’m happy with it.”
Burgess hit it to 8 inches on the last hole for birdie, but he and his partner agreed the tournament got away from them when they gave up two strokes on holes 2 and 3. Not making birdie on the par-5 2nd was especially galling.
“We did that three or four times this weekend,” Greene said. “We’re right there to make birdie on a par-5. We didn’t do it. And we lose by four shots.”
