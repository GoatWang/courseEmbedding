Restaurant Brands International is a Canadian multinational fast food company. Formed in 2014 by the $12.5 billion merger between American fast food restaurant chain Burger King and the Canadian coffee shop and restaurant chain Tim Hortons, and expanded by the 2017 purchase of Louisiana based and themed Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, the company is the third-largest operator of fast food restaurants in the world. The company is based alongside Tim Hortons in Oakville, Ontario, but both chains retain their existing operations and headquarters in Oakville and Miami respectively. The merger focused primarily on expanding the international reach of the Tim Hortons brand, and providing financial efficiencies for both companies.
The company is majority-owned by the Brazilian investment company 3G Capital—the previous majority owner of Burger King—holding a 51% stake. The remainder of the company is publicly traded on the New York and Toronto Stock Exchanges, and owned by the prior shareholders of Burger King and Tim Hortons. The deal was approved by Tim Hortons' shareholders on December 9, 2014, and the company began trading on December 15, 2014.

History[edit]
On August 24, 2014, U.S. fast food chain Burger King announced that it was in negotiations to merge with the Canadian coffee shop and restaurant chain Tim Hortons;[3] the proposed merger would involve a tax inversion into Canada, with a new holding company majority-owned by Burger King's current majority-owner 3G Capital, and the remaining shares in the company held by current Burger King and Tim Hortons shareholders. A Tim Hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow Tim Hortons to leverage Burger King's resources for international growth; the two chains would retain separate operations post-merger.[4] News of the proposal caused Tim Hortons' shares to increase in value by 28 percent.[5]
On August 25, 2014, Burger King officially confirmed its intent to acquire Tim Hortons Inc. in a deal totaling CDN$12.5 billion (US$11.4 billion).[6] 3G Capital would purchase the company at $65.50 per-share, and existing shareholders would receive $65.50 in cash and 0.8025 shares in the new holding company: per-share—all-cash ($88.50) and all-shares (3.0879) options would also be available. Due to its iconic status in Canadian culture, CEO Marc Caira reassured the integrity of Tim Hortons following the purchase, stating that the acquisition would "enable us to move more quickly and efficiently to bring Tim Hortons' iconic Canadian brand to a new global customer base."[5][7]
Although tax inversions, a process in which a company decreases the amount of taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a country with lower rates, but maintains the majority of their operations in their previous location, have been a recent financial trend, it did not have as much of an impact on Burger King's reincorporation in Canada. The corporate tax rate in the United States is 39.1%, while Canada's corporate tax rate is only 26%: however, Burger King had already used various sheltering techniques to reduce its tax rate to 27.5%. As a high-profile instance of tax inversion, news of the merger was criticized by U.S. politicians, who felt that the move would result in a loss of tax revenue to foreign interests, and could result in further government pressure against inversions (which had, until the Burger King merger, been primarily invoked by pharmaceutical firms).[8][9][4][6] 3G Capital co-founder Alex Behring denied that the merger was tax-related, stating that it was "fundamentally about growth and creating value through accelerated expansion."[10]
The deal was approved by the Canadian Competition Bureau on October 28, 2014, ruling that the deal was "unlikely to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition."[11] The deal was approved by Minister of Industry James Moore on December 4, 2014: the two companies agreed to conditions, requiring that the Burger King and Tim Hortons chains retain separate operations, not combine locations in Canada and the United States, maintain "significant employment levels" at the Oakville headquarters, and ensure that Canadians make up at least 30% of Tim Hortons' board of directors.[12] Tim Hortons shareholders approved the merger on December 9, 2014: the same day, it was announced that the new holding company would be known as Restaurant Brands International, and trade under the ticker symbol QSR. Vice-chairman Marc Caira felt that the merger was the "next chapter" for Tim Hortons, envisioning a "bolder, more assertive, and dynamic Tim Hortons in the future" alongside its prospects for international expansion.[10][13]
Popeyes acquisition[edit]
On February 21, 2017, Restaurant Brands International announced its intent to acquire Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen for US$1.8 billion at US$79 per share.[14] On March 27, the deal closed with RBI purchasing Popeyes at $79 per share via Orange, Inc, an indirect subsidiary of RBI.[15]
Ownership and leadership[edit]
3G Capital (which held a 71% majority stake in Burger King) holds a 51% majority stake in Restaurant Brands International.[7] Berkshire Hathaway, who partially funded the merger, holds a 4.8% stake.[16] Burger King CEO Daniel Schwartz serves as CEO of the company, with previous Tim Hortons CEO Marc Caira being vice-chairman and director. Elías Díaz Sesé, formerly of Burger King's Asia-Pacific operations, was named the new president of Tim Hortons, while Jose Cil, formerly of Burger King's EMEA operations, was named the new president of Burger King.[17]

Restaurant Brands International is a Canadian multinational fast food company. Formed in 2014 by the $12.5 billion merger between American fast food restaurant chain Burger King and the Canadian coffee shop and restaurant chain Tim Hortons, and expanded by the 2017 purchase of Louisiana based and themed Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, the company is the third-largest operator of fast food restaurants in the world. The company is based alongside Tim Hortons in Oakville, Ontario, but both chains retain their existing operations and headquarters in Oakville and Miami respectively. The merger focused primarily on expanding the international reach of the Tim Hortons brand, and providing financial efficiencies for both companies.
The company is majority-owned by the Brazilian investment company 3G Capital—the previous majority owner of Burger King—holding a 51% stake. The remainder of the company is publicly traded on the New York and Toronto Stock Exchanges, and owned by the prior shareholders of Burger King and Tim Hortons. The deal was approved by Tim Hortons' shareholders on December 9, 2014, and the company began trading on December 15, 2014.

History[edit]
On August 24, 2014, U.S. fast food chain Burger King announced that it was in negotiations to merge with the Canadian coffee shop and restaurant chain Tim Hortons;[3] the proposed merger would involve a tax inversion into Canada, with a new holding company majority-owned by Burger King's current majority-owner 3G Capital, and the remaining shares in the company held by current Burger King and Tim Hortons shareholders. A Tim Hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow Tim Hortons to leverage Burger King's resources for international growth; the two chains would retain separate operations post-merger.[4] News of the proposal caused Tim Hortons' shares to increase in value by 28 percent.[5]
On August 25, 2014, Burger King officially confirmed its intent to acquire Tim Hortons Inc. in a deal totaling CDN$12.5 billion (US$11.4 billion).[6] 3G Capital would purchase the company at $65.50 per-share, and existing shareholders would receive $65.50 in cash and 0.8025 shares in the new holding company: per-share—all-cash ($88.50) and all-shares (3.0879) options would also be available. Due to its iconic status in Canadian culture, CEO Marc Caira reassured the integrity of Tim Hortons following the purchase, stating that the acquisition would "enable us to move more quickly and efficiently to bring Tim Hortons' iconic Canadian brand to a new global customer base."[5][7]
Although tax inversions, a process in which a company decreases the amount of taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a country with lower rates, but maintains the majority of their operations in their previous location, have been a recent financial trend, it did not have as much of an impact on Burger King's reincorporation in Canada. The corporate tax rate in the United States is 39.1%, while Canada's corporate tax rate is only 26%: however, Burger King had already used various sheltering techniques to reduce its tax rate to 27.5%. As a high-profile instance of tax inversion, news of the merger was criticized by U.S. politicians, who felt that the move would result in a loss of tax revenue to foreign interests, and could result in further government pressure against inversions (which had, until the Burger King merger, been primarily invoked by pharmaceutical firms).[8][9][4][6] 3G Capital co-founder Alex Behring denied that the merger was tax-related, stating that it was "fundamentally about growth and creating value through accelerated expansion."[10]
The deal was approved by the Canadian Competition Bureau on October 28, 2014, ruling that the deal was "unlikely to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition."[11] The deal was approved by Minister of Industry James Moore on December 4, 2014: the two companies agreed to conditions, requiring that the Burger King and Tim Hortons chains retain separate operations, not combine locations in Canada and the United States, maintain "significant employment levels" at the Oakville headquarters, and ensure that Canadians make up at least 30% of Tim Hortons' board of directors.[12] Tim Hortons shareholders approved the merger on December 9, 2014: the same day, it was announced that the new holding company would be known as Restaurant Brands International, and trade under the ticker symbol QSR. Vice-chairman Marc Caira felt that the merger was the "next chapter" for Tim Hortons, envisioning a "bolder, more assertive, and dynamic Tim Hortons in the future" alongside its prospects for international expansion.[10][13]
Popeyes acquisition[edit]
On February 21, 2017, Restaurant Brands International announced its intent to acquire Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen for US$1.8 billion at US$79 per share.[14] On March 27, the deal closed with RBI purchasing Popeyes at $79 per share via Orange, Inc, an indirect subsidiary of RBI.[15]
Ownership and leadership[edit]
3G Capital (which held a 71% majority stake in Burger King) holds a 51% majority stake in Restaurant Brands International.[7] Berkshire Hathaway, who partially funded the merger, holds a 4.8% stake.[16] Burger King CEO Daniel Schwartz serves as CEO of the company, with previous Tim Hortons CEO Marc Caira being vice-chairman and director. Elías Díaz Sesé, formerly of Burger King's Asia-Pacific operations, was named the new president of Tim Hortons, while Jose Cil, formerly of Burger King's EMEA operations, was named the new president of Burger King.[17]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

(2)   Restaurant count excludes 420 and 454 limited service kiosks as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. NRG excludes limited service kiosks for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015, we revised our presentation of restaurant counts to exclude limited service kiosks, with the revision applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented to provide period-to-period comparability.     (3)   System-wide sales are primarily driven by sales at franchise restaurants, as approximately 100% of current restaurants are franchised. We do not record franchise sales as revenue; however, our franchise revenues include royalties based on a percentage of franchise sales.   Consolidated Financial Highlights           Three Months Ended June 30,     (in US$ millions, except per share data)    2016    2015 (7)       (unaudited)            RBI Total Revenues    $   1,040.2    $   1,042.2     RBI Net Income Attributable to           Common Shareholders    $   90.9    $   11.0     RBI Dilutive Net Income Attributable to Common           Shareholders and Noncontrolling Interests (4)    $   179.2    $   25.3     RBI Diluted Earnings per Share    $   0.38    $   0.05            TH Adjusted EBITDA (5)    $   279.0    $   234.9     BK Adjusted EBITDA (5)    $   200.1    $   192.9     RBI Adjusted EBITDA (6)    $   479.1    $   427.8            RBI Adjusted Net Income (6)(8)    $   192.4    $   141.0     RBI Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share (6)(8)    $   0.41    $   0.30     (4)   Includes net income available to common shareholders and net income available to noncontrolling interests related to the Class B exchangeable limited partnership units of Restaurant Brands International Limited Partnership.     (5)   TH Adjusted EBITDA and BK Adjusted EBITDA are our measures of segment profitability.     (6)   RBI Adjusted EBITDA, RBI Adjusted Net Income, and RBI Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for further detail.     (7)   TH results for the three months ended June 30, 2015 have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the final purchase price allocation for Tim Hortons.     (8)   Commencing in the first quarter of 2016, we revised our presentation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share to include share-based compensation and non-cash incentive compensation expense, with the revision applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented to provide period-to-period comparability.   RBI Total Revenues for the quarter were $1,040.2 million compared to $1,042.2 million in the prior year period primarily as a result of unfavorable FX movements, partially offset by system-wide sales growth at both TH and BK. On a GAAP basis, RBI reported Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders of $90.9 million in the second quarter, versus $11.0 million in the prior year, and Diluted Earnings per Share of $0.38, compared to $0.05 in the prior year, primarily due to the non-recurrence of one-time expenses arising from the 2015 debt refinancing, effective cost management, and the non-recurrence of one-time expenses arising from the Tim Hortons transaction. Adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.2%, excluding the impact of FX movements, was driven by organic growth at both brands combined with cost discipline.TH Segment Results    Three Months Ended June 30,     (in US$ millions)    2016    2015 (7)       (unaudited)            Comparable Sales Growth (1)    2.7%    5.5%     System-wide Sales Growth (1)    4.8%    8.4%     System-wide Sales (3)    $   1,667.9    $   1,657.6            System Net Restaurant Growth (NRG) (2)    26    23     System Restaurant Count at Period End (2)    4,464    4,322            Sales    $   535.5    $   539.0     Franchise and Property Revenues    $   224.3    $   225.0     TH Total Revenues    $   759.8    $   764.0            Cost of Sales     $   415.5    $   449.8     Franchise & Property Expenses    $   79.6    $   88.6     Segment SG&A (9)    $   15.1    $   23.0     Segment Depreciation and Amortization (10)    $   26.1    $   29.6     TH Adjusted EBITDA (5) (11)     $   279.0    $   234.9     (9)   Segment selling, general and administrative expenses consists of segment selling expenses and segment management general and administrative expenses.

Impactful new product launches drove favorable comparable sales at TH. TH ended the second quarter with 4,464 restaurants, opening 26 net new restaurants during the period.TH experienced a 4.2% FX headwind to Total Revenues for the second quarter.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Key Business MetricsWe evaluate our restaurants and assess our business based on the following operating metrics.System-wide sales growth refers to the change in sales at all company-owned and franchise restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Comparable sales growth refers to the change in restaurant sales in one period from the same prior year period for restaurants that have been open for thirteen months or longer. Company-owned restaurants refranchised during a quarterly period are included with franchise restaurants for the purpose of calculating comparable sales growth for the quarter. Comparable sales and sales growth are measured on a constant currency basis, which means that results exclude the effect of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating prior year results at current year monthly average exchange rates. We analyze key operating metrics on a constant currency basis as this helps identify underlying business trends, without distortion from the effects of currency movements.System-wide sales represent sales at all company-owned restaurants and franchise restaurants. We do not record franchise sales as revenues; however, our franchise revenues include royalties based on a percentage of franchise sales.Key Business Metrics by Brand Market       Three Months Ended June 30,      Key Business Metrics      2016    2015              System-wide Sales Growth           TH - Canada      4.4 %    8.1 %     TH - US      6.1 %    10.6 %     TH - International      33.5 %    12.6 %     BK - US&C      0.0 %    7.9 %     BK - EMEA      10.7 %    15.4 %     BK - APAC      18.4 %    14.8 %     BK - LAC      15.7 %    18.3 %              Comparable Sales Growth           TH - Canada      2.3 %    5.4 %     TH - US      5.9 %    7.0 %     TH - International      (3.3)%    (3.2)%     BK - US&C      (0.8)%    7.9 %     BK - EMEA      0.8 %    5.1 %     BK - APAC      5.3 %    2.3 %     BK - LAC      4.9 %    8.5 %              System NRG           TH - Canada      25    17     TH - US      2    -     TH - International      (1)    6     BK - US&C      (15)    11     BK - EMEA      51    80     BK - APAC      46    45     BK - LAC      10    5              System Restaurant Count           TH - Canada      3,692    3,600     TH - US      658    657     TH - International      114    65     BK - US&C      7,366    7,390     BK - EMEA      4,149    3,901     BK - APAC      1,796    1,534     BK - LAC      1,789    1,703     RESTAURANT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL INC.

These interest rate swaps were settled during May 2015.     (3) Net losses (gains) on foreign exchange is primarily related to revaluation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.   RESTAURANT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNon-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)Below, we define the non-GAAP financial measures, provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors. These measures may differ from similarly captioned measures of other companies in our industry.Non-GAAP MeasuresTo spplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, RBI reports the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share ("Adjusted Diluted EPS"), Organic revenue growth and Organic Adjusted EBITDA growth. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in assessing our operating performance, as it provides them with the same tools that management uses to evaluate our performance and is responsive to questions we receive from both investors and analysts.  By disclosing these non-GAAP measures, we intend to provide investors with a consistent comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented.EBITDA is defined as earnings (net income or loss) before interest, (gain) loss on early extinguishment of debt, taxes, and depreciation and amortization and is used by management to measure operating performance of the business.Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the non-cash impact of share-based compensation and non-cash incentive compensation expense and (income) loss from equity method investments, net of cash distributions received from equity method investments, as well as other operating expenses (income), net. Other specifically identified costs associated with non-recurring projects are also excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, including acquisition accounting impact on cost of sales, Tim Hortons transaction and restructuring costs and integration costs, each of which is associated with the acquisition of Tim Hortons. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance of the business, excluding these non-cash and other specifically identified items that management believes are not relevant to management's assessment of operating performance or the performance of an acquired business. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, also represents our measure of segment income.Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income excluding (i) franchise agreement amortization, which is a non-cash expense arising as a result of acquisition accounting that may hinder the comparability of our operating results to our industry peers, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, a non-cash component of interest expense, and (gains) losses on early extinguishment of debt, which are non-cash charges that vary by the timing, terms and size of debt financing transactions, (iii) (income) loss from equity method investments, net of cash distributions received from equity method investments, (iv) other operating expenses (income), net, and (v) other specifically identified costs associated with non-recurring projects. Adjusted Net Income includes preferred share dividends.Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the number of diluted shares of RBI during the reporting period. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS are used by management to evaluate the operating performance of the business, excluding certain non-cash and other specifically identified items that management are not relevant to management's assessment of operating performance or the performance of an acquired business.Revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA growth, on an organic basis, are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of FX movements. Management believes that organic growth is an important metric for measuring the operating performance of our business as it excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate the impact of FX movements by translating current year results at prior year monthly average exchange rates.  RESTAURANT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL INC.
