Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

About Us


























About Us



				Assembly Biosciences, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing a new class of oral therapeutics for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and novel oral biotherapeutics for disorders associated with the microbiome.
            








Management
Board of Directors










                            Assembly's team has significant experience in infectious disease drug discovery and development and has collectively helped bring more than ten anti-infective products to the market. The company's HBV-Cure Program is aimed at increasing cure rates and is advancing multiple drug candidates that address upstream and downstream viral targets in the HBV lifecycle for possible use in combination therapy. The company's Microbiome Program consists of a fully integrated platform that includes a robust strain identification and selection process, methods for strain isolation and growth under cGMP conditions, a large and growing strain library and inventory, and a patent pending delivery system, Gemicel®, which allows for targeted oral delivery of live biologic and conventional therapies to the lower GI tract. The lead program from this platform, AB-M101, is in development for the treatment of C. difficile infection, and several other indications are in development.
                        


                            Assembly has recruited a diverse team of outstanding scientists whose shared commitment to advancing science and enhancing the health and well-being of patients creates a vibrant culture and drives our efforts to develop curative treatments for the millions of people worldwide infected by HBV and CDI.
                        

Assembly's MISSION
                            Discover, develop, and commercialize novel drugs with the potential to cure challenging infectious diseases, focusing initially on a functional cure for chronic HBV and on a new class of medicines that uses our patent pending microbiome technologies to treat disease in entirely new ways.
                        

OUR STRATEGY
                            Assembly is building a fully integrated infectious disease-focused company based on its proprietary technologies:
                        


                                Assembly's HBV-Cure research team is discovering and developing multiple drug candidates that address both upstream and downstream targets in the HBV lifecycle for possible use in combination therapy. The goal is an orally-administered regimen that eradicates the HBV infection, unlike current therapies that only keep the virus in check. Assembly has built a senior scientific team with decades of combined experience working on HBV. 
                            

                                The company's Microbiome Therapeutics Program is focused on the targeted delivery of microbiome-based therapies in a novel oral formulation to treat recurrent CDI patients. Assembly has a patent pending delivery system, Gemicel®, which allows for targeted delivery of selected GMP-manufactured bacteria strains to the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and it has built a team of world-class microbiome scientists from academia and industry to help advance this innovative program.
                            

                                Assembly's Gemicel is an enabling and versatile platform technology that is suitable for targeted oral delivery of live biotherapeutics, vaccines, complex macromolecules and small molecules targeted to specific regions of the GI tract. Gemicel is an integral part of Assembly's microbiome program and it also is available for licensing for non-competing applications.
                            


                            Assembly has facilities in Indiana, San Francisco and New York.  Our team consists of approximately 100 management and technical employees and consultants with deep expertise in drug discovery, development and commercialization. This team is augmented by a highly experienced Board of Directors and world-class scientific and clinical advisers.
