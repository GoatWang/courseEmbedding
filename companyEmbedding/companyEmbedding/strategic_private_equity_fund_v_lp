A private equity fund is a collective investment scheme used for making investments in various equity (and to a lesser extent debt) securities according to one of the investment strategies associated with private equity. Private equity funds are typically limited partnerships with a fixed term of 10 years (often with annual extensions). At inception, institutional investors make an unfunded commitment to the limited partnership, which is then drawn over the term of the fund. From the investors' point of view, funds can be traditional (where all the investors invest with equal terms) or asymmetric (where different investors have different terms).[1][2]
A private equity fund is raised and managed by investment professionals of a specific private equity firm (the general partner and investment advisor). Typically, a single private equity firm will manage a series of distinct private equity funds and will attempt to raise a new fund every 3 to 5 years as the previous fund is fully invested.[1]

Legal structure and terms[edit]




Diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund


Most private equity funds are structured as limited partnerships and are governed by the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement or LPA.[3] Such funds have a general partner (GP), which raises capital from cash-rich institutional investors, such as pension plans, universities, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals, which invest as limited partners (LPs) in the fund. Among the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement are the following:[4][5]

Term of the partnership: The partnership is usually a fixed-life investment vehicle that is typically 10 years plus some number of extensions.
Management fees: An annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the fund's manager to pay for the private equity firm's investment operations (typically 1 to 2% of the committed capital of the fund.[6]
Distribution Waterfall : The process by which the returned capital will be distributed to the investor, and allocated between Limited and General Partner. This waterfall includes the preferred return : a minimum rate of return (e.g. 8%) which must be achieved before the General Partner can receive any carried interest, and the Carried interest, the share of the profits paid the General Partner above the preferred return (e.g. 20%).[6]
Transfer of an interest in the fund: Private equity funds are not intended to be transferred or traded; however, they can be transferred to another investor. Typically, such a transfer must receive the consent of and is at the discretion of the fund's manager.[7]
Restrictions on the General Partner: The fund's manager has significant discretion to make investments and control the affairs of the fund. However, the LPA does have certain restrictions and controls and is often limited in the type, size, or geographic focus of investments permitted, and how long the manager is permitted to make new investments.[8]

Investments and financing[edit]
A private equity fund typically makes investments in companies (known as portfolio companies). These portfolio company investments are funded with the capital raised from LPs, and may be partially or substantially financed by debt. Some private equity investment transactions can be highly leveraged with debt financing—hence the acronym LBO for "leveraged buy-out". The cash flow from the portfolio company usually provides the source for the repayment of such debt. While billion dollar private equity investments make the headlines, private equity funds also play a large role in middle market businesses.[9]
Such LBO financing most often comes from commercial banks, although other financial institutions, such as hedge funds and mezzanine funds, may also provide financing. Since mid-2007, debt financing has become much more difficult to obtain for private equity funds than in previous years.[10][11]
LBO funds commonly acquire most of the equity interests or assets of the portfolio company through a newly created special purpose acquisition subsidiary controlled by the fund, and sometimes as a consortium of several like-minded funds.[12][13]
Multiples and prices[edit]
The acquisition price of a portfolio company is usually based on a multiple of the company's historical income, most often based on the measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Private equity multiples are highly dependent on the portfolio company's industry, the size of the company, and the availability of LBO financing.[14]
Portfolio company sales (exits)[edit]
A private equity fund's ultimate goal is to sell or exit its investments in portfolio companies for a return, known as internal rate of return (IRR) in excess of the price paid. These exit scenarios historically have been an IPO of the portfolio company or a sale of the company to a strategic acquirer through a merger or acquisition (M&A), also known as a trade sale.[15] A sale of the portfolio company to another private equity firm, also known as a secondary, has become common feature of developed private equity markets.[14]
In prior years, another exit strategy has been a preferred dividend by the portfolio company to the private equity fund to repay the capital investment, sometimes financed with additional debt.[16][17]
Investment features and considerations[edit]
Considerations for investing in private equity funds relative to other forms of investment include:

Substantial entry requirements: With most private equity funds requiring significant initial commitment (usually upwards of $1,000,000), which can be drawn at the manager's discretion over the first few years of the fund.[18]
Limited liquidity: Investments in limited partnership interests (the dominant legal form of private equity investments) are referred to as "illiquid" investments, which should earn a premium over traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Once invested, liquidity of invested funds may be very difficult to achieve before the manager realizes the investments in the portfolio because an investor's capital may be locked-up in long-term investments for as long as twelve years. Distributions may be made only as investments are converted to cash with limited partners typically having no right to demand that sales be made.[19]
Investment Control: Nearly all investors in private equity are passive and rely on the manager to make investments and generate liquidity from those investments. Typically, governance rights for limited partners in private equity funds are minimal. However, in some cases, Limited Partners with substantial investment enjoy special rights and terms of investment.[20]
Unfunded Commitments: An investor's commitment to a private equity fund is satisfied over time as the general partner makes capital calls on the investor. If a private equity firm cannot find suitable investment opportunities, it will not draw on an investor's commitment, and an investor may potentially invest less than expected or committed.[4][10]
Investment Risks: Given the risks associated with private equity investments, an investor can lose all of its investment. The risk of loss of capital is typically higher in venture capital funds, which invest in companies during the earliest phases of their development or in companies with high amounts of financial leverage. By their nature, investments in privately held companies tend to be riskier than investments in publicly traded companies.[21]
High returns: Consistent with the risks outlined above, private equity can provide high returns, with the best private equity managers significantly outperforming the public markets.[22]

For the above-mentioned reasons, private equity fund investment is for investors who can afford to have capital locked up for long periods and who can risk losing significant amounts of money. These disadvantages are offset by the potential benefits of annual returns, which may range up to 30% for successful funds.[23]

Distribution Waterfall : The process by which the returned capital will be distributed to the investor, and allocated between Limited and General Partner.

Restrictions on the General Partner: The fund's manager has significant discretion to make investments and control the affairs of the fund. However, the LPA does have certain restrictions and controls and is often limited in the type, size, or geographic focus of investments permitted, and how long the manager is permitted to make new investments.[8]

These exit scenarios historically have been an IPO of the portfolio company or a sale of the company to a strategic acquirer through a merger or acquisition (M&A), also known as a trade sale.[15] A sale of the portfolio company to another private equity firm, also known as a secondary, has become common feature of developed private equity markets.[14]

This article is about private equity investment funds. For private equity fund managers or financial sponsors and an overview of the industry, see private equity firm and private equity.

A private equity fund is a collective investment scheme used for making investments in various equity (and to a lesser extent debt) securities according to one of the investment strategies associated with private equity. Private equity funds are typically limited partnerships with a fixed term of 10 years (often with annual extensions). At inception, institutional investors make an unfunded commitment to the limited partnership, which is then drawn over the term of the fund. From the investors' point of view, funds can be traditional (where all the investors invest with equal terms) or asymmetric (where different investors have different terms).[1][2]
A private equity fund is raised and managed by investment professionals of a specific private equity firm (the general partner and investment advisor). Typically, a single private equity firm will manage a series of distinct private equity funds and will attempt to raise a new fund every 3 to 5 years as the previous fund is fully invested.[1]

Legal structure and terms[edit]




Diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund


Most private equity funds are structured as limited partnerships and are governed by the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement or LPA.[3] Such funds have a general partner (GP), which raises capital from cash-rich institutional investors, such as pension plans, universities, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals, which invest as limited partners (LPs) in the fund. Among the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement are the following:[4][5]

Term of the partnership: The partnership is usually a fixed-life investment vehicle that is typically 10 years plus some number of extensions.
Management fees: An annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the fund's manager to pay for the private equity firm's investment operations (typically 1 to 2% of the committed capital of the fund.[6]
Distribution Waterfall : The process by which the returned capital will be distributed to the investor, and allocated between Limited and General Partner. This waterfall includes the preferred return : a minimum rate of return (e.g. 8%) which must be achieved before the General Partner can receive any carried interest, and the Carried interest, the share of the profits paid the General Partner above the preferred return (e.g. 20%).[6]
Transfer of an interest in the fund: Private equity funds are not intended to be transferred or traded; however, they can be transferred to another investor. Typically, such a transfer must receive the consent of and is at the discretion of the fund's manager.[7]
Restrictions on the General Partner: The fund's manager has significant discretion to make investments and control the affairs of the fund. However, the LPA does have certain restrictions and controls and is often limited in the type, size, or geographic focus of investments permitted, and how long the manager is permitted to make new investments.[8]

The following is an illustration of the difference between a private equity fund and a private equity firm:

Investments and financing[edit]
A private equity fund typically makes investments in companies (known as portfolio companies). These portfolio company investments are funded with the capital raised from LPs, and may be partially or substantially financed by debt. Some private equity investment transactions can be highly leveraged with debt financing—hence the acronym LBO for "leveraged buy-out". The cash flow from the portfolio company usually provides the source for the repayment of such debt. While billion dollar private equity investments make the headlines, private equity funds also play a large role in middle market businesses.[9]
Such LBO financing most often comes from commercial banks, although other financial institutions, such as hedge funds and mezzanine funds, may also provide financing. Since mid-2007, debt financing has become much more difficult to obtain for private equity funds than in previous years.[10][11]
LBO funds commonly acquire most of the equity interests or assets of the portfolio company through a newly created special purpose acquisition subsidiary controlled by the fund, and sometimes as a consortium of several like-minded funds.[12][13]
Multiples and prices[edit]
The acquisition price of a portfolio company is usually based on a multiple of the company's historical income, most often based on the measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Private equity multiples are highly dependent on the portfolio company's industry, the size of the company, and the availability of LBO financing.[14]
Portfolio company sales (exits)[edit]
A private equity fund's ultimate goal is to sell or exit its investments in portfolio companies for a return, known as internal rate of return (IRR) in excess of the price paid. These exit scenarios historically have been an IPO of the portfolio company or a sale of the company to a strategic acquirer through a merger or acquisition (M&A), also known as a trade sale.[15] A sale of the portfolio company to another private equity firm, also known as a secondary, has become common feature of developed private equity markets.[14]
In prior years, another exit strategy has been a preferred dividend by the portfolio company to the private equity fund to repay the capital investment, sometimes financed with additional debt.[16][17]
Investment features and considerations[edit]
Considerations for investing in private equity funds relative to other forms of investment include:

Substantial entry requirements: With most private equity funds requiring significant initial commitment (usually upwards of $1,000,000), which can be drawn at the manager's discretion over the first few years of the fund.[18]
Limited liquidity: Investments in limited partnership interests (the dominant legal form of private equity investments) are referred to as "illiquid" investments, which should earn a premium over traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Once invested, liquidity of invested funds may be very difficult to achieve before the manager realizes the investments in the portfolio because an investor's capital may be locked-up in long-term investments for as long as twelve years. Distributions may be made only as investments are converted to cash with limited partners typically having no right to demand that sales be made.[19]
Investment Control: Nearly all investors in private equity are passive and rely on the manager to make investments and generate liquidity from those investments. Typically, governance rights for limited partners in private equity funds are minimal. However, in some cases, Limited Partners with substantial investment enjoy special rights and terms of investment.[20]
Unfunded Commitments: An investor's commitment to a private equity fund is satisfied over time as the general partner makes capital calls on the investor. If a private equity firm cannot find suitable investment opportunities, it will not draw on an investor's commitment, and an investor may potentially invest less than expected or committed.[4][10]
Investment Risks: Given the risks associated with private equity investments, an investor can lose all of its investment. The risk of loss of capital is typically higher in venture capital funds, which invest in companies during the earliest phases of their development or in companies with high amounts of financial leverage. By their nature, investments in privately held companies tend to be riskier than investments in publicly traded companies.[21]
High returns: Consistent with the risks outlined above, private equity can provide high returns, with the best private equity managers significantly outperforming the public markets.[22]

For the above-mentioned reasons, private equity fund investment is for investors who can afford to have capital locked up for long periods and who can risk losing significant amounts of money. These disadvantages are offset by the potential benefits of annual returns, which may range up to 30% for successful funds.[23]

We are among the most active secondary buyers in the world, closing one to two transactions per week on average. We pride ourselves in providing solutions on a fair, timely and confidential basis.


STRIVING TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS OF
Secondary Investing  For our limited partners, we strive to provide the benefits of secondary investing, which may include (i) reducing blind pool risk; (ii) mitigating the “J-Curve” with shorter duration profiles; and (iii) diversifying exposure across industries, investment strategies, fund sponsors, geographies and vintage years. This is achieved by utilizing our deep network of global relationships and focusing on a detailed, bottom-up analysis of the underlying assets. We believe our market position and proprietary investment database reinforce our reputation as a nimble and knowledgeable investor.

“ “We provide liquidity to investors who have invested in private investments and need for some reason to sell those investments and make their cash work for them someplace else. We really do two things. On the transaction level, we help these investors monetize, and on a broader scope, we provide liquidity to an illiquid market.”  - Stephen Can Strategic Partners

A private equity fund is a collective investment scheme used for making investments in various equity (and to a lesser extent debt) securities according to one of the investment strategies associated with private equity. Private equity funds are typically limited partnerships with a fixed term of 10 years (often with annual extensions). At inception, institutional investors make an unfunded commitment to the limited partnership, which is then drawn over the term of the fund. From the investors' point of view, funds can be traditional (where all the investors invest with equal terms) or asymmetric (where different investors have different terms).[1][2]
A private equity fund is raised and managed by investment professionals of a specific private equity firm (the general partner and investment advisor). Typically, a single private equity firm will manage a series of distinct private equity funds and will attempt to raise a new fund every 3 to 5 years as the previous fund is fully invested.[1]

Legal structure and terms[edit]




Diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund


Most private equity funds are structured as limited partnerships and are governed by the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement or LPA.[3] Such funds have a general partner (GP), which raises capital from cash-rich institutional investors, such as pension plans, universities, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals, which invest as limited partners (LPs) in the fund. Among the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement are the following:[4][5]

Term of the partnership: The partnership is usually a fixed-life investment vehicle that is typically 10 years plus some number of extensions.
Management fees: An annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the fund's manager to pay for the private equity firm's investment operations (typically 1 to 2% of the committed capital of the fund.[6]
Distribution Waterfall : The process by which the returned capital will be distributed to the investor, and allocated between Limited and General Partner. This waterfall includes the preferred return : a minimum rate of return (e.g. 8%) which must be achieved before the General Partner can receive any carried interest, and the Carried interest, the share of the profits paid the General Partner above the preferred return (e.g. 20%).[6]
Transfer of an interest in the fund: Private equity funds are not intended to be transferred or traded; however, they can be transferred to another investor. Typically, such a transfer must receive the consent of and is at the discretion of the fund's manager.[7]
Restrictions on the General Partner: The fund's manager has significant discretion to make investments and control the affairs of the fund. However, the LPA does have certain restrictions and controls and is often limited in the type, size, or geographic focus of investments permitted, and how long the manager is permitted to make new investments.[8]

The following is an illustration of the difference between a private equity fund and a private equity firm:

Investments and financing[edit]
A private equity fund typically makes investments in companies (known as portfolio companies). These portfolio company investments are funded with the capital raised from LPs, and may be partially or substantially financed by debt. Some private equity investment transactions can be highly leveraged with debt financing—hence the acronym LBO for "leveraged buy-out". The cash flow from the portfolio company usually provides the source for the repayment of such debt. While billion dollar private equity investments make the headlines, private equity funds also play a large role in middle market businesses.[9]
Such LBO financing most often comes from commercial banks, although other financial institutions, such as hedge funds and mezzanine funds, may also provide financing. Since mid-2007, debt financing has become much more difficult to obtain for private equity funds than in previous years.[10][11]
LBO funds commonly acquire most of the equity interests or assets of the portfolio company through a newly created special purpose acquisition subsidiary controlled by the fund, and sometimes as a consortium of several like-minded funds.[12][13]
Multiples and prices[edit]
The acquisition price of a portfolio company is usually based on a multiple of the company's historical income, most often based on the measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Private equity multiples are highly dependent on the portfolio company's industry, the size of the company, and the availability of LBO financing.[14]
Portfolio company sales (exits)[edit]
A private equity fund's ultimate goal is to sell or exit its investments in portfolio companies for a return, known as internal rate of return (IRR) in excess of the price paid. These exit scenarios historically have been an IPO of the portfolio company or a sale of the company to a strategic acquirer through a merger or acquisition (M&A), also known as a trade sale.[15] A sale of the portfolio company to another private equity firm, also known as a secondary, has become common feature of developed private equity markets.[14]
In prior years, another exit strategy has been a preferred dividend by the portfolio company to the private equity fund to repay the capital investment, sometimes financed with additional debt.[16][17]
Investment features and considerations[edit]
Considerations for investing in private equity funds relative to other forms of investment include:

Substantial entry requirements: With most private equity funds requiring significant initial commitment (usually upwards of $1,000,000), which can be drawn at the manager's discretion over the first few years of the fund.[18]
Limited liquidity: Investments in limited partnership interests (the dominant legal form of private equity investments) are referred to as "illiquid" investments, which should earn a premium over traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Once invested, liquidity of invested funds may be very difficult to achieve before the manager realizes the investments in the portfolio because an investor's capital may be locked-up in long-term investments for as long as twelve years. Distributions may be made only as investments are converted to cash with limited partners typically having no right to demand that sales be made.[19]
Investment Control: Nearly all investors in private equity are passive and rely on the manager to make investments and generate liquidity from those investments. Typically, governance rights for limited partners in private equity funds are minimal. However, in some cases, Limited Partners with substantial investment enjoy special rights and terms of investment.[20]
Unfunded Commitments: An investor's commitment to a private equity fund is satisfied over time as the general partner makes capital calls on the investor. If a private equity firm cannot find suitable investment opportunities, it will not draw on an investor's commitment, and an investor may potentially invest less than expected or committed.[4][10]
Investment Risks: Given the risks associated with private equity investments, an investor can lose all of its investment. The risk of loss of capital is typically higher in venture capital funds, which invest in companies during the earliest phases of their development or in companies with high amounts of financial leverage. By their nature, investments in privately held companies tend to be riskier than investments in publicly traded companies.[21]
High returns: Consistent with the risks outlined above, private equity can provide high returns, with the best private equity managers significantly outperforming the public markets.[22]

For the above-mentioned reasons, private equity fund investment is for investors who can afford to have capital locked up for long periods and who can risk losing significant amounts of money. These disadvantages are offset by the potential benefits of annual returns, which may range up to 30% for successful funds.[23]

A private equity fund is a collective investment scheme used for making investments in various equity (and to a lesser extent debt) securities according to one of the investment strategies associated with private equity. Private equity funds are typically limited partnerships with a fixed term of 10 years (often with annual extensions). At inception, institutional investors make an unfunded commitment to the limited partnership, which is then drawn over the term of the fund. From the investors' point of view, funds can be traditional (where all the investors invest with equal terms) or asymmetric (where different investors have different terms).[1][2]
A private equity fund is raised and managed by investment professionals of a specific private equity firm (the general partner and investment advisor). Typically, a single private equity firm will manage a series of distinct private equity funds and will attempt to raise a new fund every 3 to 5 years as the previous fund is fully invested.[1]

Legal structure and terms[edit]




Diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund


Most private equity funds are structured as limited partnerships and are governed by the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement or LPA.[3] Such funds have a general partner (GP), which raises capital from cash-rich institutional investors, such as pension plans, universities, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals, which invest as limited partners (LPs) in the fund. Among the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement are the following:[4][5]

Term of the partnership: The partnership is usually a fixed-life investment vehicle that is typically 10 years plus some number of extensions.
Management fees: An annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the fund's manager to pay for the private equity firm's investment operations (typically 1 to 2% of the committed capital of the fund.[6]
Distribution Waterfall : The process by which the returned capital will be distributed to the investor, and allocated between Limited and General Partner. This waterfall includes the preferred return : a minimum rate of return (e.g. 8%) which must be achieved before the General Partner can receive any carried interest, and the Carried interest, the share of the profits paid the General Partner above the preferred return (e.g. 20%).[6]
Transfer of an interest in the fund: Private equity funds are not intended to be transferred or traded; however, they can be transferred to another investor. Typically, such a transfer must receive the consent of and is at the discretion of the fund's manager.[7]
Restrictions on the General Partner: The fund's manager has significant discretion to make investments and control the affairs of the fund. However, the LPA does have certain restrictions and controls and is often limited in the type, size, or geographic focus of investments permitted, and how long the manager is permitted to make new investments.[8]

The following is an illustration of the difference between a private equity fund and a private equity firm:

Investments and financing[edit]
A private equity fund typically makes investments in companies (known as portfolio companies). These portfolio company investments are funded with the capital raised from LPs, and may be partially or substantially financed by debt. Some private equity investment transactions can be highly leveraged with debt financing—hence the acronym LBO for "leveraged buy-out". The cash flow from the portfolio company usually provides the source for the repayment of such debt. While billion dollar private equity investments make the headlines, private equity funds also play a large role in middle market businesses.[9]
Such LBO financing most often comes from commercial banks, although other financial institutions, such as hedge funds and mezzanine funds, may also provide financing. Since mid-2007, debt financing has become much more difficult to obtain for private equity funds than in previous years.[10][11]
LBO funds commonly acquire most of the equity interests or assets of the portfolio company through a newly created special purpose acquisition subsidiary controlled by the fund, and sometimes as a consortium of several like-minded funds.[12][13]
Multiples and prices[edit]
The acquisition price of a portfolio company is usually based on a multiple of the company's historical income, most often based on the measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Private equity multiples are highly dependent on the portfolio company's industry, the size of the company, and the availability of LBO financing.[14]
Portfolio company sales (exits)[edit]
A private equity fund's ultimate goal is to sell or exit its investments in portfolio companies for a return, known as internal rate of return (IRR) in excess of the price paid. These exit scenarios historically have been an IPO of the portfolio company or a sale of the company to a strategic acquirer through a merger or acquisition (M&A), also known as a trade sale.[15] A sale of the portfolio company to another private equity firm, also known as a secondary, has become common feature of developed private equity markets.[14]
In prior years, another exit strategy has been a preferred dividend by the portfolio company to the private equity fund to repay the capital investment, sometimes financed with additional debt.[16][17]
Investment features and considerations[edit]
Considerations for investing in private equity funds relative to other forms of investment include:

Substantial entry requirements: With most private equity funds requiring significant initial commitment (usually upwards of $1,000,000), which can be drawn at the manager's discretion over the first few years of the fund.[18]
Limited liquidity: Investments in limited partnership interests (the dominant legal form of private equity investments) are referred to as "illiquid" investments, which should earn a premium over traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Once invested, liquidity of invested funds may be very difficult to achieve before the manager realizes the investments in the portfolio because an investor's capital may be locked-up in long-term investments for as long as twelve years. Distributions may be made only as investments are converted to cash with limited partners typically having no right to demand that sales be made.[19]
Investment Control: Nearly all investors in private equity are passive and rely on the manager to make investments and generate liquidity from those investments. Typically, governance rights for limited partners in private equity funds are minimal. However, in some cases, Limited Partners with substantial investment enjoy special rights and terms of investment.[20]
Unfunded Commitments: An investor's commitment to a private equity fund is satisfied over time as the general partner makes capital calls on the investor. If a private equity firm cannot find suitable investment opportunities, it will not draw on an investor's commitment, and an investor may potentially invest less than expected or committed.[4][10]
Investment Risks: Given the risks associated with private equity investments, an investor can lose all of its investment. The risk of loss of capital is typically higher in venture capital funds, which invest in companies during the earliest phases of their development or in companies with high amounts of financial leverage. By their nature, investments in privately held companies tend to be riskier than investments in publicly traded companies.[21]
High returns: Consistent with the risks outlined above, private equity can provide high returns, with the best private equity managers significantly outperforming the public markets.[22]

For the above-mentioned reasons, private equity fund investment is for investors who can afford to have capital locked up for long periods and who can risk losing significant amounts of money. These disadvantages are offset by the potential benefits of annual returns, which may range up to 30% for successful funds.[23]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Swander Pace Capital Closes $350M Fund V



San Francisco and New Jersey – Swander Pace Capital, a leading private equity firm with a successful track record of growing consumer products companies, has announced the close of its fifth and largest fund. Fund V closed on Dec. 31, 2013, with $350 million in commitments from top-tier institutional investors, endowments, and family offices. SPC Partners V, L.P. will pursue the firm’s time-tested strategy of investing in world-class consumer products companies and maximizing growth through working with experienced management, expanding marketing and distribution efforts, implementing operational efficiencies, and targeting strategic add-on acquisitions.
“We are honored to have once again attracted a best-in-class group of limited partners that recognize Swander Pace’s track record of success and ability to provide strong returns to investors. Our team’s commitment to, and execution of, our investment strategy has built Swander Pace into a leading middle-market consumer products private equity firm and valued partner to family-run or entrepreneurially driven businesses,” said Andrew Richards, Co-Founder and Managing Director at Swander Pace. “Fund V is the largest fund in our firm’s history, and we are eager to continue implementing our strategy of proprietary deal sourcing and strategic and tactical value addition that we have honed by staying focused on consumer products for the past 18 years. The consistency of our focus in the consumer sector has built a set of playbooks we can replicate with each new investment that include growth strategies, channel migration, marketing, operational improvement or cost reductions. The execution of this strategy over our past four funds has enabled Swander Pace to identify, acquire and partner with high-potential consumer product companies that are in attractive niche sectors.”
Fund V will focus on growing manufacturers and marketers of consumer products with revenues up to $400 million. The firm seeks to invest in businesses with leading market positions in attractive, defensible industry niches and works primarily with entrepreneurs and families to implement strategic and tactical playbooks to drive revenue growth and improve operating performance. Swander Pace has substantial experience in the consumer products industry, including in sectors such as food and beverage, health and wellness, natural and organic, beauty and personal care, household products, pet products, soft goods and accessories, juvenile products, and ingredients, among many others.
“The partners at Swander Pace Capital are thrilled to welcome back our existing limited partners and welcome our new LPs to Fund V,” said Mark Poff, Managing Director at Swander Pace. “We are grateful for the strong support we received from our existing investors and believe that support is a validation of our strategy, focus, and performance. Swander Pace is well positioned to leverage the success of our preceding funds and our deep expertise in the consumer sector, and we are excited to execute our strategy in this new fund. We have already begun investing Fund V with the successful acquisitions of glo Professional Inc., Aden & Anais Inc. and Recochem Inc.”

      SPV LBO Centric, SPV Real Estate and SPV Venture Secondary Funds began investing in the second half of 2011 and have to date already collectively invested or committed to invest approximately US $500 million to over 170 underlying funds in over 30 transactions. Strategic Partner's pipeline is robust, with significant transaction deal flow being generated by Strategic Partner’s investment team as well as the entire Credit Suisse organization. The Fund is the fifth in a series of investment partnerships seeking capital appreciation through the purchase of secondary interests in high quality private equity funds from investors seeking liquidity.  Strategic Partners has built a market reputation of fair pricing, timely and seamless transaction execution, and confidentiality with sellers.
      

      Stephen Can, Global Head of Strategic Partners since its inception in 2000, said, “We are very pleased with our limited partner commitment to our fifth fund. From the start of its platform, Strategic Partners has raised over $11 billion of capital commitments, completed over 600 transactions, acquired over 1,400 limited partnership interests, and built a world class team currently consisting of 24 dedicated secondary investment professionals supported by over 50 accounting and product specialists.  We look forward to continuing to leverage our expertise in the secondary space and to building on our strong track record as 'secondary buyer of choice', by transacting on a fair, timely and confidential basis.”
