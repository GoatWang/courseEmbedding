Panzer IV - Mid & Late War



















Panzer IV (designated as Sd.Kfz. 161) was a German medium tank developed in the late 1930s and used extensively during the Second World War.
 
Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armor — that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III.  However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin.
 
Robust and reliable, the Panzer IV saw service in all combat theaters involving Germany and has the distinction of being the only German tank to remain in continuous production throughout the war, with over 8,800 produced between 1936 and 1945.  Upgrades and design modifications, often made in response to the appearance of new Allied tanks, extended its service life.  Generally, these involved increasing the Panzer IV’s armor protection or upgrading its weapons, although during the last months of the war, with Germany’s pressing need for rapid replacement of losses, design changes also included retrograde measures to simplify and speed up the manufacturing process.
 
The Panzer IV was the most widely exported tank in German service, with around 300 sold to partners such as Finland, Romania, Spain and Bulgaria during the war.
 
This model kit depicts a mid or late war version of the Panzer IV tank.  With this kit, you can assemble it to present an Ausf F2, G, or H variant.  It comes with 3 gun and 2 mantlet choices, together with detachable turret and side armour skirts (Schürzen).

Case 1:11-cv-00709-LY Document 1 Filed 08/17/11 Page 3 of 12

GENERAL AVERMENTS 

9. 

On or about March 10, 2004, Rubicon, through its predecessor-in-interest, Jim 

Thompson, filed a use-based trademark application with the United States Patent and Trademark 

Office (“USPTO”) for registration of the mark NETGATE in International Class 9, which 

matured to registration on or about October 24, 2006, and in which a first use in commerce date 

of April 15, 1993 was claimed. See printout of U.S. Reg. No. 3161285, attached hereto as 

Exhibit A. 

10. Mr. Thompson previously owned U.S. Reg. No. 2038157 for the mark 

NETGATE (on assignment from Smallworks, Inc.), which matured to registration on February 

18, 1997, but which was inadvertently cancelled in November 2003 due to a docketing error. 

Nonetheless, the NETGATE mark has been in continuous use in commerce by Rubicon and/or 

its predecessors-in-interest since at least as early as April 1993. 

11. 

Rubicon and its predecessor-in-interest have for many years operated an active 

business by the name of “Netgate.” See documents and website printouts attached as composite 

Exhibit B. In addition, the Netgate business operates a website located at www.netgate.com. 

The domain name “netgate.com” was registered by Rubicon and its predecessor-in-interest in 

1997, and has been in use since that time. See WhoIs record attached as Exhibit C. 

12. 

On or about May 14, 2001, Defendant AT&T Corp. filed an intent-to-use 

trademark application for registration of the mark NETGATE in International Class 9 (Serial No. 

78063419), which matured to registration on or about September 19, 2006, and in which a first 

use in commerce date of January 1, 1999 was claimed. See printout of U.S. Reg. No. 3146119, 

attached hereto as Exhibit D. 





3 

Case 1:11-cv-00709-LY Document 1 Filed 08/17/11 Page 4 of 12

13. 

Rubicon’s predecessor-in-interest filed Opposition No. 91/163,507 against AT&T 

Corp.’s application serial no. 78063419 for the NETGATE mark, based on prior use of the 

NETGATE mark. See printout of opposition no. 91/163,507, filed with the Trademark Trial and 

Appeal Board (“TTAB”), attached as Exhibit E. 

14. 

On or about March 6, 2006, Rubicon’s predecessor-in-interest and AT&T Corp. 

entered into a settlement agreement. See agreement filed with the TTAB, attached hereto as 

Exhibit F. 

15. 

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, AT&T Corp. (and its successors and 

assigns pursuant to para. 7 of the agreement, which would include all Defendants) was only 

authorized to use the agreed-upon mark (AT&T NETGATE) in connection with certain specified 

goods or services, as indicated by section 2.1 of the agreement: 

AT&T agrees to amend the listed goods and services in the ‘419 Application to 
remove: “telecommunications computer programs to enable dial up access to a 
telecommunications network and to enable virtual private telecommunications 
network services,” and to only use the AT&T NETGATE mark in association 
with the amended identification of goods set forth in the ‘419 Application. 

16. 

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, AT&T Corp. (and therefore all 

Defendants) was only authorized to use NETGATE in direct connection with the AT&T “house 

mark,” as per section 2.2 of the agreement: 

AT&T agrees to use the mark “AT&T” in direct and prominent proximity with 
the mark NETGATE (e.g., “AT&T NETGATE”) in connection with the goods 
cited in the ‘419 Application […] 

17. 

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, AT&T Corp. (and therefore all 

Defendants) was only authorized to use NETGATE standing alone for a three (3) month “phase 

out” period, after which NETGATE would not be used for any goods or services, as indicated in 

section 3.2 of the agreement: 



4 

Case 1:11-cv-00709-LY Document 1 Filed 08/17/11 Page 5 of 12

For a period of three (3) months following the Effective Date, Thompson 
expressly agrees that AT&T may use the NETGATE mark in association with 
AT&T’s sale and use of goods cited in the ‘419 Application, and marketing 
materials therefore, which are already in AT&T’s inventory, provided that at the 
end of such three (3) month period AT&T will use the mark AT&T NETGATE in 
association with such goods, and the mark NETGATE standing alone will not be 
used by AT&T or on its behalf in association with any goods or services. 


See Exhibit F for the foregoing quoted sections. 


18. 

Despite the foregoing terms of the agreement, and contrary thereto, and despite 

the notice given to Defendants by Rubicon, Defendants have used the mark NETGATE standing 

alone (without “AT&T” preceding it) in connection with “internal documents for training 

mistakenly posted online,” “customer guides,” and “marketing materials … viewed … by 

existing customers.” See correspondence to and from Defendants’ counsel, attached hereto as 

composite Exhibit G. 

19. 

Defendants used NETGATE as a standalone mark, in connection with materials 

that are beyond the scope of the identified goods or services in the agreement, and well past the 

three (3) month phase out period referenced in the agreement between Defendants and Rubicon’s 

predecessor-in-interest. See Exhibit H. Such usage by Defendants has directly and proximately 

caused harm and damages to Rubicon, including but not limited to instances of actual confusion 

among consumers, thereby resulting in not only devotion of time and energy to misdirected 

inquiries from consumers, but upon information and belief, lost revenue and sales. See Exhibit 

I. 

20. 

In addition to the foregoing, representatives from within AT&T have also 

contacted Rubicon, asking for information regarding AT&T’s NETGATE product. See, e.g., 

composite Exhibit J. Such inquiries from AT&T representatives to Rubicon indicates that not 

only is confusion likely because of AT&T’s unauthorized use, AT&T’s own employees and 



5 

Case 1:11-cv-00709-LY Document 1 Filed 08/17/11 Page 6 of 12

representatives are (a) actually confused as to the possible source, affiliation, relationship, or 

sponsorship between Rubicon’s NETGATE-branded products and AT&T’s products, and (b) not 

using the AT&T house mark in front of “Netgate,” thereby contributing to the confusion and 

infringement of Rubicon’s rights. 



Count I – Breach of Contract 

21. 

Rubicon hereby repeats the allegations of paragraphs 1-20 above as if fully set 

forth herein. 

22. 

The March 6, 2006 agreement between Rubicon’s predecessor-in-interest and 

AT&T Corp. constituted a valid contract that was binding upon the parties hereto. 

23. 

Defendants’ actions as set forth hereinabove constitute a material and intentional 

breach of the terms of the agreement. 

24. 

Rubicon had performed all conditions precedent to the agreement between the 

parties, and was not otherwise in breach of the agreement. 

25. 

Defendants’ breach of the terms of the agreement has directly and proximately 

caused damages and other harm to Rubicon. 

Count II – Trademark Infringement 



Rubicon hereby repeats the allegations of paragraphs 1-25 above as if fully set 

26. 

forth herein. 



27. 

This cause of action arises under § 32 of the Trademark Act of 1946 as amended 

(15 U.S.C. § 1114) for infringement of federally registered trademark. 



28. 

By reason of the foregoing acts, upon information and belief, the Defendants have 

infringed, and shall continue to infringe, Rubicon’s federally registered trademark, causing 



6 

Case 1:11-cv-00709-LY Document 1 Filed 08/17/11 Page 7 of 12

irreparable injury, the full extent of which cannot presently be determined. Unless Defendants 

are enjoined by the Court, the irreparable injury, harm and damages to Rubicon shall continue. 

Count III – Unfair Competition 

29. 

Rubicon hereby repeats the allegations of paragraphs 1-28 above as if fully set 

forth herein. 



30. 

This cause of action arises under the common law of unfair competition of the 

State of Texas, as well as pursuant to the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125. 



31. 

By reason of the foregoing acts, Defendants have traded upon and appropriated 

the reputation and valuable good will of Rubicon and have acted to create the likelihood of 

confusion and mistake on the part of the purchasing public as to the source of Defendants’ goods 

and/or services. 



32. 

Defendants’ acts are likely to lead the public mistakenly to the belief that 

Defendants’ goods and/or services are in some way related to, sponsored by, or associated with, 

Rubicon, and/or create the impression that Defendants’ and Rubicon’s goods and/or services are 

distributed under the same corporate aegis and authority. 



33. 

Defendants’ activities constitute unfair competition and a misappropriation and 

infringement of Rubicon’s registered and common law trademark rights, and have caused and 

will continue to cause irreparable injury, harm and damages to Rubicon unless enjoined by this 

Court. 

Count IV – Fraud 

34. 

Rubicon hereby repeats the allegations of paragraphs 1-33 above as if fully set 

forth herein. 





35. 

This cause of action arises under the common law of the State of Texas. 

7 

Case 1:11-cv-00709-LY Document 1 Filed 08/17/11 Page 8 of 12

36. 

Upon information and belief, Defendants knowingly and intentionally (or 

recklessly without any knowledge of the truth) made materially false, misleading, inaccurate and 

fraudulent statements to Rubicon and to the USPTO with the intention that Rubicon and the 

USPTO rely upon such statements so that Defendants would be able to obtain registration of the 

Defendants’ NETGATE mark. 

37. 

Rubicon relied upon Defendants’ materially false, misleading, inaccurate and 

fraudulent statements and thereupon agreed to settle its opposition against Defendants. 

38. 

Upon information and belief, the USPTO relied upon Defendants’ materially 

false, misleading, inaccurate and fraudulent statements in granting Defendants’ registration for 

the NETGATE mark. 

39. 

The materially false, misleading, inaccurate and fraudulent statements of 

Defendants have directly and proximately caused damage and harm to Rubicon, including but 

not limited to instances of actual confusion among consumers. 

Count V – Cancellation of Registration 

40. 

Rubicon hereby repeats the allegations of paragraphs 1-39 above as if fully set 

forth herein. 



41. 

42. 

This cause of action arises under 15 U.S.C. § 1119. 

By virtue of the March 6, 2006 agreement between Rubicon and Defendants, 

Defendants were contractually obligated to not use NETGATE standing alone. 

43. 

In light of such contractual obligations, Defendants have abandoned use of 

Defendants’ registered NETGATE mark on or in connection with the goods and services recited 

in U.S. Reg. No. 3146119. As a result of such abandonment, cancellation of U.S. Reg. No. 

3146119 is appropriate. 



8 

Case 1:11-cv-00709-LY Document 1 Filed 08/17/11 Page 9 of 12

44. 

In the alternative, and to the extent that Defendants have not abandoned use of 

NETGATE as a standalone mark as per the terms of the agreement shown in Exhibit F, then in 

such event, and upon information and belief, Defendants’ continued use of the NETGATE mark 

standing alone constitutes fraud on Rubicon as well as upon the USPTO. 

45. 

Upon information and belief, Defendants (through their predecessor-in-interest) 

knowingly and intentionally (or recklessly without any knowledge of the truth) made materially 

false, misleading, inaccurate and fraudulent statements to Rubicon and to the USPTO in order to 

obtain registration of the NETGATE mark. 

46. 

Rubicon relied upon Defendants’ materially false, misleading, inaccurate and 

fraudulent statements and thereupon agreed to settle its opposition against Defendants. 

47. 

Upon information and belief, the USPTO relied upon Defendants’ materially 

false, misleading, inaccurate and fraudulent statements in granting Defendants’ registration for 

the NETGATE mark. 

48. 

The materially false, misleading, inaccurate and fraudulent statements of 

Defendants have caused damage and harm to Rubicon, including but not limited to instances of 

actual confusion among consumers. 

49. 

In light of the fraudulent statements and/or actions of Defendants, as well as the 

actual confusion being caused by Defendants’ statements and/or actions, cancellation of 

Defendants’ U.S. Reg. No. 3146119 is appropriate. 

Jury Demand 



50. 

Rubicon demands a trial by jury on all issues.
