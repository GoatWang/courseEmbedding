We have used titebond 111 for a while now and it is the best wood glue that we have used for our mountain wall art. It is awesome in gluing the reclaimed laths, fast and ensures they will not come off under any condition, unlike many other brands we have tried. We are vary happy with this product and will continue to use it.

We have used titebond 111 for a while now and it is the best wood glue that we have used for our mountain wall art. It is awesome in gluing the reclaimed laths, fast and ensures they will not come off under any condition, unlike many other brands we have tried. We are vary happy with this product and will continue to use it.

I agree with the answer, I use Titebond 3 on cutting boards and on turned pieces which may eventually become utilitarian bowls and such. With food-safe finishes, oils (I prefer walnut) and beeswax, they are pretty safe all round.

            Excellent thought. Mineral oil would work well, but sometimes it does not dry well. I do, however, let people know that I use walnut oil. IF they have the nut allergy, I can re-make (or do a special order) mixed with what they need.

BEST ANSWER: The problem is this!  Every Titebond product has a date code which should be clearly visible on the container.  However after ordering glue from Rockler I have found the date code wiped off or not on the container.

I'm sure it does but I have never found an exact answer.  I normally buy my glue from a retailer that has good product turn-over thinking his glue might be fresher.  I mark the date I purchased it and always store it in 50+ degree temps.  I always get at least a year out of it.  If it gets too thick or doesn't smell right, throw it out, no sense in ruining a nice glued-up top because of old glue.

most definitely it has a shelf life.  I put the date I buy it on the front in magiv marker.  after one year I start watching it closely and when it gets too thick, I throw it out.  shelf life depends on when the glue was manufactured, the ambient temps in which it is stored and how exposed it has been to air.  there is no set rule, but get suspicious after one year in your possession.

When you buy it, put the date on the bottle.  One year later throw it away and buy a new one.  Keep the bottle tightly capped.  Glue interacts with water or air to solidify.  Finally keep the bottle go glue from hi heat or low cold.

On this type of project the importance really needs to be placed on removal of the old glue and any contaminates such as wax or oils. Being an inside job the type of glue then would depend on how long you want to work with the pieces. Titebond makes 3 primary wood glues from slow to quick setting (type III slowest). You could also use a white glue PVA, PVC or two part types of glues. I have all Titebond and some white glue.I use for my wood projects.

            That really is dependent on the type and condition of the glue. If it is antique the glue is most likely hyde glue and you could use hot water or a hair drier to loosen and remove. other types usually will give up to a paint scraper or chisel that's not too sharp or even a broad screwdriver. The most difficult would be a 2 part epoxy and you can only hope that it's hold on the wood is not too strong or have a lot of coarse grade sandpaper.

Tightbond II is the one for outdoor use and would most likely be the best choice in that line. If you are not soaking the project I don't see a problem. If so I would look to a marine 2 part glue or some other marine solution to be sure.

Strong glue... I have been using...
Strong glue... I have been using TiteBond III glue for wood for sometime and knew it was strong, but just recently I found out how strong it is. On a small project I had glued some 1/4&rdquo; diameter rare earth magnets into shallow holes so that they would act as retainers to another piece of wood that had the same size magnets likewise glued into shallow holes. Some time later, months, &nbsp;I discovered that one of the magnets was installed with the wrong polarity facing outward. To correct this error, I have to pry out the magnet and reverse it, and re-glue it back in. The magnet was really bonded in well. After a bit of work I was able to get it out. After getting it free, I noticed that it looked odd on the glued side. A closer look reveled that the thin nickel plating had pulled free of the back side of the magnet and was still stuck to the bottom of the hole where the magnet had been. These magnets have a shiny, polished exterior, so there was noting for the Titebond III to really &ldquo;grip&rdquo;, but it still managed to hold on to the plating well enough to strip it off the side of the magnet. In my opinion, that&rsquo;s bonding power.

Titebong Glue
Titebond is the only glue that I use in my shop I use it every day. I have tried others but I always go back to Titebond. Best glue on the market.

I have been using Titebond glues...
I have been using Titebond glues for years and needed to replenish my supply. I am currently building an exterior door out of red oak and needed more to glue the mortise and tenons. I have found that this glue does more than just resist moisture and it does allow time to assemble items in cooler temperatures. I have found also that this glue is stronger than the polyurethane glues on the market.

I have always used tite bond glue and never had any problem with it and have build furniture that is at least 20 years old and the joints are still holding up. Since they came out with the 3 that is all I use and the drying time is not that long so you can take the clamps off quicker and on to another part of your project When you build furniture for the public you need the best.

Here is an example of how strong this glue is. I made a desk and while gluing up the table top /desk top I was unsure how long Iwanted it 50 or 54 in so Iglued it up 56 in and cut it to the right size at 50 in. &nbsp;I have always been curious how strong it really is. With the 6 in strip that was 5 pieces that where joined toghter w/biscuits to took it slammed it on the concret floor in my basment woodshop around 45 deg, it did break apart but not at a seam it broke apart 1 in away from a seam it ripped the RED OAK apart and NOT at a joint. WOW, Titebond is and will always be the wood glue I ever use.

not a fan
I have bought several gallons of this glue only because I need to meet FDA requirements.  Purchased from several different suppliers and all have had clumping issues before I finished using the entire jug.  The Tite Bond II does not have this problem as some of the jugs of it at least a year old and still very usable.  Not sure what the cause is but if you do not need the FDA save your money I end up throwing away 16ozs. of sludge every time.

Titebond has a very strong bond
I like titebond because it's easy to use. I've used titebond for a number of years. Once two peices of wood are glued together it's a very tight bond. Titebond works for me ??

My go-to glue
Works great for indoor and outdoor applications, plus it has the longest open time of any of the Titebond glues.  That's important  because I live in the desert, and the heat can reduce most other glue open times.

Tough all weather glue
Built my outdoor redwood table and cedar adirondack chairs in Las Vegas. Sat in Temps up to 115 degrees F and extremely Dry conditions. Moved back to Elko and they are in 2 feet of snow, freezing weather to 20 below 0 F and wet. I have had one piece of Cedar split from freezing and the glue joint remains intact. Great product for tough service outside.

Best ext. glue on the market
I have tried a lot of other brands and types of glue over the years, but I always come back to Titebond.  With over fifty years of woodworking as a hobby, I have NEVER had a proper glue joint fail with Titebbond.  The wood will break before the glue does.

stronger than the wood itself
This glue is very strong.  I used it to glue together a case I was building.  Made a mistake and tried to take it apart.  It was pine.  I ended up breaking the wood instead of coming apart at the glue joint....

Always a Favorite
I have used Titebond for many years and have always found it to  be a solid product.  I specifically use Titebond III for most of the projects I work on, and after about 30 minutes, I can continue to work on the project, knowing it will hold for some minor, continuous work.  Once it has fully cured, Titebond III is incredibly strong and reliable, and has never failed me.  I highly recommend it.

Best glue ever
I use this glue all the time for making end grain cutting boards and it works well in other areas.  Some of my cutting boards have been in use for nearly 2 years and not a single report of glue failing.  I also use it for other projects both indoor and out and no failures reported.  This includes outdoor furniture and wood mallets which take a lot of beatings and have never failed.  I now buy Titebond III by the gallon.

Titebond glue comments
Titebond III Ultimate wood glue is an excellent product that I've been using for years...so many in fact, that I've forgotten the brand name of the product we used in my old cabinet shop days that was considered the standard.  Excellent bonding, sands great, and cleans up effortlessly.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
