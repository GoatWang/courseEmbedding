The Brewery is still open for tours by appointment only.Company OverviewCore Brewing & Distilling Company started in September of 2010. The founder, Jesse Core, began production on a 1-barrel RIMS brewhouse with 8 small fermenters. ...Our first client was Kingfish in Fayetteville. By 2012, we expanded our brewhouse to a 4-vessel, 25-barrel brewhouse with 4 x 25-barrel fermenters and 2 x 25-barrel Brite tanks. Demand grew quickly, and Core expanded again by adding 10 more 40-barrel fermentation vessels and 5 more 40-barrel Brite tanks.  We are grateful that consumer demand has been high and driving our growth. At Core, we understand that our consumers expect high quality product and we aim to exceed their expectations. If we produce consistent product of high quality, demand will continue to grow. Additionally, our founder has established a culture of humility and hard work putting the emphasis on the customer and community. We are good people making good product. In 3 short years, we have grown from 0 to 500 barrels of sales per month. Our product is found in over 500 locations, and we have won numerous awards. The mascot of the company is a wiener dog. His name is Barney. He was a gift from Jesse’s mother, and Barney was a special member of the family for over 19 years.
