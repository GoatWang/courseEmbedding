		Model 4314 Bluetooth Wireless Technology Modem



The Model 4314 is Version 2.1 Bluetooth with data rates of up to 3Mbps. The Model 4314 incorporates a Class 1 radio with a range of up to 100 meters (330 feet) and is interoperable with Class 1, 2 and 3 Bluetooth devices. The 4314 is a miniature 'thumbnail' sized USB adapter which protrudes very slightly from the USB port. The thumbnail design protects the adapter and the connected USB port from damage due to impact. Other adapters extend significantly farther from the PC and an impact force can be magnified by leverage. That leverage increases the likelihood of damage to the adapter and the port into which the adapter is plugged.
Version 2.1 Bluetooth provides several benefits over previous Bluetooth versions, including faster pairing, lower power consumption, and improved security. The Model 4314 provides a Bluetooth wireless connection to another Bluetooth enabled device, such as a modem, mobile phone, headset, another computer, or a peripheral and is RoHS Lead-free compliant.
Support is provided for the newest Bluetooth multi-media profiles including A2DP. The Model 4314 can maintain two Bluetooth profiles for a device with which the 4314 communicates. This allows toggling between applications, for instance Bluetooth headphones can be switched between a telephony applications and stereo playback. Bluesoleil software is provided to make communications between your PC and other Bluetooth devices easy. The Model 4314 is compatible with Bluetooth versions 2.1+EDR, 2.0+EDR, 2.0, 1.2, and 1.1

                  user experience.

Frequently asked questions »




Stop burning money on cable modem rental!
Owning your cable modem eliminates modem rental charges, typically about $90 per year. Currently Charter®, Mediacom® and Cablevision® donât offer any savings; but Comcast®, Time Warner Cable®, Cox®, Bright House Networks® and many others do.





Explore great ways to make and receive voice calls.
If you have a cable modem, how should you handle voice calls? There are lots of good options.
Here's a good summary »




			* 343/123 Mbps is the maximum download/upload speed for 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 cable modems; 686/123 Mbps is the maximum download/upload speed for 16x4 DOCSIS 3.0 cable modems. Actual speeds depend on a number of factors and will typically be lower. 
			** Speeds shown are the maximum wireless speeds derived from IEEE 802.11. Actual speeds will vary.

Stop burning money on cable modem rental!
Owning your cable modem eliminates modem rental charges, typically about $90 per year. Currently Charter®, Mediacom® and Cablevision® donât offer any savings; but Comcast®, Time Warner Cable®, Cox®, Bright House Networks® and many others do.





Explore great ways to make and receive voice calls.
If you have a cable modem, how should you handle voice calls? There are lots of good options.
Here's a good summary »




			* 343/123 Mbps is the maximum download/upload speed for 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 cable modems; 686/123 Mbps is the maximum download/upload speed for 16x4 DOCSIS 3.0 cable modems. Actual speeds depend on a number of factors and will typically be lower. 
			** Speeds shown are the maximum wireless speeds derived from IEEE 802.11. Actual speeds will vary.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
