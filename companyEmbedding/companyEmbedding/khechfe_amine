Cross-border selling can seem overwhelming, leaving small businesses unsure of how to dive into international markets or opting to avoid it altogether. Especially with recent international uncertainties such as Brexit, being wary is understandable.Yet, following the Brexit vote on June 23, 2016, U.K. online retail sales increased by 18.7 percent in July, compared to the previous year’s sales during the same period. This increase marked the strongest online sales performance since November 2014. Global markets are faced with new challenges every day, but many etailers are continuing to find success, no matter what’s happening around the world. The cross-border selling opportunities in the $2-trillion ecommerce market lead us to a pivotal question. How can small businesses not only expand by selling globally, but also ensure that they have a successful outcome despite economic or political uncertainties? Here are five strategies.Diversify your selling to different markets and countries.You’ve heard the saying “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” Well, this advice absolutely applies to your business strategy. Offering your product in a handful of global markets ensures that any potential international issues won’t drastically and negatively impact your business.Diversifying your markets will keep your business alert and flexible to adapt to challenging situations. If one market crashes, your company won’t come down with it; you’ll have “backup” markets to protect your business and keep it profitable.Take advantage of global marketplace platforms.Entering a new marketplace with your own website can be time-consuming, costly and present difficulties such as language barriers. Selling via local online marketplaces can be a relatively risk-free way to test out new markets and enable your business to be agile and able to move quickly.For example, if you’re looking to expand into the Latin America market, you’ll want to consider Mercado Libre, the most popular and largest ecommerce site in Latin America. It’s centered on auctions and listings by third-party sellers (similar to eBay). Not convinced yet? From 2010 to 2012, Mercado Libre grew 70 percent, with its traffic triple that of Amazon’s.International marketplaces offer a win-win for business and the consumer. They provide consumers with one-stop shopping for products they might not have found otherwise, and they allow businesses to connect with an expanded buyer audience they probably wouldn’t have been able to reach on their own.Don’t overlook shipping.Selling your products to international customers is one thing, but you have to have a solid plan in place for how you’re going to get them their purchases. Choosing the right shipping method is crucial, as well as offering multiple shipping options tailored to customers’ delivery speed and cost preferences. U.S. customers have heightened delivery expectations, which means international customers have to, too.According to the 2016 UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper, 75 percent of shoppers rate shipping costs as being the most important buying factor, exhibited by 56 percent of shoppers reporting they’ve abandoned a cart due to high shipping costs. Additionally, consumer perception of what constitutes as fast delivery has accelerated. A Deloitte study reported that nine out of 10 shoppers only consider same-day, next-day and two-day delivery to be fast.Also, don’t forget about the customers’ return process. Returns play a major role in sales conversions, with 89 percent of customers saying they’ll shop again at an online store after a positive returns experience. Consumers’ buying experiences don’t end when they click “Submit Order” -- the subsequent delivery process will still influence the future sales growth of your online business.Endicia’s international shipping solutions can help you streamline all of these things by automatically filling out customs forms, quickly clearing customs, reducing shipping costs by utilizing local networks and having more visibility into each shipment with end-to-end tracking.Develop networks in your new market(s).When you decide to begin selling internationally, it’s important to develop relationships in the new markets. Make the effort to establish strategic partnerships with prominent websites, influencers and social media players to generate brand visibility and improve SEO performance. If your brand isn’t anywhere to be found in your new, local market, it will be difficult for consumers and businesses to find you -- resulting in lost sales opportunities.Localize everything -- from language to cross-border taxation.Keep things simple by localizing all of the information for the customers that you’re targeting. To start, this means presenting your company information in the relevant language for customers. And, localize yourself to where you’re selling. If you don’t speak the language or understand specific laws, develop relationships with local service providers, industry contacts and partners that can help you smooth over issues that may arise with local postal services and other entities.Localization also means ensuring that all currency conversions, international payment options and duties and taxes are clearly stated and accurately represent local information, so customers aren’t surprised with unexpected fees upon checkout or delivery.International selling presents businesses with huge opportunities to grow their operations. By nurturing international partnerships, optimizing shipping and services and connecting with local resources, small businesses can successfully expand their global footprint.

Shipping is the final (and arguably most important) frontier when it comes to satisfying customers. Big box retailers have made shipping a priority by routinely examining and revamping their fulfillment methods, resulting in solutions like Amazon Prime, Walmart’s two-day shipping subscription and eBay’s Fast ‘N Free initiative.Keeping an eye on trends and adopting new, relevant shipping methods will not only help improve customer satisfaction, but it will also help small business owners meet their bottom lines and compete with the big dogs.Here are five logistics trends and strategies that all retail business owners should evaluate.1. Free shipping is expected.According to a Deloitte survey, free shipping is the top priority for shoppers when it comes to retail policies, and nine in 10 shoppers prioritize free shipping over fast shipping when shopping online.For small businesses to remain competitive, and avoid shopping cart abandonment, they’ll need to strongly consider incorporating free shipping as an option. As all businesses know, shipping is never really free.On a basic level, there are a few strategies to help businesses cover the cost of free shipping. First, increase product prices to cover shipping costs. In this case, the customer pays. Second, the business pays the full price of shipping. Third, the company slightly increases prices of products to cover some shipping costs, so that both pay a portion.Businesses can also get creative, offering free shipping when a customer hits a minimum order value. This strategy can help by increasing an average order size; therefore, increasing profits to help offset shipping costs.2. Deliver packages at a specific time.Some of consumers’ biggest pet peeves are receiving those “sorry we missed you” postage slips on their front door, or even worse, having a package stolen off their doorstep.According to a Temando survey, 76 percent of consumers want a specified time slot for delivery, and 37 percent are willing to pay a premium for it. The good news is that the major carriers’ tracking information have significantly improved, helping recipients know where their package is on its route and the estimated delivery date. In addition, most consumers know roughly when their mail carrier arrives each day and can oftentimes plan accordingly.For even greater control over delivery times, businesses can consider offering local customers on-demand delivery services, such as UberRUSH or Deliv. With these services, shoppers can specify the exact time of day they would like to have their order arrive.To ship smaller items to out-of-town customers with unusual or difficult schedules, USPS also offers a Hold for Pickup option, allowing the customer to pick up the parcel at a specified post office location. It also offers Package Intercept, which allows customers to reroute their domestic packages if they go on a vacation or business trip.3. Drones will deliver.Drones will soon be able to deliver small items to local areas quickly and efficiently. Amazon and Google are investing in drone delivery, among countless other tech companies.However, there are still operational limitations standing in the way of drone delivery. The Part 107 drone regulations announced recently that it does not cover a variety of operations crucial to delivering packages, such as flying beyond a pilot’s visual line of sight, at higher altitudes and over laypeople.Related: 3 Ways to Grow a Multi-Million Dollar Drop Shipping BusinessSo while they’re not buzzing overhead quite yet, business owners should keep drone delivery on their radar to make sure their business is ready to adapt quickly once regulations allowing drone deliveries are in place.4. More options drive customer satisfaction.Traditionally, shoppers are given a few shipping options at checkout: standard, expedited and overnight. However, consumers are looking for more flexibility when it comes to how and when they receive their orders.According to an Accenture study, 66 percent of consumers have chosen a retailer based on the number of available delivery options.Related: 5 Keys to Building Your Ecommerce SiteTo avoid shopping cart abandonment and upset customers, retailers should think about adding additional delivery choices such as local pickup, carrier-specific options, same-day shipping and more.USPS is generally the most affordable option for smaller, lightweight packages while UPS and FedEx are better suited for larger items. Allowing customers to select specified carriers - UPS, FedEx or USPS -- may create satisfied, repeat customers as it gives them some control over the process.5. Big data transforms shipping.Business data has been around for a long time, mostly sitting in filing cabinets as an untapped resource. Thanks to new technologies, small businesses can now leverage their data to better serve their customers.With the right tools, businesses can automatically analyze information, such as pricing histories, mobile device usage, website traffic, locations, parcels’ time in transit and shipping destinations to make informed business decisions. This eliminates inefficiencies and bias; therefore, reducing overall business costs and improving practices.Related: The 6 Best Ecommerce Platforms for Small BusinessesThere are countless ways small businesses can gather, analyze and make sense of all the data at their fingertips. For example, Endicia uses package data and predictive analysis to guide ecommerce business owners’ decisions, ranging from where to plant warehouses to how to improve delivery for the end-consumer through forecasted shipping costs and time in transit.By taking a look at where most products are shipped and how long they take to get there, business owners can determine the optimal location for a warehouse that will save the most time and money.Shipping is a challenging aspect of any ecommerce business and every small business will have different tactics and challenges to create the most efficient shipping strategy possible. Keeping an eye on shipping trends and strategies while implementing and tweaking it as needed, will help businesses determine what works best in order to be successful and competitive with the ecommerce retail giants.

5 Things You Didn’t Know About Endicia: Amine Khechfé’s Interview with Mixergy

 

Endicia general manager and co-founder, Amine Khechfe, was recently interviewed by Andrew Warner of Mixergy to discuss how Endicia helps businesses, his favorite moments since starting the company and much more.
What’s Mixergy? It’s a website and podcast that helps ambitious people learn from a mix of experienced mentors. Andrew Warner, founder and host of the show, created the site to provide a channel for successful founders to share their stories and advice.
Mixergy has hosted countless influencers such as Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, Gregg Spiridellis, co-founder of JibJab and Barbara Corcoran, businesswoman and television personality on ABC’s Shark Tank. We couldn’t be more excited to have Amine interviewed alongside these big names.
While we thought we’ve heard it all before, we learned a few more fun facts about Endicia’s founding that we wanted to share. Here are 5 things you might not know about Endicia:
The Name “Endicia” Was a Last Minute Thought
Many people have trouble pronouncing our company name (Andrew Warner included). During the interview, Amine let Andrew in on a little secret – coming up with a name was the very last thing on the list when founding the company. There was no money to hire a creative marketing firm and – as a team of engineers –  Endicia’s founders were more focused on building solutions than naming their business.
Bonus fact – Endicia is a play on the term “Indicia” which is the name of markings on an envelope which indicate postage has been paid.

Endicia Wasn’t Born Overnight
When we think about printing a shipping label, it seems pretty easy. But back in the day it wasn’t quite so simple. It took more than nine years for the U.S. Postal Service to approve Amine and his co-founder Harry’s idea to print postage from a personal computer.
In the meantime, Amine and Harry worked on developing software to print envelopes and do bulk mailing. The duo also went to the Post Office regularly and identified three big issues that people had – getting a tracking number, paying for insurance and completing international forms. While they were waiting for approval, they worked to automate all of these tasks for online businesses.
No Funding Necessary
Before receiving approval from the USPS to develop PC Postage, Harry and Amine kept themselves afloat by providing consulting services to other businesses and organizations. They worked nights and built Endicia software on the side. As a result, they never took outside funding and never used a single line of credit in the founding of Endicia.
Early Customers Came From Online Forums
By 1999, Endicia had launched and the company needed customers. It saw an opportunity with new online sellers that had to ship products quickly but didn’t necessarily know all their options.
Endicia started going to online help forums, such as eBay’s shipping forum, and began answering questions for people who needed help. Online sellers began recognizing the Endicia name and signing up for the software. Then those customers would tell other online sellers, and the business began growing via word of mouth.
Endicia Built Relationships with Cookies
Starting in the ‘80s, Endicia co-founder, Harry Whitehouse, began bringing chocolate chip cookies to meetings with customers. The gesture became a calling card for Endicia and helped the business solidify relationships in the early days. Today, Endicia still takes cookies with them to meetings – even international trade shows! Needless to say, the cookie has become a part of our brand and helps the company maintain a personal touch.
