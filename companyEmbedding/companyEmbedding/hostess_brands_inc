KANSAS CITY, Mo--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hostess Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ: TWNK, TWNKW) (the “Company”), a leading 
      manufacturer and marketer in the United States of sweet baked goods, 
      including Hostess®, Twinkies®, Ding Dongs®, Ho Hos®, Donettes® and a 
      variety of other new and classic treats, today reported financial 
      results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.
    


      Hostess® is the second leading brand by market share within the Sweet 
      Baked Goods ("SBG") category. For the 52-week period ended March 25, 
      2017 the Company's market share was 17% per Nielsen’s U.S. SBG category 
      data. The Company has a #1 leading market position within the two 
      largest SBG Segments: Donut Segment and Snack Cake Segment, and have a 
      #2 leading market position in total Sweet Baked Goods, according to 
      Nielsen U.S. total universe for the 52 weeks ended March 25, 2017. The 
      Donut and Snack Cake Segments together account for 49% of the Sweet 
      Baked Goods category's total dollar sales.
    

      The Company's results include those of Superior Cake Products, Inc. 
      ("Superior"), which was acquired by the Company on May 10, 2016. Through 
      Superior, the Company competes in the in-store bakery section of 
      retailers.
    

      On November 4, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of a 
      controlling interest in Hostess Holdings, L.P. ("Hostess Holdings") and 
      changed its name from Gores Holdings, Inc. to Hostess Brands, Inc. (the 
      "Business Combination"). As a result, the Company's consolidated 
      financial results are presented: (i) as of March 31, 2017 and December 
      31, 2016 (Successor); (ii) for the three months ended March 31, 2017 
      (Successor); and (iii) for the three months ended March 31, 2016 
      (Predecessor).
    

      The Company has also presented supplemental unaudited pro forma 
      financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2016, giving 
      effect to the Business Combination as if it had occurred on January 1, 
      2016. All references in this press release to results for the quarter 
      ended March 31, 2016, refer to such unaudited pro forma results. The 
      Company believes this pro forma information provides helpful 
      supplemental information with respect to the performance of the Hostess 
      business during this period.
    

      The Company also has supplemented its discussion with a presentation of 
      adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the 
      schedules in this press release for explanations and reconciliations of 
      this and other non-GAAP financial measures.
    

First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights



        Net revenue for the first quarter 2017 increased 15.2%, or $24.3 
        million from pro forma first quarter of 2016 (net revenue increased 
        9.1%, excluding revenue from the Company's In-Store Bakery segment)
      

        Net income for the first quarter 2017 was $24.2 million, an increase 
        of $11.9 million, compared to $12.3 million for the pro forma first 
        quarter of 2016
      

        EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.15 per share
      

        Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.3%, or $6.4 million, to $54.5 million for 
        the first quarter of 2017 from $48.1 million for the pro forma first 
        quarter of 2016
      


      “We are pleased with our strong start to the year and continued ability 
      to gain market share,” commented Bill Toler, President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of the Company. “Our 2017 new product initiatives and 
      our holiday and seasonal programs provided solid growth in the first 
      quarter and we are optimistic about their potential for the year."
    

First Quarter 2017 Financial Results


      Net revenue was $184.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, an 
      increase of $24.3 million, or 15.2%, compared to pro forma net revenue 
      of $160.2 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase was 
      primarily due to $9.7 million of revenue from In-Store Bakery; the 
      initial launch of the Company's 2017 new product initiatives, including 
      Chocolate Cake Twinkies®, Golden Cupcakes, and White Fudge Ding Dongs®, 
      among others; continued growth from the Company's 2016 new product 
      initiatives; and increased distribution.
    

      Gross profit was $79.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, an 
      increase of $9.2 million, or 13.2%, compared to pro forma gross profit 
      of $70.1 million for the first quarter of 2016, driven by the increase 
      in revenue.
    

      Gross margin was 43.0% for the first quarter of 2017, compared to 43.7% 
      for the pro forma first quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross margin 
      was primarily due to a shift in product mix to include the Company's 
      In-Store Bakery segment.
    

      Advertising, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were 
      $28.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, or 15.5% of net revenue, 
      compared to $23.6 million, or 14.7% of net revenue, for the pro forma 
      first quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to 
      increased professional service expenses, the addition of Superior's 
      operations, increased non-cash share based compensation and increased 
      brokerage costs.
    

      The effective tax rate was 29.2% for the first quarter of 2017, giving 
      effect to the non-controlling interest which represents an ownership 
      interest in a partnership for income tax purposes. The pro forma first 
      quarter 2016 effective tax rate was 28.5%. The increase in the effective 
      tax rate is attributed to the acquisition of Superior.
    

      Net income was $24.2 million, or $0.15 per share, for the first quarter 
      of 2017, compared to net income of $12.3 million, or $0.08 per share, 
      for the pro forma first quarter of 2016. The increase in net income was 
      primarily attributed to revenue and gross profit growth. Other factors 
      causing the increase in net income included the $7.3 million impairment 
      loss recognized during the first quarter of 2016 and a decrease in first 
      quarter 2017 interest expense. Net income of $15.8 million was allocated 
      to Class A common stockholders for the first quarter of 2017, while the 
      remaining $8.4 million was allocated to the non-controlling interest.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA was $54.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, an 
      increase of $6.4 million, or 13.3%, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $48.1 
      million for the pro forma first quarter of 2016. As a percentage of net 
      revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 29.5% for the first quarter of 2017, 
      compared to 30.0% in the same period last year. The decrease is 
      primarily due to a shift in product mix to include the Company's 
      In-Store Bakery segment. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial 
      measure. Please refer to the schedules in this press release for 
      reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.
    

First Quarter 2017 Segment Results


      The Company has two reportable segments: Sweet Baked Goods and Other. 
      The Sweet Baked Goods segment consists of sweet baked goods and the 
      Other segment consists of branded bread and buns, in-store bakery 
      products, frozen retail and licensing.
    

Sweet Baked Goods Segment: Net revenue for the first 
      quarter of 2017 was $168.4 million, an increase of $13.7 million, or 
      8.9%, compared to pro forma net revenue of $154.7 million for the pro 
      forma first quarter of 2016. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 
      was $74.9 million, or 44.5% of net revenue, compared to gross profit of 
      $68.1 million, or 44.0% of net revenue, for the pro forma first quarter 
      of 2016. Gross margin increases were due to favorable commodity pricing.
    

Other Segment: Net revenue for the first quarter of 2017 
      was $16.1 million, an increase of $10.6 million, or 193.4%, compared to 
      net revenue of $5.5 million for the pro forma first quarter of 2016. 
      This increase is primarily due to the impact of the Superior acquisition 
      completed May 10, 2016. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 was 
      $4.4 million, or 27.4% of net revenue, compared to gross profit of $1.9 
      million, or 35.2% of net revenue for the pro forma first quarter of 2016.
    

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow


      As of March 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $45.7 
      million and approximately $97.2 million available for borrowing, net of 
      letters of credit, under its revolving line of credit. The Company had 
      outstanding term loan debt of $996.3 million and net debt of $950.6 
      million as of March 31, 2017, resulting in a total pro forma combined 
      leverage ratio of 4.29x based on pro forma combined adjusted EBITDA of 
      $221.7 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017. (See the 
      schedules in the press release for the calculation of the pro forma 
      combined leverage ratio and a reconciliation of pro forma combined 
      adjusted EBITDA to pro forma combined net income of $94.4 million for 
      the twelve months ended March 31, 2017.)
    

Outlook


      The Company expects to continue to grow above the sweet baked goods 
      category in 2017. The Company reaffirms anticipated net revenue of $781 
      million and adjusted EBITDA of $235 million for the year ended December 
      31, 2017. (See the schedules in the press release for a reconciliation 
      of anticipated 2017 adjusted EBITDA to anticipated net income of $98 
      million for 2017)
    

      Based upon the Company's anticipated net income of $98 million for 2017, 
      $33 million is expected to be allocated to the non-controlling interest 
      based on the current ownership percentage in Hostess Holdings. The 
      remaining $65 million allocated to Class A Common stockholders is 
      expected to result in $0.66 basic earnings per share and $0.61 diluted 
      earnings per share for the full year based on expected basic and diluted 
      shares outstanding of approximately 98.7 million and 106.8 million, 
      respectively.
    

      Income tax related payments to be made by the Company relating to 2017 
      activity include: (i) tax payments between $20 million and $23 million 
      during 2017 to cover the Company's current federal and state income tax 
      liabilities, (ii) between $16 million and $19 million of distributions 
      to the holders of the non-controlling interest to reimburse their income 
      tax liability, and (iii) between $13 million and $15 million of payments 
      to the selling equityholders of Hostess Holdings for 2017 activity under 
      the terms of the tax receivable agreement. The tax receivable agreement 
      payment is expected to be made in 2018.
    

      The Company believes that it is well positioned to grow and enhance 
      shareholder value through the execution of its strategic initiatives. 
      These key strategic initiatives are focused on further core distribution 
      expansion, continued new product initiatives and line extensions, the 
      pursuit of white space opportunities and serving as a platform for 
      future acquisitions.

SUPPLEMENTAL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION


      The unaudited pro forma statements of operations for the quarter ended 
      March 31, 2016 present our consolidated results of operations giving pro 
      forma effect as if the Business Combination (as defined below) had 
      occurred as of January 1, 2016. The pro forma adjustments are based on 
      available information and upon assumptions that our management believes 
      are reasonable in order to reflect, on a pro forma basis, the impact of 
      these transactions on the historical financial information of our 
      Predecessor entity.
    

      On November 4, 2016 (the “Closing Date”), in a transaction referred to 
      as the “Business Combination,” the Company, then known as Gores 
      Holdings, Inc. acquired a controlling interest in Hostess Holdings, L.P. 
      (“Hostess Holdings”), an entity owned indirectly by C. Dean Metropoulos 
      and certain equity funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global 
      Management, LLC (the “Apollo Funds”). Hostess Holdings had acquired the 
      Hostess brand and certain strategic assets out of the bankruptcy 
      liquidation proceedings of its prior owner (“Old Hostess”), free and 
      clear of all past liabilities, in April 2013, and relaunched the Hostess 
      brand later that year.
    

      The Business Combination was accounted for using the acquisition method 
      of accounting. The initial estimated fair values of the acquired assets 
      and assumed liabilities as of the Closing Date, which are based on the 
      consideration paid and estimates and our assumptions, are reflected 
      herein. The total purchase price of approximately $2.4 billion to 
      acquire Hostess Holdings, has been allocated to the assets acquired and 
      assumed liabilities of Hostess Holdings based upon estimated fair values 
      at the date of acquisition. Third party valuation specialists conducted 
      analyses in order to assist our management in determining the fair 
      values of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed. The Company has 
      estimated the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at 
      the date of acquisition. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial 
      information is included for informational purposes only and does not 
      purport to reflect the results of operations of Hostess Brands, Inc. 
      that would have occurred had the Business Combination occurred as of 
      January 1, 2016.
    

      The unaudited pro forma financial information contains a variety of 
      adjustments, assumptions and estimates, is subject to numerous other 
      uncertainties and the assumptions and adjustments as described in the 
      accompanying notes hereto and should not be relied upon as being 
      indicative of our results of operations had the Business Combination 
      occurred on January 1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma financial 
      information also does not project our results of operations for any 
      future period or date. The acquisition of Superior Cake Products, Inc. 
      (“Superior”) occurred in May 2016. The unaudited pro forma consolidated 
      financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2016 does not 
      include the results of the Superior acquisition and its related 
      operations. We evaluated the impact of the Superior acquisition on the 
      Company’s financial statements and concluded that the impact was not 
      significant and did not require nor separately warrant the inclusion of 
      pro forma financial results assuming the acquisition of Superior at 
      January 1, 2016 under applicable SEC rules and regulations or under GAAP.
    

      On November 18, 2016, we refinanced our first and second lien term loans 
      (the “Former First and Second Lien Term Loans”) into one new first lien 
      term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $998.8 million and with a 
      maturity date of August 3, 2022 (the “New First Lien Term Loan”). We 
      evaluated the impact of the refinancing of existing debt pursuant to the 
      New First Lien Term Loan, completed on November 18, 2016, and concluded 
      that the impact was not significant and did not require nor separately 
      warrant the inclusion of pro forma financial results assuming the 
      completion of the refinancing on January 1, 2016.
    

      The pro forma adjustments give effect to the items identified in the pro 
      forma table below in connection with the Business Combination.

Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA


      Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in the 
      Company's industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net 
      income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to 
      cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
      (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA may not be 
      comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The 
      Company has included adjusted EBITDA because it believes it provides 
      management and investors with additional information to measure the 
      Company's performance and liquidity, estimate the Company's value and 
      evaluate the Company's ability to service debt.
    

      We define adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted to exclude (i) interest 
      expense, net, (ii) depreciation and amortization and (iii) income taxes 
      and (iv) as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items 
      that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating 
      performance. These further adjustments are itemized below. You are 
      encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons the Company 
      considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating 
      adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may 
      incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the 
      adjustments set forth below. The Company's presentation of adjusted 
      EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results 
      will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you 
      should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of 
      the Company's results as reported under GAAP. For example, adjusted 
      EBITDA:
    


        does not reflect the Company's capital expenditures, future 
        requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
      

        does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's 
        working capital needs;
      

        does not reflect the significant interest expenses, or the cash 
        requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on 
        the Company's debt;
      

        does not reflect any cash requirements for the assets being 
        depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; 
        and
      

        does not reflect payments related to income taxes, the tax receivable 
        agreement or distributions to the non-controlling interest to 
        reimburse its tax liability.
      


      The Company's presentation of adjusted EBITDA does not exclude the 
      normal annual cash payments associated with its employment agreement 
      with Mr. Metropoulos as the Chief Executive Officer and/or Executive 
      Chairman. These amounts were $0.1 million for the three months ended 
      March 31, 2017 and $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 
      2016. Following completion of the Business Combination, these expenses 
      will be approximately $0.1 million quarterly.

Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA-Guidance for the year ended 
      December 31, 2017


      Reconciliation of our 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income 
      presents inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that are 
      necessary for a full reconciliation to net income. Our outlook for 2017 
      adjusted EBITDA is based on the same methodology used to present 
      adjusted EBITDA for completed historical and pro forma periods. However, 
      the amounts, if any, of the non-recurring items that are excluded from 
      adjusted EBITDA are highly uncertain and incapable of estimation, and 
      have not been included in the table above. Such non-recurring items may 
      include non-cash expenses for earn out liabilities under the terms of 
      the Business Combination, non-cash expense relating to the tax 
      receivable agreement and/or other items. As such items are excluded from 
      adjusted EBITDA, the occurrence and magnitude thereof, while impacting 
      net income and the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, 
      would have no impact on adjusted EBITDA for 2017. In addition, the below 
      reconciliation assumes that the overall capital structure of the Company 
      and effective income tax rates are consistent with the structure at 
      March 31, 2017. Changes to these assumptions could significantly impact 
      our net income for 2017 and accordingly, the reconciliation of adjusted 
      EBITDA to net income, but not adjusted EBITDA itself. For additional 
      information regarding our adjusted EBITDA, refer to the related 
      explanations presented above under “Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA”.

          The net income of Hostess Holdings is allocated to owners pro rata 
          based on ownership percentage. As of March 31, 2017, the Company 
          owned approximately 98.3 million of Hostess Holdings $130.0 million 
          total partnership units. The remaining approximately 31.7 million 
          partnership units are owned by a non-controlling interest.
        



          ii.
        



          Represents the corporate income tax expense generated from the 
          Company's interest in Hostess Holdings. The non-controlling interest 
          represents an ownership interest in Hostess Holdings, which is a 
          partnership for tax purposes. We expect that the Company will make 
          tax payments between $20 million and $23 million during 2017 to 
          cover its income tax liability, while Hostess Holdings will make 
          distributions between $16 million and $19 million to the 
          non-controlling interest to reimburse its income tax liability. 
          Additionally, we expect that the payment due to the selling 
          equityholders of Hostess Holdings for 2017 activity under the terms 
          of the tax receivable agreement will be between $13 million and $15 
          million. This payment is expected to be made in 2018. Neither the 
          non-controlling interest tax distributions nor the tax receivable 
          agreement payment are included in the income tax provision.
        



          iii.
        



          Represents amounts associated with the March 2017 issuance of stock 
          options, restricted stock units, or performance share units and 
          restricted stock to employees of the Company.
        



          iv.
        



          Other expenses primarily consists of professional fees incurred for 
          the secondary offering of common stock which closed on April 19, 
          2017. Proceeds from the offering were not received by the Company.
        



          v.
        



          Weighted-average basic common shares outstanding for 2017 includes 
          98,250,917 Class A common shares outstanding as of March 31, 2017 
          and the annualized impact of the conversion of 600,000 Class B 
          common shares to Class A common shares on April 19, 2017.
        



          vi.
        



          Reflects the dilutive impact of 7.9 million Class A common shares 
          due to outstanding warrants (based on a range of 7.2 million to 8.5 
          million) and 0.2 million Class A common shares due to outstanding 
          unvested equity awards to employees (based on a range of 0.1 million 
          to 0.3 million).

Hostess Brands, Inc. is a bakery company formed in June 2013. It owns several bakeries in the United States that produce snack cakes under the Hostess and Dolly Madison brand names. It is headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri and is 50% owned by HB Holdings, LLC, a venture set up by Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company.[1]
The company is separate from Old HB, which was formerly known as Hostess Brands, Inc. from 2009 to 2013. Old HB is currently under liquidation and sold its cake business to Apollo and Metropoulos creating the current Hostess Brands. The current Hostess Brands was formed as New HB Acquisition, LLC to acquire the cake business (Hostess and Dolly Madison brands) of Hostess Brands, Inc. Following the conclusion of the sale, Hostess Brands, Inc. became Old HB, Inc. and New HB Acquisition became Hostess Brands, LLC.[2]
In June 2013, Hostess Brands retained the same public relations and advertising firms that had previously worked for Old HB. Bernstein-Rein in Kansas City, Missouri' will do Hostess Brands' advertising; LAK Public Relations in New York will handle its public relations for the return of Hostess products.[3]
The company officially restarted production of snack cakes on June 6, 2013, with products officially going on sale on July 15, 2013.[1]
Of the eleven bakeries operated by Old HB, Hostess Brands retained four, in Columbus, Georgia; Emporia, Kansas; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Schiller Park, Illinois.[4] The Schiller Park facility later closed, in October 2014.[5][6]
In the summer of 2015, Hostess began producing Hostess brand bread and buns. The company, which previously owned Wonder Bread, never produced bread under its own brand name. The new Hostess bread items are carried at certain drug stores and dollar stores.[7]
In July 2016, Hostess announced it would be going public in an offering valuing the company at $2.3 billion.[8] The deal would see Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company become minority owners, with The Gores Group taking a majority ownership position in the firm.[9]
Instead of making an initial public offering, Gores acquired Hostess via a spin-off, Gores Holdings, under a special-purpose acquisition company process.[10] Gores Holdings subsequently renamed itself Hostess Brands, changing its ticker symbol from GRSH to TWNK, after the Twinkie brand snack cake.[11][12]
In February 2017, Hostess released three new ice cream flavors inspired by Twinkies, Sno Balls, and CupCakes. The Twinkies flavor is made of buttercream ice cream base, sponge cake pieces and a vanilla frosting swirl. The SnoBalls flavor is made of cream-filled cakes with marshmallow and coconut frosting. The CupCake flavor is made of cream-filled cake with the famous squiggly line. Hostess ice cream is produced with Nestle, available in Dollar General stores and convenience stores. Hostess ice creams are only in stores for a limited run through May.[13]

Old HB,[2] known as Hostess Brands from 2009 to 2013 and established in 1930 as Interstate Bakeries Corporation, was a wholesale baker and distributor of bakery products in the United States.[3] Before its 2012 closure and liquidation, it owned the Hostess, Wonder Bread, Nature's Pride, Dolly Madison, Butternut Breads, and Drake's brands.
For many years the company was based at 12 East Armour Boulevard, Kansas City, Missouri. In 2009, after it emerged from a 2004 bankruptcy, its name was changed to Hostess Brands and its headquarters moved to Irving, Texas.[4] Hostess Brands sought bankruptcy protection again in January 2012.[5]
On November 16, 2012, the company filed a motion in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in White Plains to close its business and sell its assets. On November 21, the motion was accepted[6] and a judge agreed to sell the Hostess brands.[7][8] The Hostess and Dolly Madison brands are now produced by Kansas City, Missouri-based Hostess Brands.

History[edit]

Interstate Bakeries and Interstate Brands[edit]
The company has its roots in Nafziger Bakeries, founded by Ralph Leroy Nafziger in a church basement at 6th and Prospect Avenue in Kansas City in 1905. Nafziger expanded the bakeries and bought out competitors. In 1925 he sold Nafziger to Purity Bakeries[9] (which became American Bakeries) and acquired a controlling interest in Schulze Baking Company and its Butternut Bread brand.[10]
In 1930 Nafziger announced the formation of the Interstate Bakeries Corporation (IBC) with the merger of Schulze Bakery and the seven bakers of Western Bakeries of Los Angeles to become the fifth largest baker in the United States.[11][12] The company sold Butternut bread, wrapped in gingham, to grocery stores.[10]
Schulze and Western continued to operate separately under the Interstate umbrella until 1937, when they merged with Interstate Bakeries.[13][14] In 1943 Interstate acquired the Supreme Baking Company of Los Angeles, and in 1950 it bought the O'Rourke Baking Company of Buffalo, New York.




Butter-Nut bread package, 1930-1945


Acquisitions during the 1950s and early 1960s included the Ambrosia, Remar, Butter Cream, Campbell-Sell and Schall Tasty baking companies, the Kingston Cake and Cobb's Sunlit bakeries, Sweetheart Bread Company and Hart's Bakeries.[14] In the late 1960s IBC acquired Millbrook Bread, Shawano Farms and the Baker and Shawano canning companies.[14] In 1969 IBC changed its name to Interstate Brands, with its signature brands Butternut and Blue Seal breads and Dolly Madison cakes; Butternut Breads had been in business since 1902.[14]
DPF (1975)[edit]
In 1975 Interstate was acquired by the Data Processing Financial and General Corporation (DPF), a computer-leasing company that had encountered difficulties during the IBM antitrust battles which changed the pricing of IBM hardware. To change its business model, DPF used its cash to buy a low-tech company. The merged company, headquartered in Hartsdale, New York, kept the DPF acronym while continuing to divest its remaining technology assets. Investing heavily in its plants, it acquired the Silver Loaf Baking Company, Eddy Bakeries and Mrs. Cubbison's Foods.[14]
Interstate Bakeries and IBC Holdings[edit]
In 1981 DPF completed the sale of its remaining computer systems and changed the company name back to the original Interstate Bakeries, moving its headquarters back to Kansas City.[14] In 1986 Interstate acquired Purity Baking Company and Stewart Sandwiches, followed in 1987 by Landshire Food Products.[14] The following year Interstate became a privately held company, and its name changed to IBC Holdings. IBC bought the Merita-Cotton's Bakeries division of the American Bakeries Company.[14] In 1991, IBC again became a public company and changed its name back to Interstate Bakeries.[14]
Continental Baking merger (1995)[edit]
In January 1995, Interstate acquired the Continental Baking Company from Ralston Purina for $330 million and 16.9 million shares of Interstate stock. Continental had acquired Taggart Bakeries of Indianapolis in 1925,[15] and the deal brought Taggart's creations (including Wonder Bread and the Hostess brand) to Interstate. Taggart had created Hostess in 1921, and the brand focused on cakes like Twinkies, CupCakes, Ding Dongs and Ho Hos (created during Continental's ownership).[16] At this time, the merged company also bought the San Francisco French Bread Company, John J. Nissen Baking Company, Drake's and My Bread Company.[14]
With the merger, Interstate held two national bread divisions: Butternut and Wonder Bread. The divisions had different cultures: Butternut was unregimented, with each bakery a self-contained profit center, and Wonder Bread was structured; this caused early problems. In both divisions, snack cakes were more profitable due to economy of scale and logistics. When extended-shelf-life enzymes were developed for bread, it was hoped to convert small, less-efficient bakeries into a network of large bakeries like their snack-cakes operations. The new enzymes gave the bread a different taste and texture,[17] and market forces reduced prices and sales.
Bankruptcy (2004)[edit]
On September 22, 2004, Interstate Bakeries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company named a new chief executive, Tony Alvarez. Interstate Bakery's stock, which had been $34 per share, fell to $2.05 with the bankruptcy. During the bankruptcy proceedings (at the time, the longest-running in U.S. history), Interstate fought a 2007 bid from Mexican baker Grupo Bimbo and Ron Burkle of the Yucaipa Companies.[18]
Under Craig Jung, Interstate Bakeries emerged from bankruptcy as a private company on February 3, 2009.[19] The plan included a 50-percent equity stake by Ripplewood Holdings and credit lines from General Electric Capital and GE Capital Markets, Silver Point Finance and Monarch Master Funding. Interstate's unionized workers made contract concessions in exchange for equity in the company.[20]
During the 2004–2009 bankruptcy period Interstate closed nine of its 54 bakeries and more than 300 outlet stores, and its workforce declined from 32,000 to 22,000. The company dropped regional brands and operating agreements, such as an agreement to produce Sunbeam Bread for the northeastern U.S.[20]
Hostess Brands (2009)[edit]
On November 2, 2009, IBC became Hostess Brands, named for its Twinkies-and-cupcakes cake division. Hostess Brands continued its bread lines, including Wonder Bread.[21] The company's subsidiaries, such as Interstate Brands Corporation and IBC Sales Corporation, continued displaying their name and logo on Hostess Brands products.
Bankruptcy and liquidation[edit]
In December 2011, it was reported that Hostess Brands was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy a second time. The company stopped paying future pension benefits after August, breaking its union contracts.[22] According to a Hostess employee, "We understand that, should we pursue some form of legal action to require the company to live up to the terms of the contract, they may close, but we have come to believe that they will close anyway. We believe the company is poorly managed and the only hope is a complete change in management".[22]
On January 10, 2012, Hostess Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time. In its filing, the company said it "is not competitive, primarily due to legacy pension and medical benefit obligations and restrictive work rules". According to Hostess, it employed 19,000 people and was more than $860 million in debt. The company said it would continue to operate with $75 million of debtor-in-possession financing from Monarch Alternative Capital, Silver Point Capital and other investors.[5]
In March Brian Driscoll resigned as CEO[23] and was replaced by Gregory F. Rayburn, who had been hired as chief restructuring officer nine days earlier. Fortune reported that unions in the company were unhappy with Driscoll's proposed compensation package of $1.5 million, plus cash incentives and $1.95 million in long-term compensation. The court had discovered that Hostess executives received raises of up to 80 percent the previous year. Rayburn cut the salaries of the four top Hostess executives to $1, to be restored by January 1 of the following year or earlier.[24]
In July 2012, the New York Post reported that negotiations with the Teamsters Union, led by Silver Point Capital, were close to an agreement allowing Hostess Brands to cut employee pay and benefits if the company continued funding its pension plans.[25] In May, as required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the company's 19,000 workers were warned of a possible layoff. In an email to the Marysville, California Appeal-Democrat, Hostess spokesman Erik Halvorson wrote that the May notices were to alert employees to a possible sale of the company but "our goal is still to emerge from bankruptcy as a growing company with a strong future".[26] Although the layoff notices listed July 7–21 as dates, on July 5 another company spokesman told the Financial News & Daily Record that there were no immediate plans to lay off Hostess employees.[27]
In November 2012, Hostess employees nationwide went on strike. The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union (BCTGM), representing 6,600 Hostess employees, took action after a contract proposal from Hostess Brands was rejected by 92 percent of its members.[28]
On November 16, Hostess announced that it was ceasing its plant operations and laying off most of its 18,500 employees. The company said that it intended to sell off its assets (including its well-known brand names) and liquidate.[29][30] According to CEO Gregory Rayburn, "Hostess Brands will move promptly to lay off most of its 18,500-member workforce and focus on selling its assets to the highest bidders."[31][32] A BCTGM press release issued that day read in part, "When a highly-respected financial consultant, hired by Hostess, determined earlier this year that the company's business plan to exit bankruptcy was guaranteed to fail because it left the company with unsustainable debt levels, our members knew that the massive wage and benefit concessions the company was demanding would go straight to Wall Street investors and not back into the company."[33]
According to Rayburn, potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the Hostess brand.[34] On November 21, Judge Robert Drain cleared Hostess to close.[6] In approving the plan, Drain ruled against U.S. Trustee for the Southern District Tracy Hope Davis' motion to convert the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy with an appointed trustee to oversee liquidation. Davis criticized the plan's provisions, which would "'grant bonuses to insiders' and 'cherry-pick' which administrative claims get paid".[35] Drain left Rayburn in charge of the liquidation; Hostess had argued that its assets would devalue if the company had to wait for a trustee to get up to speed on the company.[36] Hostess Brands' liquidation plan was finalized by a federal bankruptcy judge on November 29.[37] In January 2013, the company asked a judge to set a March 21 deadline for workers to file back-pay claims.[38] On February 11, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in New York approved stalking horse bidders for Hostess Brands.[39][40][41][42]
The company received bids for assets from Walmart, Target, Kroger, Flowers Foods and Grupo Bimbo,[43][44][45][46] and was expected to sell its snack-cake and bread brands during 2013.[47][48][49][50] On January 8, 2013, Hostess Brands hired Hilco to sell its equipment, machinery and real estate.[51] Three days later the company announced a $390 million stalking-horse bid by Flowers Foods for six of its bread brands (including Wonder Bread),[52] and court approval was received for a February 28 auction of the brands.[53]
On January 15, 2013, Hostess Brands began searching for a stalking-horse bidder for its snack cakes;[54] four companies (Grupo Bimbo, a partnership of Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company, Hurst Capital and McKee Foods) were negotiating.[55][56][57] Two weeks later the company picked Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company as lead bidder for its snack cakes,[58][59][60][61] with the bid deadlines for all Hostess brands March 11 and 12.[62]
Buyers[edit]
It was announced on January 28, 2013 that United States Bakery was the leading bidder for Hostess' Sweetheart, Eddy's, Standish Farms and Grandma Emilie's brands and McKee Foods was the leading bidder for its Drake's brand, which included Ring Dings, Yodels and Devil Dogs.[63][64] On March 11 Apollo Global Management made the sole bid ($410 million) for the company's snack business, which included Twinkies.[65]
Hostess Brands[edit]
Further information: Hostess Brands
On June 6, 2013, the new Hostess Brands reopened the Emporia, Kansas plant.[66] Hostess announced ten days later that production would resume the following month, and on June 23 said that its brands would be back on store shelves on July 15.[67][68] although the company would sell fewer products than before, new president Rich Seban said that it might produce innovative pastries and snacks. "We can have some fun with that mixture," Seban said, suggesting that Hostess might experiment with gluten-free, higher-fiber and lower-sugar and -sodium products.[69]
Brands[edit]
Sold to Apollo and Metropoulos[edit]
In January 2013, a joint venture by Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company became the leading bidder to purchase Dolly Madison and the Hostess brand of snacks.[58] Silver Point Capital, Grupo Bimbo and Hurst Capital also placed bids for both brands.[55][56][59][70] On March 12, Apollo and Metropoulos won the bid to buy the brands from Hostess for $410 million.[71] The deal was approved by a bankruptcy court, and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company principal Daren Metropoulos announced that Hostess products would be sold again on July 15.[72]
Sold to Bimbo Bakeries USA[edit]
Bimbo Bakeries USA outbid Flowers Foods for the rights to Beefsteak on February 28, 2013,[73][74] and the deal was approved by a bankruptcy court on March 20.[75] In August, the trademarks of J. J. Nissen and the web domain jjnissenbreads.com were transferred to Bimbo Bakeries,[76] which later purchased other regional Hostess bread brands: Colombo, Cotton's, Emperor Norton, Fisherman's Wharf, Parisian and Toscana.
Sold to Flowers Foods[edit]
In January 2013 it was announced that Flowers Foods had offered to buy six of Hostess' bread brands, including Wonder Bread. The deal, initially structured at $360 million, involved 20 bakeries and 38 depots.[77] Flowers Foods won the bid to purchase five of the six bread brands (except Beefsteak, purchased by Grupo Bimbo) on February 28.[73] The deal went through a bankruptcy court in March and was completed on July 22, 2013.[78][79] The five brands are Butternut Bread, Home Pride, Merita Breads, Nature's Pride and Wonder Bread.[52]
Sold to Lewis Brothers Bakeries[edit]
The rights to the following Hostess brands were sold to Lewis Brothers Bakeries in December 2013:[80]

Bread du Jour
Continental
Countess
County Fair
D'Agostino's
Daffodil Farm
Di Carlo
Millbrook
Nancy Martin
Old World

Sold to McKee Foods[edit]
McKee Foods, owner of Hostess competitor Little Debbie, purchased the Drake's snack cakes on March 14, 2013 for $27.5 million.[64][81] After the deal passed a bankruptcy court, McKee began selling the snacks on September 23.[82]
Sold to United States Bakery[edit]
United States Bakery won the auction for four northwestern Hostess bakeries on March 15, 2013 for a reported $30.85 million,[63][83] and the deal was approved by a bankruptcy court that month. The brands were Eddy's, Grandma Emile's, Standish Farms and Sweetheart Bakery.[63] As of December 2015[update], the rights to the Baker's Inn and Dutch Hearth brands remain unsold.[84][85]

Old HB,[2] known as Hostess Brands from 2009 to 2013 and established in 1930 as Interstate Bakeries Corporation, was a wholesale baker and distributor of bakery products in the United States.[3] Before its 2012 closure and liquidation, it owned the Hostess, Wonder Bread, Nature's Pride, Dolly Madison, Butternut Breads, and Drake's brands.
For many years the company was based at 12 East Armour Boulevard, Kansas City, Missouri. In 2009, after it emerged from a 2004 bankruptcy, its name was changed to Hostess Brands and its headquarters moved to Irving, Texas.[4] Hostess Brands sought bankruptcy protection again in January 2012.[5]
On November 16, 2012, the company filed a motion in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in White Plains to close its business and sell its assets. On November 21, the motion was accepted[6] and a judge agreed to sell the Hostess brands.[7][8] The Hostess and Dolly Madison brands are now produced by Kansas City, Missouri-based Hostess Brands.

Interstate Bakeries and Interstate Brands[edit]
The company has its roots in Nafziger Bakeries, founded by Ralph Leroy Nafziger in a church basement at 6th and Prospect Avenue in Kansas City in 1905. Nafziger expanded the bakeries and bought out competitors. In 1925 he sold Nafziger to Purity Bakeries[9] (which became American Bakeries) and acquired a controlling interest in Schulze Baking Company and its Butternut Bread brand.[10]
In 1930 Nafziger announced the formation of the Interstate Bakeries Corporation (IBC) with the merger of Schulze Bakery and the seven bakers of Western Bakeries of Los Angeles to become the fifth largest baker in the United States.[11][12] The company sold Butternut bread, wrapped in gingham, to grocery stores.[10]
Schulze and Western continued to operate separately under the Interstate umbrella until 1937, when they merged with Interstate Bakeries.[13][14] In 1943 Interstate acquired the Supreme Baking Company of Los Angeles, and in 1950 it bought the O'Rourke Baking Company of Buffalo, New York.




Butter-Nut bread package, 1930-1945


Acquisitions during the 1950s and early 1960s included the Ambrosia, Remar, Butter Cream, Campbell-Sell and Schall Tasty baking companies, the Kingston Cake and Cobb's Sunlit bakeries, Sweetheart Bread Company and Hart's Bakeries.[14] In the late 1960s IBC acquired Millbrook Bread, Shawano Farms and the Baker and Shawano canning companies.[14] In 1969 IBC changed its name to Interstate Brands, with its signature brands Butternut and Blue Seal breads and Dolly Madison cakes; Butternut Breads had been in business since 1902.[14]
DPF (1975)[edit]
In 1975 Interstate was acquired by the Data Processing Financial and General Corporation (DPF), a computer-leasing company that had encountered difficulties during the IBM antitrust battles which changed the pricing of IBM hardware. To change its business model, DPF used its cash to buy a low-tech company. The merged company, headquartered in Hartsdale, New York, kept the DPF acronym while continuing to divest its remaining technology assets. Investing heavily in its plants, it acquired the Silver Loaf Baking Company, Eddy Bakeries and Mrs. Cubbison's Foods.[14]
Interstate Bakeries and IBC Holdings[edit]
In 1981 DPF completed the sale of its remaining computer systems and changed the company name back to the original Interstate Bakeries, moving its headquarters back to Kansas City.[14] In 1986 Interstate acquired Purity Baking Company and Stewart Sandwiches, followed in 1987 by Landshire Food Products.[14] The following year Interstate became a privately held company, and its name changed to IBC Holdings. IBC bought the Merita-Cotton's Bakeries division of the American Bakeries Company.[14] In 1991, IBC again became a public company and changed its name back to Interstate Bakeries.[14]
Continental Baking merger (1995)[edit]
In January 1995, Interstate acquired the Continental Baking Company from Ralston Purina for $330 million and 16.9 million shares of Interstate stock. Continental had acquired Taggart Bakeries of Indianapolis in 1925,[15] and the deal brought Taggart's creations (including Wonder Bread and the Hostess brand) to Interstate. Taggart had created Hostess in 1921, and the brand focused on cakes like Twinkies, CupCakes, Ding Dongs and Ho Hos (created during Continental's ownership).[16] At this time, the merged company also bought the San Francisco French Bread Company, John J. Nissen Baking Company, Drake's and My Bread Company.[14]
With the merger, Interstate held two national bread divisions: Butternut and Wonder Bread. The divisions had different cultures: Butternut was unregimented, with each bakery a self-contained profit center, and Wonder Bread was structured; this caused early problems. In both divisions, snack cakes were more profitable due to economy of scale and logistics. When extended-shelf-life enzymes were developed for bread, it was hoped to convert small, less-efficient bakeries into a network of large bakeries like their snack-cakes operations. The new enzymes gave the bread a different taste and texture,[17] and market forces reduced prices and sales.
Bankruptcy (2004)[edit]
On September 22, 2004, Interstate Bakeries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company named a new chief executive, Tony Alvarez. Interstate Bakery's stock, which had been $34 per share, fell to $2.05 with the bankruptcy. During the bankruptcy proceedings (at the time, the longest-running in U.S. history), Interstate fought a 2007 bid from Mexican baker Grupo Bimbo and Ron Burkle of the Yucaipa Companies.[18]
Under Craig Jung, Interstate Bakeries emerged from bankruptcy as a private company on February 3, 2009.[19] The plan included a 50-percent equity stake by Ripplewood Holdings and credit lines from General Electric Capital and GE Capital Markets, Silver Point Finance and Monarch Master Funding. Interstate's unionized workers made contract concessions in exchange for equity in the company.[20]
During the 2004–2009 bankruptcy period Interstate closed nine of its 54 bakeries and more than 300 outlet stores, and its workforce declined from 32,000 to 22,000. The company dropped regional brands and operating agreements, such as an agreement to produce Sunbeam Bread for the northeastern U.S.[20]
Hostess Brands (2009)[edit]
On November 2, 2009, IBC became Hostess Brands, named for its Twinkies-and-cupcakes cake division. Hostess Brands continued its bread lines, including Wonder Bread.[21] The company's subsidiaries, such as Interstate Brands Corporation and IBC Sales Corporation, continued displaying their name and logo on Hostess Brands products.
Bankruptcy and liquidation[edit]
In December 2011, it was reported that Hostess Brands was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy a second time. The company stopped paying future pension benefits after August, breaking its union contracts.[22] According to a Hostess employee, "We understand that, should we pursue some form of legal action to require the company to live up to the terms of the contract, they may close, but we have come to believe that they will close anyway. We believe the company is poorly managed and the only hope is a complete change in management".[22]
On January 10, 2012, Hostess Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time. In its filing, the company said it "is not competitive, primarily due to legacy pension and medical benefit obligations and restrictive work rules". According to Hostess, it employed 19,000 people and was more than $860 million in debt. The company said it would continue to operate with $75 million of debtor-in-possession financing from Monarch Alternative Capital, Silver Point Capital and other investors.[5]
In March Brian Driscoll resigned as CEO[23] and was replaced by Gregory F. Rayburn, who had been hired as chief restructuring officer nine days earlier. Fortune reported that unions in the company were unhappy with Driscoll's proposed compensation package of $1.5 million, plus cash incentives and $1.95 million in long-term compensation. The court had discovered that Hostess executives received raises of up to 80 percent the previous year. Rayburn cut the salaries of the four top Hostess executives to $1, to be restored by January 1 of the following year or earlier.[24]
In July 2012, the New York Post reported that negotiations with the Teamsters Union, led by Silver Point Capital, were close to an agreement allowing Hostess Brands to cut employee pay and benefits if the company continued funding its pension plans.[25] In May, as required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the company's 19,000 workers were warned of a possible layoff. In an email to the Marysville, California Appeal-Democrat, Hostess spokesman Erik Halvorson wrote that the May notices were to alert employees to a possible sale of the company but "our goal is still to emerge from bankruptcy as a growing company with a strong future".[26] Although the layoff notices listed July 7–21 as dates, on July 5 another company spokesman told the Financial News & Daily Record that there were no immediate plans to lay off Hostess employees.[27]
In November 2012, Hostess employees nationwide went on strike. The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union (BCTGM), representing 6,600 Hostess employees, took action after a contract proposal from Hostess Brands was rejected by 92 percent of its members.[28]
On November 16, Hostess announced that it was ceasing its plant operations and laying off most of its 18,500 employees. The company said that it intended to sell off its assets (including its well-known brand names) and liquidate.[29][30] According to CEO Gregory Rayburn, "Hostess Brands will move promptly to lay off most of its 18,500-member workforce and focus on selling its assets to the highest bidders."[31][32] A BCTGM press release issued that day read in part, "When a highly-respected financial consultant, hired by Hostess, determined earlier this year that the company's business plan to exit bankruptcy was guaranteed to fail because it left the company with unsustainable debt levels, our members knew that the massive wage and benefit concessions the company was demanding would go straight to Wall Street investors and not back into the company."[33]
According to Rayburn, potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the Hostess brand.[34] On November 21, Judge Robert Drain cleared Hostess to close.[6] In approving the plan, Drain ruled against U.S. Trustee for the Southern District Tracy Hope Davis' motion to convert the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy with an appointed trustee to oversee liquidation. Davis criticized the plan's provisions, which would "'grant bonuses to insiders' and 'cherry-pick' which administrative claims get paid".[35] Drain left Rayburn in charge of the liquidation; Hostess had argued that its assets would devalue if the company had to wait for a trustee to get up to speed on the company.[36] Hostess Brands' liquidation plan was finalized by a federal bankruptcy judge on November 29.[37] In January 2013, the company asked a judge to set a March 21 deadline for workers to file back-pay claims.[38] On February 11, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in New York approved stalking horse bidders for Hostess Brands.[39][40][41][42]
The company received bids for assets from Walmart, Target, Kroger, Flowers Foods and Grupo Bimbo,[43][44][45][46] and was expected to sell its snack-cake and bread brands during 2013.[47][48][49][50] On January 8, 2013, Hostess Brands hired Hilco to sell its equipment, machinery and real estate.[51] Three days later the company announced a $390 million stalking-horse bid by Flowers Foods for six of its bread brands (including Wonder Bread),[52] and court approval was received for a February 28 auction of the brands.[53]
On January 15, 2013, Hostess Brands began searching for a stalking-horse bidder for its snack cakes;[54] four companies (Grupo Bimbo, a partnership of Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company, Hurst Capital and McKee Foods) were negotiating.[55][56][57] Two weeks later the company picked Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company as lead bidder for its snack cakes,[58][59][60][61] with the bid deadlines for all Hostess brands March 11 and 12.[62]
Buyers[edit]
It was announced on January 28, 2013 that United States Bakery was the leading bidder for Hostess' Sweetheart, Eddy's, Standish Farms and Grandma Emilie's brands and McKee Foods was the leading bidder for its Drake's brand, which included Ring Dings, Yodels and Devil Dogs.[63][64] On March 11 Apollo Global Management made the sole bid ($410 million) for the company's snack business, which included Twinkies.[65]
Hostess Brands[edit]
Further information: Hostess Brands
On June 6, 2013, the new Hostess Brands reopened the Emporia, Kansas plant.[66] Hostess announced ten days later that production would resume the following month, and on June 23 said that its brands would be back on store shelves on July 15.[67][68] although the company would sell fewer products than before, new president Rich Seban said that it might produce innovative pastries and snacks. "We can have some fun with that mixture," Seban said, suggesting that Hostess might experiment with gluten-free, higher-fiber and lower-sugar and -sodium products.[69]
Brands[edit]
Sold to Apollo and Metropoulos[edit]
In January 2013, a joint venture by Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company became the leading bidder to purchase Dolly Madison and the Hostess brand of snacks.[58] Silver Point Capital, Grupo Bimbo and Hurst Capital also placed bids for both brands.[55][56][59][70] On March 12, Apollo and Metropoulos won the bid to buy the brands from Hostess for $410 million.[71] The deal was approved by a bankruptcy court, and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company principal Daren Metropoulos announced that Hostess products would be sold again on July 15.[72]
Sold to Bimbo Bakeries USA[edit]
Bimbo Bakeries USA outbid Flowers Foods for the rights to Beefsteak on February 28, 2013,[73][74] and the deal was approved by a bankruptcy court on March 20.[75] In August, the trademarks of J. J. Nissen and the web domain jjnissenbreads.com were transferred to Bimbo Bakeries,[76] which later purchased other regional Hostess bread brands: Colombo, Cotton's, Emperor Norton, Fisherman's Wharf, Parisian and Toscana.
Sold to Flowers Foods[edit]
In January 2013 it was announced that Flowers Foods had offered to buy six of Hostess' bread brands, including Wonder Bread. The deal, initially structured at $360 million, involved 20 bakeries and 38 depots.[77] Flowers Foods won the bid to purchase five of the six bread brands (except Beefsteak, purchased by Grupo Bimbo) on February 28.[73] The deal went through a bankruptcy court in March and was completed on July 22, 2013.[78][79] The five brands are Butternut Bread, Home Pride, Merita Breads, Nature's Pride and Wonder Bread.[52]

Sold to McKee Foods[edit]
McKee Foods, owner of Hostess competitor Little Debbie, purchased the Drake's snack cakes on March 14, 2013 for $27.5 million.[64][81] After the deal passed a bankruptcy court, McKee began selling the snacks on September 23.[82]
Sold to United States Bakery[edit]
United States Bakery won the auction for four northwestern Hostess bakeries on March 15, 2013 for a reported $30.85 million,[63][83] and the deal was approved by a bankruptcy court that month. The brands were Eddy's, Grandma Emile's, Standish Farms and Sweetheart Bakery.[63] As of December 2015[update], the rights to the Baker's Inn and Dutch Hearth brands remain unsold.[84][85]

Old HB,[2] known as Hostess Brands from 2009 to 2013 and established in 1930 as Interstate Bakeries Corporation, was a wholesale baker and distributor of bakery products in the United States.[3] Before its 2012 closure and liquidation, it owned the Hostess, Wonder Bread, Nature's Pride, Dolly Madison, Butternut Breads, and Drake's brands.
For many years the company was based at 12 East Armour Boulevard, Kansas City, Missouri. In 2009, after it emerged from a 2004 bankruptcy, its name was changed to Hostess Brands and its headquarters moved to Irving, Texas.[4] Hostess Brands sought bankruptcy protection again in January 2012.[5]
On November 16, 2012, the company filed a motion in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in White Plains to close its business and sell its assets. On November 21, the motion was accepted[6] and a judge agreed to sell the Hostess brands.[7][8] The Hostess and Dolly Madison brands are now produced by Kansas City, Missouri-based Hostess Brands.

Interstate Bakeries and Interstate Brands[edit]
The company has its roots in Nafziger Bakeries, founded by Ralph Leroy Nafziger in a church basement at 6th and Prospect Avenue in Kansas City in 1905. Nafziger expanded the bakeries and bought out competitors. In 1925 he sold Nafziger to Purity Bakeries[9] (which became American Bakeries) and acquired a controlling interest in Schulze Baking Company and its Butternut Bread brand.[10]
In 1930 Nafziger announced the formation of the Interstate Bakeries Corporation (IBC) with the merger of Schulze Bakery and the seven bakers of Western Bakeries of Los Angeles to become the fifth largest baker in the United States.[11][12] The company sold Butternut bread, wrapped in gingham, to grocery stores.[10]
Schulze and Western continued to operate separately under the Interstate umbrella until 1937, when they merged with Interstate Bakeries.[13][14] In 1943 Interstate acquired the Supreme Baking Company of Los Angeles, and in 1950 it bought the O'Rourke Baking Company of Buffalo, New York.




Butter-Nut bread package, 1930-1945


Acquisitions during the 1950s and early 1960s included the Ambrosia, Remar, Butter Cream, Campbell-Sell and Schall Tasty baking companies, the Kingston Cake and Cobb's Sunlit bakeries, Sweetheart Bread Company and Hart's Bakeries.[14] In the late 1960s IBC acquired Millbrook Bread, Shawano Farms and the Baker and Shawano canning companies.[14] In 1969 IBC changed its name to Interstate Brands, with its signature brands Butternut and Blue Seal breads and Dolly Madison cakes; Butternut Breads had been in business since 1902.[14]
DPF (1975)[edit]
In 1975 Interstate was acquired by the Data Processing Financial and General Corporation (DPF), a computer-leasing company that had encountered difficulties during the IBM antitrust battles which changed the pricing of IBM hardware. To change its business model, DPF used its cash to buy a low-tech company. The merged company, headquartered in Hartsdale, New York, kept the DPF acronym while continuing to divest its remaining technology assets. Investing heavily in its plants, it acquired the Silver Loaf Baking Company, Eddy Bakeries and Mrs. Cubbison's Foods.[14]
Interstate Bakeries and IBC Holdings[edit]
In 1981 DPF completed the sale of its remaining computer systems and changed the company name back to the original Interstate Bakeries, moving its headquarters back to Kansas City.[14] In 1986 Interstate acquired Purity Baking Company and Stewart Sandwiches, followed in 1987 by Landshire Food Products.[14] The following year Interstate became a privately held company, and its name changed to IBC Holdings. IBC bought the Merita-Cotton's Bakeries division of the American Bakeries Company.[14] In 1991, IBC again became a public company and changed its name back to Interstate Bakeries.[14]
Continental Baking merger (1995)[edit]
In January 1995, Interstate acquired the Continental Baking Company from Ralston Purina for $330 million and 16.9 million shares of Interstate stock. Continental had acquired Taggart Bakeries of Indianapolis in 1925,[15] and the deal brought Taggart's creations (including Wonder Bread and the Hostess brand) to Interstate. Taggart had created Hostess in 1921, and the brand focused on cakes like Twinkies, CupCakes, Ding Dongs and Ho Hos (created during Continental's ownership).[16] At this time, the merged company also bought the San Francisco French Bread Company, John J. Nissen Baking Company, Drake's and My Bread Company.[14]
With the merger, Interstate held two national bread divisions: Butternut and Wonder Bread. The divisions had different cultures: Butternut was unregimented, with each bakery a self-contained profit center, and Wonder Bread was structured; this caused early problems. In both divisions, snack cakes were more profitable due to economy of scale and logistics. When extended-shelf-life enzymes were developed for bread, it was hoped to convert small, less-efficient bakeries into a network of large bakeries like their snack-cakes operations. The new enzymes gave the bread a different taste and texture,[17] and market forces reduced prices and sales.
Bankruptcy (2004)[edit]
On September 22, 2004, Interstate Bakeries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company named a new chief executive, Tony Alvarez. Interstate Bakery's stock, which had been $34 per share, fell to $2.05 with the bankruptcy. During the bankruptcy proceedings (at the time, the longest-running in U.S. history), Interstate fought a 2007 bid from Mexican baker Grupo Bimbo and Ron Burkle of the Yucaipa Companies.[18]
Under Craig Jung, Interstate Bakeries emerged from bankruptcy as a private company on February 3, 2009.[19] The plan included a 50-percent equity stake by Ripplewood Holdings and credit lines from General Electric Capital and GE Capital Markets, Silver Point Finance and Monarch Master Funding. Interstate's unionized workers made contract concessions in exchange for equity in the company.[20]
During the 2004–2009 bankruptcy period Interstate closed nine of its 54 bakeries and more than 300 outlet stores, and its workforce declined from 32,000 to 22,000. The company dropped regional brands and operating agreements, such as an agreement to produce Sunbeam Bread for the northeastern U.S.[20]
Hostess Brands (2009)[edit]
On November 2, 2009, IBC became Hostess Brands, named for its Twinkies-and-cupcakes cake division. Hostess Brands continued its bread lines, including Wonder Bread.[21] The company's subsidiaries, such as Interstate Brands Corporation and IBC Sales Corporation, continued displaying their name and logo on Hostess Brands products.
Bankruptcy and liquidation[edit]
In December 2011, it was reported that Hostess Brands was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy a second time. The company stopped paying future pension benefits after August, breaking its union contracts.[22] According to a Hostess employee, "We understand that, should we pursue some form of legal action to require the company to live up to the terms of the contract, they may close, but we have come to believe that they will close anyway. We believe the company is poorly managed and the only hope is a complete change in management".[22]
On January 10, 2012, Hostess Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time. In its filing, the company said it "is not competitive, primarily due to legacy pension and medical benefit obligations and restrictive work rules". According to Hostess, it employed 19,000 people and was more than $860 million in debt. The company said it would continue to operate with $75 million of debtor-in-possession financing from Monarch Alternative Capital, Silver Point Capital and other investors.[5]
In March Brian Driscoll resigned as CEO[23] and was replaced by Gregory F. Rayburn, who had been hired as chief restructuring officer nine days earlier. Fortune reported that unions in the company were unhappy with Driscoll's proposed compensation package of $1.5 million, plus cash incentives and $1.95 million in long-term compensation. The court had discovered that Hostess executives received raises of up to 80 percent the previous year. Rayburn cut the salaries of the four top Hostess executives to $1, to be restored by January 1 of the following year or earlier.[24]
In July 2012, the New York Post reported that negotiations with the Teamsters Union, led by Silver Point Capital, were close to an agreement allowing Hostess Brands to cut employee pay and benefits if the company continued funding its pension plans.[25] In May, as required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the company's 19,000 workers were warned of a possible layoff. In an email to the Marysville, California Appeal-Democrat, Hostess spokesman Erik Halvorson wrote that the May notices were to alert employees to a possible sale of the company but "our goal is still to emerge from bankruptcy as a growing company with a strong future".[26] Although the layoff notices listed July 7–21 as dates, on July 5 another company spokesman told the Financial News & Daily Record that there were no immediate plans to lay off Hostess employees.[27]
In November 2012, Hostess employees nationwide went on strike. The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union (BCTGM), representing 6,600 Hostess employees, took action after a contract proposal from Hostess Brands was rejected by 92 percent of its members.[28]
On November 16, Hostess announced that it was ceasing its plant operations and laying off most of its 18,500 employees. The company said that it intended to sell off its assets (including its well-known brand names) and liquidate.[29][30] According to CEO Gregory Rayburn, "Hostess Brands will move promptly to lay off most of its 18,500-member workforce and focus on selling its assets to the highest bidders."[31][32] A BCTGM press release issued that day read in part, "When a highly-respected financial consultant, hired by Hostess, determined earlier this year that the company's business plan to exit bankruptcy was guaranteed to fail because it left the company with unsustainable debt levels, our members knew that the massive wage and benefit concessions the company was demanding would go straight to Wall Street investors and not back into the company."[33]
According to Rayburn, potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the Hostess brand.[34] On November 21, Judge Robert Drain cleared Hostess to close.[6] In approving the plan, Drain ruled against U.S. Trustee for the Southern District Tracy Hope Davis' motion to convert the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy with an appointed trustee to oversee liquidation. Davis criticized the plan's provisions, which would "'grant bonuses to insiders' and 'cherry-pick' which administrative claims get paid".[35] Drain left Rayburn in charge of the liquidation; Hostess had argued that its assets would devalue if the company had to wait for a trustee to get up to speed on the company.[36] Hostess Brands' liquidation plan was finalized by a federal bankruptcy judge on November 29.[37] In January 2013, the company asked a judge to set a March 21 deadline for workers to file back-pay claims.[38] On February 11, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in New York approved stalking horse bidders for Hostess Brands.[39][40][41][42]
The company received bids for assets from Walmart, Target, Kroger, Flowers Foods and Grupo Bimbo,[43][44][45][46] and was expected to sell its snack-cake and bread brands during 2013.[47][48][49][50] On January 8, 2013, Hostess Brands hired Hilco to sell its equipment, machinery and real estate.[51] Three days later the company announced a $390 million stalking-horse bid by Flowers Foods for six of its bread brands (including Wonder Bread),[52] and court approval was received for a February 28 auction of the brands.[53]
On January 15, 2013, Hostess Brands began searching for a stalking-horse bidder for its snack cakes;[54] four companies (Grupo Bimbo, a partnership of Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company, Hurst Capital and McKee Foods) were negotiating.[55][56][57] Two weeks later the company picked Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company as lead bidder for its snack cakes,[58][59][60][61] with the bid deadlines for all Hostess brands March 11 and 12.[62]
Buyers[edit]
It was announced on January 28, 2013 that United States Bakery was the leading bidder for Hostess' Sweetheart, Eddy's, Standish Farms and Grandma Emilie's brands and McKee Foods was the leading bidder for its Drake's brand, which included Ring Dings, Yodels and Devil Dogs.[63][64] On March 11 Apollo Global Management made the sole bid ($410 million) for the company's snack business, which included Twinkies.[65]

On June 6, 2013, the new Hostess Brands reopened the Emporia, Kansas plant.[66] Hostess announced ten days later that production would resume the following month, and on June 23 said that its brands would be back on store shelves on July 15.[67][68] although the company would sell fewer products than before, new president Rich Seban said that it might produce innovative pastries and snacks. "We can have some fun with that mixture," Seban said, suggesting that Hostess might experiment with gluten-free, higher-fiber and lower-sugar and -sodium products.[69]
Brands[edit]
Sold to Apollo and Metropoulos[edit]
In January 2013, a joint venture by Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company became the leading bidder to purchase Dolly Madison and the Hostess brand of snacks.[58] Silver Point Capital, Grupo Bimbo and Hurst Capital also placed bids for both brands.[55][56][59][70] On March 12, Apollo and Metropoulos won the bid to buy the brands from Hostess for $410 million.[71] The deal was approved by a bankruptcy court, and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company principal Daren Metropoulos announced that Hostess products would be sold again on July 15.[72]
Sold to Bimbo Bakeries USA[edit]
Bimbo Bakeries USA outbid Flowers Foods for the rights to Beefsteak on February 28, 2013,[73][74] and the deal was approved by a bankruptcy court on March 20.[75] In August, the trademarks of J. J. Nissen and the web domain jjnissenbreads.com were transferred to Bimbo Bakeries,[76] which later purchased other regional Hostess bread brands: Colombo, Cotton's, Emperor Norton, Fisherman's Wharf, Parisian and Toscana.
Sold to Flowers Foods[edit]
In January 2013 it was announced that Flowers Foods had offered to buy six of Hostess' bread brands, including Wonder Bread. The deal, initially structured at $360 million, involved 20 bakeries and 38 depots.[77] Flowers Foods won the bid to purchase five of the six bread brands (except Beefsteak, purchased by Grupo Bimbo) on February 28.[73] The deal went through a bankruptcy court in March and was completed on July 22, 2013.[78][79] The five brands are Butternut Bread, Home Pride, Merita Breads, Nature's Pride and Wonder Bread.[52]

Sold to McKee Foods[edit]
McKee Foods, owner of Hostess competitor Little Debbie, purchased the Drake's snack cakes on March 14, 2013 for $27.5 million.[64][81] After the deal passed a bankruptcy court, McKee began selling the snacks on September 23.[82]
Sold to United States Bakery[edit]
United States Bakery won the auction for four northwestern Hostess bakeries on March 15, 2013 for a reported $30.85 million,[63][83] and the deal was approved by a bankruptcy court that month. The brands were Eddy's, Grandma Emile's, Standish Farms and Sweetheart Bakery.[63] As of December 2015[update], the rights to the Baker's Inn and Dutch Hearth brands remain unsold.[84][85]

Hostess Brands, Inc. is a bakery company formed in June 2013. It owns several bakeries in the United States that produce snack cakes under the Hostess and Dolly Madison brand names. It is headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri and is 50% owned by HB Holdings, LLC, a venture set up by Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company.[1]
The company is separate from Old HB, which was formerly known as Hostess Brands, Inc. from 2009 to 2013. Old HB is currently under liquidation and sold its cake business to Apollo and Metropoulos creating the current Hostess Brands. The current Hostess Brands was formed as New HB Acquisition, LLC to acquire the cake business (Hostess and Dolly Madison brands) of Hostess Brands, Inc. Following the conclusion of the sale, Hostess Brands, Inc. became Old HB, Inc. and New HB Acquisition became Hostess Brands, LLC.[2]
In June 2013, Hostess Brands retained the same public relations and advertising firms that had previously worked for Old HB. Bernstein-Rein in Kansas City, Missouri' will do Hostess Brands' advertising; LAK Public Relations in New York will handle its public relations for the return of Hostess products.[3]
The company officially restarted production of snack cakes on June 6, 2013, with products officially going on sale on July 15, 2013.[1]
Of the eleven bakeries operated by Old HB, Hostess Brands retained four, in Columbus, Georgia; Emporia, Kansas; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Schiller Park, Illinois.[4] The Schiller Park facility later closed, in October 2014.[5][6]
In the summer of 2015, Hostess began producing Hostess brand bread and buns. The company, which previously owned Wonder Bread, never produced bread under its own brand name. The new Hostess bread items are carried at certain drug stores and dollar stores.[7]
In July 2016, Hostess announced it would be going public in an offering valuing the company at $2.3 billion.[8] The deal would see Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company become minority owners, with The Gores Group taking a majority ownership position in the firm.[9]
Instead of making an initial public offering, Gores acquired Hostess via a spin-off, Gores Holdings, under a special-purpose acquisition company process.[10] Gores Holdings subsequently renamed itself Hostess Brands, changing its ticker symbol from GRSH to TWNK, after the Twinkie brand snack cake.[11][12]
In February 2017, Hostess released three new ice cream flavors inspired by Twinkies, Sno Balls, and CupCakes. The Twinkies flavor is made of buttercream ice cream base, sponge cake pieces and a vanilla frosting swirl. The SnoBalls flavor is made of cream-filled cakes with marshmallow and coconut frosting. The CupCake flavor is made of cream-filled cake with the famous squiggly line. Hostess ice cream is produced with Nestle, available in Dollar General stores and convenience stores. Hostess ice creams are only in stores for a limited run through May.[13]

Hostess Brands, Inc. is a bakery company formed in June 2013. It owns several bakeries in the United States that produce snack cakes under the Hostess and Dolly Madison brand names. It is headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri and is 50% owned by HB Holdings, LLC, a venture set up by Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company.[1]
The company is separate from Old HB, which was formerly known as Hostess Brands, Inc. from 2009 to 2013. Old HB is currently under liquidation and sold its cake business to Apollo and Metropoulos creating the current Hostess Brands. The current Hostess Brands was formed as New HB Acquisition, LLC to acquire the cake business (Hostess and Dolly Madison brands) of Hostess Brands, Inc. Following the conclusion of the sale, Hostess Brands, Inc. became Old HB, Inc. and New HB Acquisition became Hostess Brands, LLC.[2]
In June 2013, Hostess Brands retained the same public relations and advertising firms that had previously worked for Old HB. Bernstein-Rein in Kansas City, Missouri' will do Hostess Brands' advertising; LAK Public Relations in New York will handle its public relations for the return of Hostess products.[3]
The company officially restarted production of snack cakes on June 6, 2013, with products officially going on sale on July 15, 2013.[1]
Of the eleven bakeries operated by Old HB, Hostess Brands retained four, in Columbus, Georgia; Emporia, Kansas; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Schiller Park, Illinois.[4] The Schiller Park facility later closed, in October 2014.[5][6]
In the summer of 2015, Hostess began producing Hostess brand bread and buns. The company, which previously owned Wonder Bread, never produced bread under its own brand name. The new Hostess bread items are carried at certain drug stores and dollar stores.[7]
In July 2016, Hostess announced it would be going public in an offering valuing the company at $2.3 billion.[8] The deal would see Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company become minority owners, with The Gores Group taking a majority ownership position in the firm.[9]
Instead of making an initial public offering, Gores acquired Hostess via a spin-off, Gores Holdings, under a special-purpose acquisition company process.[10] Gores Holdings subsequently renamed itself Hostess Brands, changing its ticker symbol from GRSH to TWNK, after the Twinkie brand snack cake.[11][12]
In February 2017, Hostess released three new ice cream flavors inspired by Twinkies, Sno Balls, and CupCakes. The Twinkies flavor is made of buttercream ice cream base, sponge cake pieces and a vanilla frosting swirl. The SnoBalls flavor is made of cream-filled cakes with marshmallow and coconut frosting. The CupCake flavor is made of cream-filled cake with the famous squiggly line. Hostess ice cream is produced with Nestle, available in Dollar General stores and convenience stores. Hostess ice creams are only in stores for a limited run through May.[13]

Announces First Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsBusiness WireMay 9, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareKANSAS CITY, Mo--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hostess Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ: TWNK, TWNKW) (the “Company”), a leading manufacturer and marketer in the United States of sweet baked goods, including Hostess®, Twinkies®, Ding Dongs®, Ho Hos®, Donettes® and a variety of other new and classic treats, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.Hostess® is the second leading brand by market share within the Sweet Baked Goods ("SBG") category. For the 52-week period ended March 25, 2017 the Company's market share was 17% per Nielsen’s U.S. SBG category data. The Company has a #1 leading market position within the two largest SBG Segments: Donut Segment and Snack Cake Segment, and have a #2 leading market position in total Sweet Baked Goods, according to Nielsen U.S. total universe for the 52 weeks ended March 25, 2017. The Donut and Snack Cake Segments together account for 49% of the Sweet Baked Goods category's total dollar sales.The Company's results include those of Superior Cake Products, Inc. ("Superior"), which was acquired by the Company on May 10, 2016. Through Superior, the Company competes in the in-store bakery section of retailers.On November 4, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Hostess Holdings, L.P. ("Hostess Holdings") and changed its name from Gores Holdings, Inc. to Hostess Brands, Inc. (the "Business Combination"). As a result, the Company's consolidated financial results are presented: (i) as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (Successor); (ii) for the three months ended March 31, 2017 (Successor); and (iii) for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (Predecessor).The Company has also presented supplemental unaudited pro forma financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2016, giving effect to the Business Combination as if it had occurred on January 1, 2016. All references in this press release to results for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, refer to such unaudited pro forma results. The Company believes this pro forma information provides helpful supplemental information with respect to the performance of the Hostess business during this period.The Company also has supplemented its discussion with a presentation of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the schedules in this press release for explanations and reconciliations of this and other non-GAAP financial measures.First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights Net revenue for the first quarter 2017 increased 15.2%, or $24.3 million from pro forma first quarter of 2016 (net revenue increased 9.1%, excluding revenue from the Company's In-Store Bakery segment)  Net income for the first quarter 2017 was $24.2 million, an increase of $11.9 million, compared to $12.3 million for the pro forma first quarter of 2016  EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.15 per share  Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.3%, or $6.4 million, to $54.5 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $48.1 million for the pro forma first quarter of 2016 “We are pleased with our strong start to the year and continued ability to gain market share,” commented Bill Toler, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Our 2017 new product initiatives and our holiday and seasonal programs provided solid growth in the first quarter and we are optimistic about their potential for the year."First Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsNet revenue was $184.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $24.3 million, or 15.2%, compared to pro forma net revenue of $160.2 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to $9.7 million of revenue from In-Store Bakery; the initial launch of the Company's 2017 new product initiatives, including Chocolate Cake Twinkies®, Golden Cupcakes, and White Fudge Ding Dongs®, among others; continued growth from the Company's 2016 new product initiatives; and increased distribution.Gross profit was $79.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $9.2 million, or 13.2%, compared to pro forma gross profit of $70.1 million for the first quarter of 2016, driven by the increase in revenue.Gross margin was 43.0% for the first quarter of 2017, compared to 43.7% for the pro forma first quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product mix to include the Company's In-Store Bakery segment.Advertising, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $28.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, or 15.5% of net revenue, compared to $23.6 million, or 14.7% of net revenue, for the pro forma first quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to increased professional service expenses, the addition of Superior's operations, increased non-cash share based compensation and increased brokerage costs.Read MoreThe effective tax rate was 29.2% for the first quarter of 2017, giving effect to the non-controlling interest which represents an ownership interest in a partnership for income tax purposes. The pro forma first quarter 2016 effective tax rate was 28.5%. The increase in the effective tax rate is attributed to the acquisition of Superior.Net income was $24.2 million, or $0.15 per share, for the first quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $12.3 million, or $0.08 per share, for the pro forma first quarter of 2016. The increase in net income was primarily attributed to revenue and gross profit growth. Other factors causing the increase in net income included the $7.3 million impairment loss recognized during the first quarter of 2016 and a decrease in first quarter 2017 interest expense. Net income of $15.8 million was allocated to Class A common stockholders for the first quarter of 2017, while the remaining $8.4 million was allocated to the non-controlling interest.Adjusted EBITDA was $54.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $6.4 million, or 13.3%, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $48.1 million for the pro forma first quarter of 2016. As a percentage of net revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 29.5% for the first quarter of 2017, compared to 30.0% in the same period last year. The decrease is primarily due to a shift in product mix to include the Company's In-Store Bakery segment. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the schedules in this press release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.First Quarter 2017 Segment ResultsThe Company has two reportable segments: Sweet Baked Goods and Other. The Sweet Baked Goods segment consists of sweet baked goods and the Other segment consists of branded bread and buns, in-store bakery products, frozen retail and licensing.Sweet Baked Goods Segment: Net revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $168.4 million, an increase of $13.7 million, or 8.9%, compared to pro forma net revenue of $154.7 million for the pro forma first quarter of 2016. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 was $74.9 million, or 44.5% of net revenue, compared to gross profit of $68.1 million, or 44.0% of net revenue, for the pro forma first quarter of 2016. Gross margin increases were due to favorable commodity pricing.Other Segment: Net revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $16.1 million, an increase of $10.6 million, or 193.4%, compared to net revenue of $5.5 million for the pro forma first quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily due to the impact of the Superior acquisition completed May 10, 2016. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 was $4.4 million, or 27.4% of net revenue, compared to gross profit of $1.9 million, or 35.2% of net revenue for the pro forma first quarter of 2016.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of March 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $45.7 million and approximately $97.2 million available for borrowing, net of letters of credit, under its revolving line of credit. The Company had outstanding term loan debt of $996.3 million and net debt of $950.6 million as of March 31, 2017, resulting in a total pro forma combined leverage ratio of 4.29x based on pro forma combined adjusted EBITDA of $221.7 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017. (See the schedules in the press release for the calculation of the pro forma combined leverage ratio and a reconciliation of pro forma combined adjusted EBITDA to pro forma combined net income of $94.4 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017.)OutlookThe Company expects to continue to grow above the sweet baked goods category in 2017. The Company reaffirms anticipated net revenue of $781 million and adjusted EBITDA of $235 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. (See the schedules in the press release for a reconciliation of anticipated 2017 adjusted EBITDA to anticipated net income of $98 million for 2017)Based upon the Company's anticipated net income of $98 million for 2017, $33 million is expected to be allocated to the non-controlling interest based on the current ownership percentage in Hostess Holdings. The remaining $65 million allocated to Class A Common stockholders is expected to result in $0.66 basic earnings per share and $0.61 diluted earnings per share for the full year based on expected basic and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 98.7 million and 106.8 million, respectively.Income tax related payments to be made by the Company relating to 2017 activity include: (i) tax payments between $20 million and $23 million during 2017 to cover the Company's current federal and state income tax liabilities, (ii) between $16 million and $19 million of distributions to the holders of the non-controlling interest to reimburse their income tax liability, and (iii) between $13 million and $15 million of payments to the selling equityholders of Hostess Holdings for 2017 activity under the terms of the tax receivable agreement. The tax receivable agreement payment is expected to be made in 2018.The Company believes that it is well positioned to grow and enhance shareholder value through the execution of its strategic initiatives. These key strategic initiatives are focused on further core distribution expansion, continued new product initiatives and line extensions, the pursuit of white space opportunities and serving as a platform for future acquisitions.Conference Call and WebcastThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today, May 9, 2017 at 4:30 pm EDT to discuss the results for the first quarter.Investors interested in participating in the live call can dial 877-451-6152 from the U.S. and 201-389-0879 internationally.

The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and upon assumptions that our management believes are reasonable in order to reflect, on a pro forma basis, the impact of these transactions on the historical financial information of our Predecessor entity.On November 4, 2016 (the “Closing Date”), in a transaction referred to as the “Business Combination,” the Company, then known as Gores Holdings, Inc. acquired a controlling interest in Hostess Holdings, L.P. (“Hostess Holdings”), an entity owned indirectly by C. Dean Metropoulos and certain equity funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (the “Apollo Funds”). Hostess Holdings had acquired the Hostess brand and certain strategic assets out of the bankruptcy liquidation proceedings of its prior owner (“Old Hostess”), free and clear of all past liabilities, in April 2013, and relaunched the Hostess brand later that year.The Business Combination was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The initial estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as of the Closing Date, which are based on the consideration paid and estimates and our assumptions, are reflected herein. The total purchase price of approximately $2.4 billion to acquire Hostess Holdings, has been allocated to the assets acquired and assumed liabilities of Hostess Holdings based upon estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Third party valuation specialists conducted analyses in order to assist our management in determining the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed. The Company has estimated the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is included for informational purposes only and does not purport to reflect the results of operations of Hostess Brands, Inc. that would have occurred had the Business Combination occurred as of January 1, 2016.The unaudited pro forma financial information contains a variety of adjustments, assumptions and estimates, is subject to numerous other uncertainties and the assumptions and adjustments as described in the accompanying notes hereto and should not be relied upon as being indicative of our results of operations had the Business Combination occurred on January 1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma financial information also does not project our results of operations for any future period or date. The acquisition of Superior Cake Products, Inc. (“Superior”) occurred in May 2016. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2016 does not include the results of the Superior acquisition and its related operations. We evaluated the impact of the Superior acquisition on the Company’s financial statements and concluded that the impact was not significant and did not require nor separately warrant the inclusion of pro forma financial results assuming the acquisition of Superior at January 1, 2016 under applicable SEC rules and regulations or under GAAP.On November 18, 2016, we refinanced our first and second lien term loans (the “Former First and Second Lien Term Loans”) into one new first lien term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $998.8 million and with a maturity date of August 3, 2022 (the “New First Lien Term Loan”). We evaluated the impact of the refinancing of existing debt pursuant to the New First Lien Term Loan, completed on November 18, 2016, and concluded that the impact was not significant and did not require nor separately warrant the inclusion of pro forma financial results assuming the completion of the refinancing on January 1, 2016.The pro forma adjustments give effect to the items identified in the pro forma table below in connection with the Business Combination.

Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company has included adjusted EBITDA because it believes it provides management and investors with additional information to measure the Company's performance and liquidity, estimate the Company's value and evaluate the Company's ability to service debt.We define adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted to exclude (i) interest expense, net, (ii) depreciation and amortization and (iii) income taxes and (iv) as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance. These further adjustments are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons the Company considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments set forth below. The Company's presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. For example, adjusted EBITDA: does not reflect the Company's capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;  does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs;  does not reflect the significant interest expenses, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company's debt;  does not reflect any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; and  does not reflect payments related to income taxes, the tax receivable agreement or distributions to the non-controlling interest to reimburse its tax liability. The Company's presentation of adjusted EBITDA does not exclude the normal annual cash payments associated with its employment agreement with Mr. Metropoulos as the Chief Executive Officer and/or Executive Chairman. These amounts were $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Following completion of the Business Combination, these expenses will be approximately $0.1 million quarterly.

Equity Incentive Plan.     ii.     For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded expense of $0.7 million which primarily consisted of legal and professional fees related to a secondary offering of common stock which closed in April 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, other expense of $1.3 million consisted of transaction costs attributable to the pursuit of a potential acquisition that has since been abandoned.     iii.     For the pro forma three months ended March 31, 2016, we closed multiple production lines at the Indianapolis, Indiana bakery and transitioned production to other facilities resulting in a loss of $7.3 million.     iv.     For the three months ended March 31, 2016, we incurred a loss on a sale/abandonment of property and bakery shutdown costs of $0.2 million, primarily due to utilities, insurance, taxes and maintenance expenses related to the Schiller Park, Illinois bakery.                Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA-Guidance for the year ended December 31, 2017Reconciliation of our 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income presents inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that are necessary for a full reconciliation to net income. Our outlook for 2017 adjusted EBITDA is based on the same methodology used to present adjusted EBITDA for completed historical and pro forma periods. However, the amounts, if any, of the non-recurring items that are excluded from adjusted EBITDA are highly uncertain and incapable of estimation, and have not been included in the table above. Such non-recurring items may include non-cash expenses for earn out liabilities under the terms of the Business Combination, non-cash expense relating to the tax receivable agreement and/or other items. As such items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA, the occurrence and magnitude thereof, while impacting net income and the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, would have no impact on adjusted EBITDA for 2017. In addition, the below reconciliation assumes that the overall capital structure of the Company and effective income tax rates are consistent with the structure at March 31, 2017. Changes to these assumptions could significantly impact our net income for 2017 and accordingly, the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, but not adjusted EBITDA itself. For additional information regarding our adjusted EBITDA, refer to the related explanations presented above under “Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA”.

As of March 31, 2017, the Company owned approximately 98.3 million of Hostess Holdings $130.0 million total partnership units. The remaining approximately 31.7 million partnership units are owned by a non-controlling interest.     ii.     Represents the corporate income tax expense generated from the Company's interest in Hostess Holdings. The non-controlling interest represents an ownership interest in Hostess Holdings, which is a partnership for tax purposes. We expect that the Company will make tax payments between $20 million and $23 million during 2017 to cover its income tax liability, while Hostess Holdings will make distributions between $16 million and $19 million to the non-controlling interest to reimburse its income tax liability. Additionally, we expect that the payment due to the selling equityholders of Hostess Holdings for 2017 activity under the terms of the tax receivable agreement will be between $13 million and $15 million. This payment is expected to be made in 2018. Neither the non-controlling interest tax distributions nor the tax receivable agreement payment are included in the income tax provision.     iii.     Represents amounts associated with the March 2017 issuance of stock options, restricted stock units, or performance share units and restricted stock to employees of the Company.     iv.     Other expenses primarily consists of professional fees incurred for the secondary offering of common stock which closed on April 19, 2017. Proceeds from the offering were not received by the Company.     v.     Weighted-average basic common shares outstanding for 2017 includes 98,250,917 Class A common shares outstanding as of March 31, 2017 and the annualized impact of the conversion of 600,000 Class B common shares to Class A common shares on April 19, 2017.     vi.     Reflects the dilutive impact of 7.9 million Class A common shares due to outstanding warrants (based on a range of 7.2 million to 8.5 million) and 0.2 million Class A common shares due to outstanding unvested equity awards to employees (based on a range of 0.1 million to 0.3 million).                   Reconciliation of Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA   For the Trailing Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2017   (Unaudited)                                         (In thousands)      Pro Forma (i)  Combined   Year Ended December 31, 2016      Less: Pro Forma  Quarter Ended   March 31,   2016      Plus:  Quarter Ended   March 31,   2017          Pro Forma CombinedTrailing Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2017     Net income     $   82,442       $   (12,258   )     $   24,199           $   94,383       Plus non-GAAP adjustments:                 ii.

As part of the refinancing of the First Lien Term Loan, the Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.8 million, which consisted of penalties of $3.0 million, the write-off of deferred financing costs of $0.2 million net of debt premium write-offs of approximately $4.0 million.     iv.     The Company recognized $0.5 million of expense related to awards granted under the 2016 Hostess Brands, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan.     v.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
