Our StoryThank you for visiting our website!  We all at Plastec enjoy making your  garden and outdoor living area both beautiful and enjoyableThe company was founded in 1989 with  Kathleen Sellers’ invention of the Plant Pallet, and is a diverse (woman-owned) business, N.B. certified by the state of Florida. The Plant Pallet design was later incorporated into a heavy duty saucer called the Super Saucer and was awarded a Utility patent, creating the heavy duty saucer market. Plastec then expanded the “Plant Protection” line by designing the  Saucer Stand, the Saucer Caddy, and the Saucer Table.Now Plastec offers a complete selection of affordable Plant Accessories which are functional, yet decorative and design-oriented – made from various materials and styles. Continually innovating, Plastec has developed unique, new ways to decorate with plants. The  Veranda Stand and the  Veranda Screen for hanging baskets, and the  Stone Saucer line are examples of new products that have created a stir in the category.Moving outdoors, in conjunction with the outdoor living expansion, Plastec has introduced color and design to the area of Garden Décor, Watering, and Garden Cleanup.  Custom POP’s and displays, attractive headers, and efficient merchandising plans all make the Plastec line easy to sell.All Plastec Saucers and Cork mats are made in the USA. Other Plastec products are designed in the USA and manufactured in the USA, China, Mexico, Germany, Belgium and India. Other products are imported from Poland and Germany under exclusive sales agreements.
