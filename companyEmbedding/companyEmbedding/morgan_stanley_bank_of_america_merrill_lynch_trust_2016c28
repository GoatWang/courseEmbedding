                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The rating confirmations reflect the overall performance of the transaction, which has remained in line with DBRS�s expectations since issuance. As of the February 2017 remittance, all 42 loans remain in the pool with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $952.7 million, which represents a collateral reduction of 0.3% since issuance as a result of scheduled loan amortization. Pool-wide, six loans (27.1% of the pool) are structured with full interest-only (IO) terms, while an additional 20 loans (49.2% of the pool) have partial IO periods remaining, ranging from seven months to 46 months. According to the DBRS underwritten (UW) figures, the transaction had a weighted-average (WA) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and WA debt yield of 1.77 times (x) and 9.4%, respectively, or 1.41x and 8.4%, respectively, excluding shadow-rated loans. To date, five loans (12.6% of the pool) have reported year-end 2016 net cash flow (NCF) figures. The largest 15 loans in the pool collectively represent 72.3% of the transaction balance and 13 of those loans are reporting partial-year 2016 financials, showing a WA annualized DSCR and debt yield of 1.74x and 14.3%, respectively.

As of the February 2017 remittance, there are no loans in special servicing and three loans (7.2% of the pool) on the servicer�s watchlist. The largest loan on the watchlist, Navy League Building (Prospectus ID#4, 6.3% of the pool) is secured by a 190,926 sq. ft. office building in Arlington, Virginia. The loan was placed on the watchlist as a result of low income due to rent abatements in place during the reporting period for three tenants, including the largest tenant, which represents 25.7% of the NRA on a lease expiring in April 2027. At closing, the borrower deposited $3.3 million in escrow to fund the rent abatements, with funds to be released monthly through December 2017. The Q3 2016 DSCR was reported at 1.05x and property occupancy remains strong at 98.2%, as of the September 2016 rent roll. The remaining two loans on the watchlist were flagged for non-performance-related reasons pertaining to outstanding servicing advances and deferred maintenance. 

At issuance, DBRS assigned an investment-grade shadow rating to two loans, Penn Square Mall (Prospectus ID#1, 9.5% of the pool) and GLP Industrial Portfolio A (Prospectus ID#3, 7.4% of the pool). DBRS has today confirmed that the performance of these loans remain consistent with the investment-grade loan characteristics.

DBRS has provided updated loan-level commentary and analysis for larger and/or pivotal watchlisted loans, as well as for the largest 15 loans in the pool, in the DBRS CMBS IReports platform. To view these and future loan-level updates provided as part of DBRS�s ongoing surveillance for this transaction, please log into DBRS CMBS IReports at www.ireports.dbrs.com.

OUR MISSION STATEMENT


Experience, intellectual capital and dedicated personal service to help you meet your life goals





Our Story and Services


Story
As the financial world becomes more complex and investment choices multiply, careful planning becomes ever more important to helping you achieve your financial goals. As Financial Advisors, our role is to work with you to help you develop a plan that lays out a clear path to your goals; a plan that we develop in collaboration with you, and one that you can follow with confidence in the face of the market’s ups and downs.Together, we will explore a broad range of topics that are likely to influence your financial future; from your family situation to your career aspirations, from likely education expenses to the retirement you ultimately envision. What we learn will become the foundation for a financial and investment strategy based on who you are and where you want to go. Only then will we talk with you about the details of investing: how much risk makes sense, your asset allocation, and which investments are right for your portfolio. But that’s just the beginning. Over time, we will revise your plan to reflect new aspirations and priorities, helping your plan keep pace as the markets change and your life unfolds.

2017 Top Advisor Rankings by State





Here are America's best financial advisors, organized by state. The rankings are based on data provided by over 4,000 of the nation's most productive advisors. Factors included in the rankings: assets under management, revenue produced for the firm, regulatory record, quality of practice and philanthropic work. Investment performance isn't an explicit component because not all advisors have audited results and because performance figures often are influenced more by clients' risk tolerance than by an advisor's investment-picking abilities. A ranking of "N" denotes "not ranked that year".

Alabama: Since the election, the broad markets are up nearly 15%, and Robert Runkle sees more gains ahead. Even as others warn that stocks are now fully valued, he sees no signs of a reversal. “We’re probably a little ahead of ourselves. But markets have a tendency to swing too far,” says the 61-year-old managing director at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management in Montgomery. “It’s not unusual for a market to keep going higher and higher when everyone thinks it’s going to sell off.” The 34-year industry veteran says he’s optimistic because companies are reporting stronger earnings and revenue. “I truly believe the fundamentals of the economy are falling into place for better times,” he says. Runkle is telling clients to be on the lookout for wage inflation—a harbinger of even better times to come. While it’s too early to tell whether the economy will reach 4% growth, President Trump’s target, he’s encouraged to see progress. “Bottom line, the economic outlook is very bright,” he says. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

Alaska: Margaret Price spends a lot of time helping clients “rise above their emotional self” in today’s political environment, and discouraging some from going into cash. Most require only fine-tuning and rebalancing, she says. “They don’t understand why the market is up so sharply, and they worry we’re going back to 2008-09.” Price, 60, is cautious with new money, but she’s taking a close look at large-cap financial and health-care companies, which could benefit if Trump reduces regulations. And she sees opportunities in fixed income, despite Federal Reserve tightening. “It’s easy to say never buy bonds in a rising interest-rate environment, but in 2017 there could be opportunities when the market gets ahead of itself.” Case in point: municipal bonds, which sold off after the election on Trump’s pledge to lower taxes (which would make tax-free bonds relatively less attractive than taxable bonds). But by year end, muni yields were higher than Treasuries and the Standard & Poor’s 500. —Michael Sisk «Less

Arizona: Growing up, David Stahle spent his summers working for his father’s publishing business. At age 16, he wanted to put some of his earnings into a mutual fund, but his dad’s broker wouldn’t give him the time of day. So, his father pulled his account and transferred it to Merrill Lynch, where Stahle has spent his career. He attended college for a year and a half, while interning at Merrill. When he was 20, he took his Series 7 exam over Christmas break and passed with flying colors, prompting his manager to hire him. “He took a risk on me, even though I was young and didn’t have a college degree,” recalls Stahle. Now 49 and based in the firm’s Gilbert office, he still follows the lessons he learned early on—to focus on what’s best for clients and put their interests first. About 10 years ago, a dying client asked him to continue to check on his wife’s financial well-being after he passed—a request Stahle honored. “I don’t just look at them as clients. I look at them as family,” he says. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

Arkansas: As a young teenager, Allen Homra showed no interest when his dad tried to teach him about investing. In college, however, he took a liking to it and interned at a bond firm, where most of the sales were done by phone. He decided this wasn’t for him, so he pursued opportunities where he could meet clients face to face. “I was raised in a small town. I’ve always been a person who gets along with people,” says Homra, 53, who’s been at Edward Jones since 1987. Based in Stuttgart, Ark., the financial advisor still owns the blue-chip stocks he inherited from his grandfather in the 1970s, and he believes in taking a long-term approach for his clients as well. “Most of my clients have the same philosophies that I have,” he says. He tries to keep things simple—shying away from complicated investment products that many people would find hard to understand. “I know that we make a difference in our clients’ lives. That’s very important,” he adds. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

California: Andy Chase, a former U.S. Tennis Association junior champion, has won in the investment arena, too, with a simple formula. “I’m into risk-adjusted returns, and I like cash flow,” he says. Hired by Smith Barney in 1981, Chase set up shop in Silicon Valley to remain near his alma mater, Stanford. “At the time, [the area] was a backwater,” he says. “But soon, venture capital firms would flood in.” Chase, 57, now works for Morgan Stanley, at its Menlo Park office. He likes health care, which has been beaten up. “It’s very rare that you get to buy what I think is going to be the fastest-growing industry, with a big global tail wind [from] aging and demographics,” he says. “And you’re buying one of the cheaper sectors, other than utilities.” But he’s skeptical of “America first” themes like defense, infrastructure, and energy. “Anyone that makes their investment decisions based on what the government might or might not do is making a mistake,” he warns. —Steve Garmhausen «Less

Colorado: Clients wonder about the effect that Donald Trump’s trade and tax-reform policies will have on the market, says Shawn Fowler, managing director in Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management’s Denver office. “We are humble enough to say we don’t know,” he tells them, and then asks, “What are your goals, what have we built for you, and are we on track to achieve those goals?” Fowler, 46, says his investment strategy has three anchors: dividend-growth stocks, high-quality municipal bonds, and real estate (split 50-50 between REIT index funds and private-equity realty funds). These all generate enough cash to ensure that each client’s “standard of living is defensible.” This approach has earned him loyalty, which he returns. His first clients were a couple he cold-called. Recently, when the husband died, Fowler traveled to Arkansas to help the wife clean out her house and prepare for her next chapter. Why? Because “they gave me a chance 27 years ago.” --Michael Sisk «Less

Connecticut: Jeff Erdmann prides himself on serving multiple-generation households—often with $40 million or more to invest. “Our clients consider me and my team a crucial member of their family, as we help satisfy their planning and investment needs,” he says. Erdmann started with Merrill Lynch in 1984 as a retail broker. But he quickly shifted away from a transactional approach after realizing that clients preferred holistic advice. Now 54, Erdmann is trying to help clients process the flood of news from Washington. He thinks that tax cuts and repatriation of overseas corporate cash will materialize. “However,” he observes, “a lot of that is already priced into the market.” Based in Merrill’s Greenwich office, he sees a good chance for low- to mid-single-digit stock market returns this year. But that will depend on the Trump team’s effectiveness in implementing its financial agenda. Says Erdmann: “We’ll have a much clearer picture in the next three to four months as to how well this administration can execute.” —Steve Garmhausen «Less

D.C.: It’s not often you get a relief rally when the markets have been up for most of eight years, but that’s what Marvin McIntyre thinks happened after Donald Trump was elected. “The very idea of less regulation and more growth was powerful,” says the Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management advisor, who considers the Trump presidency a positive for stocks. However, some of his clients are less focused on the market than they are on estate planning and quality of life. McIntyre recently did a financial review for a client who looked 10 years older than he is. The client, it turned out, was fighting with his business partner. McIntyre, 74, asked what he’d do if he could walk away. When the man said he’d love to teach, McIntyre said: “We’ve just gone over the numbers and you could turn the faucet on here and live comfortably for the rest of your life.” Two weeks later, the client thanked him. His partner had agreed to buy him out, and he planned to teach in the fall. —Michael Sisk «Less

Delaware: Perhaps the best bit of early career advice that Kimberlee Orth received came from her future husband. She was in her early 20s and unsatisfied working in a hospital’s budgeting and reimbursement unit. “Why don’t you get into financial planning?” he suggested. “That’s really where the future is.” Once she became a certified financial planner, she loved her new career. Orth, 53, an Ameriprise advisor in Wilmington, focuses on making sure clients have realistic retirement expectations. “Look at the budget, create a bucket list, and dig deeper to understand what you spend now and how much of that spending is likely to continue,” she advises. She wants both spouses to attend face-to-face meetings with her, even though one usually takes the lead and is her main contact. “It’s good for that other spouse to see the kinds of questions asked, and the kinds of answers I give.” It gives that individual confidence, Orth adds, should the day come when he or she must be the lead spouse in financial discussions. —Michael Sisk «Less

Florida: Thomas Moran says the U.S. economy is on good footings and that he expects solid earnings this year. “The chance of recession is well below average,” observes Moran, who works for Wells Fargo Advisors in Naples. That’s particularly good news for small- and mid-cap companies that make most of their profits domestically, he adds, noting that the stronger dollar will create head winds for large U.S. corporations with significant overseas operations. Moran, 60, tends to focus on high-dividend stocks for income. For more adventurous clients, he uses exchange-traded funds that invest in alternative assets, such as timber, water, currencies, or precious metals. He eschews anything with an exit fee or mandatory holding period because his clients generally “are in the distribution phase of their life, and it gives them peace of mind that the money is accessible.” Moran  and his wife, Sandi, have co-chaired the Naples Winter Wine Festival, which has raised over $160 million for children’s charities over the past 16 years. —Michael Sisk «Less

Georgia: The daughter of one of Rod Westmoreland’s clients recently gave $1,500 to a friend to buy a dog because, she told her parents, “We have so much money it doesn’t matter.” Another client told him that she was divorcing her husband of 40-plus years. In the first instance, Westmoreland set up a series of family meetings; in the second, he suggested a cooling-off period. Such “soft issues” come with the territory when you work closely with clients. Of course, Westmoreland, 64, a managing director at the Merrill Lynch Private Banking and Investment Group in Atlanta, also keeps a close eye on returns. His goal is to achieve inflation, plus 5%—not easy in today’s low-interest-rate environment. In 2009, he had about 50% invested in bonds; today, it’s virtually zero. Instead, he emphasizes U.S. stocks and private equity. He’s bullish on corporate profits, given possible cuts in taxes and regulations. He also likes some European companies with global operations and undervalued shares. —Michael Sisk «Less

Hawaii: Eric Fujimoto was going into accounting until he realized that those college classes started at 8 a.m.—so he opted for noon classes that led him to becoming a financial advisor at age 22. Now, he rises at 4 a.m. to be ready when the New York markets open. “Kind of ironic,” he admits. Fujimoto, 44, who works for Ameriprise Financial in Honolulu, likes simple, liquid investments that clients can understand, such as mid-cap, large-cap, growth, or value stocks, and bonds suited to their risk tolerance. Currently, health care and tech are among the sectors he favors. He has clients both in Hawaii and on the mainland. One difference: In the continental U.S., families often are spread over thousands of miles, but in Hawaii, many multigenerational families live “within a stone’s throw” of one another. That fosters the so-called Ohana spirit of close contact with one’s neighbors. Fujimoto is part of four generations on the island, which connects him to his clients and helps him build relationships with them. —Michael Sisk «Less

Idaho: When Sandra Dalton left accounting and moved back to Boise to become a financial advisor, she had some sibling inspiration. “My sister was a financial advisor, and she was having a lot more fun,” Dalton says, chuckling. Today, she’s also having fun, and is upbeat on the economy, earnings, and stocks based on anticipated tax and regulatory reforms under Trump, plus possible repatriation of overseas dollars that could boost dividends, stock buybacks, and acquisitions. “We think clients can still buy and do well over a long period,” she says. Dalton, 59, likes financials (fewer regulations and rising interest rates), energy (reduced regulations), and technology (repatriation). As for concerns that the bull started back in March 2009, she says, “Bull markets do not die of old age.” Because rates are low, investors will still find decent returns only in equities. “We’re just beginning to see big flows of money out of fixed income into equities,” she says. “We think that reversal will go on for an extended period of time.” —Michael Sisk «Less

Illinois: Steven Hefter says clients are worried about Trump and stocks’ recent run-up. Should they sell now? If so, how much? But he views their fear as a sign that stocks still have room to run. “Bull markets don’t usually end until there’s a sense of euphoria in the market—until everyone’s talking about the stocks they own.” Potential tax cuts, deregulation, repatriation of foreign cash, and fiscal stimulus could boost annual gross-domestic-product growth to 3% or higher, he argues, encouraging those still on the sidelines to jump in. “I believe there’s more to go,” and perhaps “much more to go in this so-called Trump rally.” Hefter, 62, who works for Wells Fargo Advisors in Highland Park, likes growth-oriented stocks and cyclicals. On the fixed-income side, he has moved into adjustable bonds and adjustable-rate preferred stocks. Yet he has to think about what he’d do if his bullishness is misplaced. One client has requested a plan on how to bail out quickly without triggering huge capital gains. Fear still reigns. —Michael Sisk «Less

Indiana: When William Craig Dobbs graduated from Ball State University in the 1980s, he wanted to be a lawyer but couldn’t afford to. So he went to Wall Street, made a name for himself on Merrill Lynch’s institutional consulting team. Nearly 30 years later, as a top financial advisor for Morgan Stanley’s Graystone Consulting affiliate, he runs the $22 billion Dobbs Group in Indianapolis, advising retirement plans, endowments, and foundations. His 104 clients’ accounts average $150 million, and he has a 97% retention rate. Dobbs, 52, invests in equities, bonds, private equity, commodities, and other assets. He’s ultraselective when choosing active managers. “We’ll always have the bulk of our assets in indexes,” he says. Today, he sees opportunities in international small-cap value stocks, private equity, and real estate, plus high-yield and convertible bonds. His approach is to “get in early and get out early, but still secure the meat of the return.” —Kevin Burke «Less

Iowa: Kevin Timmerman, 48, is a “meat and potatoes” investor. “We stay away from alternative investments and indexed annuities,” he says. “We just don’t see the value for investors.” Instead, he mostly uses passive investments, including index funds. In stocks, he has been adding overseas exposure while taking profits in the U.S. On the fixed-income side, with interest rates rising, he’s using funds run by bond pros, such as DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach. Timmerman’s clear, sound approach reflects his roots growing up on a Midwestern-values farm. One summer, he worked for a meatpacking plant slaughtering hogs—a “scary” experience that drove him to do well in school. In 1996, he co-founded Steele Capital Management in Dubuque, using fee-only pricing to avoid conflicts of interest. It now has $1.7 billion in assets in more than 1,100 accounts, ranging up to $5 million. Amid today’s uncertainty, “everybody’s on edge,” he says. “I try to bring them back to their goals and objectives.” —Kevin Burke «Less

Kansas: Scott Ferguson’s love of math led him to become a civil engineer. But that job, he found, mostly entailed pushing paper. Hoping to combine math with human engagement by providing financial advice, he joined Merrill Lynch in 1983, where he built a large book of business. Today, at 56, he works for Morgan Stanley in Leawood. He runs six core strategies across 14 portfolios for 1,500 clients with up to $20 million in assets; his average account is $5 million. He employs math-based strategies, but notes that “people can make better decisions than a black box.” He invests in individual stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, and, sometimes, ETFs. In alternatives, he uses single-manager hedge funds, long/short mutual funds, and private equity. Struck by the markets’ optimism—born of hope for corporate-tax cuts, higher earnings, and fiscal stimulus—he sees Dow 27,000 arriving in three years. Now, he’s overweight financial and tech stocks, and underweight energy shares. In fixed income, he favors high-yield bonds. —Kevin Burke «Less

Kentucky: Barry Barlow learned about the challenges business owners face after leaving Merrill Lynch in 1983 to run his family’s struggling lumber mill, which he was forced to liquidate three years later. In 2000, after working at Hilliard Lyons, he returned to Merrill. Based at its Louisville branch, he helps wealthy families solve complex financial problems. For example, he saved $1 million in tax liabilities for a terminally ill client with $3 million invested in a $100 stock within a trust for his children. Barlow, 61, likes stocks of beaten-up companies with strong organic earnings growth and shareholder-friendly policies—such as paying a steady dividend. “We want to buy a dollar for 65 cents,” he says. Right now, he’s finding buys in health care and media, while avoiding consumer staples and industrials. With rates edging up, he’s using a short-term bond ladder positioned to reinvest at higher rates. And he keeps three years of clients’ current income in a cash reserve. Says Barlow: “We’re in the high-sleep-quotient business.” —Kevin Burke «Less

Louisiana: Rick Frayard, 64, stresses careful attention to detail in his role as a managing director at UBS Wealth Management. It’s a skill he picked up during a stint as an Army helicopter pilot. “If you don’t pay attention to detail when you inspect your aircraft, something may be missing or broken and cause the aircraft to crash,” he says. “In investment management, if you don’t pay attention to what’s going on, you’ll be surprised and not prepared,” he says. Frayard, who joined UBS in 1985, cites the recent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 as potential evidence that U.S. markets are entering a structural bull market. He has a positive market outlook for the next five to eight years; in the past few structural bull market cycles, he says, investors reaped returns of 14% to 16%. “With the stock market at an all-time high, and a new administration ushering in the possibility of tax cuts and deregulation, there’s greater potential for earnings growth and a continuation of the bull market,” he says. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

Maine: While studying at Brown University, Todd Doolan spent his summers as an intern at Morgan Stanley, cold-calling investors. Eventually, he became an institutional equity trader at Lehman Brothers. In 1989, he moved from New York and started his own advisory practice in Portland. Today, at 53, he helps successful professionals—mostly doctors and small-business owners—achieve a comfortable retirement. His core message? Remove emotion from the investment process. In client portfolios, he uses individual stocks, bond ladders, actively managed mutual funds, ETFs, hedge funds of funds, and private equity. He favors blue-chip stocks and tech ETFs. Right now, he likes health-care stocks, which he believes offer good value. He’s also finding some attractive opportunities abroad, particularly in Europe. “Their valuations and dividends look very compelling,” he says. In fixed income, he favors munis in states with high income taxes, as well as shorter-duration bonds: “We can now get yield on short money.” ��Kevin Burke «Less

Maryland: When Bob Scherer, 65, was a tax consultant with Arthur Andersen, he received only a small bonus after saving a quarter-billion dollars for a corporate client. Disappointed, he decided to become a financial advisor. Nearly 40 years later, he manages $8 billion in assets at Morgan Stanley’s Graystone Consulting in Potomac. His clients include endowments, foundations, retirement plans, and wealthy individuals. Diversification is his core investment philosophy. The key to client retention? His ability to distill complexity and build relationships rooted in what he calls “intellectual trust.” During periods of market stress, bonds have provided downside protection, but, he says, bonds aren’t “the great diversifier anymore.” For broad stock market exposure, he uses passive investments. In fixed income, he favors emerging market debt, short-duration bonds, and select high-yield bonds. He also invests across several hedge funds, with strategies including global macro, long/short, event-driven, and relative value. —Kevin Burke «Less

Massachusetts: Rising interest rates make Greg Miller’s job much easier. He focuses almost exclusively on convertible bonds—one of the few fixed-income products that does well when rates tick up. “They’re very timely right now,” says Miller, 67, CEO and co-chief investment officer at Wellesley Asset Management. “Properly invested, we believe they can do better than stocks and bonds—with a lot less volatility,” he says. Miller discovered convertibles after selling his radiology company in the 1980s. At the time, he sought out an investment that would offer security as well as the potential to outperform equities. He was wary of stocks because his grandfather’s wealth had been wiped out in 1929, and his father’s portfolio took a devastating hit in the mid-1970s. Miller eventually turned his investment prowess into a profession. And now, with the Federal Reserve signaling more interest-rate hikes, Miller predicts that more and more investors will see the value in convertibles. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

Michigan: Charles Zhang holds a third-degree black belt in tae kwon do, a sport he says keeps him both calm and disciplined—the ideal temperament for a long-term investor. After becoming American Express’s top advisor in the early 1990s, he founded Zhang Financial, an independent fee-only wealth manager in Portage. He and his wife, Lynn, his business partner, serve about 1,000 clients, each with at least $500,000 in investible assets. He often helps clients with second mortgages, vacation-home purchases, and other matters. “We reward loyalty,” he says. Zhang, 49, favors low-cost ETFs and index funds, and avoids hedge funds—whose fees he considers excessive—as well as margin accounts, because he never wants to be a forced seller. He preaches tax-loss harvesting and periodic rebalancing, noting, “We try to take profits off the table after a strong run.” Right now, he likes financials, health care, global real estate, and emerging markets. He’s wary on fixed income, favoring shorter-duration bonds. —Kevin Burke «Less

Minnesota: Peter Eckerline was once turned down for a Wall Street job because he lacked sales experience. He then tried selling peepholes door to door, but “had a lot of doors slammed in my face.” Soon after, he landed a job at Merrill Lynch, where he remains. Eckerline, 56, serves 232 clients, with net worth of $5 million to $20 million. One client needed financing to save his chain of Chrysler dealerships. “We helped to refi the whole dealership though Bank of America’s auto-lending group,” he says. Eckerline buys out-of-favor stocks, particularly high-quality dividend payers. Currently, he likes financials, health care, and tech. In fixed income, he favors high-yield, floating-rate, and municipal bonds, and he’s using short-duration bond funds to defend against rising rates. He views emerging markets as cheap and allocates roughly 20% of client assets to alternatives, including private equity. His clients worry about a correction, but also about preserving wealth for their heirs, he says: “We help them live the lives they want to live.” —Kevin Burke «Less

Mississippi: Michael Dowell, 66, typically meets with prospective clients three to five times before investing a penny on their behalf. “It takes time to learn a client’s thumbprint. We like to dig into the weeds and find out everything about clients that could affect their financial life,” says Dowell, who has been in the business for over 40 years. “We want to know what we’re doing is the right thing for you.” Dowell says this strategy helps ensure that nothing important goes unnoticed. “We’ve opened up some significant accounts that had never seen an approach like this before,” he says. “We overturn a lot of rocks.” A few years ago, someone called wanting to invest $400,000 in municipal bonds to reduce a high tax bill. Dowell met with him several times and helped him work out a more appropriate strategy. The man became a client and brought with him a portfolio worth roughly $3 million. “It was a win for us and a win for him,” Dowell says. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

Missouri: Michael Jefferies of UBS Financial Services advises every client to have a plan. “I sit down with them and say, ‘What is your intent for your wealth?’ ” Jefferies, who has spent 40-plus years with UBS, stresses the importance of grasping clients’ specific goals and needs. For some, it’s leaving money to their children. For others, it’s sending their kids to the best colleges. “I refer to myself as a life consultant because I work with people’s lives. I try to help people solve problems,” he says. “I want to help them reach whatever goal they have, or solve whatever problem they’re trying to solve.” Jefferies wants to help clients hit their financial goals, diversify their holdings, and understand their risks. “I can help people achieve their goals financially,” he says, “because I keep them from taking too much risk.” Whether he’s working with baby boomers, Gen Xers, or millennials, his clients have different needs. “They all face different problems, and I want to help them solve those problems.” —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

Montana: James Stack sticks to the motto “Safety first.” In the 1970s, he was a research-and-development engineer for IBM and had the humbling and defining experience of losing a large chunk of money during 1973 and 1974. Then, in 1979, he left IBM to start the financial-research firm InvesTech, and for many years the firm’s main focus was a monthly newsletter that provided investment-strategy advice. By the mid-90s, however, the tech bubble was heating up and many readers were looking for a risk-averse money manager. He founded Stack Financial Management, a sister company to InvesTech, to meet this growing need. Now 65, Stack’s primary focus is on managing risk, not necessarily obtaining peak performance. Given that we are in the midst of the second-longest bull market in Wall Street history, he urges caution. Stack notes that today’s valuations are very high, and he tries to minimize risk for clients. “We’re steering a more cautious course with our sector selection and the type of stocks we pick,” he says. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

Nebraska: Ron Carson loves demanding, inquisitive clients. “It’s time for investors to stand up and ask tough questions of their financial advisors,” he says. An independent advisor, Carson, 52, has long championed a fiduciary standard of client care, where transparency is embraced and conflicts of interest avoided. That has helped him build a $7.8 billion asset firm run by a team of 171. Carson’s career started three decades ago, when he sold life insurance while a student at the University of Nebraska. Today, many of his  1,581 clients are anxious about the rhetoric coming from Washington. “This is the most unsettled they’ve been in a long time,” he says. One of the firm’s most popular strategies is buying and selling covered calls. The goal, he says, is to “capture 60% to 70% of the [market’s] upside and limit the downside.” When not running the firm, Carson focuses on charitable work, including a foundation set up with his wife, Jeanie, to fulfill end-of-life wishes for impoverished seniors with terminal illnesses. —Steve Garmhausen «Less

Nevada: Randy Garcia, CEO of The Investment Counsel Co., will take a stand, even when it bucks conventional wisdom or clients’ preconceived notions. “We’re willing to challenge clients to make the best-informed decisions,” he says. At 63, Garcia is no stranger to applying his own analysis to a situation. “If it passes our test and we can create a sound, fundamental reason to support it, we will. But we’re going to cast a more critical eye than our peers.” Garcia isn’t afraid to take an unpopular stance. In 2009, when others were hedge fund crazy, his firm exited—a prudent call. Today, it urges clients to hold high-quality fixed income, even though some have had their confidence shaken by media hype over rising rates. “Fixed income is like insurance. We believe there’s a place for high-quality fixed income,” he says. “Our clients are paying us for advice, and advice equals guidance, perspective, and judgment. It’s not simply about accessing an investment product. That’s mostly a commodity.” —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

New Hampshire: In the early 1980s, John Habig and some buddies would watch Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser on Friday nights. Then, in 1985, Habig got a job at E.F. Hutton, the brokerage famed for its slogan “When E.F. Hutton talks, people listen.” Because Habig’s license plate read EFHUTT, drivers seeing it would cup their hands to their ears. These days, Habig, now 64, works for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management in Portsmouth, but still enjoys interacting with people. He favors financial, industrial, and materials stocks, but is cautious on buying shares that have run up a lot.  He has increased his international-stock allocation to 15% from 5% a year ago. And he favors Treasuries and munis over corporate bonds, whose returns, he says, can be beaten by owning the same company’s dividend-paying stock. An outdoorsman, Habig traps about 100 lobsters off his dock each year, and often phones pals to say, “Hey, I’ve got too many lobsters and not enough beers; come on over.” —Charles Keenan «Less

New Jersey: The approach that Gary Tantleff of UBS Financial Services takes with clients is like the approach he takes to parenting his four sons. For the 30-year industry veteran, it’s about nurturing long-lasting relationships. “I always try to do the right thing for people,” he says, “I think that’s been a big part of our success.” Tantleff, 52, focuses on fixed income and works with sophisticated investors such as CEOs of banks and credit unions and heads of school districts. They are more familiar with economics than most, but he still takes the time to explain his thinking. He’s currently advising clients to expect interest-rate hikes, and changes in regulatory and fiscal policies under Trump. Tantleff frequently calls clients to share nuggets of information or insights. “I think when you do the right thing by people, you’re rewarded with their trust, which is helping to grow the business,” he says. He believes client relationships strengthen over time. “I can’t stress enough that it’s something you build over 10, 20, 30 years,” he says. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

New Mexico: A scratch golfer, Charles Reardon says that about one stroke per round separates the best from the rest: “That one putt, that one shot, is the difference between making it big and not making it at all,” says the former New Mexico high school champion. Success in financial advising also requires consistency, he observes. His Morgan Stanley Wealth Management clients in Albuquerque these days fear that the market has gone up too quickly. “Everyone is waiting for the next shoe to drop.” But, he notes, “big market declines happen when everyone thinks the market is going to go straight up, and optimism is very high.” Reardon, 57, likes steady, dividend-paying businesses. “We would much rather generate income through dividends and good, solid companies that raise their dividends each year and provide a little better inflation hedge.” He’s also a believer in international stocks, and plans to boost them to 25% of his equity holdings, up from 20%. In his view, they’re likely to catch up with U.S. valuations. —Charles Keenan «Less

New York: Lyon Polk, 54, likes to say that nobody gets wealthy with the goal of running a family office—and that helps to explain his success. He and his team make sure wealthy families’ financial planning, investments, personal banking, lending, and family advisory services are handled with a minimum of fuss. Clients “care about life running smoothly, their kids not getting messed up, and being able to pursue their passions without running a whole organization,” he says. Polk’s group within Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management has notched annual growth of over 20% for eight years running. He focuses on investment management, portfolio construction, and alternative investments. These days, he’s telling clients that active managers have historically done better in a rising-rate environment. He’s looking for muted market returns this year—between 6% and 8%.“Everyone’s expectation for different asset classes is pretty low compared to historical standards,” he says. —Steve Garmhausen «Less

North Carolina: William Oliver, 49, thinks that clients should be able to sleep at night without worrying about their portfolios. People won’t stay invested in the market if they are afraid of the downside, but jumping ship limits their long-term savings potential. That’s why Oliver aims to manage risk so that normal volatility doesn’t send clients into tailspins. “We help them make sure they aren’t exposed to undue risk,” he says. Every client has a different threshold for downside risk, and Oliver uses their risk appetites, savings goals, and investment needs to create individualized investment targets. “We get clients to understand that having the returns of the stock market shouldn’t be their goal,” he says. “We create a custom benchmark for clients.” Oliver believes that a client who clocked gains of 8% in 2016 by taking 40% less risk than the market had a well-positioned portfolio, even though the S&P 500 returned 12%. “It’s about getting responsible growth while managing risk,” he says. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

North Dakota: Charitable giving is a major part of Troy Nelson’s life—so much so that he routinely urges clients to make it a priority in their investment plans. “Charitable work gives me perspective on the blessings I’ve had and have, and it refocuses me on what’s important in life,” he says. Last year, Nelson, 42, embarked on his third mission trip to the Dominican Republic. The highlight: raising $50,000 to build a cafeteria to feed hundreds of children. He and four colleagues solicited donations in exchange for hiking 33 miles and over 10,000 vertical feet to the top of Pico Duarte in one day—a trek that normally takes three. Nelson regularly discusses how clients can give back to the community in ways they may not have considered. Recently, he showed a childless couple how much they could save in income and estate taxes through charitable donations, while significantly benefiting the local community. They then incorporated charitable giving into their estate plan. “There’s something special about giving back to others,” Nelson says. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

Ohio: Valerie Newell’s disciplined investing approach owes much to her background as an All-American swimmer at Bowling Green State University. “My old swim coach used to tell us, ‘Don’t look back, you’re not going that way,’ ” she says. “We tell clients, when you sell a stock, don’t look back.” Now,  Newell, 64, is coaching clients through their hopes and fears of a new president. She and her team tell them to stay focused on market and economic fundamentals. “That’s what drives markets in the long term,” she says. “But it’s important to consider there might be increased volatility in this market.” She prides herself on succeeding in a male-dominated field. “[Women advisors] should understand their skills are extremely valuable to clients, and don’t let other people discount them,” she says. Newell likes fixed-to-floating-rate preferred stock as a hedge against rising rates. And despite the recent re-emergence of value stocks, she urges investors not to write off health care and tech. —Steve Garmhausen «Less

Oklahoma: Childhood dinner conversations piqued Steve Jelley’s appetite for a financial-advisory career. “Growing up, having a business professor for a father, most of our dinner conversations revolved around world-finance topics,” says Jelley, 52. “We really enjoyed talking about stocks and bonds and the direction of those markets.” His father encouraged him to get a degree in accounting, where jobs were plentiful. After graduating from college and spending three years in public accounting, Jelley joined Merrill Lynch in 1990. “I��m still one of the few people I know who love coming to work every single day,” he says. “The markets are never static.” Of course, shifting markets can be a challenge, especially when clients resist rethinking portfolios that worked well in the past. Jelley believes the economy is moving toward an inflationary environment. His advice: Today’s champions won’t necessarily be tomorrow’s. “When change occurs in the market, sometimes you need to take gains and reinvest elsewhere,” he says. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

Oregon: Judith McGee, CEO of McGee Wealth Management, says financial planning resembles engineering: It takes analysis and discipline to help clients meet objectives. “It’s very hard for people to detach from what’s motivating them,” she says. “You have to address the fear, but you have to try to guide clients toward realistic data and outcomes.” In 1979, McGee became one of the first women in the Western U.S. to get her certified financial planner designation. In  2015, she helped found the Women’s Leadership Alliance to attract more female advisors to the field. McGee, now 74, previously held administrative roles with engineering and manufacturing companies and learned about small business, financial statements, cash flows, and the importance of an analytical approach. “You can do really well on the investment side, but if your client is pulling too much cash from the portfolio, he won’t make it. You have to have the discipline of financial planning with the art of money management. They are twins,” she says. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

Pennsylvania: Grant Rawdin, founder and CEO of Wescott Financial Advisory Group, started working after college as an accountant with law firm Duane Morris, while attending law school at night. He became an attorney in the firm’s tax, business, and estate practice, then set up a financial-advisory practice within the firm as a complementary service to clients. Several years later, Rawdin launched his financial-advisory practice. As an advisor, he believes it is important for him to take an active role in professional and community organizations. Now, 57, he’s a member of the CFP Board Center for Financial Planning’s Advisory Council and chair of the Philadelphia region’s Urban Affairs Coalition. He thinks that clients should also take an expansive approach when investing. He counsels them to diversify, be opportunistic, and look beyond what they’re normally accustomed to. “The more you see the world, the more you realize there are lots of moving parts and opportunities,” he says. —Cheryl Winokur Munk «Less

Rhode Island: One of Malcolm Makin’s early prospects, referred by her sister, called him in 1978 to open an IRA. But it was April 15, the deadline to claim the tax deduction for the previous year, and she and her husband lived in New Jersey. Makin’s solution was to charter a plane in Westerly, R.I., where his Raymond James office is, and fly to the Garden State to complete the paperwork. The couple became long-term clients. Such hustle has helped Makin, now 72, amass $1.1 billion in assets under management, and made him the No. 1 advisor in Rhode Island every year since our survey began in 2009. He’s roughly 60% in stocks; last year, he replaced some S&P 500 issues with small-cap value shares, which have done well. He likes companies that could benefit from higher infrastructure spending, is a fan of real estate, and is boosting his allocation to European markets. His key advice: Don’t forget the basics; look for well-run companies with good assets and good cash flow. —Charles Keenan «Less

South Carolina: After Cheryl Holland earned her certified financial planner designation in 1991, she created plans for $25 an hour, and even bartered with some clients. Artists gave her paintings, and an auto-shop owner repainted and reupholstered her MG. Today, her Columbia-based Abacus Planning Group has more than 25 employees. To keep morale high, Holland, 58, and her staff participate in a surprise 10-minute “pop up” meeting every month. Once, it was a water-balloon fight in the parking lot; another time, a ukulele concert by a guy in pink tights. But when it comes to clients’ money, she’s all business. Currently, her equity allocation is 40% international, and she likes alternative investments, such as energy and real estate. She generally prefers mutual and exchange-traded funds over individual stocks. Among her aims: minimizing taxes, keeping fees “hyperlow,” and optimally timing gifts. Says Holland: “We’re big on picking up nickels and dimes for wealth creation.” —Charles Keenan «Less

South Dakota: Todd Nelson used to open new stores for the Wendy’s hamburger chain. In 1982, in Las Vegas, Dave Thomas—Wendy’s legendary CEO—told him to start a Merrill Lynch account and buy good-quality investments. Nelson found that he liked the investment world, and in 1989, he applied to become a Merrill Lynch advisor. Early on, he drew clients from business contacts, referrals, and talks at service clubs. Most were cut out of the Dave Thomas mold: “They had an idea or concept. Over time, they became successful through perseverance.” Same for Nelson, now 61, who oversees $1.2 billion in assets in his Sioux Falls office. “Longevity is usually a plus in this business,” he says. “People don’t trust you right away.” The advisor, who likes high-dividend S&P 500 stocks and conservative bonds, such as municipals, relies on money managers to select individual investments. “Whether it’s Wendy’s or Merrill Lynch, or the clients we deal with, there are a lot of common denominators,” he says. —Charles Keenan «Less

Tennessee: After graduating from college, Tim Roberson applied for a Merrill Lynch trainee position in Nashville on a whim. For three interviews, he was called the night before and asked to report at 6 a.m., a three-hour’s drive from home. On the fourth, he was hired. “They put me through the ringer,” he says. Roberson, who once wanted to be a dentist, spent the next decade steadily building a book: “I was a cold-calling machine.” Now 48, he serves  business owners, executives, and retirees, including a growing niche of divorced women. For stocks, he buys ETFs and individual names. He likes industrials and financials: “We think they’re overextended, but we believe earnings will continue to increase to justify those prices.” He has also taken positions in a commodity ETF, some master limited partnerships, and a beaten-up global shipping sector, but he’s reducing exposure to U.S. blue chips in favor of overseas markets. “It’s a global economy,” he says. “You are starting to see improvement.” —Charles Keenan «Less

Texas: Richard Szelc’s clients worry about rising interest rates, and even good news: Why has the market gone up so much? They realize that “these are really uncharted waters,” he says. But with the possibility of deregulation, tax cuts, and greater infrastructure spending, the Dallas-based Neuberger Berman advisor adds it’s “hard not to be positive about the economy.” Nowadays, Szelc has no cash allocation. He’d rather put money in taxable, investment-grade corporate bonds that can be sold as needed for living expenses. He also contends that high-yield bonds could do well, despite widespread opinion to the contrary: “If the economy picks up, you might have credit-quality upgrades, which will provide for principal appreciation, along with coupon income.” To hedge against higher rates, he has cut his portfolios’ duration to 3.5 years, from four to 4.5 years five months ago. Among the equity sectors he’s bullish on are energy and financials. Says Szelc, 61: “We have to be more nimble and tactical than ever before.” —Charles Keenan «Less

Utah: In the mid-1990s, after working solo at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management for about a decade, Carl Laurella partnered with two other advisors at the firm’s Salt Lake City unit. “Three heads were better than one,” he says. “That was a very powerful value proposition to clients and prospects.” Today, investors’ worries include rising interest rates, even though that also means higher income. The idea of bond prices consistently rising is over for now, Laurella argues. So, his team has shifted more money into alternative assets, such as hedge funds, private equity, and real estate. The advisor, 58, relies on managers to do the investing, reasoning that “wealthy individuals aren’t interested in a guy from Salt Lake picking stocks for them.” Right now, he’s counseling clients to increase exposure to high-quality international equities, which he sees as due to rise after years of trailing U.S. stocks. It’s not always easy to persuade investors, Laurella says, “but some of the markets are really on sale.” —Charles Keenan «Less

Vermont: At age 22, Brian Pelkey was hired by E.F. Hutton. His first job was cold-calling prospective clients and offering municipal bonds with an 11.5% coupon. A few years later, during the crash of 1987, he got a taste of Wall Street panic. “I remember in disbelief watching that computer screen,” he recalls. It taught him that “when turmoil seems the greatest, most times the best thing to do is nothing.” That lesson is timely now, as political news gives the jitters to some of his clients at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s office in Colchester. Pelkey, 56, taps proven managers to do his stock-picking. Among other things, he favors global high-quality dividend payers, along with preferred securities with a fixed interest rate that eventually floats with the London interbank offered rate. And he’s still a fan of munis, given Vermont’s 9%-plus state tax rate for the highest earners. Producing solid portfolios that generate a reasonable income stream, he says, gives clients the patience to sit through unsettling times. —Charles Keenan «Less

Virginia: Stephan Cassaday took an interest in investing at age 10, when his father bought him 10 shares of airplane manufacturer Cessna. The stock doubled in a year, and Cassaday took his $150 in profits and bought a drum set. He still plays in his basement to let off steam. Pressure is nothing new. He went independent in 1993, going more than four years without a paycheck, and borrowing from credit cards to meet payroll before going into the black. Now, he counts 1,600 households as clients, mainly civil servants in the Washington area. Last summer, Cassady, 61, went entirely with active managers. “It’s a stockpicker’s market,” he says. “Everyone loves indexes. When everyone loves something, it’s almost always the wrong thing to do.” He sees value in health care and financials. Likewise, “emerging markets are dirt cheap,” as well as some European companies. “If the EU blows up, does that mean Volkswagen is not going to sell Bugattis and Lamborghinis to the Chinese, or Nestlé is not going to sell chocolate?” he asks. —Charles Keenan «Less

Washington: One of Erik Morgan’s clients, with a net worth north of $10 million, wasn’t getting much respect at a Ferrari dealership; his cargo shorts and ZZ Top beard might have been the problem. So Morgan, 47, of Seattle’s Freestone Capital Management, became his (successful) negotiator. Morgan’s willingness to tackle the unusual extends to the investments he puts in his clients’ portfolios. Recently, they included a $300 million portfolio of trailer parks, mainly in Alabama, Michigan, and Ohio. The starting rate of return was 7%, but it could be boosted by higher occupancy and rent increases. Morgan says he looks for ways to provide returns that aren’t correlated to stocks. Lately, that has included some master limited partnerships, REITs, and business-development companies. In equities, international stocks offer better value than domestic shares, he contends. He’s bullish on Asia but cautions that investors there must make a significant financial commitment and “be willing to endure the ups and downs.” —Charles Keenan «Less

West Virginia: David Miller, 47, once worked as a bank auditor, crisscrossing the state to evaluate corporate borrowers. “You got to see what businesses were doing well and what businesses were hurting,” he says. “I thought you could use the same philosophy to identify sectors where you could make money.” Miller was recruited in the early 1990s by Ferris Baker Watts, which was bought by RBC. Today, he favors financials, health care, energy, materials, and industrials. He mainly invests in ETFs, tapping three sources for advice: RBC, Dorsey Wright, and First Trust. All three must align for him to dive into a sector, which typically shows value and momentum. He favors domestic, given bullishness over rising rates, deregulation, and repatriation of overseas corporate cash. In fixed income, he likes discounted floating-rate bonds, such as mortgage-backed securities and senior loans in high-quality companies. “We have to fight against rising rates, which lots of clients haven’t experienced,” he says. —Charles Keenan «Less

Wisconsin: Andrew Burish, a UBS Financial Services advisor in Madison, joins clients to ride motorcycles in locales such as California, Mexico, and Europe. But when it comes to investing, he’s less adventurous, favoring good old-fashioned buy-and-holds. He looks for dividend payers with sustained double-digit returns on equity over the past 10 years, and avoids value traps by emphasizing free-cash flow. “This means they can survive a storm,” he says. “Clients who are waiting for a recovery market get paid handsomely while they wait.” To that end, he likes U.S. financials, which now make up 25% of his domestic equities. He thinks they could double in five years, thanks to projected corporate-tax cuts, rising interest rates, and deregulation. Energy makes up another 10%. Burish, 58, a longtime proponent of international stocks, has had to preach patience in recent years, as they’ve underperformed U.S. shares. But the strong dollar makes goods produced abroad cheaper for Americans, aiding foreign exporters. —Charles Keenan «Less

Wyoming: Jeffrey Vincent started at LPL Financial in 1988, not long after the stock market crashed and oil bust. “Most everybody thought I was going to fail,” he says. He had been laid off as an accountant at Amoco, but his connections provided him with a pipeline of clients. And he saw opportunity in 401(k) rollovers. Today, blue-collar oil-and-gas workers make up much of his client base. His investing approach focuses on individual companies, and he favors high-yielding equities, such as pipeline companies and preferred stocks. Vincent, 59, also likes some European American depositary receipts, and oil, insurance, and banks. “They haven’t run up in value so much,” he says. He’s avoiding fixed-income purchases and shortening durations on longer maturities. He likes cash, too; some clients hold 25%. “Even though we are optimistic, we see a lot of risk out there.” He eschews client minimums, citing how a landscaper can end up referring a wealthy customer. “The more accounts, the better,” he says. —Charles Keenan «Less
