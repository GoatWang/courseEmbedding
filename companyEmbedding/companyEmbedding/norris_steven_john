Early life and career[edit]
Steven Norris attended the Liverpool Institute for Boys, a grammar school, from 1956 to 1963; there he became a prefect and, in his last year, Head Boy. He gained an open Exhibition in Social Studies and graduated from Worcester College, Oxford where he was President of the University Law Society. After graduating he pursued a career in the engineering and motor industries, and entered politics when he was elected to Berkshire County Council in 1977.
Parliamentary and ministerial career[edit]
He became the Member of Parliament for Oxford East in 1983. After narrowly losing that seat in 1987 to Andrew Smith, he re entered the House of Commons at a by election for Epping Forest in 1988.
He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to William Waldegrave at the Department of the Environment, Nicholas Ridley at the Department of Trade and Industry and Kenneth Baker at the Home Office, before being promoted to Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport and Minister for Transport in London by John Major in 1992, where he was responsible for the Jubilee line Extension, the largest extension of the London Underground network to date.
Norris became known in particular for his interest in public transport. He is, or has been, Chairman of the National Cycling Strategy Board, Director General of the Road Haulage Association and President of the Motor Cycle Industry Association, a Commissioner with the Independent Transport Commission, and a patron of the cyclists charity, Sustrans and of the Campaign for Better Transport (UK) Trust.[1]
London Mayoral bids[edit]
In 1996, he published his autobiography Changing Trains, in which he first expressed an interest in running to be Mayor of London. He stood down from Parliament at the 1997 General Election to pursue business interests.
2000[edit]
In September 1999, Norris was pitted against writer Jeffrey Archer, in the race to become Conservative candidate for Mayor of London. The battle was bitterly fought, with Norris at one point remarking to a Conservative colleague that he would never support Archer "alive or dead".[2]
Archer was selected, but withdrew in 1999, after it was revealed that he had committed perjury in a libel case. Archer was subsequently convicted and imprisoned. Norris was selected as the Conservative party candidate in a ballot of Conservative Party members in London at the end of that year. In the Mayoral election itself he came in second, with 42% in the final round, losing to temporarily independent, but former (and future) Labour member Ken Livingstone.
2004[edit]
In November 2002, he formally announced his intention to run again to be the Mayor of London.[3] In February 2003, he was again selected as Conservative mayoral candidate for the next elections in 2004. His platform included promises to open the Tube until 3.00am on Fridays and Saturdays and a "zero tolerance" approach to crime, adapted from New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, whom he met to discuss strategies to combat crime in April 2004. The 2004 Election saw him increase his share of the vote, in contrast to the London wide vote of Conservative candidates for the London Assembly, which fell two percentage points compared to 2000.
Possible future candidacy[edit]
After speculation that he would run again in 2008, Norris declined to put his name forward in time for the deadline for nominations to be submitted, initially scheduled for 4 August 2006.[4] The day following Norris's announcement the Conservative leader David Cameron extended the deadline for nominations in the hope of attracting a heavyweight candidate. Norris did not rule out being the Conservative candidate for Mayor of London in the 2008 Mayoral Election.
On 22 February 2007, in an interview, Norris demonstrated his continued interest in and passion for the Mayoralty. He concluded by saying: "If I run, I'll win." By 16 July 2007, however, he did not hand in his nomination papers by the new later deadline, and Boris Johnson was later selected.
Business career[edit]
Norris was a non-executive director of Jarvis plc and took over as Chairman and later Executive Chairman, when the company ran into difficulties.
In May 2002, when the tragic rail disaster at Potters Bar occurred, the company was initially triggered. This was as Jarvis were the maintenance contractor. He guided the company through a long programme of disposals and business improvements, although the company went into administration in 2010.
He was senior independent director at AIM listed ITIS Holdings plc and is currently Chairman of Soho Estates and BNP Paribas Real Estate UK. He is also Chairman of Virtus Data Centres Ltd and a director of Cubic Corporation. He is Deputy Chairman of Optare plc, and a non executive director of Driver Group plc. He is a founding partner of Norris McDonough LLP with David McDonough OBE.
Personal life[edit]
Norris married his first wife, Vicky, in 1969, and has two sons from that marriage. He has another son with his second wife, Emma, whom he married in April 2000. He is a supporter of home town side Everton F.C.. During the 1990s, it was widely reported that he had had a series of extramarital affairs.[5]

Early life and career[edit]

After graduating he pursued a career in the engineering and motor industries, and entered politics when he was elected to Berkshire County Council in 1977.
Parliamentary and ministerial career[edit]
He became the Member of Parliament for Oxford East in 1983. After narrowly losing that seat in 1987 to Andrew Smith, he re entered the House of Commons at a by election for Epping Forest in 1988.
He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to William Waldegrave at the Department of the Environment, Nicholas Ridley at the Department of Trade and Industry and Kenneth Baker at the Home Office, before being promoted to Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport and Minister for Transport in London by John Major in 1992, where he was responsible for the Jubilee line Extension, the largest extension of the London Underground network to date.

He is, or has been, Chairman of the National Cycling Strategy Board, Director General of the Road Haulage Association and President of the Motor Cycle Industry Association, a Commissioner with the Independent Transport Commission, and a patron of the cyclists charity, Sustrans and of the Campaign for Better Transport (UK) Trust.[1]
London Mayoral bids[edit]
In 1996, he published his autobiography Changing Trains, in which he first expressed an interest in running to be Mayor of London. He stood down from Parliament at the 1997 General Election to pursue business interests.
2000[edit]
In September 1999, Norris was pitted against writer Jeffrey Archer, in the race to become Conservative candidate for Mayor of London. The battle was bitterly fought, with Norris at one point remarking to a Conservative colleague that he would never support Archer "alive or dead".[2]
Archer was selected, but withdrew in 1999, after it was revealed that he had committed perjury in a libel case. Archer was subsequently convicted and imprisoned. Norris was selected as the Conservative party candidate in a ballot of Conservative Party members in London at the end of that year. In the Mayoral election itself he came in second, with 42% in the final round, losing to temporarily independent, but former (and future) Labour member Ken Livingstone.
2004[edit]
In November 2002, he formally announced his intention to run again to be the Mayor of London.[3] In February 2003, he was again selected as Conservative mayoral candidate for the next elections in 2004. His platform included promises to open the Tube until 3.00am on Fridays and Saturdays and a "zero tolerance" approach to crime, adapted from New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, whom he met to discuss strategies to combat crime in April 2004. The 2004 Election saw him increase his share of the vote, in contrast to the London wide vote of Conservative candidates for the London Assembly, which fell two percentage points compared to 2000.
Possible future candidacy[edit]
After speculation that he would run again in 2008, Norris declined to put his name forward in time for the deadline for nominations to be submitted, initially scheduled for 4 August 2006.[4] The day following Norris's announcement the Conservative leader David Cameron extended the deadline for nominations in the hope of attracting a heavyweight candidate. Norris did not rule out being the Conservative candidate for Mayor of London in the 2008 Mayoral Election.
On 22 February 2007, in an interview, Norris demonstrated his continued interest in and passion for the Mayoralty. He concluded by saying: "If I run, I'll win." By 16 July 2007, however, he did not hand in his nomination papers by the new later deadline, and Boris Johnson was later selected.
Business career[edit]
Norris was a non-executive director of Jarvis plc and took over as Chairman and later Executive Chairman, when the company ran into difficulties.
In May 2002, when the tragic rail disaster at Potters Bar occurred, the company was initially triggered. This was as Jarvis were the maintenance contractor. He guided the company through a long programme of disposals and business improvements, although the company went into administration in 2010.
He was senior independent director at AIM listed ITIS Holdings plc and is currently Chairman of Soho Estates and BNP Paribas Real Estate UK. He is also Chairman of Virtus Data Centres Ltd and a director of Cubic Corporation. He is Deputy Chairman of Optare plc, and a non executive director of Driver Group plc. He is a founding partner of Norris McDonough LLP with David McDonough OBE.
Personal life[edit]
Norris married his first wife, Vicky, in 1969, and has two sons from that marriage. He has another son with his second wife, Emma, whom he married in April 2000. He is a supporter of home town side Everton F.C.. During the 1990s, it was widely reported that he had had a series of extramarital affairs.[5]

The former Conservative cabinet minister Steve Norris has agreed to pay £45,000 in costs and issue a public apology to Millwall’s owner, John Berylson, over a comment made by Norris on Twitter.
The legal settlement is the latest twist in the Millwall compulsory purchase saga that saw Lewisham council attempt to seize land occupied by the club’s community trust in order to sell it to a small offshore-registered developer called Renewal. Norris, best known for his role in privatising the railways in John Major’s government, is chairman of the Surrey Canal Sports Foundation, a charitable company set up to offer an element of public benefit in the controversial housing scheme.




Millwall and the battle over The Den: how the controversy has unfolded






 


Read more






Following a series of troublesome revelations around the scheme, several of Norris’s fellow trustees resigned from his foundation, including the mayor of Lewisham, Sir Steve Bullock, the leader of Southwark council, Peter John, and Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson. The compulsory purchase of the land was halted in January this year and a public inquiry into the scheme announced, led by the former Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson.
In March, shortly after the inquiry had been announced, Norris took to Twitter to engage in a series of animated conversations with opponents of the scheme including Millwall fans and local residents. In the course of this, the twice-failed London mayoral candidate accused Berylson of intending to “blackmail” Renewal in some unspecified sense, an accusation apparently offered without foundation or awareness of its seriousness.
Berylson, whose family business is based in the United States, took legal action to protect his reputation. With the case heading towards a hearing, Norris has accepted that his comment could have been interpreted as suggesting Berylson was engaging in blackmail, that such an accusation would be completely false and offered a public apology. Norris has also agreed to pay the legal costs of the proceedings.
In a statement, Berylson said: “I welcome the fact that this legal dispute has now been resolved and that the chairman of the Surrey Canal Sports Foundation [SCSF], Steve Norris, has acknowledged that his defamatory comment made on Twitter was wholly unwarranted. He has now publicly apologised to me.
“While I have never sought any financial gain from this case, I do care greatly that my reputation as a businessman remains firmly intact. It is the foundation on which I have built my career over many years and I will not have that tarnished under any circumstances. Mr Norris has paid £45,000 to cover my legal costs which were unnecessarily incurred as a consequence of his potentially damaging and entirely inaccurate tweet.”
In court, Norris offered the following statement: “On 9 March 2017, as part of a Twitter exchange, I said that IMHO Mr Berylson thinks he can blackmail Renewal. I apologise to Mr Berylson if those reading my tweet interpreted my comments as meaning that Mr Berylson was engaging in blackmail. Such an allegation would be untrue and defamatory. I accept that Mr Berylson has always acted in the best interests of Millwall Football Club. I apologise to Mr Berylson and I apologise if it has caused him any harm.”
The settlement represents an embarrassing note in the career of Norris, 72, who works as a public relations specialist for the London Communications Agency. The stated aims of London Communications are to “audit reputations”, “handle crises” and “manage media relations”. In this case Norris would appear to have done exactly the opposite, providing instead a textbook example of the perils of social media in the hands of the naive or inexperienced.
This year Katie Hopkins was found to have defamed the food blogger Jack Monroe after mistakenly accusing Monroe of supporting the vandalising of second world war statues. Norris will join Hopkins, who is appealing, on the list of those who have fallen foul of instant publication of potentially actionable statements.
Under the settlement Norris also agreed to tweet the apology from his account on Wednesday afternoon and to leave the apology tweet undeleted for posterity. Responding to the news, the Association of Millwall Supporters said: “We are delighted Mr Norris has apologised for his strange and unfounded accusations. We hope Mr Norris can learn from his mistake and now appreciates that social media can be a powerful tool in the wrong hands. While we accept Mr Norris has simply been naive in this case we trust and hope he will treat fellow Twitter users with due courtesy in future.”
The case will also cause a further note of peripheral embarrassment for Lewisham council as it provides evidence to the Dyson inquiry into its dealings regarding the Millwall land seizure and the New Bermondsey regeneration project. Norris was a fellow board member at the SCSF of Bullock, the Labour mayor. Norris’s remaining fellow directors include Jordana Malik, the director of Renewal, whose founding directors include the last Labour mayor of Lewisham, Dave Sullivan. Sullivan resigned as a director in 2007 and told the Guardian he has sold his shares in Renewal, ultimate ownership of which is registered behind the veil of offshore secrecy.
