William J. (Bill) Teuber Jr. is the Vice Chairman at EMC Corporation. With revenues of $23.2 billion in 2013 and more than 62,000 employees worldwide, EMC is a global leader in enabling businesses and service providers to transform their operations and deliver IT as a service. Fundamental to this transformation is cloud computing. Through innovative products and services, EMC accelerates the journey to cloud computing, helping IT departments to store, manage, protect and analyze their most valuable asset-information-in a more agile, trusted and cost-efficient way.
Teuber was appointed to the newly-created executive position of Vice Chairman in 2006. In this role, he focuses on strategy and business development in emerging markets, assists with government relations and works closely with the Board of Directors. In addition, sponsors EMC’s largest customer accounts and works with EMC Chairman and CEO Joe Tucci and EMC’s executive team to develop future leaders of the company. He is based at EMC’s corporate headquarters in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.
From 2006 to July 2012, Teuber oversaw EMC Customer Operations, the company’s global sales and distribution organization. In this role, he was responsible for driving EMC’s growth and market leadership worldwide. His scope of responsibilities included overseeing investments to build up EMC’s presence in emerging markets, which delivered robust revenue growth under his leadership. Before that, Teuber served as EMC’s Chief Financial Officer from 1996 to 2006, leading the company’s worldwide finance operation with responsibility for all of EMC’s financial reporting, balance sheet management, foreign exchange, audit, tax, and investment banking programs. While CFO, he was also responsible for EMC’s Information Technology and Investor Relations functions.
Prior to becoming CFO, Teuber was Vice President and Corporate Controller. He joined EMC in 1995 from Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. where he was a partner in the firm’s Audit and Financial Advisory Services practice.
He is a member of the board of directors of Popular, Inc., a diversified financial services company that includes Banco Popular as a holding, and Inovalon Inc., a healthcare technology company. He is also a Trustee of the College of the Holy Cross. He holds an MBA degree from Babson College, a Master of Science in Taxation from Bentley College, and a Bachelor’s degree from Holy Cross.

In Health Care, Republicans Could Learn From Rwanda

														Rwanda’s economy adds up to some $700 per person, less than one-eightieth of the average economic output of an American. A little more than two  decades ago it was shaken by genocidal interethnic conflict that killed hundreds of thousands. Still today, a newborn Rwandan can expect to live to 64, 15 years less than an American baby. 

But over the past 15 years or so, Rwanda has built a near-universal health care system that covers more than 90 percent of the population, financed by tax revenue, foreign aid and voluntary premiums scaled by income.
