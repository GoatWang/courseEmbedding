“Sailfish Cove winery and apartment are the best example of NZ hospitality.”


Reviewed 22 February 2015
for a stay in February 2015



1 person found this review helpful 



We booked here on Waitangi weekend because there was nothing available in the Bay of Islands....and it could not have been a better experience. My husband and I(I am a Kiwi) were on a 5 week trip through NZ and we stayed here with friends. The winery experience is brilliant...tasting(well drinking) with Harvie was so much fun and being in the centre of a working winery was very interesting....it's a tough business. The apartment is fantastic,very luxurious,huge living area and bedrooms with views you usually only dream about and beautifully decorated,added interest are the alpaccas and Shelby the dog who became our very best friend.The pool was an added bonus. Gaylene and Harvie,thank you for one of the most memorable experiences in our trip. The area around Tutakaka is a hedden gem,excellant food in the town,we walked to the largest Kauri in the East Coast,was well worth the effort. It's an area we would like to go back to and explore.

“Beautiful location, modern amenities”


Reviewed 18 February 2015
for a stay in February 2015



1 person found this review helpful 



We spent a few days at the Vineyard and enjoyed not only Gaylene and Harvie's hospitality but modern amenities in a gorgeous location as well. Short walk to the ocean cove, surrounded by acres of vineyard, quiet, large living room and kitchen downstairs and 2 large bedrooms upstairs with an ocean view, indoor swimming pool, the alpacas and the stunning views. Can't ask for a better place to spend a few restful days.
