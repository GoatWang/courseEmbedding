PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS
providing objective and independent financial advice/management


 
 









Our Characteristics 


Independence
PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS follows a “service delivery model” holding ourselves out as an objective provider of advice that places the interests of our clients first.  PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS typically will not sell traditional products from a brokerage firm and generally will not be compensated for the products utilized by clients.
Breadth and Integration of Services
PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS provides a wide array of services and typically oversee their clients’ entire financial universe. PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS will have full information about their clients investments, tax situation, estate plan and family dynamics. With this information, PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS can assist in structuring and administering clients’ financial universe in an optimal fashion.
High Touch Services
PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS will have high average account sizes (usually in the tens to hundreds of millions range) and low client to employee ratios (around 3 to 1 range). Large account sizes combined with low client-to-employee ratios allows a great deal of focus and attention on each client family. Meetings with clients often occur multiple times a year and for some families there could be multiple conversations on a daily basis.
Multi-Generational Planning
PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS will work with an entire family – the patriarch/matriarch, their children and grandchildren. Planning encompasses the family’s goals that typically include passing wealth down to generations in a tax efficient manner. Children and grandchildren are clients and are counseled on investments, taxes, estate planning, and philanthropy from an early age.
Outsourcing
PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS will NOT provide all services in-house. PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS will have the client’s interests in hand when deciding whether or not to outsource a particular investment activity. PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS plans to rely heavily on the 1st class custodian and trustee expertise of multiple back office service providers.
Focus on Taxable Investor
PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS will have a myopic focus on taxable investors as the bulk of their client’s assets are subject to short and long term capital gains. This is unique to very high net worth families. Most investment research (academic and financial service industry) is geared toward the institutional investor and foundations (with very different tax concerns than individuals and families). The bulk of the research done for the individual investor relates to 401ks and IRAs.
The Virtual Family Office
PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS depends on the back office practices of multiple custodians and third-party institutions. By outsourcing these key tasks, PROFICIO CAPITAL PARTNERS can keep costs extremely low, benefit from the expertise of established market leaders, and be able to carefully evaluate the need to bring the services in-house or to maintain outsourcing longer term.
Key outsourced services include the following:

Global asset custody
Alternative Asset Administration
Consolidated information management/reporting
Compliance monitoring and risk services
Financial recordkeeping
Estate Plan Review
Mortgages/Lines of Credit/Margin Lending
Fiduciary & Trust Solutions

What are analysts saying about Maxim Integrated Products stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Maxim Integrated Products stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Maxim is an OEM of analog and mixed signal ICs. The fiscal third-quarter earnings of the company were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  However, over the last one year, the stock has underperformed the Zacks characterized Semi- Analog & Mixed industry. Maxim has a solid portfolio that generates steady design wins, a highly profitable and well-diversified core business, a policy of maintaining efficiency that has led to cost cutting measures and regular cash returns.  Maxim’s exposure to the consumer and communications markets increases risks. However, the diversification of the consumer revenue across a variety of tablets, wearables, peripherals and smartphones is adding stability to the company’s business profile." (6/28/2017)
2. Maxim Group analysts commented, "MXIM delivered another round of beat/raise results with F3Q (March) sales/EPS of $581M/$0.56 besting the Street’s $576M/$0.52, and F4Q (June) guidance of $610M/ $0.62 easily ahead of consensus $598M/$0.58. Auto/industrial (~50% of sales) is driving upside. GM of 65.2% was just ahead of mgmt’s LT target and expected up another 100bps Q/Q in F4Q. Investors would typically cheer such a solid upside result/ outlook; however, mgmt commentary concerning slowing auto orders could temper enthusiasm near term. In addition to MXIM, semiconductor auto bellwethers include NXPI, ADI, and TXN." (4/21/2017)

Consensus Ratings for Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 7 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.47)Consensus Price Target: $47.13 (3.39% upside)
