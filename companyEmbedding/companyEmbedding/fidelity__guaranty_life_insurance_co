            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Fidelity and Guaranty Life Insurance Company provides annuities and life insurance for over 700,000 policyholders across the United States. The company was founded in 1959 and is based in Des Moines, Iowa. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of Harbinger Group prior to a partial initial public offering in 2013.[2]
In November 2015, Fidelity announced an agreement to sell the company to the Chinese insurance firm Anbang Insurance for a fee of around $1.57 billion.[3]

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in 1959 under the laws of Maryland and commenced business in 1960. The company was primarily formed to write individual life insurance and annuity products.
Until June 1, 1995, the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company"), a Maryland-domiciled property and casualty insurer. USF&G Corporation, a Maryland-domiciled insurance holding company, was the company’s ultimate controlling entity.
Effective June 1, 1995, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, USF&G Company declared a dividend payable to USF&G Corporation consisting of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company. As a result, the company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of USF&G Corporation. In 1996, then-CEO Norman Blake publicly discussed the possibility of selling the life insurance company as part of plan to grow the international operations of the property & casualty business.[4] By 1997, Blake told shareholders that several large carriers had approached management to purchase the entire organization.[5]
On January 20, 1998, St. Paul announced that it would acquire USF&G for $2.8 billion and merge both entities into a single organization.[6] On April 24, 1998, as a result of the merger of its parent, USF&G Corporation, with The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc.
Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company’s ultimate parent, USF&G Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity.
On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc ("Old Mutual"), a London based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001.[7] As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. ("OMUSLH"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was $635 million USD.[8]
On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas-domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., ("Omnia"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company’s parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company’s board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company’s charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007.
On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A claiming indexed annuities should be regulated as securities and should only be sold by registered representatives.[9] A lawsuit was filed on the same day challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate fixed indexed annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal.[10] On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A.[11] On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”)[12] which exempted fixed index annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.
In early 2010, reports surfaced that Old Mutual had placed the U.S. insurance operations for sale.[13] On April 6, 2011, Old Mutual announced the completion of sale of its life and annuity business to the Harbinger Group.[14] Harbinger expressed its intention to use cash flow from the company to fund future acquisitions for the conglomerate.[15] Harbinger appointed Lee Launer, a former senior executive of MetLife to run the company as CEO.[16]
At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".
In August, 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing its intention to complete an initial public equity offering.[17]
The company currently writes various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Currently, the largest product line is fixed indexed annuity (FIA). In calendar year 2012, FIAs generated approximately 95% of total sales. See Annuity (US financial products) and Indexed annuity for description of these products. The company's National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) number is 63274.
In 2013, the company announced a move of its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa, citing a lower cost of business and a desire to operate under a similar regulator as rival companies.[18] The company launched an initial public offering in late 2013[19] In October, 2014, the company hired Chris Littlefield, former CEO of Aviva USA, as President of the company.[20] The company subsequently appointed him CEO in April, 2014.[21]
Business[edit]
Policies are offered in every state and the District of Columbia; however, in New York, products are offered through a wholly owned subsidiary, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company of New York.
In 2012, the majority of the company's direct premiums and annuity consideration business was written in the states of California (13.15%), Georgia (10.89%), Texas (8.81%), Florida (8.74%), Pennsylvania (6.07%), Michigan (5.62%), Arizona (5.41%), New Jersey (3.91%), Ohio (3.45%), Illinois (3.36%), North Carolina (3.03%), Missouri (1.97%), Tennessee (1.85%), Wisconsin (1.77%), and Indiana (1.61%). Total writings of $2,199,063,661 from these 15 states account for 79.6% of the total direct premiums and annuity consideration business written during 2012.
The company focuses on the sale of individual life insurance products and annuities, which include deferred annuities (fixed indexed and fixed rate annuities) and immediate annuities primarily sold through independent insurance marketing organizations (IMOs) that in turn represent independent agents. The major categories of direct premiums and annuity considerations written during 2012 were individual annuities (78.5%) and universal life insurance (21.4%).
From a statutory reporting perspective, the total adjusted statutory capital of Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company was $949 million and $870 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Fidelity & Guaranty Life had statutory net income of $102 million and statutory net income of $110 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, the company had more than $85 billion of insurance in force with over $16 billion in assets . The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the investment firm Harbinger Group.[22]
A.M. Best rates the company and its subsidiaries in the ‘Very Good’ category of B++; Fitch Ratings maintains a BBB rating; and Moody's Investors Service holds the company at a Ba1 (adequate) position, and Standard & Poor's rates the company at BBB-.

Fidelity and Guaranty Life Insurance Company provides annuities and life insurance for over 700,000 policyholders across the United States. The company was founded in 1959 and is based in Des Moines, Iowa. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of Harbinger Group prior to a partial initial public offering in 2013.[2]
In November 2015, Fidelity announced an agreement to sell the company to the Chinese insurance firm Anbang Insurance for a fee of around $1.57 billion.[3]

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in 1959 under the laws of Maryland and commenced business in 1960. The company was primarily formed to write individual life insurance and annuity products.
Until June 1, 1995, the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company"), a Maryland-domiciled property and casualty insurer. USF&G Corporation, a Maryland-domiciled insurance holding company, was the company’s ultimate controlling entity.
Effective June 1, 1995, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, USF&G Company declared a dividend payable to USF&G Corporation consisting of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company. As a result, the company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of USF&G Corporation. In 1996, then-CEO Norman Blake publicly discussed the possibility of selling the life insurance company as part of plan to grow the international operations of the property & casualty business.[4] By 1997, Blake told shareholders that several large carriers had approached management to purchase the entire organization.[5]
On January 20, 1998, St. Paul announced that it would acquire USF&G for $2.8 billion and merge both entities into a single organization.[6] On April 24, 1998, as a result of the merger of its parent, USF&G Corporation, with The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc.
Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company’s ultimate parent, USF&G Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity.
On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc ("Old Mutual"), a London based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001.[7] As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. ("OMUSLH"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was $635 million USD.[8]
On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas-domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., ("Omnia"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company’s parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company’s board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company’s charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007.
On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A claiming indexed annuities should be regulated as securities and should only be sold by registered representatives.[9] A lawsuit was filed on the same day challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate fixed indexed annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal.[10] On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A.[11] On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”)[12] which exempted fixed index annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.
In early 2010, reports surfaced that Old Mutual had placed the U.S. insurance operations for sale.[13] On April 6, 2011, Old Mutual announced the completion of sale of its life and annuity business to the Harbinger Group.[14] Harbinger expressed its intention to use cash flow from the company to fund future acquisitions for the conglomerate.[15] Harbinger appointed Lee Launer, a former senior executive of MetLife to run the company as CEO.[16]
At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".
In August, 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing its intention to complete an initial public equity offering.[17]
The company currently writes various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Currently, the largest product line is fixed indexed annuity (FIA). In calendar year 2012, FIAs generated approximately 95% of total sales. See Annuity (US financial products) and Indexed annuity for description of these products. The company's National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) number is 63274.
In 2013, the company announced a move of its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa, citing a lower cost of business and a desire to operate under a similar regulator as rival companies.[18] The company launched an initial public offering in late 2013[19] In October, 2014, the company hired Chris Littlefield, former CEO of Aviva USA, as President of the company.[20] The company subsequently appointed him CEO in April, 2014.[21]

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in 1959 under the laws of Maryland and commenced business in 1960. The company was primarily formed to write individual life insurance and annuity products.
Until June 1, 1995, the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company"), a Maryland-domiciled property and casualty insurer. USF&G Corporation, a Maryland-domiciled insurance holding company, was the company’s ultimate controlling entity.
Effective June 1, 1995, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, USF&G Company declared a dividend payable to USF&G Corporation consisting of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company. As a result, the company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of USF&G Corporation. In 1996, then-CEO Norman Blake publicly discussed the possibility of selling the life insurance company as part of plan to grow the international operations of the property & casualty business.[4] By 1997, Blake told shareholders that several large carriers had approached management to purchase the entire organization.[5]
On January 20, 1998, St. Paul announced that it would acquire USF&G for $2.8 billion and merge both entities into a single organization.[6] On April 24, 1998, as a result of the merger of its parent, USF&G Corporation, with The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc.
Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company’s ultimate parent, USF&G Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity.
On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc ("Old Mutual"), a London based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001.[7] As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. ("OMUSLH"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was $635 million USD.[8]
On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas-domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., ("Omnia"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company’s parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company’s board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company’s charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007.

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in 1959 under the laws of Maryland and commenced business in 1960. The company was primarily formed to write individual life insurance and annuity products.
Until June 1, 1995, the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company"), a Maryland-domiciled property and casualty insurer. USF&G Corporation, a Maryland-domiciled insurance holding company, was the company’s ultimate controlling entity.
Effective June 1, 1995, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, USF&G Company declared a dividend payable to USF&G Corporation consisting of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company. As a result, the company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of USF&G Corporation. In 1996, then-CEO Norman Blake publicly discussed the possibility of selling the life insurance company as part of plan to grow the international operations of the property & casualty business.[4] By 1997, Blake told shareholders that several large carriers had approached management to purchase the entire organization.[5]
On January 20, 1998, St. Paul announced that it would acquire USF&G for $2.8 billion and merge both entities into a single organization.[6] On April 24, 1998, as a result of the merger of its parent, USF&G Corporation, with The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc.
Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company’s ultimate parent, USF&G Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity.
On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc ("Old Mutual"), a London based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001.[7] As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. ("OMUSLH"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was $635 million USD.[8]
On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas-domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., ("Omnia"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company’s parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company’s board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company’s charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007.
On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A claiming indexed annuities should be regulated as securities and should only be sold by registered representatives.[9] A lawsuit was filed on the same day challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate fixed indexed annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal.[10] On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A.[11] On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”)[12] which exempted fixed index annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.
In early 2010, reports surfaced that Old Mutual had placed the U.S. insurance operations for sale.[13] On April 6, 2011, Old Mutual announced the completion of sale of its life and annuity business to the Harbinger Group.[14] Harbinger expressed its intention to use cash flow from the company to fund future acquisitions for the conglomerate.[15] Harbinger appointed Lee Launer, a former senior executive of MetLife to run the company as CEO.[16]
At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".
In August, 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing its intention to complete an initial public equity offering.[17]
The company currently writes various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Currently, the largest product line is fixed indexed annuity (FIA). In calendar year 2012, FIAs generated approximately 95% of total sales. See Annuity (US financial products) and Indexed annuity for description of these products. The company's National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) number is 63274.
In 2013, the company announced a move of its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa, citing a lower cost of business and a desire to operate under a similar regulator as rival companies.[18] The company launched an initial public offering in late 2013[19] In October, 2014, the company hired Chris Littlefield, former CEO of Aviva USA, as President of the company.[20] The company subsequently appointed him CEO in April, 2014.[21]

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in 1959 under the laws of Maryland and commenced business in 1960. The company was primarily formed to write individual life insurance and annuity products.
Until June 1, 1995, the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company"), a Maryland-domiciled property and casualty insurer. USF&G Corporation, a Maryland-domiciled insurance holding company, was the company’s ultimate controlling entity.
Effective June 1, 1995, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, USF&G Company declared a dividend payable to USF&G Corporation consisting of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company. As a result, the company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of USF&G Corporation. In 1996, then-CEO Norman Blake publicly discussed the possibility of selling the life insurance company as part of plan to grow the international operations of the property & casualty business.[4] By 1997, Blake told shareholders that several large carriers had approached management to purchase the entire organization.[5]
On January 20, 1998, St. Paul announced that it would acquire USF&G for $2.8 billion and merge both entities into a single organization.[6] On April 24, 1998, as a result of the merger of its parent, USF&G Corporation, with The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc.
Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company’s ultimate parent, USF&G Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity.
On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc ("Old Mutual"), a London based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001.[7] As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. ("OMUSLH"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was $635 million USD.[8]
On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas-domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., ("Omnia"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company’s parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company’s board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company’s charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007.
On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A claiming indexed annuities should be regulated as securities and should only be sold by registered representatives.[9] A lawsuit was filed on the same day challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate fixed indexed annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal.[10] On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A.[11] On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”)[12] which exempted fixed index annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.
In early 2010, reports surfaced that Old Mutual had placed the U.S. insurance operations for sale.[13] On April 6, 2011, Old Mutual announced the completion of sale of its life and annuity business to the Harbinger Group.[14] Harbinger expressed its intention to use cash flow from the company to fund future acquisitions for the conglomerate.[15] Harbinger appointed Lee Launer, a former senior executive of MetLife to run the company as CEO.[16]
At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".
In August, 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing its intention to complete an initial public equity offering.[17]
The company currently writes various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Currently, the largest product line is fixed indexed annuity (FIA). In calendar year 2012, FIAs generated approximately 95% of total sales. See Annuity (US financial products) and Indexed annuity for description of these products. The company's National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) number is 63274.
In 2013, the company announced a move of its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa, citing a lower cost of business and a desire to operate under a similar regulator as rival companies.[18] The company launched an initial public offering in late 2013[19] In October, 2014, the company hired Chris Littlefield, former CEO of Aviva USA, as President of the company.[20] The company subsequently appointed him CEO in April, 2014.[21]
Business[edit]
Policies are offered in every state and the District of Columbia; however, in New York, products are offered through a wholly owned subsidiary, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company of New York.
In 2012, the majority of the company's direct premiums and annuity consideration business was written in the states of California (13.15%), Georgia (10.89%), Texas (8.81%), Florida (8.74%), Pennsylvania (6.07%), Michigan (5.62%), Arizona (5.41%), New Jersey (3.91%), Ohio (3.45%), Illinois (3.36%), North Carolina (3.03%), Missouri (1.97%), Tennessee (1.85%), Wisconsin (1.77%), and Indiana (1.61%). Total writings of $2,199,063,661 from these 15 states account for 79.6% of the total direct premiums and annuity consideration business written during 2012.
The company focuses on the sale of individual life insurance products and annuities, which include deferred annuities (fixed indexed and fixed rate annuities) and immediate annuities primarily sold through independent insurance marketing organizations (IMOs) that in turn represent independent agents. The major categories of direct premiums and annuity considerations written during 2012 were individual annuities (78.5%) and universal life insurance (21.4%).
From a statutory reporting perspective, the total adjusted statutory capital of Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company was $949 million and $870 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Fidelity & Guaranty Life had statutory net income of $102 million and statutory net income of $110 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, the company had more than $85 billion of insurance in force with over $16 billion in assets . The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the investment firm Harbinger Group.[22]
A.M. Best rates the company and its subsidiaries in the ‘Very Good’ category of B++; Fitch Ratings maintains a BBB rating; and Moody's Investors Service holds the company at a Ba1 (adequate) position, and Standard & Poor's rates the company at BBB-.

At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".
In August, 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing its intention to complete an initial public equity offering.[17]
The company currently writes various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Currently, the largest product line is fixed indexed annuity (FIA). In calendar year 2012, FIAs generated approximately 95% of total sales. See Annuity (US financial products) and Indexed annuity for description of these products. The company's National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) number is 63274.
In 2013, the company announced a move of its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa, citing a lower cost of business and a desire to operate under a similar regulator as rival companies.[18] The company launched an initial public offering in late 2013[19] In October, 2014, the company hired Chris Littlefield, former CEO of Aviva USA, as President of the company.[20] The company subsequently appointed him CEO in April, 2014.[21]
Business[edit]
Policies are offered in every state and the District of Columbia; however, in New York, products are offered through a wholly owned subsidiary, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company of New York.

Total writings of $2,199,063,661 from these 15 states account for 79.6% of the total direct premiums and annuity consideration business written during 2012.
The company focuses on the sale of individual life insurance products and annuities, which include deferred annuities (fixed indexed and fixed rate annuities) and immediate annuities primarily sold through independent insurance marketing organizations (IMOs) that in turn represent independent agents.

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in 1959 under the laws of Maryland and commenced business in 1960. The company was primarily formed to write individual life insurance and annuity products.
Until June 1, 1995, the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company"), a Maryland-domiciled property and casualty insurer. USF&G Corporation, a Maryland-domiciled insurance holding company, was the company’s ultimate controlling entity.
Effective June 1, 1995, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, USF&G Company declared a dividend payable to USF&G Corporation consisting of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company. As a result, the company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of USF&G Corporation. In 1996, then-CEO Norman Blake publicly discussed the possibility of selling the life insurance company as part of plan to grow the international operations of the property & casualty business.[4] By 1997, Blake told shareholders that several large carriers had approached management to purchase the entire organization.[5]
On January 20, 1998, St. Paul announced that it would acquire USF&G for $2.8 billion and merge both entities into a single organization.[6] On April 24, 1998, as a result of the merger of its parent, USF&G Corporation, with The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc.
Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company’s ultimate parent, USF&G Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity.
On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc ("Old Mutual"), a London based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001.[7] As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. ("OMUSLH"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was $635 million USD.[8]
On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas-domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., ("Omnia"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company’s parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company’s board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company’s charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007.
On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A claiming indexed annuities should be regulated as securities and should only be sold by registered representatives.[9] A lawsuit was filed on the same day challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate fixed indexed annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal.[10] On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A.[11] On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”)[12] which exempted fixed index annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.

At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".

Moody's Investors Service

Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 in each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligations ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.
Aaa
Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.
Aa
Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality, and are subject to very low credit risk.
A
Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.
Baa
Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.
Ba
Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.
B
Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.
Caa
Obligations rated Caa are judged to be speculative of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.
Ca
Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.
C
Obligations rated C are the lowest rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.




Fitch Ratings

"+" or "-" may be appended to a rating to indicate the relative position of a credit within the rating category. Such suffixes are not added to ratings in the 'AAA' category or to ratings below the 'B' category.
AAA: Exceptionally Strong
'AAA' IFS Ratings denote the lowest expectation of ceased or interrupted payments. They are assigned only in the case of exceptionally strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events.
AA: Very Strong
'AA' IFS Ratings denote a very low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments. They indicate very strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.
A: Strong
'A' IFS Ratings denote a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments. They indicate strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. This capacity may, nonetheless, be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings.
BBB: Good
'BBB' IFS Ratings indicate that there is currently a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments. The capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations on a timely basis is considered adequate, but adverse changes in circumstances and economic conditions are more likely to impact this capacity.
BB: Moderately Weak
'BB' IFS Ratings indicate that there is an elevated vulnerability to ceased or interrupted payments, particularly as the result of adverse economic or market changes over time. However, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow for policyholder and contract obligations to be met in a timely manner.
B: Weak
'B' IFS Ratings indicate two possible conditions. If obligations are still being met on a timely basis, there is significant risk that ceased or interrupted payments could occur in the future, but a limited margin of safety remains. Capacity for continued timely payments is contingent upon a sustained, favorable business and economic environment, and favorable market conditions. Alternatively, a 'B' IFS Rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted payments, but with the potential for extremely high recoveries. Such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of 'RR1' (Outstanding).
CCC: Very Weak
'CCC' IFS Ratings indicate two possible conditions. If obligations are still being met on a timely basis, there is a real possibility that ceased or interrupted payments could occur in the future. Capacity for continued timely payments is solely reliant upon a sustained, favorable business and economic environment, and favorable market conditions. Alternatively, a 'CCC' IFS Rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted payments, and with the potential for average to superior recoveries. Such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of 'RR2' (Superior), 'RR3' (Good), and 'RR4' (Average).
CC: Extremely Weak
'CC' IFS Ratings indicate two possible conditions. If obligations are still being met on a timely basis, it is probable that ceased or interrupted payments will occur in the future. Alternatively, a 'CC' IFS Rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted payments, with the potential for average to below-average recoveries. Such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of 'RR4' (Average) or 'RR5' (Below Average).
C: Distressed
'C' IFS Ratings indicate two possible conditions. If obligations are still being met on a timely basis, ceased or interrupted payments are imminent. Alternatively, a 'C' IFS Rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted payments, and with the potential for below average to poor recoveries. Such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of 'RR5' (Below Average) or 'RR6' (Poor).




Standard & Poor's

Ratings from 'AA' to 'CCC' may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.

AA

A

BBB

BB
An insurer rated 'BB' has marginal financial security characteristics. Positive attributes exist, but adverse business conditions could lead to insufficient ability to meet financial commitments. 
B
An insurer rated 'B' has weak financial security characteristics. Adverse business conditions will likely impair its ability to meet financial commitments. 
CCC
An insurer rated 'CCC' has very weak financial security characteristics, and is dependent on favorable business conditions to meet financial commitments. 
CC
An insurer rated 'CC' has extremely weak financial security characteristics and is likely not to meet some of its financial commitments.

Getting Contracted
Dating back to our inception in 1959, Fidelity & Guaranty Life has been a strong proponent of the independent agent model. We are represented by over 250 Independent Marketing Organizations comprising a 25,000-strong network of agents across the United States. If you would like to become a Fidelity & Guaranty Life agent, please review the getting contracted process below.
                  


Provide identification and proof of requirements

Contracting is quick and easy at Fidelity & Guaranty Life. We need you to complete eight core documents so we can begin to accept your business and process your commissions:

The Producer Agency Form
EFT ACH authorization
W9 – IRS tax identification
Copy of your current resident insurance license
Copy of CE continuing education certifications for states that require prior to solicitation
Copy of annuity suitability CE certification
Copy of current Errors & Omission coverage
Copy of your Anti-Money Laundering training certification

Producers and agencies may obtain the contracting forms needed from the sections below, an independent marketing organization (IMO), managing general agency, or one of our field representatives. Agent appointment packages must be signed and submitted by your up-line and/or master general producer (MGA). Questions? Contact Agency Services.




Contract with Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company

The Producer Agency Form must be completed by all individuals, principals, agencies, and/or corporations who wish to be contracted. The top section of the form should be completed by the appointing agency and/or IMO so we can accurately capture your organization hierarchy (Find an IMO). The person or entity applying for the contract should fill out the middle section called Producer/Agency Information.
Please note that by signing the Producer Agency Form you are certifying that all of the information provided on the form is true and correct. In addition, you acknowledge that you have received, read and will comply with the company’s:

Code of Ethical Conduct
Market Conduct Guide
Insurance Producer Agreement

The bottom section of page 1 of the Producer Agency Form is to be completed and dated by the appointing agency. The name of the agency, agency contract code, approved compensation level and signature of the immediate up-line is required.
 Authorization to run producer/principal background review on the second page of the Producer Agency Form is to be read and signed by the producer/principal of the entity being contracted. According to state regulations and our internal Market Conduct Guide, we are required to run background reports. We also complete a Vector One debit check balance inquiry, which identifies any outstanding debt with other insurance carriers. Questions? Contact Agency Services




Commission payments

To pay commissions, we need a completed Form W-9 for tax purposes. We also need a signed Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) authorization and a voided check to send commissions to your bank account. Agents who receive payments via EFT can also be set up to receive a daily pay frequency. Questions? Contact Agency Services.




Complete mandatory training and licensing requirements

 We require copies of the following five items to complete the contracting process:

Current resident license
CE continuing education certifications for states that require prior to solicitation
Annuity suitability CE certification
Errors and Omission coverage
Anti-Money Laundering training certification

Fidelity & Guaranty Life pays full cost of your appointment and renewal for producers who actively submit business. Please be aware that many states have unique requirements that you must fulfill:

Presolicitation restrictions—States have guidelines on whether or not an agent can solicit business prior to appointment date. States that have restrictions are designated as “sensitive states."
E&O coverage requirements—Some states require agents to obtain errors & omission coverage and we will require proof of insurance.
Override license requirements—Non-resident licensing may be required for any overrides.
Continuing education mandates—We cannot process business in certain states until we received your current Continuing Education Certificate.


Training Support:

LIMRA's AML training website
SuccessCE suitability training website
ISSI for E&O coverage email contact



For additional information on Continuing Education requirements, please visit our training page in SalesLink.



Annuity Suitability Certifications
Fidelity & Guaranty Life will not process annuity agent appointments or accept new business until we have received the current Annuity Suitability Certification. Training can also be done online on our website via SuccessCE. A list of states and their Annuity & Suitability requirements can be found on our website. Any business received prior to the completion of the required courses will be returned. For additional information on Annuity Suitability Certification, please visit our Training page.
Anti-Money Laundering Training
Federal regulations require that you provide proof of completion of Anti-Money Laundering training. Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company and Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company of New York have partnered with LIMRA and SuccessCE to make these courses available online.

                      1001 Fleet Street, Baltimore, MD 21202
Questions? Contact Agency Services.





How to speed up the process

Each state handles the appointment process differently so our turnaround times for appointment can vary. For a better sense of how your state operates, please review our Appointing Agents State Specific Requirements and Turnaround Time document for details. You will also find the approximate turnaround times for states to receive the appointment paperwork, process it, and send confirmation back to Fidelity & Guaranty Life in the document mentioned above. To make the process go as quickly as possible, make sure all forms are completed, the information is legible, and all parties have signed the forms. Questions? Contact Agency Services.




What happens next?

Once we have received all of your fully completed, signed forms, and have conducted the mandatory background checks, we will set you up in our system. You will receive a welcome letter that contains your agent number, a PIN, and logon instructions for our agent website, SalesLink. Questions? Contact Agency Services.




Ethics, compliance & business responsibilities

FGL considers ethics and compliance integral to the way we do business. To complete the contracting process, you signed an acknowledgment that you read and agreed to abide by three core documents:

Code of Ethical Conduct
Market Conduct Guide
Insurance Producer Agreement

As a company, we are committed to treating our customers fairly and ethically. The Code of Ethical Conduct makes that commitment by the Company and its employees. We expect our producers - the individuals and firms authorized to sell and distribute our insurance products - to share this commitment. The Market Conduct Guide provides a framework for meeting regulatory responsibilities. Because of the complexity and frequent changes in regulation it is sometimes only a summary and does not provide definitive guidance. The Insurance Producer Agreement contains important terms and agreements regarding your business relationship with the company. Questions? Contact Agency Services.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
