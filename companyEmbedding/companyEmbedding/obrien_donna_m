A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

One reason is simple, while the Internet may be everywhere, it's not always accurate, and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information. That's why approved textbooks are so important; they give you the facts, not the opinions of someone on the Internet.Help for the Home SchooledNo one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children. There is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their children's education on the aspects Engl are most important to them, and tailor the curriculum to their own child's individual learning styles. From science and mathematics to English and history, textbooks are a vital part of any education program.For Every Age LevelNo matter what age or grade level your student is at, there are education textbooks to cover their needs.  Even if they go to a regular grade school, there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it. Not every book is the right fit for every student, and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbook.Explore Adult EducationEducation isn't just for children; many adults have a need for textbooks too. From those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their GED, to professionals looking to further their development, there's a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life. It's not just academic textbooks. You can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management, to woodworking, and auto repair.Control Your College EducationCollege is more than just an investment in your future; it's an investment. One way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks. Many textbooks, especially in fields such as English and history do not change much from year to year, so grabbing last  year's engineering handbook may be the best way to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverMixed LotPaperbackNot SpecifiedPublication Yearsee all1900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allBusiness & EconomicsEducation, TeachingEngineeringHistoryMathMedicinePerforming ArtsScience & TechLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

Managing Disruptive Change in Healthcare
Lessons from a Public-Private Partnership to Advance Cancer Care and Research
Arnold D. Kaluzny and Donna M. O'Brien


A management case study of the design and implementation of a public-private partnership to enhance access, improve quality, and expand the research capability of community hospitals to bring better healthcare to the community
Offers description of the implementation and sustainability of a federally sponsored program by the hospital personnel involved in three community settings: a larger urban hospital, a rural hospital setting, and a national hospital system
Provides manager and clinicians with innovative guiding principles providing value-based care in a community setting
Works as a casebook in leading complex organizational transformations within the new environment of value and population health








Managing Disruptive Change in Healthcare
Lessons from a Public-Private Partnership to Advance Cancer Care and Research
Arnold D. Kaluzny and Donna M. O'Brien



Description



Healthcare faces unprecedented global challenges. Rapid advances in genomics, computational sciences, and technology -- as well as the new focus on value-based care and an increased trend toward healthcare commercialization -- represent disruptive changes to an already-fragmented delivery system. The healthcare establishment has been slow to adapt, and now faces rising cancer-care costs and lags in outcome improvement and genomically informed interventions. Managing Disruptive Change in Healthcare codifies the US National Cancer Institute's lessons from utilizing a public-private partnership with community hospitals to navigate the change needed to increase patient access to high-quality cancer care, and enhance hospitals' capacity to conduct and support research initiatives. The treatment of complex diseases requires a delivery system capable of translating scientific advances into care that is coordinated across the full continuum; this book offers a blueprint to just such an infrastructure.

Managing Disruptive Change in Healthcare
Lessons from a Public-Private Partnership to Advance Cancer Care and Research
Arnold D. Kaluzny and Donna M. O'Brien


Reviews and Awards


"Kaluzny and O'Brien provide an inside view of a cooperative arrangement between the National Cancer Institute and thirty community hospitals across the United States to advance scientific breakthroughs and improve cancer care. The book documents the value of public-private partnerships in conducting and financing key healthcare initiatives and implementing complex programs. Managing Disruptive Change should be on the reading list for everyone involved in developing healthcare public policy." -- U.S. Senator Robert P. Casey, Jr.
"Great advances in biomedical science and technology have occurred in academic medical centers, but most people with cancer are treated, suffer and die in the communities where they live. Bridging this gap requires disruptive change beyond just expanding access to state of art care. It requires creating a delivery system that serves as a platform for discovery by constantly monitoring, understanding and improving how we provide the right care for the right person and achieve the right outcome. That is the story and legacy of the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program so well described in this book." --Andrew C. von Eschenbach, MD  Former Commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration Former Director of the U.S. National Cancer Institute President, Samaritan Health Initiatives
"Innovative programs, committed leadership, and the ability to change are necessary to provide state-of-the-art healthcare. Kaluzny and O'Brien brilliantly show how the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP), a unique public-private partnership, led to sustainable changes in cancer care programs. The case studies provide clear focus on the dynamics of several community hospitals that successfully implemented the program, and the book shows how NCCCP addressed challenges in care for the underserved and moved the bar in providing quality cancer care." --Otis W. Brawley, MD, MACP  Chief Medical Officer, American Cancer Society Professor of Hematology, Medical Oncology, Medicine and Epidemiology, Emory University
"This book demonstrates how a desire to develop a coordinated treatment plan for cancer care in the community setting can be achieved in a period of disruptive change in healthcare. The unique role of government as a catalyst and the power of public/private partnerships to facilitate large-scale and sustainable change backed by learnings from cancer research and cancer care delivery has created a set of principles applicable to health care in general in our country and worldwide. Its potential is overwhelming." -- Gail L. Warden, President Emeritus Henry Ford Health System Detroit and Professor of Health Management and Policy University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor
"Drawing upon the experience of the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program, the authors have created a must-have resource for community cancer care providers. With practical case studies, including lessons learned, this publication offers clear insight into the future of community-based cancer care and will serve as a guide to develop and improve quality and value in all programs." --Christian Downs, JD, MHA, Executive Director, Association of Community Cancer Centers

Donna M. O’Brien
Donna M. O’Brien, President of Strategic Visions in Healthcare, LLC has a consulting practice in healthcare strategy, policy, and healthcare operations. Building upon her extensive management experience with health systems, academic medical centers and driving strategic partnerships, she launched her consulting practice in 2005.
In her consulting work Ms. O’Brien has focused on strategy development and implementation, facilitating mergers and partnerships, and the transformation of care delivery to support value-based care, personalized medicine and advances in research. Her clients include: health systems, academic medical centers, research institutes, and the public sector. Ascension Health, the largest not for profit health system in the U.S., engaged her to lead a six year strategy initiative to rebuild healthcare capacity which included primary care expansion and the development of a public-private partnership for a new healthcare campus in New Orleans post-Katrina.
From 2005 to 2014 she served as a Special Advisor to the Director of the National Cancer Institute, where she supported the planning and implementation of the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP), a public-private partnership designed to transform cancer care by promoting state-of-the art-care and expanding research to support personalized medicine with a specific program focus on reducing healthcare disparities. She is a co-author of several published articles related to this initiative including a book in press (2015) with Oxford University Press, Managing Disruptive Change in Healthcare: Lessons from a Public-Private Partnership to Advance Cancer Care and Research. Growing from this work, she is now serving as an advisor to several large scale big data genomic initiatives.
Her extensive board experience includes service on three national health system Boards of Directors. She served on the Merger Steering Committee to oversee the formation of Christus Health, a Dallas-based healthcare organization with approximately 40 hospitals in the U.S, Ireland, Mexico, and Chile. She is a Member of the Board of Regents of Seton Hall University, where she has Chaired the Audit Committee, serves on the Finance, Academic Affairs and Medical School Committees. She also serves on the Boards of Directors of the Bethesda Maryland based International Cancer Expert Corps, and the Dominican Friars Health Care Ministry in New York.
Ms. O’Brien served on the Governor of New York State’s Commission on Healthcare Facilities for the Twenty First Century (the Berger Commission). In 2009, she received the National Institutes of Health Director’s Award for her work on the team that developed the NCCCP Program. She has served as a U.S. Advisor for Oxford Cancer Solutions (UK).
O’Brien has over 25 years experience working in executive positions in healthcare including serving as Executive Vice President of the Catholic Health System of Long Island (a $1.3B health system with five hospitals, four nursing homes, homecare/hospice,) where she led the formation of the health system, and as an executive at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston where she was responsible for inpatient operations.
She is a graduate of the College of the Holy Cross and has her Masters in Health Administration from St. Louis University. She is Board certified as a Fellow in the American College of Healthcare Executives.
