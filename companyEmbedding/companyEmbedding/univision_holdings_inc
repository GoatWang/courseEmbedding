Atlantic Media selling ownership stake to organization run by Laurene Powell Jobs

					Emerson Collective, founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of late Apple founder Steve Jobs, is acquiring a majority ownership stake in The Atlantic. According to a news release on Friday Atlantic Media Chairman David Bradley told staff of the deal, which includes its flagship magazine, digital properties, live events business and consulting services. Bradley, through Atlantic Media, will hold a minority stake and continue to run The Atlantic for the next three to five years. In a letter to The Atlantic staff Bradley said, "Against the odds, The Atlantic is prospering. While I will stay at the helm some years, the most consequential decision of my career now is behind me: Who next will take stewardship of this 160-year-old national treasure? To me, the answer, in the form of Laurene, feels incomparably right." The terms of the deal were not disclosed. In the 18 years since Bradley acquired the magazine from Mortimer Zuckerman, digital readership has grown to a monthly average of 33 million unique visitors from 2 million in 2009, and it generates profits above $10 million per year after recording losses of more than $10 million a year in Bradley's early days. About 20% of the magazine's revenue comes from print advertising with 80% coming in digital advertising.

Bullish analyst says Netflix could reach $30 EPS over time
              
              MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson put out a bullish note on Netflix Inc.  on Thursday, raising his 12-month price target on the streaming giant to $230 from $195. That represents a 23% premium to current trading levels. Sanderson also said his model suggests that Netflix hitting earnings of $30 per share is possible over time. "While we look to our $12 EPS power in 2021 as our valuation benchmark, we think there is a much larger opportunity over time," Sanderson wrote. "We think that 2021 provides a relevant benchmark for valuation, but think that the growth story will still have meaningful headroom from there. We continue to think the international opportunity is much larger. Each benchmark suggests the opportunity for Netflix outside the U.S. could be four to five times the domestic opportunity over time." Shares of Netflix were down less than 1% intraday on Thursday, but have gained more than 50% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  is up nearly 11%.

BuzzFeed launches app and cooktop product  for popular video cooking series Tasty
              
              BuzzFeed on Thursday launched a new iPhone app for its popular Tasty web series. The Tasty video series, which shows quick and relatively easy step-by-step recipes, has been a boon for the media company, reaching one in four Facebook users and generating 2.3 billion monthly video views. "Tasty's strong brand and massive fan base give it almost limitless avenues for expansion -- from cookbooks to licensing to consumer tech," said head of BuzzFeed Product Labs Ben Kaufman in a statement. Tasty already has nine additional brands in its portfolio. Along with the launch of the Tasty app, BuzzFeed announced a bluetooth-enabled cook top that connects with the app, the Tasty One Top.

New York Times beats profit expectations as subscriber and ad revenue rise
              
              New York Times Co.  reported Thursday a second-quarter net profit of $15.6 million, or 9 cents a share, after a loss of $211,000, or breakeven on a per-share basis, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 18 cents, beating the FactSet consensus of 13 cents. Revenue rose 9.2% to $407.1 million from $372.6 million, above the FactSet consensus of $393.1 million. Subscription revenue increased 13.9%, as a 46.4% jump in digital-only subscription revenue and an increase in home-delivery prices for The New York Times paper offset a decline in print copies sold. Advertising revenue rose 0.8%, as 22.5% growth in digital-only revenue offset a 10.5% decline in print. For the third quarter, the media company expects total subscription revenue to increase at rate similar to the second quarters, while ad revenue is expected to decline in the mid- to high-single digits percentage range. "We believe that more and more people are prepared to pay for high quality in-depth journalism that helps them make sense of the world," said Chief Executive Mark Thompson. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has soared 38% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500  has gained 11%.

Charter Communications reports declining Q2 profit, revenue falls short of expectations
              
              Charter Communications Inc.  reported second-quarter earnings that declined sharply as revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations. Shares were down slightly on light volume in premarket trade. The company reported net income of $139 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with $248 million, or 91 cents during the same period a year ago. FactSet's consensus for per-share earnings was 79 cents. Revenue for the quarter hit $10.36 billion, compared with $9.97 billion on a pro forma basis in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue was just below FactSet's consensus of $10.38 billion. Charter lost 90,000 video subscribers in the quarter, compared with a larger loss of 152,000 a year ago, but reported net customer adds of 155,000 thanks to its internet business. Revenue in the video segment, $4.12 billion, remained relatively unchanged year-over-year despite the loss in subscribers. Shares of Charter have gained more than 21% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  is up more than 11%.

Shares of Scripps gain, Discovery stock slumps after reports that Viacom is out as potential buyer
              
              Shares of Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.  were up more than 3% in premarket trade on Thursday, while Discovery Communication Inc.  shares fell more than 2% following media reports Wednesday evening that Viacom Inc.  is no longer in the hunt to acquire Scripps. That makes Discovery the leading contender for a potential deal to buy Scripps. According to a report in Variety, Viacom had made an all-cash bid for Scripps, which would have likely knocked the company to junk status. Shares of Viacom were inactive in premarket trade. Scripps shares have gained nearly 18% in the year to date, while shares of Discovery are down 3% and the S&P 500 index  is up nearly 11% in the year.

Twitter shares tank after report of flat user growth 
              
              Shares of Twitter Inc.  were down 8% in premarket trade after the company reported second-quarter earnings expectations with flat user growth. Twitter reported a net loss of $116.5 million, or a loss of 16 cents per share, compared with a loss of $107 million, or a loss of 15 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Twitter reported adjusted earnings per share of 8 cents, above the FactSet consensus of 5 cents. Revenue was $573.9 million, down from $602 million in the year-earlier period and above the FactSet consensus of $537.5 million. It reported 328 million monthly active users, up 5% year-over-year, but in line with  328 million reported in the previous quarter. The FactSet consensus was for 328.8 million. Daily active users increased 12% year-over-year, compared with an increase of 14% last quarter. Twitter expects adjusted EBITDA to be between $130 million and $150 million for the third quarter and expects total non-GAAP expenses to fall 3% to 6% compared to 2016. Shares of Twitter have gained 18% in the past three months, while the S&P 500  has gained 3.7%.

AT&T shares gain 3% in premarket after company surprises analyst with Q2 wireless results
              
              Shares of AT&T Inc.  were up more than 3% in premarket trade on Wednesday after the company reported second-quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday that beat Wall Street expectations. The internet, phone and TV provider also reported wireless phone results that surprised analysts. AT&T added 127,000 new wireless postpaid subscribers, far above FactSet's consensus for 20,500 adds, and the company reported record low churn, thanks in part to DirecTV. "Despite the competitive environment, and solid volumes from T-Mobile, bundling with [DirecTV] drove strong wireless results," wrote Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack. The company lost 351,000 traditional TV subscribers in the quarter, though that was offset thanks to its internet live TV offering DirecTV Now, which the company said has half a million subscribers. But management admitted that cord-cutting in the TV landscape is still having an impact and in fact has increased. "Comments around cord-cutting and OTT adoption bear monitoring as inflection in trends could indicate accelerating linear subscriber declines," McCormack wrote. AT&T shares have declined nearly 15% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  has gained close to 11%.

Pandora Media shares gain more than 4% premarket after upbeat analyst note
              
              Shares of internet radio company Pandora Media Inc.  were up 4.5% in premarket trade on Monday after an upbeat analyst note. SunTrust analyst Matthew Thornton sent a note to investors on Monday following a meeting with Pandora interim Chief Executive Naveed Chopra. Thornton's key takeaways from the meeting were that the subscription model that many analysts feel Pandora was late to isn't going away, but the company plans to drop investment to maintenance levels. Pandora also plans to increase its focus on monetizing radio, while reallocating subscription investment to sales hires and ad technology. The company also wants to increase focus on cost efficiencies. Thornton said Chopra told him that Pandora's hours growth could hinge on new content and that more details will be available in the coming quarters. Thornton maintains a buy rating on Pandora and a $10.50 12-month price target, which is about 11% above current trading levels. Pandora shares have declined more than 27% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  is up more than 10% during the same period.

Spanish-language network Univision Holdings filed for an initial public offering of up to $100 million last week with plans to list under the ticker symbol âUVNâ on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market.  The deal will mark a partial exit at the least for its owners, private-equity firms Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG and Thomas H. Lee Partners, as well as media mogul Haim Saban, the group that acquired the company in 2007 for $13.7 billion, including debt.  The deal was financed with a stunning $10 billion of debt, landing the company with a debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of 12 times, ranking with the loftiest of the leveraged-buyout era. The company has struggled under that debt load ever since. Univision operates the biggest portfolio of Spanish-language media platforms in the U.S., with broadcast and cable networks, 60 local TV stations, radio, digital and mobile properties, according to its prospectus. It reaches more than 49 million media consumers every month, tapping a demographic that is showing strong growth and increasing economic and political influence as the U.S. heads into an election year. There were 57 million Hispanic people in the U.S. as of December 2014, a number that is expected to grow to 77 million by 2030, according to the prospectus. The community had an aggregate estimated buying power of $1.3 trillion as of 2014, a number forecast to expand to $1.7 trillion by 2019. Itâs also the youngest demographic, with 60% of Hispanics below the age of 34 as of June 2012. It has a registered-voter base of 15.7 million, or about 10% of the total voter base as of March 2015.  The prospectus makes no mention of Donald Trumpâs $500 million lawsuit, filed last week, alleging breach of contract and defamation after the broadcaster pulled out of airing the Miss USA pageant.  Also read:  Fellow Republican presidential candidates distance themselves from Donald Trump after Mexico immigration remarks  Univision has just extended its programming agreement with Mexicoâs Grupa Televisa SAB, the worldâs biggest producer of Spanish-language TV programming, to at least 2030. Televisa is a major investor in Univision â it competed with the networkâs current owners to buy the network in 2007 â and provides it with exclusive rights to broadcast its popular Spanish-language telenovelas, sports and other programs in the U.S.  The IPO is being lead managed by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. Here are 5 things to know about Univision before its IPO: It is highly indebted As outlined above, Univision is grappling with a sizable debt burden, much of which was taken on by its owners to finance their buyout of the company in 2007. Univision had total outstanding debt of $10.6 billion as of March 31, in the form of bank loans, bonds and senior secured credit facilities. The company is planning to use the proceeds of the IPO to reduce its debt, which could become unmanageable if it were to experience net losses for a prolonged period, or if any of its lenders were to withdraw a financing commitment, according to its prospectus. It isnât profitable Univision posted a net loss of $142 million for the three months ending March 31, after a small profit of $3.8 million in the year-earlier period. The company eked out a $1.9 million profit for all of 2014 after a $216 million profit for 2013. But it was unprofitable for the three preceding years, according to the prospectus. Revenue totaled $2.9 billion in 2014. Its audience may shrink over time As a service primarily targeting Hispanics, Univision is exposed to a range of factors affecting that community, including any federal or state legislation that curbs immigration from Latin America into the U.S. As long as new immigrants enter the country, the network has a natural audience for its programming. However, as later generations become bilingual, âdemand for our Spanish-language programming could be adversely impacted by competing English-language programming, including programming primarily in English [that targets] the bilingual U.S. Hispanic population,â said the prospectus. â In addition, a shift in policy towards encouraging English-language fluency among U.S. Hispanic immigrants could also impact demand for Spanish-language programming.â It is highly exposed to Televisa Univision receives the bulk of its programming from Televisa, but the two parties haven't always had a harmonious relationship. Televisa accused Univision of failing to even consider its counterbid in 2007, according to a Wall Street Journal report, and threatened to pull its programming and offer it to other outlets. Televisa will own a roughly 22% stake of Univisionâs voting rights if the IPO is completed, after purchasing a 5% stake in 2010 and exchanging $1.125 billion in notes for warrants that convert into common stock. âThe loss or decline in popularity of programming from Televisa could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations,â according to the prospectus. It will not pay dividends any time soon  As a holding company, Univision relies on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations. That means its ability to pay dividends on its common stock will be dependent on the transfers from its subsidiaries â but the amount it can use for dividends is limited by their debt agreements. As a result, the company isn't planning to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, which means a shareholder will have to rely on price appreciation to make gains.

Stitch Fix has confidentially filed to go public: report
              
              Stitch Fix, a subscription clothing service, has filed confidentially to go public, according to TechCrunch, citing sources. The company has been rumored to be going public for months, with Reuters reporting in May that the company had hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to underwrite the offering. Under the JOBS Act, companies are able to file confidentially before releasing a public prospectus. In late June, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to allow confidential filing for all companies, rather than the previous standard of companies with annual revenue of less than $1 billion. Stitch Fix would be another test of a subscription service model, after Blue Apron Holdings Inc.'s  offering earlier this month. Shares of Blue Apron have fallen 28% month-to-date, while the S&P 500  has gained 2%.

Atlantic Media selling ownership stake to organization run by Laurene Powell Jobs
              
              Emerson Collective, founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of late Apple founder Steve Jobs, is acquiring a majority ownership stake in The Atlantic. According to a news release on Friday Atlantic Media Chairman David Bradley told staff of the deal, which includes its flagship magazine, digital properties, live events business and consulting services. Bradley, through Atlantic Media, will hold a minority stake and continue to run The Atlantic for the next three to five years. In a letter to The Atlantic staff Bradley said, "Against the odds, The Atlantic is prospering. While I will stay at the helm some years, the most consequential decision of my career now is behind me: Who next will take stewardship of this 160-year-old national treasure? To me, the answer, in the form of Laurene, feels incomparably right." The terms of the deal were not disclosed. In the 18 years since Bradley acquired the magazine from Mortimer Zuckerman, digital readership has grown to a monthly average of 33 million unique visitors from 2 million in 2009, and it generates profits above $10 million per year after recording losses of more than $10 million a year in Bradley's early days. About 20% of the magazine's revenue comes from print advertising with 80% coming in digital advertising.

Goodyear Tire's stock dives after slashed profit outlook offsets in-line earnings
              
              Shares of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  plunged 9.3% in premarket trade Friday, after the tire maker slashed its 2017 profit outlook. Net profit for the quarter to June 30 fell to $147 million, or 58 cents a share, from $202 million, or 75 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 70 cents, matching the FactSet consensus. Revenue slipped to $3.69 billion from $3.88 billion, just shy of the FactSet consensus of $3.73 billion. The company cut its 2017 guidance for segment operating income to a range of $1.60 billion to $1.65 billion from "approximately" $2.0 billion. "In addition to higher raw material costs, we have seen a weakening in OE and consumer replacement demand across many of our key markets during the first half, despite strong underlying industry fundamentals," said Chief Executive Richard Kramer. "The combination of these factors has led to a highly unusual first half environment, particularly given the favorable trends in miles driven, gasoline prices and unemployment that are generally supportive of our industry." The stock has rallied 14.9% year to date through Thursday, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.6%.

Adjusted earnings per share were 56 cents, above FactSet's earnings consensus for 43 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter hit $39.85 billion, compared with $39.49 billion during the same period a year ago. Revenue was above FactSet's expected $37.28 billion consensus. Revenue from automotive sales were up to $37.11 billion in the quarter, compared with $36.93 billion a year ago, and the company said that automotive profits were driven by North America. Europe and Asia Pacific were also profitable. The car manufacturer said it expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.85. The FactSet consensus is for full-year earnings of $1.51 per share. Ford shares are down 7% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  is up nearly 11% in the year.

Wells Fargo: FDA plan to lower nicotine could be opportunity for Altria, Philip Morris
              
              Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said Friday that a new Food and Drug Administration plan to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes could be a long-term opportunity for makers of reduced-risk products like Altria Group Inc.  and Philip Morris International Inc. . Shares of cigarette producers plunged after the FDA announcement, with Altria plummeting 9.6%, Philip Morris declining 0.4% and British American Tobacco  plunging 7.2% in extremely heavy midday trade. Altria and Philip Morris, however, have a "unique competitive advantage" with smokeless iQOS devices. Philip Morris said "iQOS heats the tobacco just enough to release the flavorful nicotine-containing vapor but without burning the tobacco." Even so, one medical journal study found that smoke from heat-not-burn cigarettes have 85% of the nicotine in conventional cigarettes. "We see this as an opportune entry point for long-term investors and would recommend building positions on today's broad weakness," Herzog said. "We also note that PM/MO's premarket tobacco product application with the FDA to commercialize iQOS in the U.S. remains under review." Altria shares have dropped 6.9% over the last three months and Philip Morris shares have risen 5.8%, compared with a 3.6% rise in the S&P 500 .

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from our sale of        shares of Class 
A common stock in this offering will be approximately $     million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable
by us in connection with this offering. This assumes a public offering price of
$     per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover
of this prospectus.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay indebtedness and 
for general corporate purposes.

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of 
$     per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this
offering by $     million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set
forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable by us.


Our Media Networks business is highly competitive. Competition for advertising
revenues is based on the size of the market that the particular medium can
reach, the cost of such advertising and the effectiveness of such medium.

Our television business competes for viewers and revenues with other 
Spanish-language and English-language television stations and networks,
including five English-language broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC,
FOX, and CW) and four Spanish-language broadcast television networks (TEL, ETV,
AZA and MMX) as well as 100+ daily-measured ad-supported cable networks. Many of
these competitors are owned by companies much larger than us. Additionally, some
English-language networks are producing Spanish-language programming and
simulcasting certain programming in English and Spanish. Several MVPDs offer
Spanish-language programming options as well. Our television affiliates located 
near the Mexican border also compete for viewers with television stations 
operated in Mexico, many of which are affiliated with a Televisa network and are
owned by Televisa but outside of our exclusivity rights.

The television broadcasting industry is subject to competition from
video-on-demand, DVD and Blu-ray players, other personal video systems and
fragmentation of viewership driven by the ever expanding cable-network
landscape. Additionally, consumers continue to change viewing habits,
increasingly gravitating towards wireless devices (e.g., smartphones and
tablets), live streaming of short-form and long-form content from the Internet
and online video services. Our broadcast, cable and digital networks compete
with pay content providers such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu and free content
providers such as YouTube and Facebook.

We attribute our large television audience to the size and growth of the U.S.
Hispanic population, the quality of our programming and the quality and
experience of our management. Telemundo, a subsidiary of NBC, a division of
Comcast Corporation, is our largest television competitor that broadcasts
Spanish-language television programming. In most of our DMAs, our affiliates
compete for advertising dollars directly with a station owned by or affiliated
with Telemundo, as well as with other Spanish-language and English-language
stations.

Our digital properties face various competitors, including websites such as
Facebook, YouTube, Google, Telemundo.com, Yahoo! en EspaÃ±ol, MSN Latino,
MaximumTV, ButacaTV, VICE, Vox Media, Business Insider, Time Inc., Conde Nast
Digital, Mashable, The New York Times, The Huffington Post, Buzzfeed and mobile
applications. We also compete for online advertising dollars with social media
providers such as Facebook and Twitter, search engines such as Google, Yahoo! or
Bing and other websites.

Our Radio business competes for audiences and advertising revenues with other
radio stations of all formats. iHeart Media (formerly Clear Channel), the
largest radio operator in the U.S., CBS Radio, Spanish Broadcasting System,
Liberman Broadcasting and Entravision are our largest radio competitors that
broadcast Spanish-language radio programming in several of our DMAs.
Additionally, we face competition from English-language stations that offer
programming targeting Hispanic audiences. iHeart Radio converted several
stations to Hispanic targeted formats, and has established a Hispanic radio
division creating its own iHeart Hispanic Radio Network. Spanish Broadcasting
Systemsâ AIRE Radio Networks syndicates popular Hispanic content and
personalities nationally and in markets where we compete. In addition, the radio
broadcasting industry is subject to competition from (1) Sirius XM Satellite
Radio and other satellite radio services; (2) audio programming by MVPDs and
other digital audio providers and (3) streaming music businesses such as Spotify
and Pandora.

Many of our competitors have more television and radio stations, more Internet
platforms, greater resources (financial or otherwise) and broader relationships
with advertisers than we do. Furthermore, because our English-language
competitors are perceived to reach a broader audience than we do, they have been
able to attract more advertisers and command higher advertising rates than we
have.

We also compete for audience and revenues with other media and direct mail,
newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising and other forms of entertainment and
advertising. We will face additional competitors for advertising revenue, as we
expand our offerings for multicultural and young, diverse audiences.

The rules and policies of the FCC encourage increased competition among
different electronic communications media. As a result of rapidly developing
technology, we may experience increased competition from other free or pay
systems by which information and entertainment are delivered to consumers, such
as direct broadcast satellite and video dial tone services.


Company Description
Our mission is to inform, entertain, and empower Hispanic America.

Univision is the leading media company serving Hispanic America. We produce and
deliver content across multiple media platforms to inform, entertain, and
empower Hispanic America. We have an over 50 year


 multi-generational
relationship with our audience and are the most recognized and trusted brand in
Hispanic America. We earned the highest brand equity score among U.S. media
brands among Spanish-language-dominant and bilingual Hispanics in a brand equity
research study conducted by Burke in 2015. We estimate that we reached an
average of approximately 83 million unduplicated media consumers monthly for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and our commitment to high-quality,
culturally-relevant programming combined with our multi-platform media
properties has enabled us to become the #1 destination for entertainment, sports
events, and news among U.S. Hispanics. Our flagship network, Univision Network,
has been the most-watched U.S. Spanish-language broadcast network since its
ratings were first measured by Nielsen in 1992. We have a strategic relationship
with Grupo Televisa, S.A.B. and its affiliates (âTelevisaâ), the largest media
company in the Spanish-speaking world and a top programming producer, for
exclusive, long-term access to its premium entertainment and sports content in
the U.S.

We serve a young, digitally savvy and socially engaged community. U.S. Hispanics
are the youngest major demographic as of July 2015, have contributed the most to
population growth in the U.S. since April 2010 and have rapidly growing buying
power as of September 2015. Marketers are increasingly targeting Hispanic 
America and its expanding economic, cultural and political influence. We own the
leading and growing portfolio of Spanish-language media platforms in the U.S.
across broadcast and cable television, digital and radio, enhancing our value to
both our distribution and marketing partners as the gateway to Hispanic America.
Our local television and radio stations are among the leading stations in their
markets, regardless of language, and provide us with a unique ability to connect
with our audiences and target advertisers at the local level. We believe our
âmust-seeâ content coupled with our ownership of local television stations
allows us to maximize subscription fees from multichannel video programming
distributors (âMVPDsâ), and to benefit from the largest broadcast spectrum
portfolio of any broadcaster in the U.S. as measured by the number of people 
reached by each megahertz of spectrum (âMHz-Popsâ). We believe we are 
well-positioned for growth and have the opportunity to continue to expand our 
audience and to monetize our attractive audience demographics, leading content 
across multiple platforms and spectrum assets.

Hispanic America continues to be a highly attractive audience demographic,
exhibiting strong growth and economic and political influence in the U.S.,
representing:

â¢ 57 million people as of December 2014, growing to an estimated 77 million by
  2030;                                                                  

â¢ $1.3 trillion of buying power in 2015, projected to grow to $1.7 trillion by 
  2020;                                                                  

â¢ 40% of projected new U.S. household formation from 2015 to 2025;

â¢ approximately 75% of expected U.S. employment growth from 2020 to 2034;

â¢ the youngest major demographic in the U.S. with approximately 60% of the  U.S.
  Hispanic population 34 or younger as of July 2015; and               

â¢ a registered voter base of 15.8 million U.S. Hispanics, which is approximately
  10% of the total voter base as of January 2016, up 15% from 2012 while growth 
  of non-Hispanic voters remained relatively flat over the same period.  

We operate our business through two segments: Media Networks and Radio

 â¢ Media Networks: Our principal segment is Media Networks, which includes 23
   broadcast and cable networks and digital and mobile properties. We operate
   two broadcast television networks. Univision Network is the most-watched  
   broadcast television network among U.S. Hispanics, available in           
   approximately 93% of U.S. Hispanic television households. UniMÃ¡s is among 
   the leading Spanish-language broadcast television networks. In addition,  
   we operate 10 cable networks, including GalavisiÃ³n, the leading           
   Spanish-language cable network among U.S. Hispanics, and Univision        
   Deportes Network, the most-watched Spanish-language sports cable network  
   among U.S. Hispanics. We own and operate 59 local television stations,    
   including stations located in the largest markets in the U.S., which is   
   more owned and operated local television stations than any of the top four
   English-language broadcast networks. In addition, we provide programming  
   to 75 broadcast network station affiliates. Our digital properties consist
   of online and mobile websites and apps, which generated, on average       
   monthly in the second quarter of 2016, 315 million page views.            
   Univision.com is our flagship digital property and is the #1 most visited 
   Spanish-language website among U.S. Hispanics, and Univision Now is our   
   direct-to-consumer internet subscription service. In addition, we have    
   made a series of strategic investments in digital assets that target      
   multicultural and young, diverse audiences including acquiring The Root, a
   controlling interest in The Onion and all of our former joint venture     
   partnerâs interests in Fusion, including its digital properties. In       
   September 2016, we also acquired the assets of Gawker Media Group, Inc.   
   (âGawker Mediaâ) relating to the digital media business of the digital    
   platforms Gizmodo, Jalopnik, Jezebel, Deadspin, Lifehacker and Kotaku,    
   which we are operating as the Gizmodo Media Group (âGMGâ). Our Media      
   Networks segment accounted for approximately 90% of our revenues in 2015. 

â¢ Radio: We have the largest Spanish-language radio group in the U.S. and our 
  stations are frequently ranked #1 or #2 among Spanish-language stations in 
  many major markets. We own and operate 67 radio stations, including stations 
  in 16 of the top 25 DMAs. Our radio stations reach nearly 15 million listeners 
  per week and cover approximately 74% of the U.S. Hispanic population. Our 
  Radio segment also includes Uforia, a comprehensive digital music platform, 
  which includes a total of 67 radio stations (including 14 exclusive digital 
  stations), over 60 playlists categorized by mood and a library of more than 35 
  million songs. Our Radio segment accounted for approximately 10% of our 
  revenues in 2015.          

We have a long standing strategic relationship with Televisa, which owns a
significant equity interest in us. Under our program license agreement with
Televisa, as amended on July 1, 2015 (the âTelevisa PLAâ), we have exclusive
long-term U.S. broadcast and digital rights (with limited exceptions) to
Televisaâs programming, including premium Spanish-language telenovelas, sports,
sitcoms, reality series, news programming, and feature films. In 2015, Televisa
produced over 89,000 hours of programming. Our long-term collaborative
relationship with Televisa provides us with an opportunity to take advantage of
and respond to the evolving demands of our target demographic, and access to
digital media, telenovelas and the broadcast of additional Mexican soccer league
games. We utilize this programming to help establish new cable networks and
digital platforms. Upon consummation of this offering, the term of the Televisa
PLA will continue until the later of 2030 or 7.5 years after Televisa has
voluntarily sold a specified portion of its shares of our common stock, unless
certain change of control events happen, in which case the Televisa PLA will
expire on the later of 2025 or 7.5 years after Televisa has voluntarily sold a
specified portion of its shares of our common stock.
