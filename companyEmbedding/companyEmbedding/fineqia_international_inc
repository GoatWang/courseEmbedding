VANCOUVER, July 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Canada Day Weekend, 2017 – Fineqia International Inc. (the "Company") (CSE: FNQ) (OTCPink: FNQQF) (Frankfurt: FNQA) has announced today that its U.K. subsidiary Fineqia Limited ("Fineqia") is launching a beta version of its new debt and equity platform that brings crowd investors carefully selected and risk-mitigated opportunities, many of which were previously only available to large financial institutions.








Fineqia aims to provide investors with an information advantage and more importantly, a way into carefully selected deals. Being highly selective, only a few quality deals will be shown at any given time.
The Company's Chairman Martin Graham said: "We offer a unique combination of what we believe are quality and low risk offerings only, which would typically only be available to large institutional investors. Our platform is essentially designed to deliver a priority pass for better returns."
The platform is currently running as a beta version and deals will be made available once the site status has changed from a beta to an officially open site.
Fineqia has partnered with JOI Media ("JOI") to develop the platform. JOI's crowdfunding software facilitates the entire investment process from deal origination to investor tax reporting. JOI has already developed compliant crowdfunding platforms in more than 20 countries.

VANCOUVER, Colombie-Britannique, July 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
Fineqia International Inc. (la « Société ») (CSE : FNQ) (OTCPink : FNQQF) (Francfort : FNQA) a annoncé aujourd'hui que sa filiale britannique Fineqia Limited (« Fineqia ») lance une version bêta de sa nouvelle plateforme de créances et de capitaux, qui proposera aux investisseurs participatifs des opportunités soigneusement sélectionnées et moins risquées, dont bon nombre étaient jusqu'alors réservées aux grandes institutions financières.








Fineqia vise à fournir aux investisseurs un avantage sur le plan de l'information et, surtout, un accès à des offres soigneusement sélectionnées. La plateforme étant hautement sélective, seules quelques offres de qualité seront présentées à tout moment.
Martin Graham, président du conseil d'administration de la Société, a déclaré : « Nous proposons des offres caractérisées par une combinaison unique de qualité et de faible risque, qui ne sont généralement disponibles que pour les grands investisseurs institutionnels. Notre plateforme est essentiellement conçue pour fournir un accès prioritaire à de meilleurs retours. »
La plateforme est actuellement en version bêta et des offres seront disponibles une fois que le site quittera son statut de bêta pour être mis en ligne officiellement.
Fineqia a formé un partenariat avec JOI Media (« JOI ») pour développer cette plateforme. Le logiciel de financement participatif de JOI facilite l'intégralité du processus d'investissement, de l'origine des transactions jusqu'aux rapports fiscaux des investisseurs. JOI a développé des plateformes de financement participatif complètes dans plus de 20 pays.

VANCOUVER, March 27, 2017 /CNW/ - Fineqia International Inc. (the "Company" or "Fineqia") (CSE: FNQ) (OTCPink: FNQQF) (Frankfurt: FNQA) is pleased to announce its inclusion in the Composite Index of Canadian Securities Exchange ("the CSE"), following the quarterly rebalancing of the index, effective from the close of trading on Friday, March 17, 2017.
The two-year-old Composite Index is comprised of shares of listed companies that meet market capitalisation, trading and seasoning criteria established by the CSE. A key requirement for consideration into the index is a company's securities need to fall within the top quartile of eligible securities listed on the CSE.
 "We appreciate the recognition from the CSE and believe this is an excellent step forward for us," said Fineqia's CEO Bundeep Singh Rangar. "We will continue to perform at the highest level to ensure further positive growth and maintain our position within the index."
"One of the reasons we introduced the index was to recognize the achievements of CSE listed companies as determined by participants in the market," said the CSE's Senior Vice President Robert Cook. "We are pleased that so many like Fineqia have attained that level of success." 
The CSE Composite Index is a broad indicator of market activity for the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE). It is calculated and published by Solactive AG, a Frankfurt, Germany-based indexer with approximately 350 clients in Europe, America and Asia that counts approximately US$100 billion invested in products linked to indices calculated by the Company globally.
About Fineqia International Inc. 
Fineqia's business model is to provide an online platform and associated services for the placement of debt and equity securities, initially in the UK. The platform will transparently highlight the risks and objectively outline opportunities involved.  For more information, visit www.fineqia.com.
NEITHER THE CANADIAN SECURITIES EXCHANGE NOR ITS REGULATORY SERVICE PROVIDER HAS REVIEWED AND DOES NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THE CONTENT OF THIS NEWS RELEASE.
