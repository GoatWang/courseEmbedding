We conducted a series of meetings across the island country of Mauritius, capped off with a meeting at the State House where company Chief Executive Officer, Roger Baylis-Duffield, had a private meeting with Mauritian President, Professor Ameena Gurib-Fakim. Protext management had been in Mauritius evaluating the potential for conducting a forthcoming human clinical trial on Type II Diabetes.  Mauritius is being evaluated as a trial site because, according to the World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the prevalence of Type II Diabetes in Mauritius in 2015 was a world-leading 16.28%. Worldwide as of 2013, 382 million people, or 8.3% of the adult population have diabetes, with Type II Diabetes making up about 90% of the cases. In 2014, the IDF estimated that diabetes resulted in 4.9 million annual deaths.     What is Phytofare ® and how does it affect diabetes?   A good explanation of green teas strengths over other antioxidant rich foods for use in $TXTM's product Phytofare. Phytofare® has been clinically proven in human studies to provide ten times greater bioavailability, which is the ability of the body to absorb the nutrients, over generic plant extracts. The first product brought to market, Phytofare® catechin complex, is derived from green tea and contains all eight catechins in a highly absorbable biocompatible structure. Where the parent company, Plandaí Biotechnology, focuses on selling Phytofare® as an ingredient to manufacturers in the nutraceutical industry, Plandaí SA will target the pharmaceutical market with a finished product.         Why green tea over other available antioxidant's A good explanation of green teas strengths over other antioxidant rich foods for use in $TXTM's product Phytofare.

ProText Mobility, Inc. Key Developments

ProText Mobility, Inc. has Changed its Name to Protext Pharma, Inc
May 23 17
On May 23, 2017, ProText Mobility, Inc. changed its name to Protext Pharma, Inc.


Protext Mobility, Inc. to Conduct Human Clinical Trial with Its Product Phytofare Catechin Complex
May 4 17
Protext Mobility, Inc. announced that it has signed an agreement with the Centre International de Developpment Pharmaceutique (CIDP) to conduct a human clinical trial with its product Phytofare Catechin Complex, in the country of Mauritius. The study is titled Clinical Trial on Humans to determine the efficacy of Phytofare for lowering HbA1C levels in II Diabetes patients. When glucose builds up in a person's blood, it binds to the hemoglobin in red blood cells. The HbA1C test measures how much glucose is bound over a 2-3 month period to determine average plasma glucose concentration. The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of Phytofare® Catechin Complex for improving the levels of hypoglycemia in people with diabetes as emphasized in the American Diabetes Association's new 2017 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes. The company expects to begin phase-one with a bioavailability study this month with CIC Cynologies to confirm the human clinical study dosage of Phytofare Catechin Complex. Results are anticipated for release in June; then followed by the implementation of the Type-II diabetes human clinical trial in the second half of 2017, to be undertaken by CIDP.


Protext Mobility, Inc. Engages in the Development of Pharmaceutical Applications for the Highly Bioavailable Phytofare®
Mar 7 17
Protext Mobility, Inc. engaged in the development of pharmaceutical applications for the highly bioavailable Phytofare® catechin complex discussed the potential for Phytofare® in treating type II Diabetes. Data from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that green tea catechins, in particularly EGCG, exert anti-obesity effects via several mechanisms including inhibition of adipocyte differentiation and proliferation, reduction of fat absorption, and the reduction in fat mass, tricylglycerides, free fatty acids and total cholesterol. The majority of human intervention studies investigating glucose homeostasis further demonstrate improved glucose levels in response to green tea catechins with potential anti-obesity, anti-diabetic and cardio-protective applications. The greatly improved absorption (bioavailability) of Phytofare® should address the blood plasma barrier issues to help regulate the metabolic issues associated with type II Diabetes.

Protext Mobility, Inc. (PL) Description



Protext Mobility, operates two wholly owned subsidiaries; Plandai Biotechnology South Africa (PTY) LTD. and Cannabis Biosciences, Inc. The Company is engaged in the research and clinical testing of bioceutical products, all natural ingredients formulated for pharmaceutical applications and processed under pharma-grade conditions. Plandai Biotechnology SA, has the exclusive worldwide license to develop pharmaceutical applications and products using the Phytofare catechin complex, which was developed by Plandai Biotechnology, Inc. Phytofare is a highly bioavailable extract produced from live green tea leaves. Our initial product, Phytofare Catechin Complex, has been clinically shown to have 10 times greater bioavailability over generic catechin extracts. Cannabis Biosciences is actively pursuing government licenses and permits that will allow it to use its proprietary processing and extraction technology to commence investigations and produce a full-profile cannabis extract, one that contains both CBD and the precursor acid form of THC (THC-A and THC-B) found in live cannabis plant. The Company's investigations will be designed to show that the Cannabis Biosciences extraction process, which will use live leaf and low temperatures to extract the phyto-chemicals, should leave the acid forms of THC intact, resulting in a non-psychoactive extract with full medicinal potential and having the heightened bioavailability of other Phytofare extracts.

The new business unit, Cannabis Biosciences, will focus on developing cannabis extracts under legal government licenses and permits which the Company is currently pursuing. Plandaí Biotechnology South Africa, the other business unit, is engaged in the research and clinical testing of "bioceutical" products -- all natural ingredients formulated for pharmaceutical applications and processed under pharma-grade conditions. The Company has the exclusive worldwide license to develop pharmaceutical applications and products using the Phytofare® catechin complex produced from green tea grown on the Senteeko estate.Cannabis Biosciences was formed and incorporated by Plandaí Biotechnology in 2013 to legally develop non-psychoactive medicines from live cannabis plant. Using Plandaí's proprietary processing and extraction technology, the company intends to commence investigations in conjunction with independent researchers to develop and validate a full-profile cannabis extract, one that contains both CBD and the precursor acid form of THC (THC-A and THC-B) found in live cannabis plant. The hypothesis is that the resultant extract will have similar, superior bioavailability of other Phytofare® extracts with the added benefit of being non-psychoactive. Several third-party investigations have shown that the precursor acid forms THC-A and THC-B in live cannabis leaf are inherently non-psychoactive and that the process of drying and heating the leaf metabolizes these acid forms into THC, a chemical that triggers the euphoria sought after by recreational users. The Company's investigations will be designed to show that the Cannabis Biosciences extraction process, which will use live leaf and low temperatures to extract the phyto-chemicals, should leave the acid forms of THC intact, resulting in a non-psychoactive extract with full medicinal potential.Roger Baylis-Duffield, Chief Executive Officer of Protext, commented, "Where most pharma companies have chosen to focus on the non-psychoactive CBD chemical, we believe that this strategy limits the potential medical benefits. Recent third party studies have demonstrated the synergistic value of retaining the full chemical profile of cannabis. Our objective is to validate Cannabis Biosciences cannabis extracts to be not only full profile but also non-psychoactive, which will give researchers all of the benefits of cannabis without the unwanted side effects. The acquisition of Cannabis Biosciences by Protext properly aligns our pharmaceutical research under one roof, allowing us to further our cannabis studies as we strive to create a cannabis extract that can increase the well-being and potentially improve the lives of so many people."We encourage our investors and shareholders to connect and engage with us through social media.

Protext Mobility, operates two wholly owned subsidiaries; Plandaí Biotechnology South Africa (SA) and Cannabis Biosciences. The Company is engaged in the research and clinical testing of "bioceutical" products -- all natural ingredients formulated for pharmaceutical applications and processed under pharma-grade conditions. Through its wholly owned subsidiary Plandaí Biotechnology SA, the Company has the exclusive worldwide license to develop pharmaceutical applications and products using the Phytofare® catechin complex, which was developed by Plandaí Biotechnology, Inc. Phytofare® is a highly bioavailable extract produced from live green tea leaves. Our initial product, Phytofare® Catechin Complex, has been clinically shown to have 10 times greater bioavailability over generic catechin extracts. What this means is that Phytofare® can deliver a therapeutic level of catechins, which function as powerful antioxidants, to the system where they remain active for over 24 hours. Plandaí grows green tea on its 7,500 acre Senteeko estate in South Africa, where it produces the proprietary Phytofare® catechin extract in-house, allowing the Company a continuity of supply as well as quality control throughout the entire process. Targeted applications for the Company's products include arthritis, inflammation, anti-viral, and diabetes-related metabolic syndromes.Read MorePlease visit http://www.protextm.co for further information.About Cannabis Biosciences The Company is actively pursuing government licenses and permits that will allow it to use its proprietary processing and extraction technology to commence investigations and produce a full-profile cannabis extract, one that contains both CBD and the precursor acid form of THC (THC-A and THC-B) found in live cannabis plant.

Multivitamins and other supplements can help make up the difference and prevent vitamin and mineral deficiencies. They can also provide more nutrients than diet alone, which may help to protect against or manage certain diseases. Find out a little bit more about what your body needs to stay healthy. What are the most essential vitamins? The following list of vitamins are essential for the body to function properly: Vitamin A is needed for healthy eyes, skin and skeletal tissue. Vitamin B1 (thiamin) helps the body use up fat and produce energy. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is an antioxidant that protects the body s cells protect against free radical damage. Vitamin B3 (niacin) may reduce the risk of heart disease. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is important for hormone production, immune system health and energy. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) helps protect the layer around cells. Vitamin B7 (biotin) aids the metabolism and promotes healthy skin, hair, nails and cells. Vitamin B9 (folate) is necessary for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is essential for the production of healthy red blood and nerve cells. vitamin C is essential for the growth and repair of body tissue. Vitamin D helps with calcium absorption and helps build healthy bones and optimal immune function. Vitamin E protects against free radicals and may also boost the immune system. Vitamin K may help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding while keeping your heart healthy and your bones strong. Choline is important for liver function, nerve function and muscle movement. Optimize your immune system Your immune system serves to protect your body against infection and disease. What you put into our body affects your immune system, and a lack of selected micronutrients can lead to immune deficiency. Vitamins A, C and E help maintain the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts, which acts as a barrier against infection. Vitamin D works with certain white blood cells which are important to the immune system s ability to fight off infection and disease. Selenium acts as an antioxidant to help fight infection and protect the body against oxygen free radical damage. Probiotics help to maintain the integrity of the lining of the intestines, which help to boost immunity. Omega 3 fatty acids are essential for reducing inflammation. Some people have a higher risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. If you've lost weight recently, you may be deficient in a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Be sure to start taking a high-quality multivitamin and mineral supplement. These popular supplements come in a wide variety of forms: pills, capsules, chewable tablets, gummies, drinks (liquids and powders) and more. With so many options, it should be easy to find one that works for you. Vegetarians and vegans If you're a vegetarian, you may have deficiencies in protein, vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D, zinc, iodine, riboflavin, calcium and selenium. Vegans are especially likely to be low in protein, selenium and B12. In addition to a multivitamin and mineral supplement, you might want to consider adding a vegan-friendly protein shake or two to your daily regimen. There are a wide variety of shake powders on the market, typically available in, but not limited to, vanilla, chocolate and strawberry flavors. One scoop of protein powder usually provides approximately 25 grams of protein, but it varies from one supplier to another. Macrobiotic diet If you're on a macrobiotic diet, which is fixed on ideas about the types of food drawn from Zen Buddhism, you may be deficient in vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D and other nutrients. The goal as a macrobiotic is to bring enlightenment, or healthy well-being, by teaching you how to thoughtfully choose what you eat. But it may come at a cost of some important vitamins. As with vegetarians and vegans, consider a solid multivitamin as a nutritional supplement. More support for seniors Seniors living in their own homes are often deficient in vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, calcium and zinc and occasionally vitamin B1 and vitamin B2. Older adults need more calcium and vitamin D to help maintain bone health. Try three daily servings of vitamin D-fortified low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt. Other calcium-rich foods include fortified cereals and fruit juices, dark green leafy vegetables and canned fish. These are all great additions to your daily meals, but be sure to take a multivitamin with age-adjusted doses of nutrients for people aged 50 years and older. Workout warriors For those who like to workout with weights, supplements can aid the recovery process and build muscle. Strength training on a regular basis breaks down your muscles so they can grow back bigger and stronger. Be sure to have a solid meal plan, get plenty of rest between workouts, lots of water and consider a protein supplement in the form of powders that can be mixed or protein bars. You can also add creatine to help build muscle and a variety of other workout supplements to assist with your fitness goals. At Walmart, you'll find a wide selection of vitamins and other supplements to help you keep up with your nutritional needs. Save money.

Medications like prescription drugs and headache tablets are among the most likely things that you find in any medicine cabinet, but not the only things. Medicine takes many forms and can be in tubes, packets and bottles. There are medications specifically for adults, children and babies. Not everything found in a medicine cabinet is even medicine, although they are usually health-related. When you want to stock up your medicine cabinet, we have what you need, all at Every Day Low Prices.Pain relieversPain relievers come in three basic forms: aspirin, acetaminophen and Ibuprofen. A less common form is naproxen. For headaches and joint pain, acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen are most effective. For muscle soreness use ibuprofen or naproxen. All four are effective on back, neck and shoulder pain and migraines.There are also specialty pain relievers that target joint and muscle pain, arthritis pain, menstrual cramps, urinary tract pain or migraine headaches. Some are designed specifically for children. Various pain relievers are designed for taking prior to going to bed since they cause drowsiness. These come in pill, caplet and capsule form and some children's mediation is available in flavored liquid form. There are also balms, creams and sprays that you can use for muscle and other topical pain.Cough, cold and fluWhen you or someone you love gets sick or is getting sick, it helps to have some medicine on hand to help ease the symptoms and lessen the severity and length of the illness. Items to have in your medicine cabinet include decongestants for stuffy noses and congested coughs, cough syrup and cough drops to treat coughs and sore throats, nasal sprays to relieve hay fever and allergy symptoms, chest rubs to reduce congestion and fever reducers to keep fevers from elevating too high. For chest congestion, an expectorant can help loosen phlegm and help you breathe and sleep better. Another item that can help reduce the severity of a cold is medicated vaporizing liquid (you will need an electric or battery-powered vaporizer).Digestion and nauseaFor people who deal with upset stomachs, diarrhea, indigestion and other stomach maladies, there are many medications to alleviate these issues. Antacids and over-the-counter drugs like omeprazole held relieve heartburn, either in pill, chewable tablet, or effervescent tablet form. Laxatives and stool softeners help relieve consitpation and are available in pill, liquid and suppository form. Fiber supplements and anti-diarrheal medications, such as loperamide, are designed to relieve diarrhea.There are also medications that can relieve several of these symptoms if they occur simultaneously. It's helpful to have medications that help relieve nausea or motion sickness.AllergiesAntihistamines and medications, such as fexofenadine, cetirizine, diphenhydramine and loratadine, all available over the counter at Walmart, can relive the symptoms associated with allergies. Whether you are afflicted by grass or tree pollens, pet dander or other air-borne substances, these medications can offer you relief for a few hours or all day. There are nasal sprays that offer immediate allergy relief as well.First aidJust like a fully stocked first aid kid, it always safe to be prepared and keep a good supply of first aid items handy in your medicine cabinet. There are numerous ointments and creams available that help heal cuts faster, relive the pain associated with burns and offer antibacterial and antibiotic properties. With many of these ointments, it is necessary to protect the affected area with bandages, and we have many different brands and styles.Rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide are must-have items for keeping wounds clean and disinfected. For sprains, tape and flexible bandages can help add needed support. For sunburns, there are sprays and creams that lessen the pain and severity of the sunburn. Eye drops can help relieve eye pain, and eye wash can help clear the eyes of foreign objects.Other itemsThe list of other items that are useful in your home's medicine cabinet can run a wide gamut. Dental-related items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, dental floss and mouthwash are common items as are thermometers for checking temperatures. A well-stocked medicine cabinets helps you to be prepared for minor illnesses and first aid. Always talk with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any medications.

            Chinese made off-road machines are now a common feature in the sporting goods section of many big-box retailers, but finding top quality replacement Chinese ATV parts or Chinese dirt bike parts can be more difficult than finding entire ATVs and bikes. Unfortunately the big-box service-after-the-sale philosophy is sometimes discarded along with the credit card receipt. Keeping your Chinese off-roader in good running order is no longer a problem because Monster Scooter Parts carries Chinese pit bike parts, and dirt bike parts, and ATV parts, and almost everything else that might be required to keep you off the road in out in the dirt turning gasoline into noise.We are proud to offer genuine OEM items such as Baja Motorsports parts for about every ATV and dirt bike model that Baja ever sold. We sell Coolster ATV & dirt bike parts, factory original Motovox parts, OEM equivalent TaoTao ATV parts, and a whole lot more. Look through our brand and model pages to see what we have for your bike or ATV. Or you can explore the departments menu on the left side of this page. Whether you need replacement Chinese ATV parts, Chinese dirt bike parts, or Chinese pit bike parts, or any other parts for Chinese made off-road machines, Monster Scooter Parts wants to be your source for the items that keeps your dirt machine running at its very best.
