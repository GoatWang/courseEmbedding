Our development pipeline includes two lead product candidates, ZYN002 and ZYN001, which are being evaluated in five therapeutic indications.
Our development pipeline currently includes two programs studying synthetic cannabinoid therapeutics across multiple therapeutic areas.



ZYN002 – CBD Gel


ZYN002 is the first and only synthetic CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, formulated as a patent-protected permeation-enhanced gel for transdermal delivery through the skin and into the circulatory system. ZYN002 is in Phase 2 clinical development in patients with refractory epilepsy, in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee as well as in patients with Fragile X syndrome. In February 2016, the FDA granted orphan-drug designation of ZYN002 for the treatment of patients with Fragile X syndrome in the US.




ZYN001 – THC Pro-Drug Patch


ZYN001 is a pro-drug of THC that enables transdermal delivery through the skin and into the circulatory system via a patch. A Phase 1 clinical program for ZYN001 was initiated in the first half of 2017.

THC and CBD Safety
Clinical data suggest that THC and CBD have a high therapeutic index with low toxicity.1 In the nabiximols clinical program, dizziness and fatigue were considered very common (> 1/10) adverse events. These occurred in the first four weeks of exposure were mild to moderate and resolved within a few days with continued treatment.2  Nabiximols are not recommended for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age due to lack of safety and efficacy data. In non-clinical studies, effects were observed at exposures considered in excess of human exposure suggesting little relevance to clinical use.2

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that leads to wear and tear of the joints and affects the cartilage, joint lining, ligaments and bone.
It is the most common form of joint disease and tends to occur most often in the hand joints, spine, hip, knees and great toes. It is characterized by the breakdown of the joint cartilage, bony changes in the joints and deterioration of the tendons and ligaments leading to pain and inflammation of the joint lining.

Our development pipeline includes two lead product candidates, ZYN002 and ZYN001, which are being evaluated in five therapeutic indications.
Our development pipeline currently includes two programs studying synthetic cannabinoid therapeutics across multiple therapeutic areas.



ZYN002 – CBD Gel


ZYN002 is the first and only synthetic CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, formulated as a patent-protected permeation-enhanced gel for transdermal delivery through the skin and into the circulatory system. ZYN002 is in Phase 2 clinical development in patients with refractory epilepsy, in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee as well as in patients with Fragile X syndrome. In February 2016, the FDA granted orphan-drug designation of ZYN002 for the treatment of patients with Fragile X syndrome in the US.




ZYN001 – THC Pro-Drug Patch


ZYN001 is a pro-drug of THC that enables transdermal delivery through the skin and into the circulatory system via a patch. A Phase 1 clinical program for ZYN001 was initiated in the first half of 2017.

THC and CBD Safety
Clinical data suggest that THC and CBD have a high therapeutic index with low toxicity.1 In the nabiximols clinical program, dizziness and fatigue were considered very common (> 1/10) adverse events. These occurred in the first four weeks of exposure were mild to moderate and resolved within a few days with continued treatment.2  Nabiximols are not recommended for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age due to lack of safety and efficacy data. In non-clinical studies, effects were observed at exposures considered in excess of human exposure suggesting little relevance to clinical use.2

Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Achieves Target Enrollment in Exploratory Phase 2 Trial of ZYN002 in Fragile X Syndrome
- Top-line data from this study remains on track to report in September 2017 -



















June 08, 2017 07:30 ET

 | Source: Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc.






DEVON, Pa., June  08, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZYNE), a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative transdermal synthetic cannabinoid treatments, today announced that it has met its enrollment target of 16 patients in its Phase 2 FAB-C (Treatment of Fragile X Syndrome Anxiety and Behavioral Challenges with CBD) clinical trial evaluating ZYN002 cannabidiol (CBD) gel in children with Fragile X syndrome (FXS). ZYN002 CBD gel is the first and only patent-protected, synthetic CBD that is formulated as a permeation-enhanced gel for transdermal delivery, and was awarded orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment for FXS. Patients between the ages of 6 and 17 years with Fragile X syndrome have been enrolled in the exploratory FAB-C trial, which is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ZYN002 CBD gel administered over a 12-week period in FXS. The study is evaluating 50 mg of CBD in ZYN002 4.2% gel once daily, which may be titrated up to 125 mg two times per day during the six-week titration period. Between weeks six and twelve, patients will receive a maintenance dose of 50 mg, 100 mg or 250 mg daily of CBD in ZYN002 4.2% gel. The primary outcome measures include changes in anxiety, depression and mood as measured by the ADAMS scale, a patient reported outcomes questionnaire that has been validated in FXS. Other measurements that are being observed include the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and visual analog scale (VAS) to assess for hyperactivity/impulsivity. “This achievement marks a key milestone for us and for families facing the challenges of Fragile X syndrome,” said Armando Anido, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Zynerba. “Fragile X is a devastating genetic disorder for patients and their caregivers. We believe that synthetic CBD holds great therapeutic promise in this setting, as it may compensate for the dysregulation of the endocannabinoid pathway, and in doing so may treat many of the associated neurological symptoms. We look forward to reporting data from this trial in September of this year.” Fragile X syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder and the most common inherited intellectual disability in males and a significant cause of intellectual disability in females. It is caused by a mutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation gene located on the X chromosome and leads to dysregulation of the endocannabinoid pathway including the reduction in endogenous cannabinoids (2-AG and anandamide). The disorder negatively affects synaptic function, plasticity and neuronal connections, and results in a spectrum of intellectual disabilities, social anxiety and memory problems. In the US, there are about 71,000 patients suffering with FXS. About ZYN002 CBD Gel Zynerba’s ZYN002 CBD gel is the first and only synthetic CBD formulated as a patent-protected permeation-enhanced gel and is being studied in adult epilepsy patients with focal seizures, in osteoarthritis and in children with FXS. ZYN002 is a clear, permeation-enhanced gel that is designed to provide consistent, controlled drug delivery transdermally with once- or twice-daily dosing. Transdermal therapeutics are absorbed through the skin directly into the systemic circulation, avoiding first-pass liver metabolism and potentially enabling lower dosage levels of active pharmaceutical ingredients and rapid and reliable absorption with high bioavailability. In addition, transdermal delivery avoids the gastrointestinal tract and potential stomach acid degradation of CBD into THC (associated with psychoactive effects), as demonstrated in a Zynerba-sponsored in vitro study. About Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ZYNE) is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing proprietary next-generation synthetic cannabinoid therapeutics formulated for transdermal delivery. Zynerba is developing therapeutic candidates based on proprietary transdermal technologies that, if successfully developed, may allow sustained, consistent and controlled delivery of therapeutic levels of two cannabinoids: cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Transdermal delivery has the potential to reduce adverse effects associated with oral dosing. ZYN002, the Company’s CBD gel, is the first and only synthetic CBD formulated as a patent-protected permeation-enhanced gel. In March 2017, the Company completed enrollment in the Phase 2 STAR 1 (Synthetic Transdermal Cannabidiol for the Treatment of Epilepsy) clinical trial of ZYN002 CBD gel in refractory epilepsy patients with focal seizures, the most common form of epilepsy in adults. Also in March 2017, the Phase 2 STOP (Synthetic Transdermal Cannabidiol for the Treatment of Knee Pain due to Osteoarthritis) clinical trial in patients with knee pain due to osteoarthritis was fully enrolled. In June 2017, the Company completed target enrollment in its exploratory Phase 2 FAB-C (Treatment of Fragile X Syndrome Anxiety and Behavioral Challenges with CBD) clinical trial in children with Fragile X syndrome. Zynerba is also developing ZYN001, which utilizes a synthetically manufactured pro-drug of THC. A Phase 1 clinical study for ZYN001 is planned to begin by the end of the first half of 2017.

Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We may, in some cases, use terms such as “predicts,” “believes,” “potential,” “proposed,” “continue,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “plans,” “intends,” “may,” “could,” “might,” “will,” “should” or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes to identify these forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to numerous important factors, risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events or results to differ materially from the Company’s current expectations. For example, there can be no guarantee that the Company will obtain approval for ZYN002 or ZYN001 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or foreign regulatory authorities; even if ZYN002 or ZYN001 are approved, the Company may not be able to obtain the label claims that it is seeking from the FDA. In addition, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to support its operating plan for as long as anticipated. Management’s expectations and, therefore, any forward-looking statements in this press release could also be affected by risks and uncertainties relating to a number of other factors, including the following: the success, cost and timing of the Company’s product development activities, studies and clinical trials; the success of competing products that are or become available; the Company’s ability to commercialize its product candidates; the size and growth potential of the markets for the Company’s product candidates, and the Company’s ability to service those markets; the Company’s ability to develop sales and marketing capabilities, whether alone or with potential future collaborators; the rate and degree of market acceptance of the Company’s product candidates; and the Company’s expectations regarding its ability to obtain and adequately maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for its product candidates. This list is not exhaustive and these and other risks are described in the Company’s periodic reports, including the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at www.sec.gov. Any forward-looking statements that the Company makes in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release. The Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this press release.Zynerba Contacts

Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Key Developments

Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Initiates its ZYN001 Phase 1 Clinical Program
Jun 26 17
On June 26, 2017, Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that it has initiated its ZYN001 Phase 1 clinical program to study the company's
patent-protected, pro-drug of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) delivered via a transdermal patch. This study will assess single and multiple rising doses of several formulations of ZYN001 to identify the optimal dose to take into Phase 2 studies. The initiation of the ZYN001 clinical program is an important milestone for the Company, as the company now have two clinical stage assets which upon approval may address serious unmet medical needs in a variety of disease settings, said Armando Anido, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Zynerba. The company believe that ZYN001 will be important in a number of pain indications, given THC's known impact on pain transmission and analgesic effect in patients suffering from chronic pain. Transdermal patch delivery offers unique advantages to patients, including the potential for more consistent, sustained delivery and better tolerability of THC. This first in man study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial. First, the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of ZYN001 versus placebo will be evaluated. Several formulations and patch wear times ranging from 24 hours to 7 days will be assessed in up to 48 healthy subjects. Based on results from the single dose portion of this trial, two formulations will be evaluated in multiple patch applications for 14 days in up to 32 healthy subjects who will be randomized 3:1 to ZYN001 or placebo. The goal is to deliver constant levels of THC to optimize efficacy while minimizing CNS side effects. With the successful completion of this single and multiple dose study, a Phase 2 program for ZYN001 in fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain is planned to start in the second half of 2017.


Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces Enrollment Target of 16 Patients in Phase 2 FAB-C (Treatment of Fragile X Syndrome Anxiety and Behavioral Challenges with CBD) Clinical Trial Evaluating ZYN002 Cannabidiol (CBD) Gel in Children with Fragile X Syndrome
Jun 8 17
Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that it has met its enrollment target of 16 patients in its Phase 2 FAB-C (Treatment of Fragile X Syndrome Anxiety and Behavioral Challenges with CBD) clinical trial evaluating ZYN002 cannabidiol (CBD) gel in children with Fragile X syndrome (FXS). ZYN002 CBD gel is the first and only patent-protected, synthetic CBD that is formulated as a permeation-enhanced gel for transdermal delivery, and was awarded orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment for FXS. Patients between the ages of 6 and 17 years with Fragile X syndrome have been enrolled in the exploratory FAB-C trial, which is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ZYN002 CBD gel administered over a 12-week period in FXS. The study is evaluating 50 mg of CBD in ZYN002 4.2% gel once daily, which may be titrated up to 125 mg two times per day during the six-week titration period. Between weeks six and twelve, patients will receive a maintenance dose of 50 mg, 100 mg or 250 mg daily of CBD in ZYN002 4.2% gel. The primary outcome measures include changes in anxiety, depression and mood as measured by the ADAMS scale, a patient reported outcomes questionnaire that has been validated in FXS. Other measurements that are being observed include the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and visual analog scale (VAS) to assess for hyperactivity/impulsivity. Fragile X syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder and the most common inherited intellectual disability in males and a significant cause of intellectual disability in females. It is caused by a mutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation gene located on the X chromosome and leads to dysregulation of the endocannabinoid pathway including the reduction in endogenous cannabinoids (2-AG and anandamide). The disorder negatively affects synaptic function, plasticity and neuronal connections, and results in a spectrum of intellectual disabilities, social anxiety and memory problems. In the US, there are about 71,000 patients suffering with FXS.

Why Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc. Is Tanking Today
Shares dropped after disappointing pricing details were released from the company's secondary common stock offering.

What happened
After Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ZYNE)released the pricing information of its recently announced secondary common stock offering, its shares fell by more than 16% as of 11:20 a.m. EST on Thursday.
So what
Zynerba Pharmaceuticals announced that it is selling 2.8 million shares of its common stock at a price of $18.00 per share. The offering is expected to net the company slightly more than $50 million. In addition, the underwriters of the deal are also being granted a 30-day option to purchase up to 420,000 additional shares of common stock, which could potentially pad its bank account by another $7 million.
Traders are not reacting kindly to this news because Zynerba's stock ended Wednesday's trading session at $22.46. Thus, the pricing terms of the deal suggest that the company was forced to offer a 25% discount in order to attract enough demand from investors. That's not exactly an encouraging sign.
Zynerba said that the proceeds of the deal will be used to fund the clinical development its two transdermal synthetic cannabinoid product candidates -- which are called ZYN002 and ZYN001 -- as well as for general corporate purposes.
The markets responded to the disappointing pricing terms by knocking down the company's share price by double digits.





Now what

After this transaction is complete, Zynerba's cash balance should exceed $80 million. If its current spending levels hold, then it should easily have enough capital to fund itself for at least two more years. That should be enough time for the company to make a lot of progress on its clinical development. 
Here's a look at Zynerba's pipeline as it stands today.

ZYN002 remains the most interesting drug for investors to watch since it is nearing the end of two phase 2 clinical trials. This product candidate is a cannabinoid-based get that delivers its payload through the skin. The company believes that it could be used to treat a variety of diseases such as refractory epilepsy, osteoarthritis of the knee, and Fragile X syndrome. With top-line results for its STAR 1 and STOP trials expected to be released in the next few months, investors won't have to wait long to see how this interesting product candidate performs in the clinic. However, until those results are released, I'd suggest that potential shareholder should keep Zynerba as a watchlist-only stock for now.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
