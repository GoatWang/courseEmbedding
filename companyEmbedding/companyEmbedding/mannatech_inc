 Our Story
















THE MANNATECH STORY
HISTORY





Saying  nothing has changed since we were founded in 1994 would be a lie. While we do still  create some of the best real-food supplements on the market, the science we  pioneered has grown and the number of people who have experienced a  transformation through our products has soared. The testimony alone of those  who have earned the freedom of an additional income source with our  life-changing opportunity continues to reinforce the power of our products.  When you make something this good, people take notice. 
Over  the past 20 years, we’ve expanded our reach to over 25 countries globally.  We’ve earned over 100 global patents for our technology. We’ve added products  to meet new demands. We’ve faced scrutiny from naysayers, and have overcome. In  short, we’ve thrived. 
Yet,  some things haven’t changed. We still boast an uncompromising promise to quality.  We still offer one of the best compensation plans in the industry. And, most  importantly, we still desire to do the right thing. That passion can be seen in  our partnership with the Mission 5 Million (M5M) Foundation, whose goal is to  see 5 million children in need given proper nutrition with our real-food  products. For each purchase made, Mannatech makes a donation to the M5M  Foundation to help provide vital nutrients to malnourished children across the  world. 
We like to think of ourselves as a 22-year-old startup  company: fresh, innovative and energetic, but with the wisdom that comes  through the experiences of an established and successful business. Come join  our startup and become part of the transformation. We can’t wait to write you  into our story.

Mannatech, Incorporated, is a multinational multi-level marketing firm engaged in research, development, and distribution of "glyconutrients," the company's name for blends of plant-sourced saccharides.[2] Mannatech was founded in November 1993 by Samuel L. Caster and is headquartered in Coppell, Texas.[3] It operates in 24 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, countries in Asia, Africa, and within the EU.[4][a] The company's stock is traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol MTEX. Mannatech employs 310 people and sells its products through approximately 229,000 active independent sales associates.[1]
In 2006, Forbes magazine named Mannatech the No. 5 company on its annual list of the "200 Best Small Companies"[5] and in 2007 Mannatech was ranked 12th in BusinessWeek magazine's 2007 list of America's "Top 100 Hot Growth Small Companies."[6] The scientific validity of Mannatech's key product Ambrotose has been called into question by several researchers,[7][8][9][10][11] and the company was the focus of a 2005 class action lawsuit (settled in 2008) for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act,[12] and a 2007 investigation (settled in 2009) by the Texas attorney general for alleged violations of that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[13]

Products[edit]
As of July 2016, the company offered 28 nutritional supplement products, two topical products, nine skin care products, and eleven weight management/physical fitness products. Mannatech is most widely known for Ambrotose, its glyconutritional dietary supplement, which is a patented blend of plant-sourced saccharides used in its line of Ambrotose products. Glyconutritionals were formulated to support cellular communication by positively impacting human glycoforms, a claim that has generated controversy among some members of the scientific community.[7] In an SEC filing, the company stated that its products "are formulated with predominately  [sic] naturally-occurring, plant-derived, carbohydrate-based ingredients that are designed to use nutrients working through normal physiology to help achieve and maintain optimal health and wellness, rather than developing synthetic, carbohydrate-based products, as other companies are doing."[14]
Scientific evaluation[edit]
Independent commentary[edit]
The opinion of independent glycobiologists is that the body cannot digest Ambrotose, as it lacks the enzymes needed.[7]
Prominent glycobiologist Ronald Schnaar told 20/20 in a June 1, 2007 interview, "All of the sugar building blocks that we need in our body are made from the most common foods we eat."[8][15] Hudson Freeze, a leading glycobiologist, said this about glyconutrients: "There are authentic, scientific studies that have looked at people drinking these kinds of materials, and it doesn't really do anything except increase flatulence."[8][16] Freeze is a member of the editorial board of Glycobiology, and Schnaar serves as editor-in-chief.[17] Schnaar and Freeze published a critique of Mannatech's products in Glycobiology in 2008, describing the lack of published clinical benefits of the "partially purified polydisperse plant polysaccharides" found in "Ambrotose Complex."[9]
An article in Glycobiology described the potential for the public to be misled about the science of glycobiology by the nebulous "glyconutrient" term.[10] The author expressed concern that the public could be susceptible to the "scientific-sounding label" of glyconutrient, which may "generate a feeling of security and credibility ... despite the lack of acceptance among many glycobiologists of the term." In November 2007, Science published an article in its "News Focus" section detailing the scientific controversy surrounding Mannatech.[11] It included criticisms and comments from glycobiologists, including Ajit Varki, Raymond Dwek, Freeze, and Schnaar.
According to the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, "Mannatech and its founder have been charged by the Texas Attorney General for deceptive trade practices that exaggerated the products' health benefits."[18] Ambrotose has been "promoted aggressively to cancer patients" on the basis that it can help cellular health and boost the immune system, but that "strong scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking".[18]
Company-funded studies[edit]
Mannatech has sponsored pre-clinical and clinical research on their products.[19] The company states that these studies indicate that the products can be broken down into smaller, absorbable fragments by GI tract bacteria[20] and can modify human serum glycosylation profiles.[21] Additional studies sponsored by the company have indicated that the products also exert positive prebiotic effects[22] and induce positive effects on human brain wave activity, cognition,[23] mood, and memory.[24][25]
Marzorati and Possemiers employed human gastrointestinal tract simulations and microbiological analysis to show that Ambrotose complex and Advanced Ambrotose powder exerted positive prebiotic effects. Both products exhibited selective fermentability throughout the entire colon with a positive and selective bifidus factor. They also demonstrated the possibility of enhancing species belonging to Bacteroidetes, a phylum recently associated with body weight management.[22]
A five-week combined Phase 1 and 2 open label, forced titration dose response study of 21 healthy adults suggested that the Ambrotose AO dietary supplement was safe and raised serum Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) by 36.6%. In a subsequent 21-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 25 healthy adults, Ambrotose AO capsules increased two measures of antioxidant capacity in the blood: ORAC and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC).[26]
Two clinical trials (one conducted in the U.S. and one in Australia) investigated the effect of Ambrotose complex on brain function. Stancil and Hicks conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Ambrotose in 62 healthy young adults, and reported that a single one-tablespoon serving of Ambrotose complex significantly improved visual discrimination and working memory.[24] A trial in 109 healthy middle-aged adults conducted by Best (a Mannatech-funded researcher) and colleagues[27] showed that Ambrotose complex powder (4 grams/day for 12 weeks) significantly improved memory and psychological well-being.[25]
Public scrutiny[edit]
Securities Exchange Act class-action lawsuit[edit]
The company has been known for its literature, websites, and multi-level marketing with claims of scientific links to cellular glycobiology long disputed by relevant individual Nobel prize winners.[28] On March 1, 2005 a jury trial was demanded[29] and on September 9, 2005 a class-action lawsuit was filed against Mannatech for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act. The plaintiff class accused Mannatech of violating the act by "issuing a series of material misrepresentations"; specifically: failing to control its sales associates and allowing them to make false claims concerning the efficacy of Mannatech products. This caused a misleading price inflation of the company's stock.[30] The plaintiffs consisted of the purchasers of Mannatech stock during the period August 10, 2004 through July 30, 2007.[12] On March 20, 2008, Mannatech settled the class-action lawsuit by agreeing to pay $11.25 million to the plaintiff class. As part of the settlement, Mannatech admitted no wrongdoing.[31]
Texas Attorney General civil complaint[edit]
Mannatech came under investigation by the Texas Attorney General on October 27, 2006 for alleged violations of that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[32] Samuel L. Caster, Mannatech's founder and chief executive officer at the time, stated: "We walk the fine line of always stating our case appropriately and always training our people: We're not into the treatment, cure or mitigation of disease. We're into the improvement of quality of life. Now, who can benefit from good nutrition? Sick people, well people, everybody. Everybody benefits from good nutrition."[32]
On July 5, 2007, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott formally charged Mannatech, MannaRelief, Sam Caster, and Reginald McDaniel, the company's medical director, with operating an illegal marketing scheme in violation of state law.[33] A press release stated, "Today's enforcement action stems from a large-scale investigation by state authorities, who examined Mannatech's dubious claims about the health benefits of its products."[13] In response to the civil complaint, Mannatech expanded its compliance department and began to provide periodic reports to the Attorney General's office to ensure that the marketing efforts of its affiliate network adhere to appropriate guidelines.[34]
Mannatech settled the civil complaint on February 26, 2009 by agreeing to pay $4 million in restitution to clients who purchased products and $2 million to the state to cover its costs in the case. In addition, Sam Caster agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty and steer clear of any type of leadership position or employment relationship with Mannatech for five years.[35][36] When discussing the settlement at a news conference, Abbot stated, "Bottom line, this is a warning to the general public: Be wary of phony claims of magic cure-all pills or false hope in a bottle. You could be duped into purchasing something that has no real effect and no real value."[37] Mannatech did not admit wrongdoing; settling was easier than debating Abbott, according to then-CEO Wayne Badovinus.[citation needed] "If they do it again, we will ensure they get put out of business," Abbott said.[38]
One year later, Mannatech Co-CEO Robert Sinnott reflected on the ramifications of the legal action, saying, "The civil action related mainly to some actions by our salesforce. We were embarrassed and also financially impacted by the attorney general suit. We learned from that chapter and it is closed. We've reached a settlement and we've paid the fees associated with it. We've done everything in our power to correct that and make sure we're in compliance in the future."[39]
ABC investigation[edit]
A 20/20 undercover investigation that aired June 1, 2007 on ABC Television showed Mannatech's sales associates teaching sales recruits how to target Mannatech products to patients with specific illnesses in a manner that purportedly does not violate U.S. federal law, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, by avoiding direct claims that the products cure any particular diseases.[8] Mannatech CEO Sam Caster was interviewed for the show and told 20/20 that Mannatech makes no specific health claims about its products. "I don't think dietary supplements treat, cure, mitigate anything. It is not meant to substitute a doctor's oversight, but it plays an important role in the whole health equation."[8]
Company losses[edit]
Mannatech announced in August 2007 that company founder Sam Caster was stepping down as CEO of Mannatech,[40] to be replaced by Wayne Badovinus as the new chief executive. Several corporate initiatives were undertaken, but after 17 months on the job Badovinus resigned in December 2009.[41]
Another member of the board resigned shortly after.[42] Mannatech's Chief Science Officer Robert Sinnott and Mannatech's chief financial officer Steve Fenstermacher were named Co-CEOs.[43] Fenstermacher later resigned.[44]
Publicity over the company's lawsuits began to damage the balance sheets and stock performance.[41] After profits of $32 million in 2006 and $6.6 million in 2007, Mannatech reported a $12.6 million loss in 2008 and a $17.3 million loss in 2009.[45] By mid-year 2010, one quarter of Mannatech's sales were gone.[45] 2010 losses were $10.6 million.[46] As the company's market capitalizations continued to fall, S&P Indices dropped it from the S&P 600 Index, stating "They are no longer representative of the small cap market space."[47] Recruiting efforts continued dropping in 2011, widening company losses to $20.6 million.[48]
Illegal marketing by U.K. physician[edit]
As reported by the British Medical Journal, Mannatech distributor Vivienne Balonwu, a U.K. general practitioner, was found by the U.K. General Medical Council panel to have "abused her power as a doctor" after it was determined that she had illegally promoted and sold the company's glyconutrients to patients as a treatment for medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and stroke-related complications. Following patient complaints about her marketing of the products in 2006, Balonwu was dismissed by her employer Harmoni, a medical services company, and the GMC panel imposed a 15-month penalty period during which she was "to avoid private or short term locum work" and "to complete a supervised personal development plan to tackle shortcomings in her practice.[49]
Ben Carson[edit]
From 2004 until early 2014, neurosurgeon and conservative speaker Ben Carson made videos and spoke at company events promoting Mannatech and its products.
After undergoing surgery for prostate cancer on August 7, 2002[50] Carson claimed in an interview the following November that the surgery had successfully removed all cancerous tissue and that he was completely cured of the disease.[51] However, in 2004, in a speech at a Mannatech event, he credited the company's products with the disappearance of his cancer symptoms.[52][53]
His most recent paid speech for the company was in 2013, for which he was paid $42,000. His image appeared on the corporation's website in 2014,[52] and in the same year he praised their "glyconutrient" supplements in a PBS special ("The Missing Link – The Science of Brain Health"), sponsored by a group of Mannatech distributors, that was subsequently featured on the site.[54]
Carson delivered the keynote address at a Mannatech distributor convention in 2011 during which he said that the company had donated funds to help him obtain a coveted endowed chair post at Johns Hopkins Medicine: ". . . three years ago I had an endowed chair bestowed upon me and uh, it requires $2.5 million to do an endowed chair and I'm proud to say that part of that $2.5 million came from Mannatech." In October 2015, Carson's campaign team said that "there was no contribution from Mannatech to Johns Hopkins", and that his statement had been "a legitimate mistake on his part. Confusion. He had been doing some fundraising for the hospital and some other chairs about that time, and he simply got things mixed up."[55]
During the CNBC GOP debate on October 28, 2015, Carson was asked about his relationship with Mannatech. He replied, "That's easy to answer. I didn't have any involvement with Mannatech. Total propaganda. I did a couple speeches for them. I did speeches for other people—they were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say I had any kind of relation with them. Do I take the product? Yes. I think it is a good product."[56] Politifact rated Carson's denial of any involvement as "false", pointing to his paid speeches for Mannatech and his appearances in promotional videos in which he gave favorable reviews to its products, despite not being "an official spokesman or sales associate".[57] When the CNBC moderator commented that Carson was on Mannatech's website, he replied that he had not given his permission. Earlier, he had said that he was unaware of the company's legal history.[58]
On November 3, 2015, Mannatech said on its website that for compliance with Federal campaign finance regulations the company had removed all references to Carson before he announced his bid for the presidency.[59]
Rafael Cruz[edit]
From 1993 to 2009, Rafael Bienvenido Cruz, father of presidential candidate Rafael Edward "Ted" Cruz, was a top salesman for Mannatech.[60][61]
Sam Caster[edit]
Prior to Mannatech[edit]
Samuel L. Caster is the founder and former Chairman of the board of directors of Mannatech. His first major business venture, Eagle Shield, was an insulation product that claimed to utilize new technology developed by NASA and could reduce heating and cooling costs by up to 40%. In May 1988, the Attorney General of Texas concluded that the product's technology long predated NASA and did not reduce consumers' bills in the amounts advertised.[62][63] Caster agreed to cease the misleading claims made about Eagle Shield.[29] Caster's second product, the "Electracat," was sold as a pest control device. The Electracat reportedly emitted pulsed vibrations that repelled rats, crickets, snakes, ticks, spiders, mosquitoes, and scorpions. However, in January 1991, the Attorney General of Texas investigated the product and found that the Electracat emitted no vibrations whatsoever. The Attorney General declared, "The device is a hoax, and stands on the same scientific footing as a perpetual motion machine."[62][63] Caster was ordered to stop selling the Electracat and to reimburse the state $125,000 in investigative costs.[64]
Mannatech's inception[edit]
Caster then started Mannatech in 1993, as Congress prepared to pass the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which made feasible the profitable marketing of a wider spectrum of dietary supplements.[65]

On August 22, 2007, Sam Caster resigned as CEO of Mannatech.[40] On October 19, 2007, it was reported that the company had fired Grant Thornton LLP as its auditor after the accounting firm demanded that Mannatech remove Sam Caster from all responsibilities.[66] Sam Caster was barred by the attorney general of Texas from serving as a director, officer, or employee of Mannatech for five years—from February 2009 until February 2014.[62] Caster was also barred from taking a role in any other multi-level marketing programs during that time. Despite this, then-CEO Wayne Badovinus stated Caster would work as a consultant answering directly to him.[37] The attorney general's office agreed Caster could serve as an outside consultant to the company.[62]
In March 2014, Caster appeared as main speaker at a Mannatech videoconference event with sales associates for the company's new skin rejuvenation product. Introduced as the company's founder and "visionary," he explained the company's new product and his role in its creation. "Oh my gosh, This stuff really works." he said, of the product. "No one could have predicted it would have that immediate an impact."[62]
In august 2016 Mannatech resolved its differences with Sam Caster and his consulting company, Wonder Enterprises, LLC. Caster, who left Mannatech in 2014, and Mannatech have ended arbitration proceedings. Mannatech has agreed to not pursue its rights to enforce certain covenants under the prior consulting agreements with Caster and Wonder Enterprises.[67]
MannaRelief Ministries[edit]
MannaRelief Ministries is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 1999 by Sam Caster.[68] William A. Mullens, Caster's brother-in-law, serves as MannaRelief's Executive Director, and Caster's wife, Linda, serves as chairman of the board.[69] MannaRelief receives a portion of the proceeds from Mannatech products purchased on "automatic order", and in turn distributes PhytoBlend powder (a dietary supplement purchased at cost from Mannatech[69]) to various unidentified orphanages and international relief organizations.[70][71][72][73] From 2009 to 2011, Manntech provided a total of $1.5 million in cash donations to MannaRelief, and MannaRelief purchased $1.6 million worth of products from Mannatech.[69]

Mannatech, Incorporated, is a multinational multi-level marketing firm engaged in research, development, and distribution of "glyconutrients," the company's name for blends of plant-sourced saccharides.[2] Mannatech was founded in November 1993 by Samuel L. Caster and is headquartered in Coppell, Texas.[3] It operates in 24 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, countries in Asia, Africa, and within the EU.[4][a] The company's stock is traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol MTEX. Mannatech employs 310 people and sells its products through approximately 229,000 active independent sales associates.[1]
In 2006, Forbes magazine named Mannatech the No. 5 company on its annual list of the "200 Best Small Companies"[5] and in 2007 Mannatech was ranked 12th in BusinessWeek magazine's 2007 list of America's "Top 100 Hot Growth Small Companies."[6] The scientific validity of Mannatech's key product Ambrotose has been called into question by several researchers,[7][8][9][10][11] and the company was the focus of a 2005 class action lawsuit (settled in 2008) for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act,[12] and a 2007 investigation (settled in 2009) by the Texas attorney general for alleged violations of that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[13]

Products[edit]
As of July 2016, the company offered 28 nutritional supplement products, two topical products, nine skin care products, and eleven weight management/physical fitness products. Mannatech is most widely known for Ambrotose, its glyconutritional dietary supplement, which is a patented blend of plant-sourced saccharides used in its line of Ambrotose products. Glyconutritionals were formulated to support cellular communication by positively impacting human glycoforms, a claim that has generated controversy among some members of the scientific community.[7] In an SEC filing, the company stated that its products "are formulated with predominately  [sic] naturally-occurring, plant-derived, carbohydrate-based ingredients that are designed to use nutrients working through normal physiology to help achieve and maintain optimal health and wellness, rather than developing synthetic, carbohydrate-based products, as other companies are doing."[14]
Scientific evaluation[edit]
Independent commentary[edit]
The opinion of independent glycobiologists is that the body cannot digest Ambrotose, as it lacks the enzymes needed.[7]
Prominent glycobiologist Ronald Schnaar told 20/20 in a June 1, 2007 interview, "All of the sugar building blocks that we need in our body are made from the most common foods we eat."[8][15] Hudson Freeze, a leading glycobiologist, said this about glyconutrients: "There are authentic, scientific studies that have looked at people drinking these kinds of materials, and it doesn't really do anything except increase flatulence."[8][16] Freeze is a member of the editorial board of Glycobiology, and Schnaar serves as editor-in-chief.[17] Schnaar and Freeze published a critique of Mannatech's products in Glycobiology in 2008, describing the lack of published clinical benefits of the "partially purified polydisperse plant polysaccharides" found in "Ambrotose Complex."[9]
An article in Glycobiology described the potential for the public to be misled about the science of glycobiology by the nebulous "glyconutrient" term.[10] The author expressed concern that the public could be susceptible to the "scientific-sounding label" of glyconutrient, which may "generate a feeling of security and credibility ... despite the lack of acceptance among many glycobiologists of the term." In November 2007, Science published an article in its "News Focus" section detailing the scientific controversy surrounding Mannatech.[11] It included criticisms and comments from glycobiologists, including Ajit Varki, Raymond Dwek, Freeze, and Schnaar.
According to the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, "Mannatech and its founder have been charged by the Texas Attorney General for deceptive trade practices that exaggerated the products' health benefits."[18] Ambrotose has been "promoted aggressively to cancer patients" on the basis that it can help cellular health and boost the immune system, but that "strong scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking".[18]
Company-funded studies[edit]
Mannatech has sponsored pre-clinical and clinical research on their products.[19] The company states that these studies indicate that the products can be broken down into smaller, absorbable fragments by GI tract bacteria[20] and can modify human serum glycosylation profiles.[21] Additional studies sponsored by the company have indicated that the products also exert positive prebiotic effects[22] and induce positive effects on human brain wave activity, cognition,[23] mood, and memory.[24][25]
Marzorati and Possemiers employed human gastrointestinal tract simulations and microbiological analysis to show that Ambrotose complex and Advanced Ambrotose powder exerted positive prebiotic effects. Both products exhibited selective fermentability throughout the entire colon with a positive and selective bifidus factor. They also demonstrated the possibility of enhancing species belonging to Bacteroidetes, a phylum recently associated with body weight management.[22]
A five-week combined Phase 1 and 2 open label, forced titration dose response study of 21 healthy adults suggested that the Ambrotose AO dietary supplement was safe and raised serum Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) by 36.6%. In a subsequent 21-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 25 healthy adults, Ambrotose AO capsules increased two measures of antioxidant capacity in the blood: ORAC and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC).[26]
Two clinical trials (one conducted in the U.S. and one in Australia) investigated the effect of Ambrotose complex on brain function. Stancil and Hicks conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Ambrotose in 62 healthy young adults, and reported that a single one-tablespoon serving of Ambrotose complex significantly improved visual discrimination and working memory.[24] A trial in 109 healthy middle-aged adults conducted by Best (a Mannatech-funded researcher) and colleagues[27] showed that Ambrotose complex powder (4 grams/day for 12 weeks) significantly improved memory and psychological well-being.[25]
Public scrutiny[edit]
Securities Exchange Act class-action lawsuit[edit]
The company has been known for its literature, websites, and multi-level marketing with claims of scientific links to cellular glycobiology long disputed by relevant individual Nobel prize winners.[28] On March 1, 2005 a jury trial was demanded[29] and on September 9, 2005 a class-action lawsuit was filed against Mannatech for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act. The plaintiff class accused Mannatech of violating the act by "issuing a series of material misrepresentations"; specifically: failing to control its sales associates and allowing them to make false claims concerning the efficacy of Mannatech products. This caused a misleading price inflation of the company's stock.[30] The plaintiffs consisted of the purchasers of Mannatech stock during the period August 10, 2004 through July 30, 2007.[12] On March 20, 2008, Mannatech settled the class-action lawsuit by agreeing to pay $11.25 million to the plaintiff class. As part of the settlement, Mannatech admitted no wrongdoing.[31]
Texas Attorney General civil complaint[edit]
Mannatech came under investigation by the Texas Attorney General on October 27, 2006 for alleged violations of that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[32] Samuel L. Caster, Mannatech's founder and chief executive officer at the time, stated: "We walk the fine line of always stating our case appropriately and always training our people: We're not into the treatment, cure or mitigation of disease. We're into the improvement of quality of life. Now, who can benefit from good nutrition? Sick people, well people, everybody. Everybody benefits from good nutrition."[32]
On July 5, 2007, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott formally charged Mannatech, MannaRelief, Sam Caster, and Reginald McDaniel, the company's medical director, with operating an illegal marketing scheme in violation of state law.[33] A press release stated, "Today's enforcement action stems from a large-scale investigation by state authorities, who examined Mannatech's dubious claims about the health benefits of its products."[13] In response to the civil complaint, Mannatech expanded its compliance department and began to provide periodic reports to the Attorney General's office to ensure that the marketing efforts of its affiliate network adhere to appropriate guidelines.[34]
Mannatech settled the civil complaint on February 26, 2009 by agreeing to pay $4 million in restitution to clients who purchased products and $2 million to the state to cover its costs in the case. In addition, Sam Caster agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty and steer clear of any type of leadership position or employment relationship with Mannatech for five years.[35][36] When discussing the settlement at a news conference, Abbot stated, "Bottom line, this is a warning to the general public: Be wary of phony claims of magic cure-all pills or false hope in a bottle. You could be duped into purchasing something that has no real effect and no real value."[37] Mannatech did not admit wrongdoing; settling was easier than debating Abbott, according to then-CEO Wayne Badovinus.[citation needed] "If they do it again, we will ensure they get put out of business," Abbott said.[38]
One year later, Mannatech Co-CEO Robert Sinnott reflected on the ramifications of the legal action, saying, "The civil action related mainly to some actions by our salesforce. We were embarrassed and also financially impacted by the attorney general suit. We learned from that chapter and it is closed. We've reached a settlement and we've paid the fees associated with it. We've done everything in our power to correct that and make sure we're in compliance in the future."[39]
ABC investigation[edit]
A 20/20 undercover investigation that aired June 1, 2007 on ABC Television showed Mannatech's sales associates teaching sales recruits how to target Mannatech products to patients with specific illnesses in a manner that purportedly does not violate U.S. federal law, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, by avoiding direct claims that the products cure any particular diseases.[8] Mannatech CEO Sam Caster was interviewed for the show and told 20/20 that Mannatech makes no specific health claims about its products. "I don't think dietary supplements treat, cure, mitigate anything. It is not meant to substitute a doctor's oversight, but it plays an important role in the whole health equation."[8]
Company losses[edit]
Mannatech announced in August 2007 that company founder Sam Caster was stepping down as CEO of Mannatech,[40] to be replaced by Wayne Badovinus as the new chief executive. Several corporate initiatives were undertaken, but after 17 months on the job Badovinus resigned in December 2009.[41]
Another member of the board resigned shortly after.[42] Mannatech's Chief Science Officer Robert Sinnott and Mannatech's chief financial officer Steve Fenstermacher were named Co-CEOs.[43] Fenstermacher later resigned.[44]
Publicity over the company's lawsuits began to damage the balance sheets and stock performance.[41] After profits of $32 million in 2006 and $6.6 million in 2007, Mannatech reported a $12.6 million loss in 2008 and a $17.3 million loss in 2009.[45] By mid-year 2010, one quarter of Mannatech's sales were gone.[45] 2010 losses were $10.6 million.[46] As the company's market capitalizations continued to fall, S&P Indices dropped it from the S&P 600 Index, stating "They are no longer representative of the small cap market space."[47] Recruiting efforts continued dropping in 2011, widening company losses to $20.6 million.[48]
Illegal marketing by U.K. physician[edit]
As reported by the British Medical Journal, Mannatech distributor Vivienne Balonwu, a U.K. general practitioner, was found by the U.K. General Medical Council panel to have "abused her power as a doctor" after it was determined that she had illegally promoted and sold the company's glyconutrients to patients as a treatment for medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and stroke-related complications. Following patient complaints about her marketing of the products in 2006, Balonwu was dismissed by her employer Harmoni, a medical services company, and the GMC panel imposed a 15-month penalty period during which she was "to avoid private or short term locum work" and "to complete a supervised personal development plan to tackle shortcomings in her practice.[49]
Ben Carson[edit]
From 2004 until early 2014, neurosurgeon and conservative speaker Ben Carson made videos and spoke at company events promoting Mannatech and its products.
After undergoing surgery for prostate cancer on August 7, 2002[50] Carson claimed in an interview the following November that the surgery had successfully removed all cancerous tissue and that he was completely cured of the disease.[51] However, in 2004, in a speech at a Mannatech event, he credited the company's products with the disappearance of his cancer symptoms.[52][53]
His most recent paid speech for the company was in 2013, for which he was paid $42,000. His image appeared on the corporation's website in 2014,[52] and in the same year he praised their "glyconutrient" supplements in a PBS special ("The Missing Link – The Science of Brain Health"), sponsored by a group of Mannatech distributors, that was subsequently featured on the site.[54]
Carson delivered the keynote address at a Mannatech distributor convention in 2011 during which he said that the company had donated funds to help him obtain a coveted endowed chair post at Johns Hopkins Medicine: ". . . three years ago I had an endowed chair bestowed upon me and uh, it requires $2.5 million to do an endowed chair and I'm proud to say that part of that $2.5 million came from Mannatech." In October 2015, Carson's campaign team said that "there was no contribution from Mannatech to Johns Hopkins", and that his statement had been "a legitimate mistake on his part. Confusion. He had been doing some fundraising for the hospital and some other chairs about that time, and he simply got things mixed up."[55]
During the CNBC GOP debate on October 28, 2015, Carson was asked about his relationship with Mannatech. He replied, "That's easy to answer. I didn't have any involvement with Mannatech. Total propaganda. I did a couple speeches for them. I did speeches for other people—they were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say I had any kind of relation with them. Do I take the product? Yes. I think it is a good product."[56] Politifact rated Carson's denial of any involvement as "false", pointing to his paid speeches for Mannatech and his appearances in promotional videos in which he gave favorable reviews to its products, despite not being "an official spokesman or sales associate".[57] When the CNBC moderator commented that Carson was on Mannatech's website, he replied that he had not given his permission. Earlier, he had said that he was unaware of the company's legal history.[58]
On November 3, 2015, Mannatech said on its website that for compliance with Federal campaign finance regulations the company had removed all references to Carson before he announced his bid for the presidency.[59]
Rafael Cruz[edit]
From 1993 to 2009, Rafael Bienvenido Cruz, father of presidential candidate Rafael Edward "Ted" Cruz, was a top salesman for Mannatech.[60][61]
Sam Caster[edit]
Prior to Mannatech[edit]
Samuel L. Caster is the founder and former Chairman of the board of directors of Mannatech. His first major business venture, Eagle Shield, was an insulation product that claimed to utilize new technology developed by NASA and could reduce heating and cooling costs by up to 40%. In May 1988, the Attorney General of Texas concluded that the product's technology long predated NASA and did not reduce consumers' bills in the amounts advertised.[62][63] Caster agreed to cease the misleading claims made about Eagle Shield.[29] Caster's second product, the "Electracat," was sold as a pest control device. The Electracat reportedly emitted pulsed vibrations that repelled rats, crickets, snakes, ticks, spiders, mosquitoes, and scorpions. However, in January 1991, the Attorney General of Texas investigated the product and found that the Electracat emitted no vibrations whatsoever. The Attorney General declared, "The device is a hoax, and stands on the same scientific footing as a perpetual motion machine."[62][63] Caster was ordered to stop selling the Electracat and to reimburse the state $125,000 in investigative costs.[64]
Mannatech's inception[edit]
Caster then started Mannatech in 1993, as Congress prepared to pass the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which made feasible the profitable marketing of a wider spectrum of dietary supplements.[65]
Consultant to Mannatech[edit]
On August 22, 2007, Sam Caster resigned as CEO of Mannatech.[40] On October 19, 2007, it was reported that the company had fired Grant Thornton LLP as its auditor after the accounting firm demanded that Mannatech remove Sam Caster from all responsibilities.[66] Sam Caster was barred by the attorney general of Texas from serving as a director, officer, or employee of Mannatech for five years—from February 2009 until February 2014.[62] Caster was also barred from taking a role in any other multi-level marketing programs during that time. Despite this, then-CEO Wayne Badovinus stated Caster would work as a consultant answering directly to him.[37] The attorney general's office agreed Caster could serve as an outside consultant to the company.[62]
In March 2014, Caster appeared as main speaker at a Mannatech videoconference event with sales associates for the company's new skin rejuvenation product. Introduced as the company's founder and "visionary," he explained the company's new product and his role in its creation. "Oh my gosh, This stuff really works." he said, of the product. "No one could have predicted it would have that immediate an impact."[62]
In august 2016 Mannatech resolved its differences with Sam Caster and his consulting company, Wonder Enterprises, LLC. Caster, who left Mannatech in 2014, and Mannatech have ended arbitration proceedings. Mannatech has agreed to not pursue its rights to enforce certain covenants under the prior consulting agreements with Caster and Wonder Enterprises.[67]
MannaRelief Ministries[edit]
MannaRelief Ministries is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 1999 by Sam Caster.[68] William A. Mullens, Caster's brother-in-law, serves as MannaRelief's Executive Director, and Caster's wife, Linda, serves as chairman of the board.[69] MannaRelief receives a portion of the proceeds from Mannatech products purchased on "automatic order", and in turn distributes PhytoBlend powder (a dietary supplement purchased at cost from Mannatech[69]) to various unidentified orphanages and international relief organizations.[70][71][72][73] From 2009 to 2011, Manntech provided a total of $1.5 million in cash donations to MannaRelief, and MannaRelief purchased $1.6 million worth of products from Mannatech.[69]

Mannatech, Incorporated, is a multinational multi-level marketing firm engaged in research, development, and distribution of "glyconutrients," the company's name for blends of plant-sourced saccharides.[2] Mannatech was founded in November 1993 by Samuel L. Caster and is headquartered in Coppell, Texas.[3] It operates in 24 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, countries in Asia, Africa, and within the EU.[4][a] The company's stock is traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol MTEX. Mannatech employs 310 people and sells its products through approximately 229,000 active independent sales associates.[1]
In 2006, Forbes magazine named Mannatech the No. 5 company on its annual list of the "200 Best Small Companies"[5] and in 2007 Mannatech was ranked 12th in BusinessWeek magazine's 2007 list of America's "Top 100 Hot Growth Small Companies."[6] The scientific validity of Mannatech's key product Ambrotose has been called into question by several researchers,[7][8][9][10][11] and the company was the focus of a 2005 class action lawsuit (settled in 2008) for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act,[12] and a 2007 investigation (settled in 2009) by the Texas attorney general for alleged violations of that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[13]

Products[edit]
As of July 2016, the company offered 28 nutritional supplement products, two topical products, nine skin care products, and eleven weight management/physical fitness products. Mannatech is most widely known for Ambrotose, its glyconutritional dietary supplement, which is a patented blend of plant-sourced saccharides used in its line of Ambrotose products. Glyconutritionals were formulated to support cellular communication by positively impacting human glycoforms, a claim that has generated controversy among some members of the scientific community.[7] In an SEC filing, the company stated that its products "are formulated with predominately  [sic] naturally-occurring, plant-derived, carbohydrate-based ingredients that are designed to use nutrients working through normal physiology to help achieve and maintain optimal health and wellness, rather than developing synthetic, carbohydrate-based products, as other companies are doing."[14]
Scientific evaluation[edit]
Independent commentary[edit]
The opinion of independent glycobiologists is that the body cannot digest Ambrotose, as it lacks the enzymes needed.[7]
Prominent glycobiologist Ronald Schnaar told 20/20 in a June 1, 2007 interview, "All of the sugar building blocks that we need in our body are made from the most common foods we eat."[8][15] Hudson Freeze, a leading glycobiologist, said this about glyconutrients: "There are authentic, scientific studies that have looked at people drinking these kinds of materials, and it doesn't really do anything except increase flatulence."[8][16] Freeze is a member of the editorial board of Glycobiology, and Schnaar serves as editor-in-chief.[17] Schnaar and Freeze published a critique of Mannatech's products in Glycobiology in 2008, describing the lack of published clinical benefits of the "partially purified polydisperse plant polysaccharides" found in "Ambrotose Complex."[9]
An article in Glycobiology described the potential for the public to be misled about the science of glycobiology by the nebulous "glyconutrient" term.[10] The author expressed concern that the public could be susceptible to the "scientific-sounding label" of glyconutrient, which may "generate a feeling of security and credibility ... despite the lack of acceptance among many glycobiologists of the term." In November 2007, Science published an article in its "News Focus" section detailing the scientific controversy surrounding Mannatech.[11] It included criticisms and comments from glycobiologists, including Ajit Varki, Raymond Dwek, Freeze, and Schnaar.
According to the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, "Mannatech and its founder have been charged by the Texas Attorney General for deceptive trade practices that exaggerated the products' health benefits."[18] Ambrotose has been "promoted aggressively to cancer patients" on the basis that it can help cellular health and boost the immune system, but that "strong scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking".[18]
Company-funded studies[edit]
Mannatech has sponsored pre-clinical and clinical research on their products.[19] The company states that these studies indicate that the products can be broken down into smaller, absorbable fragments by GI tract bacteria[20] and can modify human serum glycosylation profiles.[21] Additional studies sponsored by the company have indicated that the products also exert positive prebiotic effects[22] and induce positive effects on human brain wave activity, cognition,[23] mood, and memory.[24][25]
Marzorati and Possemiers employed human gastrointestinal tract simulations and microbiological analysis to show that Ambrotose complex and Advanced Ambrotose powder exerted positive prebiotic effects. Both products exhibited selective fermentability throughout the entire colon with a positive and selective bifidus factor. They also demonstrated the possibility of enhancing species belonging to Bacteroidetes, a phylum recently associated with body weight management.[22]
A five-week combined Phase 1 and 2 open label, forced titration dose response study of 21 healthy adults suggested that the Ambrotose AO dietary supplement was safe and raised serum Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) by 36.6%. In a subsequent 21-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 25 healthy adults, Ambrotose AO capsules increased two measures of antioxidant capacity in the blood: ORAC and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC).[26]
Two clinical trials (one conducted in the U.S. and one in Australia) investigated the effect of Ambrotose complex on brain function. Stancil and Hicks conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Ambrotose in 62 healthy young adults, and reported that a single one-tablespoon serving of Ambrotose complex significantly improved visual discrimination and working memory.[24] A trial in 109 healthy middle-aged adults conducted by Best (a Mannatech-funded researcher) and colleagues[27] showed that Ambrotose complex powder (4 grams/day for 12 weeks) significantly improved memory and psychological well-being.[25]
Public scrutiny[edit]
Securities Exchange Act class-action lawsuit[edit]
The company has been known for its literature, websites, and multi-level marketing with claims of scientific links to cellular glycobiology long disputed by relevant individual Nobel prize winners.[28] On March 1, 2005 a jury trial was demanded[29] and on September 9, 2005 a class-action lawsuit was filed against Mannatech for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act. The plaintiff class accused Mannatech of violating the act by "issuing a series of material misrepresentations"; specifically: failing to control its sales associates and allowing them to make false claims concerning the efficacy of Mannatech products. This caused a misleading price inflation of the company's stock.[30] The plaintiffs consisted of the purchasers of Mannatech stock during the period August 10, 2004 through July 30, 2007.[12] On March 20, 2008, Mannatech settled the class-action lawsuit by agreeing to pay $11.25 million to the plaintiff class. As part of the settlement, Mannatech admitted no wrongdoing.[31]
Texas Attorney General civil complaint[edit]
Mannatech came under investigation by the Texas Attorney General on October 27, 2006 for alleged violations of that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[32] Samuel L. Caster, Mannatech's founder and chief executive officer at the time, stated: "We walk the fine line of always stating our case appropriately and always training our people: We're not into the treatment, cure or mitigation of disease. We're into the improvement of quality of life. Now, who can benefit from good nutrition? Sick people, well people, everybody. Everybody benefits from good nutrition."[32]
On July 5, 2007, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott formally charged Mannatech, MannaRelief, Sam Caster, and Reginald McDaniel, the company's medical director, with operating an illegal marketing scheme in violation of state law.[33] A press release stated, "Today's enforcement action stems from a large-scale investigation by state authorities, who examined Mannatech's dubious claims about the health benefits of its products."[13] In response to the civil complaint, Mannatech expanded its compliance department and began to provide periodic reports to the Attorney General's office to ensure that the marketing efforts of its affiliate network adhere to appropriate guidelines.[34]
Mannatech settled the civil complaint on February 26, 2009 by agreeing to pay $4 million in restitution to clients who purchased products and $2 million to the state to cover its costs in the case. In addition, Sam Caster agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty and steer clear of any type of leadership position or employment relationship with Mannatech for five years.[35][36] When discussing the settlement at a news conference, Abbot stated, "Bottom line, this is a warning to the general public: Be wary of phony claims of magic cure-all pills or false hope in a bottle. You could be duped into purchasing something that has no real effect and no real value."[37] Mannatech did not admit wrongdoing; settling was easier than debating Abbott, according to then-CEO Wayne Badovinus.[citation needed] "If they do it again, we will ensure they get put out of business," Abbott said.[38]
One year later, Mannatech Co-CEO Robert Sinnott reflected on the ramifications of the legal action, saying, "The civil action related mainly to some actions by our salesforce. We were embarrassed and also financially impacted by the attorney general suit. We learned from that chapter and it is closed. We've reached a settlement and we've paid the fees associated with it. We've done everything in our power to correct that and make sure we're in compliance in the future."[39]
ABC investigation[edit]
A 20/20 undercover investigation that aired June 1, 2007 on ABC Television showed Mannatech's sales associates teaching sales recruits how to target Mannatech products to patients with specific illnesses in a manner that purportedly does not violate U.S. federal law, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, by avoiding direct claims that the products cure any particular diseases.[8] Mannatech CEO Sam Caster was interviewed for the show and told 20/20 that Mannatech makes no specific health claims about its products. "I don't think dietary supplements treat, cure, mitigate anything. It is not meant to substitute a doctor's oversight, but it plays an important role in the whole health equation."[8]
Company losses[edit]
Mannatech announced in August 2007 that company founder Sam Caster was stepping down as CEO of Mannatech,[40] to be replaced by Wayne Badovinus as the new chief executive. Several corporate initiatives were undertaken, but after 17 months on the job Badovinus resigned in December 2009.[41]
Another member of the board resigned shortly after.[42] Mannatech's Chief Science Officer Robert Sinnott and Mannatech's chief financial officer Steve Fenstermacher were named Co-CEOs.[43] Fenstermacher later resigned.[44]
Publicity over the company's lawsuits began to damage the balance sheets and stock performance.[41] After profits of $32 million in 2006 and $6.6 million in 2007, Mannatech reported a $12.6 million loss in 2008 and a $17.3 million loss in 2009.[45] By mid-year 2010, one quarter of Mannatech's sales were gone.[45] 2010 losses were $10.6 million.[46] As the company's market capitalizations continued to fall, S&P Indices dropped it from the S&P 600 Index, stating "They are no longer representative of the small cap market space."[47] Recruiting efforts continued dropping in 2011, widening company losses to $20.6 million.[48]
Illegal marketing by U.K. physician[edit]
As reported by the British Medical Journal, Mannatech distributor Vivienne Balonwu, a U.K. general practitioner, was found by the U.K. General Medical Council panel to have "abused her power as a doctor" after it was determined that she had illegally promoted and sold the company's glyconutrients to patients as a treatment for medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and stroke-related complications. Following patient complaints about her marketing of the products in 2006, Balonwu was dismissed by her employer Harmoni, a medical services company, and the GMC panel imposed a 15-month penalty period during which she was "to avoid private or short term locum work" and "to complete a supervised personal development plan to tackle shortcomings in her practice.[49]
Ben Carson[edit]
From 2004 until early 2014, neurosurgeon and conservative speaker Ben Carson made videos and spoke at company events promoting Mannatech and its products.
After undergoing surgery for prostate cancer on August 7, 2002[50] Carson claimed in an interview the following November that the surgery had successfully removed all cancerous tissue and that he was completely cured of the disease.[51] However, in 2004, in a speech at a Mannatech event, he credited the company's products with the disappearance of his cancer symptoms.[52][53]
His most recent paid speech for the company was in 2013, for which he was paid $42,000. His image appeared on the corporation's website in 2014,[52] and in the same year he praised their "glyconutrient" supplements in a PBS special ("The Missing Link – The Science of Brain Health"), sponsored by a group of Mannatech distributors, that was subsequently featured on the site.[54]
Carson delivered the keynote address at a Mannatech distributor convention in 2011 during which he said that the company had donated funds to help him obtain a coveted endowed chair post at Johns Hopkins Medicine: ". . . three years ago I had an endowed chair bestowed upon me and uh, it requires $2.5 million to do an endowed chair and I'm proud to say that part of that $2.5 million came from Mannatech." In October 2015, Carson's campaign team said that "there was no contribution from Mannatech to Johns Hopkins", and that his statement had been "a legitimate mistake on his part. Confusion. He had been doing some fundraising for the hospital and some other chairs about that time, and he simply got things mixed up."[55]
During the CNBC GOP debate on October 28, 2015, Carson was asked about his relationship with Mannatech. He replied, "That's easy to answer. I didn't have any involvement with Mannatech. Total propaganda. I did a couple speeches for them. I did speeches for other people—they were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say I had any kind of relation with them. Do I take the product? Yes. I think it is a good product."[56] Politifact rated Carson's denial of any involvement as "false", pointing to his paid speeches for Mannatech and his appearances in promotional videos in which he gave favorable reviews to its products, despite not being "an official spokesman or sales associate".[57] When the CNBC moderator commented that Carson was on Mannatech's website, he replied that he had not given his permission. Earlier, he had said that he was unaware of the company's legal history.[58]
On November 3, 2015, Mannatech said on its website that for compliance with Federal campaign finance regulations the company had removed all references to Carson before he announced his bid for the presidency.[59]
Rafael Cruz[edit]
From 1993 to 2009, Rafael Bienvenido Cruz, father of presidential candidate Rafael Edward "Ted" Cruz, was a top salesman for Mannatech.[60][61]
Sam Caster[edit]
Prior to Mannatech[edit]
Samuel L. Caster is the founder and former Chairman of the board of directors of Mannatech. His first major business venture, Eagle Shield, was an insulation product that claimed to utilize new technology developed by NASA and could reduce heating and cooling costs by up to 40%. In May 1988, the Attorney General of Texas concluded that the product's technology long predated NASA and did not reduce consumers' bills in the amounts advertised.[62][63] Caster agreed to cease the misleading claims made about Eagle Shield.[29] Caster's second product, the "Electracat," was sold as a pest control device. The Electracat reportedly emitted pulsed vibrations that repelled rats, crickets, snakes, ticks, spiders, mosquitoes, and scorpions. However, in January 1991, the Attorney General of Texas investigated the product and found that the Electracat emitted no vibrations whatsoever. The Attorney General declared, "The device is a hoax, and stands on the same scientific footing as a perpetual motion machine."[62][63] Caster was ordered to stop selling the Electracat and to reimburse the state $125,000 in investigative costs.[64]
Mannatech's inception[edit]
Caster then started Mannatech in 1993, as Congress prepared to pass the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which made feasible the profitable marketing of a wider spectrum of dietary supplements.[65]
Consultant to Mannatech[edit]
On August 22, 2007, Sam Caster resigned as CEO of Mannatech.[40] On October 19, 2007, it was reported that the company had fired Grant Thornton LLP as its auditor after the accounting firm demanded that Mannatech remove Sam Caster from all responsibilities.[66] Sam Caster was barred by the attorney general of Texas from serving as a director, officer, or employee of Mannatech for five years—from February 2009 until February 2014.[62] Caster was also barred from taking a role in any other multi-level marketing programs during that time. Despite this, then-CEO Wayne Badovinus stated Caster would work as a consultant answering directly to him.[37] The attorney general's office agreed Caster could serve as an outside consultant to the company.[62]
In March 2014, Caster appeared as main speaker at a Mannatech videoconference event with sales associates for the company's new skin rejuvenation product. Introduced as the company's founder and "visionary," he explained the company's new product and his role in its creation. "Oh my gosh, This stuff really works." he said, of the product. "No one could have predicted it would have that immediate an impact."[62]
In august 2016 Mannatech resolved its differences with Sam Caster and his consulting company, Wonder Enterprises, LLC. Caster, who left Mannatech in 2014, and Mannatech have ended arbitration proceedings. Mannatech has agreed to not pursue its rights to enforce certain covenants under the prior consulting agreements with Caster and Wonder Enterprises.[67]
MannaRelief Ministries[edit]
MannaRelief Ministries is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 1999 by Sam Caster.[68] William A. Mullens, Caster's brother-in-law, serves as MannaRelief's Executive Director, and Caster's wife, Linda, serves as chairman of the board.[69] MannaRelief receives a portion of the proceeds from Mannatech products purchased on "automatic order", and in turn distributes PhytoBlend powder (a dietary supplement purchased at cost from Mannatech[69]) to various unidentified orphanages and international relief organizations.[70][71][72][73] From 2009 to 2011, Manntech provided a total of $1.5 million in cash donations to MannaRelief, and MannaRelief purchased $1.6 million worth of products from Mannatech.[69]

Mannatech, Incorporated, is a multinational multi-level marketing firm engaged in research, development, and distribution of "glyconutrients," the company's name for blends of plant-sourced saccharides.[2] Mannatech was founded in November 1993 by Samuel L. Caster and is headquartered in Coppell, Texas.[3] It operates in 24 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, countries in Asia, Africa, and within the EU.[4][a] The company's stock is traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol MTEX. Mannatech employs 310 people and sells its products through approximately 229,000 active independent sales associates.[1]
In 2006, Forbes magazine named Mannatech the No. 5 company on its annual list of the "200 Best Small Companies"[5] and in 2007 Mannatech was ranked 12th in BusinessWeek magazine's 2007 list of America's "Top 100 Hot Growth Small Companies."[6] The scientific validity of Mannatech's key product Ambrotose has been called into question by several researchers,[7][8][9][10][11] and the company was the focus of a 2005 class action lawsuit (settled in 2008) for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act,[12] and a 2007 investigation (settled in 2009) by the Texas attorney general for alleged violations of that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[13]

Products[edit]
As of July 2016, the company offered 28 nutritional supplement products, two topical products, nine skin care products, and eleven weight management/physical fitness products. Mannatech is most widely known for Ambrotose, its glyconutritional dietary supplement, which is a patented blend of plant-sourced saccharides used in its line of Ambrotose products. Glyconutritionals were formulated to support cellular communication by positively impacting human glycoforms, a claim that has generated controversy among some members of the scientific community.[7] In an SEC filing, the company stated that its products "are formulated with predominately  [sic] naturally-occurring, plant-derived, carbohydrate-based ingredients that are designed to use nutrients working through normal physiology to help achieve and maintain optimal health and wellness, rather than developing synthetic, carbohydrate-based products, as other companies are doing."[14]
Scientific evaluation[edit]
Independent commentary[edit]
The opinion of independent glycobiologists is that the body cannot digest Ambrotose, as it lacks the enzymes needed.[7]
Prominent glycobiologist Ronald Schnaar told 20/20 in a June 1, 2007 interview, "All of the sugar building blocks that we need in our body are made from the most common foods we eat."[8][15] Hudson Freeze, a leading glycobiologist, said this about glyconutrients: "There are authentic, scientific studies that have looked at people drinking these kinds of materials, and it doesn't really do anything except increase flatulence."[8][16] Freeze is a member of the editorial board of Glycobiology, and Schnaar serves as editor-in-chief.[17] Schnaar and Freeze published a critique of Mannatech's products in Glycobiology in 2008, describing the lack of published clinical benefits of the "partially purified polydisperse plant polysaccharides" found in "Ambrotose Complex."[9]
An article in Glycobiology described the potential for the public to be misled about the science of glycobiology by the nebulous "glyconutrient" term.[10] The author expressed concern that the public could be susceptible to the "scientific-sounding label" of glyconutrient, which may "generate a feeling of security and credibility ... despite the lack of acceptance among many glycobiologists of the term." In November 2007, Science published an article in its "News Focus" section detailing the scientific controversy surrounding Mannatech.[11] It included criticisms and comments from glycobiologists, including Ajit Varki, Raymond Dwek, Freeze, and Schnaar.
According to the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, "Mannatech and its founder have been charged by the Texas Attorney General for deceptive trade practices that exaggerated the products' health benefits."[18] Ambrotose has been "promoted aggressively to cancer patients" on the basis that it can help cellular health and boost the immune system, but that "strong scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking".[18]
Company-funded studies[edit]
Mannatech has sponsored pre-clinical and clinical research on their products.[19] The company states that these studies indicate that the products can be broken down into smaller, absorbable fragments by GI tract bacteria[20] and can modify human serum glycosylation profiles.[21] Additional studies sponsored by the company have indicated that the products also exert positive prebiotic effects[22] and induce positive effects on human brain wave activity, cognition,[23] mood, and memory.[24][25]
Marzorati and Possemiers employed human gastrointestinal tract simulations and microbiological analysis to show that Ambrotose complex and Advanced Ambrotose powder exerted positive prebiotic effects. Both products exhibited selective fermentability throughout the entire colon with a positive and selective bifidus factor. They also demonstrated the possibility of enhancing species belonging to Bacteroidetes, a phylum recently associated with body weight management.[22]
A five-week combined Phase 1 and 2 open label, forced titration dose response study of 21 healthy adults suggested that the Ambrotose AO dietary supplement was safe and raised serum Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) by 36.6%. In a subsequent 21-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 25 healthy adults, Ambrotose AO capsules increased two measures of antioxidant capacity in the blood: ORAC and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC).[26]
Two clinical trials (one conducted in the U.S. and one in Australia) investigated the effect of Ambrotose complex on brain function. Stancil and Hicks conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Ambrotose in 62 healthy young adults, and reported that a single one-tablespoon serving of Ambrotose complex significantly improved visual discrimination and working memory.[24] A trial in 109 healthy middle-aged adults conducted by Best (a Mannatech-funded researcher) and colleagues[27] showed that Ambrotose complex powder (4 grams/day for 12 weeks) significantly improved memory and psychological well-being.[25]
Public scrutiny[edit]
Securities Exchange Act class-action lawsuit[edit]
The company has been known for its literature, websites, and multi-level marketing with claims of scientific links to cellular glycobiology long disputed by relevant individual Nobel prize winners.[28] On March 1, 2005 a jury trial was demanded[29] and on September 9, 2005 a class-action lawsuit was filed against Mannatech for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act. The plaintiff class accused Mannatech of violating the act by "issuing a series of material misrepresentations"; specifically: failing to control its sales associates and allowing them to make false claims concerning the efficacy of Mannatech products. This caused a misleading price inflation of the company's stock.[30] The plaintiffs consisted of the purchasers of Mannatech stock during the period August 10, 2004 through July 30, 2007.[12] On March 20, 2008, Mannatech settled the class-action lawsuit by agreeing to pay $11.25 million to the plaintiff class. As part of the settlement, Mannatech admitted no wrongdoing.[31]
Texas Attorney General civil complaint[edit]
Mannatech came under investigation by the Texas Attorney General on October 27, 2006 for alleged violations of that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[32] Samuel L. Caster, Mannatech's founder and chief executive officer at the time, stated: "We walk the fine line of always stating our case appropriately and always training our people: We're not into the treatment, cure or mitigation of disease. We're into the improvement of quality of life. Now, who can benefit from good nutrition? Sick people, well people, everybody. Everybody benefits from good nutrition."[32]
On July 5, 2007, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott formally charged Mannatech, MannaRelief, Sam Caster, and Reginald McDaniel, the company's medical director, with operating an illegal marketing scheme in violation of state law.[33] A press release stated, "Today's enforcement action stems from a large-scale investigation by state authorities, who examined Mannatech's dubious claims about the health benefits of its products."[13] In response to the civil complaint, Mannatech expanded its compliance department and began to provide periodic reports to the Attorney General's office to ensure that the marketing efforts of its affiliate network adhere to appropriate guidelines.[34]
Mannatech settled the civil complaint on February 26, 2009 by agreeing to pay $4 million in restitution to clients who purchased products and $2 million to the state to cover its costs in the case. In addition, Sam Caster agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty and steer clear of any type of leadership position or employment relationship with Mannatech for five years.[35][36] When discussing the settlement at a news conference, Abbot stated, "Bottom line, this is a warning to the general public: Be wary of phony claims of magic cure-all pills or false hope in a bottle. You could be duped into purchasing something that has no real effect and no real value."[37] Mannatech did not admit wrongdoing; settling was easier than debating Abbott, according to then-CEO Wayne Badovinus.[citation needed] "If they do it again, we will ensure they get put out of business," Abbott said.[38]
One year later, Mannatech Co-CEO Robert Sinnott reflected on the ramifications of the legal action, saying, "The civil action related mainly to some actions by our salesforce. We were embarrassed and also financially impacted by the attorney general suit. We learned from that chapter and it is closed. We've reached a settlement and we've paid the fees associated with it. We've done everything in our power to correct that and make sure we're in compliance in the future."[39]
ABC investigation[edit]
A 20/20 undercover investigation that aired June 1, 2007 on ABC Television showed Mannatech's sales associates teaching sales recruits how to target Mannatech products to patients with specific illnesses in a manner that purportedly does not violate U.S. federal law, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, by avoiding direct claims that the products cure any particular diseases.[8] Mannatech CEO Sam Caster was interviewed for the show and told 20/20 that Mannatech makes no specific health claims about its products. "I don't think dietary supplements treat, cure, mitigate anything. It is not meant to substitute a doctor's oversight, but it plays an important role in the whole health equation."[8]
Company losses[edit]
Mannatech announced in August 2007 that company founder Sam Caster was stepping down as CEO of Mannatech,[40] to be replaced by Wayne Badovinus as the new chief executive. Several corporate initiatives were undertaken, but after 17 months on the job Badovinus resigned in December 2009.[41]
Another member of the board resigned shortly after.[42] Mannatech's Chief Science Officer Robert Sinnott and Mannatech's chief financial officer Steve Fenstermacher were named Co-CEOs.[43] Fenstermacher later resigned.[44]
Publicity over the company's lawsuits began to damage the balance sheets and stock performance.[41] After profits of $32 million in 2006 and $6.6 million in 2007, Mannatech reported a $12.6 million loss in 2008 and a $17.3 million loss in 2009.[45] By mid-year 2010, one quarter of Mannatech's sales were gone.[45] 2010 losses were $10.6 million.[46] As the company's market capitalizations continued to fall, S&P Indices dropped it from the S&P 600 Index, stating "They are no longer representative of the small cap market space."[47] Recruiting efforts continued dropping in 2011, widening company losses to $20.6 million.[48]
Illegal marketing by U.K. physician[edit]
As reported by the British Medical Journal, Mannatech distributor Vivienne Balonwu, a U.K. general practitioner, was found by the U.K. General Medical Council panel to have "abused her power as a doctor" after it was determined that she had illegally promoted and sold the company's glyconutrients to patients as a treatment for medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and stroke-related complications. Following patient complaints about her marketing of the products in 2006, Balonwu was dismissed by her employer Harmoni, a medical services company, and the GMC panel imposed a 15-month penalty period during which she was "to avoid private or short term locum work" and "to complete a supervised personal development plan to tackle shortcomings in her practice.[49]
Ben Carson[edit]
From 2004 until early 2014, neurosurgeon and conservative speaker Ben Carson made videos and spoke at company events promoting Mannatech and its products.
After undergoing surgery for prostate cancer on August 7, 2002[50] Carson claimed in an interview the following November that the surgery had successfully removed all cancerous tissue and that he was completely cured of the disease.[51] However, in 2004, in a speech at a Mannatech event, he credited the company's products with the disappearance of his cancer symptoms.[52][53]
His most recent paid speech for the company was in 2013, for which he was paid $42,000. His image appeared on the corporation's website in 2014,[52] and in the same year he praised their "glyconutrient" supplements in a PBS special ("The Missing Link – The Science of Brain Health"), sponsored by a group of Mannatech distributors, that was subsequently featured on the site.[54]
Carson delivered the keynote address at a Mannatech distributor convention in 2011 during which he said that the company had donated funds to help him obtain a coveted endowed chair post at Johns Hopkins Medicine: ". . . three years ago I had an endowed chair bestowed upon me and uh, it requires $2.5 million to do an endowed chair and I'm proud to say that part of that $2.5 million came from Mannatech." In October 2015, Carson's campaign team said that "there was no contribution from Mannatech to Johns Hopkins", and that his statement had been "a legitimate mistake on his part. Confusion. He had been doing some fundraising for the hospital and some other chairs about that time, and he simply got things mixed up."[55]
During the CNBC GOP debate on October 28, 2015, Carson was asked about his relationship with Mannatech. He replied, "That's easy to answer. I didn't have any involvement with Mannatech. Total propaganda. I did a couple speeches for them. I did speeches for other people—they were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say I had any kind of relation with them. Do I take the product? Yes. I think it is a good product."[56] Politifact rated Carson's denial of any involvement as "false", pointing to his paid speeches for Mannatech and his appearances in promotional videos in which he gave favorable reviews to its products, despite not being "an official spokesman or sales associate".[57] When the CNBC moderator commented that Carson was on Mannatech's website, he replied that he had not given his permission. Earlier, he had said that he was unaware of the company's legal history.[58]
On November 3, 2015, Mannatech said on its website that for compliance with Federal campaign finance regulations the company had removed all references to Carson before he announced his bid for the presidency.[59]
Rafael Cruz[edit]
From 1993 to 2009, Rafael Bienvenido Cruz, father of presidential candidate Rafael Edward "Ted" Cruz, was a top salesman for Mannatech.[60][61]
Sam Caster[edit]
Prior to Mannatech[edit]
Samuel L. Caster is the founder and former Chairman of the board of directors of Mannatech. His first major business venture, Eagle Shield, was an insulation product that claimed to utilize new technology developed by NASA and could reduce heating and cooling costs by up to 40%. In May 1988, the Attorney General of Texas concluded that the product's technology long predated NASA and did not reduce consumers' bills in the amounts advertised.[62][63] Caster agreed to cease the misleading claims made about Eagle Shield.[29] Caster's second product, the "Electracat," was sold as a pest control device. The Electracat reportedly emitted pulsed vibrations that repelled rats, crickets, snakes, ticks, spiders, mosquitoes, and scorpions. However, in January 1991, the Attorney General of Texas investigated the product and found that the Electracat emitted no vibrations whatsoever. The Attorney General declared, "The device is a hoax, and stands on the same scientific footing as a perpetual motion machine."[62][63] Caster was ordered to stop selling the Electracat and to reimburse the state $125,000 in investigative costs.[64]
Mannatech's inception[edit]
Caster then started Mannatech in 1993, as Congress prepared to pass the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which made feasible the profitable marketing of a wider spectrum of dietary supplements.[65]
Consultant to Mannatech[edit]
On August 22, 2007, Sam Caster resigned as CEO of Mannatech.[40] On October 19, 2007, it was reported that the company had fired Grant Thornton LLP as its auditor after the accounting firm demanded that Mannatech remove Sam Caster from all responsibilities.[66] Sam Caster was barred by the attorney general of Texas from serving as a director, officer, or employee of Mannatech for five years—from February 2009 until February 2014.[62] Caster was also barred from taking a role in any other multi-level marketing programs during that time. Despite this, then-CEO Wayne Badovinus stated Caster would work as a consultant answering directly to him.[37] The attorney general's office agreed Caster could serve as an outside consultant to the company.[62]
In March 2014, Caster appeared as main speaker at a Mannatech videoconference event with sales associates for the company's new skin rejuvenation product. Introduced as the company's founder and "visionary," he explained the company's new product and his role in its creation. "Oh my gosh, This stuff really works." he said, of the product. "No one could have predicted it would have that immediate an impact."[62]
In august 2016 Mannatech resolved its differences with Sam Caster and his consulting company, Wonder Enterprises, LLC. Caster, who left Mannatech in 2014, and Mannatech have ended arbitration proceedings. Mannatech has agreed to not pursue its rights to enforce certain covenants under the prior consulting agreements with Caster and Wonder Enterprises.[67]
MannaRelief Ministries[edit]
MannaRelief Ministries is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 1999 by Sam Caster.[68] William A. Mullens, Caster's brother-in-law, serves as MannaRelief's Executive Director, and Caster's wife, Linda, serves as chairman of the board.[69] MannaRelief receives a portion of the proceeds from Mannatech products purchased on "automatic order", and in turn distributes PhytoBlend powder (a dietary supplement purchased at cost from Mannatech[69]) to various unidentified orphanages and international relief organizations.[70][71][72][73] From 2009 to 2011, Manntech provided a total of $1.5 million in cash donations to MannaRelief, and MannaRelief purchased $1.6 million worth of products from Mannatech.[69]

Mannatech, Incorporated, is a multinational multi-level marketing firm engaged in research, development, and distribution of "glyconutrients," the company's name for blends of plant-sourced saccharides.[2] Mannatech was founded in November 1993 by Samuel L. Caster and is headquartered in Coppell, Texas.[3] It operates in 24 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, countries in Asia, Africa, and within the EU.[4][a] The company's stock is traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol MTEX. Mannatech employs 310 people and sells its products through approximately 229,000 active independent sales associates.[1]
In 2006, Forbes magazine named Mannatech the No. 5 company on its annual list of the "200 Best Small Companies"[5] and in 2007 Mannatech was ranked 12th in BusinessWeek magazine's 2007 list of America's "Top 100 Hot Growth Small Companies."[6] The scientific validity of Mannatech's key product Ambrotose has been called into question by several researchers,[7][8][9][10][11] and the company was the focus of a 2005 class action lawsuit (settled in 2008) for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act,[12] and a 2007 investigation (settled in 2009) by the Texas attorney general for alleged violations of that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[13]

Products[edit]
As of July 2016, the company offered 28 nutritional supplement products, two topical products, nine skin care products, and eleven weight management/physical fitness products. Mannatech is most widely known for Ambrotose, its glyconutritional dietary supplement, which is a patented blend of plant-sourced saccharides used in its line of Ambrotose products. Glyconutritionals were formulated to support cellular communication by positively impacting human glycoforms, a claim that has generated controversy among some members of the scientific community.[7] In an SEC filing, the company stated that its products "are formulated with predominately  [sic] naturally-occurring, plant-derived, carbohydrate-based ingredients that are designed to use nutrients working through normal physiology to help achieve and maintain optimal health and wellness, rather than developing synthetic, carbohydrate-based products, as other companies are doing."[14]
Scientific evaluation[edit]
Independent commentary[edit]
The opinion of independent glycobiologists is that the body cannot digest Ambrotose, as it lacks the enzymes needed.[7]
Prominent glycobiologist Ronald Schnaar told 20/20 in a June 1, 2007 interview, "All of the sugar building blocks that we need in our body are made from the most common foods we eat."[8][15] Hudson Freeze, a leading glycobiologist, said this about glyconutrients: "There are authentic, scientific studies that have looked at people drinking these kinds of materials, and it doesn't really do anything except increase flatulence."[8][16] Freeze is a member of the editorial board of Glycobiology, and Schnaar serves as editor-in-chief.[17] Schnaar and Freeze published a critique of Mannatech's products in Glycobiology in 2008, describing the lack of published clinical benefits of the "partially purified polydisperse plant polysaccharides" found in "Ambrotose Complex."[9]
An article in Glycobiology described the potential for the public to be misled about the science of glycobiology by the nebulous "glyconutrient" term.[10] The author expressed concern that the public could be susceptible to the "scientific-sounding label" of glyconutrient, which may "generate a feeling of security and credibility ... despite the lack of acceptance among many glycobiologists of the term." In November 2007, Science published an article in its "News Focus" section detailing the scientific controversy surrounding Mannatech.[11] It included criticisms and comments from glycobiologists, including Ajit Varki, Raymond Dwek, Freeze, and Schnaar.
According to the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, "Mannatech and its founder have been charged by the Texas Attorney General for deceptive trade practices that exaggerated the products' health benefits."[18] Ambrotose has been "promoted aggressively to cancer patients" on the basis that it can help cellular health and boost the immune system, but that "strong scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking".[18]
Company-funded studies[edit]
Mannatech has sponsored pre-clinical and clinical research on their products.[19] The company states that these studies indicate that the products can be broken down into smaller, absorbable fragments by GI tract bacteria[20] and can modify human serum glycosylation profiles.[21] Additional studies sponsored by the company have indicated that the products also exert positive prebiotic effects[22] and induce positive effects on human brain wave activity, cognition,[23] mood, and memory.[24][25]
Marzorati and Possemiers employed human gastrointestinal tract simulations and microbiological analysis to show that Ambrotose complex and Advanced Ambrotose powder exerted positive prebiotic effects. Both products exhibited selective fermentability throughout the entire colon with a positive and selective bifidus factor. They also demonstrated the possibility of enhancing species belonging to Bacteroidetes, a phylum recently associated with body weight management.[22]
A five-week combined Phase 1 and 2 open label, forced titration dose response study of 21 healthy adults suggested that the Ambrotose AO dietary supplement was safe and raised serum Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) by 36.6%. In a subsequent 21-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 25 healthy adults, Ambrotose AO capsules increased two measures of antioxidant capacity in the blood: ORAC and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC).[26]
Two clinical trials (one conducted in the U.S. and one in Australia) investigated the effect of Ambrotose complex on brain function. Stancil and Hicks conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Ambrotose in 62 healthy young adults, and reported that a single one-tablespoon serving of Ambrotose complex significantly improved visual discrimination and working memory.[24] A trial in 109 healthy middle-aged adults conducted by Best (a Mannatech-funded researcher) and colleagues[27] showed that Ambrotose complex powder (4 grams/day for 12 weeks) significantly improved memory and psychological well-being.[25]
Public scrutiny[edit]
Securities Exchange Act class-action lawsuit[edit]
The company has been known for its literature, websites, and multi-level marketing with claims of scientific links to cellular glycobiology long disputed by relevant individual Nobel prize winners.[28] On March 1, 2005 a jury trial was demanded[29] and on September 9, 2005 a class-action lawsuit was filed against Mannatech for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act. The plaintiff class accused Mannatech of violating the act by "issuing a series of material misrepresentations"; specifically: failing to control its sales associates and allowing them to make false claims concerning the efficacy of Mannatech products. This caused a misleading price inflation of the company's stock.[30] The plaintiffs consisted of the purchasers of Mannatech stock during the period August 10, 2004 through July 30, 2007.[12] On March 20, 2008, Mannatech settled the class-action lawsuit by agreeing to pay $11.25 million to the plaintiff class. As part of the settlement, Mannatech admitted no wrongdoing.[31]
Texas Attorney General civil complaint[edit]
Mannatech came under investigation by the Texas Attorney General on October 27, 2006 for alleged violations of that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[32] Samuel L. Caster, Mannatech's founder and chief executive officer at the time, stated: "We walk the fine line of always stating our case appropriately and always training our people: We're not into the treatment, cure or mitigation of disease. We're into the improvement of quality of life. Now, who can benefit from good nutrition? Sick people, well people, everybody. Everybody benefits from good nutrition."[32]
On July 5, 2007, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott formally charged Mannatech, MannaRelief, Sam Caster, and Reginald McDaniel, the company's medical director, with operating an illegal marketing scheme in violation of state law.[33] A press release stated, "Today's enforcement action stems from a large-scale investigation by state authorities, who examined Mannatech's dubious claims about the health benefits of its products."[13] In response to the civil complaint, Mannatech expanded its compliance department and began to provide periodic reports to the Attorney General's office to ensure that the marketing efforts of its affiliate network adhere to appropriate guidelines.[34]
Mannatech settled the civil complaint on February 26, 2009 by agreeing to pay $4 million in restitution to clients who purchased products and $2 million to the state to cover its costs in the case. In addition, Sam Caster agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty and steer clear of any type of leadership position or employment relationship with Mannatech for five years.[35][36] When discussing the settlement at a news conference, Abbot stated, "Bottom line, this is a warning to the general public: Be wary of phony claims of magic cure-all pills or false hope in a bottle. You could be duped into purchasing something that has no real effect and no real value."[37] Mannatech did not admit wrongdoing; settling was easier than debating Abbott, according to then-CEO Wayne Badovinus.[citation needed] "If they do it again, we will ensure they get put out of business," Abbott said.[38]
One year later, Mannatech Co-CEO Robert Sinnott reflected on the ramifications of the legal action, saying, "The civil action related mainly to some actions by our salesforce. We were embarrassed and also financially impacted by the attorney general suit. We learned from that chapter and it is closed. We've reached a settlement and we've paid the fees associated with it. We've done everything in our power to correct that and make sure we're in compliance in the future."[39]
ABC investigation[edit]
A 20/20 undercover investigation that aired June 1, 2007 on ABC Television showed Mannatech's sales associates teaching sales recruits how to target Mannatech products to patients with specific illnesses in a manner that purportedly does not violate U.S. federal law, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, by avoiding direct claims that the products cure any particular diseases.[8] Mannatech CEO Sam Caster was interviewed for the show and told 20/20 that Mannatech makes no specific health claims about its products. "I don't think dietary supplements treat, cure, mitigate anything. It is not meant to substitute a doctor's oversight, but it plays an important role in the whole health equation."[8]
Company losses[edit]
Mannatech announced in August 2007 that company founder Sam Caster was stepping down as CEO of Mannatech,[40] to be replaced by Wayne Badovinus as the new chief executive. Several corporate initiatives were undertaken, but after 17 months on the job Badovinus resigned in December 2009.[41]
Another member of the board resigned shortly after.[42] Mannatech's Chief Science Officer Robert Sinnott and Mannatech's chief financial officer Steve Fenstermacher were named Co-CEOs.[43] Fenstermacher later resigned.[44]
Publicity over the company's lawsuits began to damage the balance sheets and stock performance.[41] After profits of $32 million in 2006 and $6.6 million in 2007, Mannatech reported a $12.6 million loss in 2008 and a $17.3 million loss in 2009.[45] By mid-year 2010, one quarter of Mannatech's sales were gone.[45] 2010 losses were $10.6 million.[46] As the company's market capitalizations continued to fall, S&P Indices dropped it from the S&P 600 Index, stating "They are no longer representative of the small cap market space."[47] Recruiting efforts continued dropping in 2011, widening company losses to $20.6 million.[48]
Illegal marketing by U.K. physician[edit]
As reported by the British Medical Journal, Mannatech distributor Vivienne Balonwu, a U.K. general practitioner, was found by the U.K. General Medical Council panel to have "abused her power as a doctor" after it was determined that she had illegally promoted and sold the company's glyconutrients to patients as a treatment for medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and stroke-related complications. Following patient complaints about her marketing of the products in 2006, Balonwu was dismissed by her employer Harmoni, a medical services company, and the GMC panel imposed a 15-month penalty period during which she was "to avoid private or short term locum work" and "to complete a supervised personal development plan to tackle shortcomings in her practice.[49]
Ben Carson[edit]
From 2004 until early 2014, neurosurgeon and conservative speaker Ben Carson made videos and spoke at company events promoting Mannatech and its products.
After undergoing surgery for prostate cancer on August 7, 2002[50] Carson claimed in an interview the following November that the surgery had successfully removed all cancerous tissue and that he was completely cured of the disease.[51] However, in 2004, in a speech at a Mannatech event, he credited the company's products with the disappearance of his cancer symptoms.[52][53]
His most recent paid speech for the company was in 2013, for which he was paid $42,000. His image appeared on the corporation's website in 2014,[52] and in the same year he praised their "glyconutrient" supplements in a PBS special ("The Missing Link – The Science of Brain Health"), sponsored by a group of Mannatech distributors, that was subsequently featured on the site.[54]
Carson delivered the keynote address at a Mannatech distributor convention in 2011 during which he said that the company had donated funds to help him obtain a coveted endowed chair post at Johns Hopkins Medicine: ". . . three years ago I had an endowed chair bestowed upon me and uh, it requires $2.5 million to do an endowed chair and I'm proud to say that part of that $2.5 million came from Mannatech." In October 2015, Carson's campaign team said that "there was no contribution from Mannatech to Johns Hopkins", and that his statement had been "a legitimate mistake on his part. Confusion. He had been doing some fundraising for the hospital and some other chairs about that time, and he simply got things mixed up."[55]
During the CNBC GOP debate on October 28, 2015, Carson was asked about his relationship with Mannatech. He replied, "That's easy to answer. I didn't have any involvement with Mannatech. Total propaganda. I did a couple speeches for them. I did speeches for other people—they were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say I had any kind of relation with them. Do I take the product? Yes. I think it is a good product."[56] Politifact rated Carson's denial of any involvement as "false", pointing to his paid speeches for Mannatech and his appearances in promotional videos in which he gave favorable reviews to its products, despite not being "an official spokesman or sales associate".[57] When the CNBC moderator commented that Carson was on Mannatech's website, he replied that he had not given his permission. Earlier, he had said that he was unaware of the company's legal history.[58]
On November 3, 2015, Mannatech said on its website that for compliance with Federal campaign finance regulations the company had removed all references to Carson before he announced his bid for the presidency.[59]
Rafael Cruz[edit]
From 1993 to 2009, Rafael Bienvenido Cruz, father of presidential candidate Rafael Edward "Ted" Cruz, was a top salesman for Mannatech.[60][61]
Sam Caster[edit]
Prior to Mannatech[edit]
Samuel L. Caster is the founder and former Chairman of the board of directors of Mannatech. His first major business venture, Eagle Shield, was an insulation product that claimed to utilize new technology developed by NASA and could reduce heating and cooling costs by up to 40%. In May 1988, the Attorney General of Texas concluded that the product's technology long predated NASA and did not reduce consumers' bills in the amounts advertised.[62][63] Caster agreed to cease the misleading claims made about Eagle Shield.[29] Caster's second product, the "Electracat," was sold as a pest control device. The Electracat reportedly emitted pulsed vibrations that repelled rats, crickets, snakes, ticks, spiders, mosquitoes, and scorpions. However, in January 1991, the Attorney General of Texas investigated the product and found that the Electracat emitted no vibrations whatsoever. The Attorney General declared, "The device is a hoax, and stands on the same scientific footing as a perpetual motion machine."[62][63] Caster was ordered to stop selling the Electracat and to reimburse the state $125,000 in investigative costs.[64]
Mannatech's inception[edit]
Caster then started Mannatech in 1993, as Congress prepared to pass the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which made feasible the profitable marketing of a wider spectrum of dietary supplements.[65]
Consultant to Mannatech[edit]
On August 22, 2007, Sam Caster resigned as CEO of Mannatech.[40] On October 19, 2007, it was reported that the company had fired Grant Thornton LLP as its auditor after the accounting firm demanded that Mannatech remove Sam Caster from all responsibilities.[66] Sam Caster was barred by the attorney general of Texas from serving as a director, officer, or employee of Mannatech for five years—from February 2009 until February 2014.[62] Caster was also barred from taking a role in any other multi-level marketing programs during that time. Despite this, then-CEO Wayne Badovinus stated Caster would work as a consultant answering directly to him.[37] The attorney general's office agreed Caster could serve as an outside consultant to the company.[62]
In March 2014, Caster appeared as main speaker at a Mannatech videoconference event with sales associates for the company's new skin rejuvenation product. Introduced as the company's founder and "visionary," he explained the company's new product and his role in its creation. "Oh my gosh, This stuff really works." he said, of the product. "No one could have predicted it would have that immediate an impact."[62]
In august 2016 Mannatech resolved its differences with Sam Caster and his consulting company, Wonder Enterprises, LLC. Caster, who left Mannatech in 2014, and Mannatech have ended arbitration proceedings. Mannatech has agreed to not pursue its rights to enforce certain covenants under the prior consulting agreements with Caster and Wonder Enterprises.[67]
MannaRelief Ministries[edit]
MannaRelief Ministries is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 1999 by Sam Caster.[68] William A. Mullens, Caster's brother-in-law, serves as MannaRelief's Executive Director, and Caster's wife, Linda, serves as chairman of the board.[69] MannaRelief receives a portion of the proceeds from Mannatech products purchased on "automatic order", and in turn distributes PhytoBlend powder (a dietary supplement purchased at cost from Mannatech[69]) to various unidentified orphanages and international relief organizations.[70][71][72][73] From 2009 to 2011, Manntech provided a total of $1.5 million in cash donations to MannaRelief, and MannaRelief purchased $1.6 million worth of products from Mannatech.[69]

Mannatech Reviews
 Mannatech Inc 







                                    is the leading developer, researcher, and 







                                    marketer of glyconutrients in the form of 







                                    Mannatech Vitamins and products.  







                                    Mannatech Inc was founded in the early 90's 







                                    and is based out of Coppell, TX.  The 







                                    company is publicly traded on the NASDAQ and 







                                    is considered to be a mid-cap Corp. 







                                    
Mannatech Inc now operates in a variety 







                                    of countries around the globe including the 







                                    United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, and 







                                    the UK.  Mannatech products include 







                                    vitamins and supplements headed by the 







                                    flagship product Ambrotose.  
The full Mannatech Inc product line 







                                    includes 25 nutritional supplements, 3 







                                    topical creams, and 4 weight loss inducing 







                                    products.  These are all sold through a 







                                    Multi level Marketing system.  
Although Mannatech Inc does 







                                    extensive research on all its products and 







                                    the board is headed by several renowned 







                                    scientists there is controversy over the 







                                    validity of their research trials.  







                                    They have not conducted controlled clinical 







                                    trials for all their products, meaning that 







                                    they have not been tested against a placebo.  







                                    The only one that they did perform revealed 







                                    no significant benefit of glyconutrients and 







                                    their derivative products. 
However many people testify to the 







                                    healing powers of Ambrotose, claiming that 







                                    it's responsible for treating everything 







                                    from eczema to lupus.  Again the 







                                    validity of these claims has not been 







                                    verified.  Despite the controversy 







                                    Mannatech Inc does have some very noble 







                                    goals and programs.  Including a 







                                    program designed to help ailing children 







                                    with nutritional deficiencies strengthen 







                                    their immune systems.
On top of the questionable effectiveness 







                                    of Mannatech products there are a 







                                    couple more warning signs.  Two of the 







                                    founders have questionable pasts and 







                                    Mannatech Inc is currently under 







                                    investigation by the Texas Attorney General 







                                    for alleged violation of the Deceptive Trade 







                                    Practices Act.

Jan   Georgia12:15pm on June 7th, 2014 I absolutely love firm and emprizone. ...both were used on my sister's legs when she had squamous cell carcinoma.   Her tumers started going away...the oncologists said he had never seen anything like it... she also did hydro tx and used a charcoal poultice on her legs.....her family did not want to go through the bother of doing all I had begun for her tx program....instead they insisted she have her leg amputated. ...so much pressure. ..she wanted to stick with our program....she buckled under the stress...gave in...had the a mputation and died 14 months later from mets to bone and lung!  What a wasted shame! !!
Janice Hwang   Seoul, Korea9:15am on September 22nd, 2013 I have been taking these products for 3 months including advanced ambrotose, osolean, vitamins and glycoslim. Now I can see my health condition has been improved. I have lost 8 pounds by taking protin shake. I also look younger and never get sick as well as other people who commented here. Thanks to Mannatech, I was glad to find that there is a company who has a mission for helping kids with malnutrition. I mean how many for profit companies can really help children continuously? 



Ron   Europe7:00am on July 3rd, 2013Been using this product for 7 days, after 2 days on the product a normal stool which I havent had for a long time.
Also some scar tissue on my skin which has been there for a decade is fading. And some small warts on my hand are shrinking, they are there for a decade as well.

Unfortunately no changes in my mental state, still highly anxious and depressed, brain fog.

I hope this clears up in time, so no rating yet.
Anna   New Zealand4:30am on May 5th, 2013 All I know was that I had PCOS and also had a bleeding disorder which had me bleeding constantly for 7 months.  2 months after taking twice the recommended amount this started to abate, 9 months later there is no trace of it and my periods have gone completely back to normal.  I did nothing different except take this as I heard t had helped people in similar positions.
Anonymous   Location unknown8:29am on May 3rd, 2013I gave my son Advanced Ambrotose when his kidneys were failing during high-dose chemo during cancer.  In ONE DAY his kidney function began to improve and continued to improve during the chemo treatment and beyond.  That was 5 years ago.  He continues to take it daily.
La-Nette   Yuba City10:25pm on February 25th, 2013 I started taking  Mannetech 5 years ago.  All I can say is I LOVE IT!!!  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a health choice regiment.  I take Plus, Ambrotose and AO.  I feel good everyday and notice I am never sick.  I am 45yrs old no health issues at this time.
Becky   Spokane, WA2:02am on October 23rd, 2012 I take the probiotic/prebiotic supplement and have seen incredible improvement with my digestive tract. Quite honestly, though, other companies may have equally quality probiotics. I just prefer Mannatech because I can take the supplement as a powder with food (most probiotics have to be taken on an empty stomach). As for the other Mannatech supplements, quite honestly, the price is prohibitive. I'm also so tired of hearing my friend and her mother give me constant sales pitches about Mannatech, regurgitating what they're taught to say, that I am really sick of hearing about the company. But I am very grateful for the priobotic/prebiotic. It's about the same price as other probiotics, and now I can eat chocolate and mildly spicy foods again! So, Mannatech may be scamming in some areas (I really don't know), but the probiotics are the real deal.
Terry   Utah1:41am on September 13th, 2012 Who writes  these reviews about mannatech. It is  overpriced garbage. The placebo affect  is in full force with people who  claim these great results with this product. Most people are smart enough to not get trapped into paying money to this company and it over zealous associates. I am in Heath care profession and no one I know uses supplements from mannatech.
Paula   Oklahoma2:39pm on August 21st, 2012 Have used Mannatech products for at least 8 years. Got off of it one time and was sick every other month with sinus infections, etc. Needless to say, I got back on Mannatech and have never looked back.  There is no need to took elsewhere for vitamins.  Mannatech products are some kind of magic!
mickjayess   Wa State11:35pm on July 15th, 2012 At Aaron in Melbourne.  I am analytical and for my own analysis, I say that the product gave me about 30% more energy.  In my opinion.  It could have been 14%, heck, maybe 46%, I dunno.  But, it was more than slight.  It was enough for me to really notice it.  And not getting sick.  I have to say, maybe there's some other lifestyle change that reduced my number and longevity of sicknesses.  But I can't think of any other change in my life except I added the product.  So, yep, let's just say there's a chance of 100% error in my analysis.  It doesn't change the fact that I started using the product, and all things being equal, I felt 30% more energy and didn't get sick.  So try it for yourself, and don't judge me by my own opinion.
Anonymous   Location unknown12:32pm on November 5th, 2011 I have been taking Manateck for five years and have had no illness at all.  The product works, there is no doubt in my mind.  I am not a distributor just a very happy user.  I think the best way to judge the product is to try it for a while and you will see for yourself.
Aaron   Melbourne6:40pm on November 2nd, 2011Science is a discipline which is evidence based. So when you make a claim you should be backing it up with a study that supports it. This is especially important when you are recommending an expensive product to someone desperately seeking hope that they can cure a condition. Taking advantage of vulnerable people is unethical.

Second, all the associates of mannatech clearly have a conflict of interest. So you especially need to be backing up your claims. 

And also, people (mickjayess, Seattle WA) talking about the effectiveness of mannatech products, by claiming they give him �30% more energy and 50% less illness,� (which is ridiculous!! How do u define illness and how can you claim you get specifically 30% more energy? Maybe you think saying you are �analytical in nature� before you say this actually backs it up???) before they put up an ad for �the 7 iron laws for successful forex trading� doesn�t exactly give a good impression of people trying to sell the stuff... 

Deborah Andrews   Savannah, Ga7:58am on July 28th, 2011 I am have been a nurse for 30 years and I have never seen anything that can help someone to improve his health faster than glyconutrients.  The pharmaceutical community has attempted to gag Mannatech Associates so that the word cannot get out.  After all, if people get healthy this will reduce their market share/profits.

The results you achieve are in direct proportion to the severity of your conditions and the number of servings you take. My health and my son's health has been dramatically improved by giving our bodies the glyconutrients necessary to have proper cell-to-cell communication.
mickjayess   Seattle, Wa11:22am on July 10th, 2011 I give the products 5 stars.  My parents take AO and Sport supplements by Mannatech.  I take both, but only one capsule per day.  So I take AO one day, and a Sport the next day etc...  Neither me or my parents are distributors.  Compared to any other nutritional product on the market, these rate at the top.  Sure, there are several other products that I rate excellent as well.  I simply choose only to take excellent products for my own health.  There is NO cure all, but the AO is wonderful.  It reduces the number of illnesses I get per year.  I am analytical in nature, so in my opinion these give me about 30% more energy and 50% less illness.  AND I'M ONLY TAKING ONE CAPSULE A DAY!!
Maria   los angeles8:38pm on May 16th, 2011 my bf was diagnosed with psoriasis and he has been taking maanotech stuff. I have to say If not that stuff his outbreaks would have been worse. i was taking stuff from Pharmanex that stuff is yuck... esp diet shakes ..  it is drained not filling just ewww their original formula was much much better.so i am thinking of trying Mannotech.
Robin   Australia6:03pm on April 7th, 2010 I have been an associate for 11 years and have found their products excellent. I rated your review only fair as if you want to inform your readers you need to keep your reviews up to date. The investigation by the Texas AG filed in favor of Mannatech which alone says huge positive things about the company.
Linda   Florence, AL11:17am on June 23rd, 2009 I have religiously used Ambrotose and PLUS since 1997, when I was diagnosed with Melanoma cancer. Because I am totally sold on it, I would like to find someone to network with in the North Alabama area.
Jackie   Las Vegas, NV1:20pm on June 8th, 2009 We were told about Mannatch by a friend who is a nurse. She had gotten the products for her mother who had cancer and just raved about them.
We got the products for my mother who was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. I believe these products helped my mother tolerate her chemo treatments as well as help her appatite. Not to mention, gave her the strength she needed to  go through everything else. She was only given 12-18 mos. and survived for 3 yrs. So I believe the products helped her.
Jay   Colorado5:50pm on May 8th, 2009 I don't care at all about signing up anybody personally to Mannatech  cause I am in another MLM that I make more money in a lot faster. What I can say is that I had the flu or colds 2 or 3 times a year before I started taking Ambrotose and I have not had either one in the last 2 years I have used it. I will continue to use and suggest people use it even though its expensive but can't sign anybody up cause most MLM companies don't like cross hosting. It's worth the high price.
Anonymous   Location unknown12:07am on December 15th, 2008I take Ambrotose. After learning about the science its  essential for us on a daily basis.  Who would not want healthy cells? The supplements can also be bought online without becoming an associate. They give you that option.  Great company. I'm not in it to make money but to take the products and be able to tell others.

Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
