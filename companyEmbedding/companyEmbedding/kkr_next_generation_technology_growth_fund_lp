      Conversion

 GOLETA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Transphorm

      Inc, an early stage semiconductor company focused on redefining

      power conversion, today announced a $70 million investment round led by

      global investment firm KKR.

      KKR's investment follows initial rounds of funding led by funds

      affiliated with Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, Foundation Capital,

      Google Ventures, Soros Quantum Strategic Partners, INCJ, Fujitsu,

      Transphorm will use this funding to support its growth, product

      innovation and expansion.

Umesh Mishra, Chairman and Co-Founder of Tranphorm (Photo: Business Wire)  


Dr.

      Umesh Mishra, Chairman of Transphorm Inc, stated: "Transphorm was

      launched to address the urgent and important problem of losses in power

      conversion, a process that converts electricity from the form it is

      delivered to the form that is ultimately used. We are delighted KKR has

      chosen to invest in Transphorm. By merging the technological leadership

      of Transphorm with the semiconductor business expertise of KKR, we are

      taking a major step forward in solving the global problem of energy

      wasted in power conversion."

    


      Transphorm believes that there is a very large market for its products

      as its ultra-efficient power devices and modules can eliminate more than

      40% of all electric conversion losses by using Gallium Nitride ("GaN"),

      a new semiconductor material that switches at far higher speeds than

      traditional components. GaN-based technology, known for its connection

      to the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics, creates a brighter, more energy

      efficient light that today is the basis of the multi-billion dollar

      LED-based lighting industry. Similarly, when applied to power

      conversion, GaN components enable significantly more efficient, compact,

      and cost-effective products.

    


      "Gallium Nitride is the most important new semiconductor in the world

      today," said Dr.

      Shuji Nakamura, 2014 Nobel Laureate in Physics and Director of the

      Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Center (SSLEEC) at UC Santa

      Barbara. "My invention of the GaN-based LED and Solid State Lighting has

      changed the world in illumination. Gallium Nitride is also the best

      material for power conversion and is essential to eliminate the enormous

      amount of energy wasted in these processes. Transphorm is the leading

      company producing GaN-based power conversion products that will have the

      same positive impact on energy we saw with LED-based lighting."

      Transphorm's products deliver world class efficiency, power density and

      power savings. They have a power efficiency of up to 98% in data centers

      and telecom applications, resulting in energy savings of over 10GWh

      annually in a typical datacenter, or the equivalent of the annual

      electricity usage of 1,000 typical U.S. homes. In addition to PV

      inverters and datacenters, other applications for Transphorm's

      technology include power supplies, motor drives and automotive systems.

    


      Manufacturers are now producing the world's smallest PV inverters by

      leveraging Transphorm's technology in their products. Transphorm has

      established strategic partnerships with industry-leading customers and

      suppliers. Yaskawa

      Electric Corporation, a global leader in motion control, robotics

      and systems engineering, launched the first GaN-based commercially

      produced solar photovoltaic (PV) inverter, powered by Transphorm GaN, in

      the Japan market earlier this year. Transphorm's products enable

      approximately 50% smaller PV inverters in residential and small

      commercial installations up to 5kW, resulting in lower system,

      installation, and service costs while at the same time delivering more

      energy per solar panel to the grid. Tata

      Power Solar, one of the pioneering solar manufacturers in the world

      and India's leading power conversion player, has also teamed with

      Transphorm to develop leading edge PV inverters. In order to provide

      customers with high quality volume production, Transphorm partnered with

      Fujitsu Semiconductor, to produce its products in Fujitsu's

      automotive-class wafer fabrication facility in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan.

    


      "Transphorm's technology is paving the way for a revolutionary change in

      energy efficiency. Right now, Transphorm is the only place where

      customers can acquire reliable, production volume GaN products that meet

      or exceed required performance specs for commercial products. Long term,

      we believe this has the potential to replace all of the existing

      silicon-based technology used in high voltage products, and wide

      adoption of this technology will dramatically reduce the amount of

      energy that is wasted by electric devices," David Kerko, Senior Advisor

      of KKR, said.

    


      For KKR, the investment is part of the firm's growth equity strategy,

      which is focused on market-leading, high-growth companies for which KKR

      can be a unique partner in helping reach scale and the next level of

      growth. KKR is funding the investment from the balance sheet of KKR &

      Co. LP (NYSE:KKR).

    


      As part of the transaction, KKR's David Kerko, Brittany

      Bagley and Eiji

      Yatagawa will join Transphorm's Board of Directors, and KKR has also

      nominated semiconductor industry veterans Mario Rivas and Michael White

      to the Transphorm board.

Aims to Back Growth Companies to Build Leading Global Enterprises

MENLO PARK, Calif. & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KKR, a leading global investment firm, today announced the final closing of KKR Next Generation Technology Growth Fund ("NGT" or the "Fund"), a $711 million fund dedicated to growth equity investment opportunities in the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) space in North America, Europe and Israel.

	The Fund is focused on generating strong returns for investors by investing in market-leading, high-growth companies. Beyond access to financial capital, KKR offers partner companies access to KKR's operational expertise, deep network, industry expertise, global reach and insights from its more than 100 current portfolio companies worldwide, which translates into over $7 billion in Information Technology spend and over $10 billion in marketing spend annually.

	NGT is part of KKR's TMT private equity platform which is led by Herald Chen and Richard Sarnoff in the Americas and Philipp Freise in Europe. Leading the TMT Growth strategy is KKR new-hire David Welsh, a veteran in the TMT growth equity space who joined the Firm in October from Adams Street Partners, where he was a Partner on the growth equity and venture capital teams focusing on enterprise technology.

	"We believe we can offer a unique set of assets and resources to our partner companies," said Mr. Welsh, Managing Director and Head of TMT Growth at KKR. "In today's evolving technology landscape, the combination of KKR's global network, sourcing engine, value creation and capital markets capabilities can help accelerate new market leaders. We look forward to leveraging our global footprint to build leading enterprises in technology, while also aiming to deliver strong returns for our investors."

	The Fund seeks to invest in secular growth areas with structured downside protection, limited leverage and will seek to take on execution risk as opposed to fundamental technology risk. In particular, NGT is expected to make equity investments amounting to less than $100 million and focused on the following themes: Business to Business Software /Software-as-a-Service, Information Technology Automation/ Infrastructure, Security, Scalable Internet /Digital Media, and the Internet of Things.

	"Our overall approach to TMT is to identify platforms - management teams, businesses, and sectors -where we can invest to build leading global TMT enterprises, whether in Private Equity or now through our new growth fund," said Herald Chen, Co-Head of TMT in North America, and Philipp Freise, Head of TMT in Europe. "This strategy has served us well and we look forward to building upon it further by helping more entrepreneurs take their companies to the next level."

	The Fund received strong backing from a diverse group of new and existing global investors, including public and corporate pensions, family offices and high net worth individual investors. "We are really pleased with the response from investors and excited to see they share our enthusiasm for the attractive opportunities NGT presents," said Alisa Amarosa Wood, KKR Member and Head of Private Market Products Group.

	KKR has a long record of supporting technology companies, having invested over $18 billion of equity in TMT-related private equity investments since 1983 and over $640 million in NGT-related growth equity investments since 2014. Over the last year, the Firm has executed a number of transactions as part of the firm's growth equity strategy, including Optimal+, GetYourGuide, Jitterbit, and Darktrace.

      and insights from its more than 100 current portfolio companies 
      worldwide, which translates into over $7 billion in Information 
      Technology spend and over $10 billion in marketing spend annually.
    

      NGT is part of KKR’s 
      TMT private equity platform which is led by Herald 
      Chen and Richard 
      Sarnoff in the Americas and Philipp 
      Freise in Europe. Leading the TMT Growth strategy is KKR new-hire David 
      Welsh, a veteran in the TMT growth equity space who joined the Firm 
      in October from Adam Street Partners, where he was a Partner on the 
      growth equity and venture capital teams focusing on enterprise 
      technology.
    

      “We believe we can offer a unique set of assets and resources to our 
      partner companies,” said Mr. Welsh, Managing Director and Head of TMT 
      Growth at KKR. “In today’s evolving technology landscape, the 
      combination of KKR’s global network, sourcing engine, value creation and 
      capital markets capabilities can help accelerate new market leaders. We 
      look forward to leveraging our global footprint to build leading 
      enterprises in technology, while also aiming to deliver strong returns 
      for our investors.”
    

      The Fund seeks to invest in secular growth areas with structured 
      downside protection, limited leverage and will seek to take on execution 
      risk as opposed to fundamental technology risk. In particular, NGT is 
      expected to make equity investments amounting to less than $100 million 
      and focused on the following themes: Business to Business Software 
      /Software-as-a-Service, Information Technology Automation/ 
      Infrastructure, Security, Scalable Internet /Digital Media, and the 
      Internet of Things.
    

      “Our overall approach to TMT is to identify platforms – management 
      teams, businesses, and sectors –where we can invest to build leading 
      global TMT enterprises, whether in Private Equity or now through our new 
      growth fund,” said Herald Chen, Co-Head of TMT in North America, and 
      Philipp Freise, Head of TMT in Europe. “This strategy has served us well 
      and we look forward to building upon it further by helping more 
      entrepreneurs take their companies to the next level.”
    

      The Fund received strong backing from a diverse group of new and 
      existing global investors, including public and corporate pensions, 
      family offices and high net worth individual investors. “We are really 
      pleased with the response from investors and excited to see they share 
      our enthusiasm for the attractive opportunities NGT presents,” said Alisa 
      Amarosa Wood, KKR Member and Head of Private Market Products Group.
    

      KKR has a long record of supporting technology companies, having 
      invested over $18 billion of equity in TMT-related private equity 
      investments since 1983 and over $640 million in NGT-related growth 
      equity investments since 2014. Over the last year, the Firm has executed 
      a number of transactions as part of the firm’s growth equity strategy, 
      including Optimal+, 
      GetYourGuide, 
      Jitterbit, 
      and Darktrace.

KKR Next Generation Technology Growth Fund is on track to close by year-end with about $700 million, according to a person familiar with the process.KKR used its $13.5 billion balance sheet to test the strategy over the past few years, investing in 15 companies to build experience and credibility. Four of the companies -- Optimal Plus Ltd., GetYourGuide Inc., Jitterbit Inc. and Darktrace Ltd. -- will be rolled into the new fund, said the person, who asked not to be named because the information isn’t public.








The New York-based firm is raising money for a growth-equity fund dedicated to health-care deals too. KKR, which also used its balance sheet to start making those investments, is targeting $650 million to $800 million for the pool, people familiar with the process said in September.Growth equity has become more attractive for leveraged-buyout firms as they search for out-sized returns amid costly valuations for conventional LBOs. In February, London-based CVC Capital Partners finished raising $1 billion for a tech-focused growth fund after surpassing its $750 million target. Carlyle Group LP has taken a geography-specific approach to the strategy, having launched growth efforts in Asia and Europe.TPG, which raised its first growth-equity fund in 2007, was one of the first movers among traditional LBO managers. Led by Bill McGlashan, its three growth funds oversee more than $7 billion, counting Airbnb Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. among their high-profile investments. They’ve also backed businesses in Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Morocco.




Partner v. OwnerThe private equity firms bet that young companies will seek industry expertise and global access as they expand beyond initial markets. Typically the businesses have raised venture capital for one to several funding rounds and are looking to partner with an experienced capital provider before going public or being sold to a strategic acquirer.“They’re looking for a partner as distinct from an owner,” said Jonathan Korngold, global head of financial services at General Atlantic, a private equity firm that’s been dedicated to growth equity since its founding in 1980. “That’s probably the biggest departure of where growth equity starts and stops versus some later-scale buyouts.”




KKR, one of the oldest buyout firms, made its name on massive takeovers of mature businesses. Led by billionaires Henry Kravis and George Roberts, some of its hallmark deals include the $31 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. in 1988 and the $48 billion acquisition of Energy Future Holdings Corp. in 2007, the biggest-ever LBO.“We’ve always been enterprise builders,” Herald Chen, co-head of KKR’s technology team, said in an interview.Chen, who declined to comment on fundraising, said KKR’s more-than 100 portfolio companies and global presence can help provide growth-stage businesses an immediate network and potential customers.Inflection PointsA window into earlier-stage businesses can also give private equity managers insight for other investment opportunities. That’s become increasingly important as the firms try to diversify their offerings, catering to investors such as pension funds and endowments that want to allocate money to a more select group of asset managers.“We are catching companies and catching industries at their inflection points,” said General Atlantic’s Korngold. GA, which manages about $20 billion, has invested in companies such as Snap Inc., BuzzFeed Inc., Uber and Airbnb.

For TPG, which has its main offices in San Francisco and Fort Worth, Texas, the growth-equity strategy has paid off. Its first fund, a $1.3 billion pool, was generating a 12 percent annualized return after fees as of June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its second fund, which finished gathering $2 billion in 2012, had a 30 percent return as of June. TPG got $3 billion in five months for its third fund last year.Despite KKR’s experience investing in growth-stage companies using its balance sheet, the firm has bolstered its prospects with staff who can screen investments differently than a leveraged-buyout dealmaker might.KKR recently brought in Dave Welsh from Adams Street Partners to oversee the growth efforts in tech, media and telecom, the person familiar with the moves said. It’s also hired from Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Technology Crossover Ventures, TPG, Silver Lake Management and General Atlantic, the person said.“It’s less transaction-oriented and more relationship-driven” than buyouts, Richard Maclean, co-founder of growth-equity firm Frontier Capital, said of the strategy. “You’re less focused on purely maximizing earnings and paying down debt, and more focused on building out a next-level team and go-to-market strategy. It’s definitely a different business.”
