							A Word On Risk

							Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Debt or fixed income securities such as those held by the Fund, are subject to market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, call risk, state concentration risk, tax risk, and income risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Credit risk refers to an issuers ability to make interest and principal payments when due. Below investment grade or high yield debt securities are subject to liquidity risk and heightened credit risk. The Fund's use of inverse floaters creates effective leverage. Leverage involves the risk that the Fund could lose more than its original investment and also increases the Fund's exposure to volatility and interest rate risk.

						








  Returns quoted represent past performance which is no guarantee of future performance.  Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than their original cost. Income is generally exempt from regular federal income taxes. Some income may be subject to state and local taxes and to the federal alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, are subject to tax. Due to market conditions, current performance may be higher or lower than the data shown. Returns without sales charge do not reflect the imposition of the maximum sales charge, which would reduce returns. Total returns for a period of less than one year are cumulative.       Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Class A shares have a 4.2% maximum sales charge. Class C and C2 shares have a 1% CDSC for redemptions within less than one year, which is not reflected in the one-year total return. Class I shares have no sales charge and may be purchased under limited circumstances or by specified classes of investors.  Load-waived (LW) Class A share star ratings do not include any front-end sales load and are intended for those investors who have access to such purchase terms (e.g., plan participants of a defined contribution plan). Not all A share mutual funds for which Morningstar calculates a load-waived A share star rating may actually waive their front-end sales load. Absent the waiver, ratings may be lower. All of the funds above offer A shares at maximum sales charge which varies by fund; and I shares which have no sales charge. Ratings are for the share class cited only; other share classes have different performance and different Morningstar RatingsTM.Expense ratios are based on the Fund's most recent fiscal year end. The net expense ratio excludes credits earned on the Fund's cash on deposit with the custodian bank, if any.


*Some income may be subject to state and local taxes and to the federal alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, are subject to tax.

			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks to achieve total return, comprised of current income and capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of investment-grade, fixed-income securities with a weighted average effective maturity and effective duration of less than three years.

			
			
				
			
		


Monthly Income
An actively managed, short-term bond strategy for investors seeking monthly income, limited interest rate risk and total return opportunities.



Quality
 
Income
 
Potentially limited interest rate risk


Designed for risk-conscious investors, the investment grade bond portfolio is composed of short term, high quality government, corporate and structured securities.
 
The fund complements its core high quality bonds with measured exposure to high yield bonds, which may provide opportunities for higher risk adjusted returns and incremental yield.
 
The short term portfolio targets to keep the average effective maturity and effective duration, a measure of sensitivity to interest rate risk, less than three years, which may limit investor exposure to changing interest rates.1





Footnote(s)

1 The average effective maturity of a portfolio is the weighted average of the maturities of the underlying bonds, taking into account the possibility that a bond might be called back to the issuer. Effective duration is a measure, as estimated by the fund’s portfolio managers, of a bond fund's price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It takes into account mortgage prepayments, puts, adjustable coupons and potential call dates. The longer a fund’s duration, the more sensitive the fund is to shifts in interest rates.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Ratings are based on S&P, Moody's or Fitch, as applicable. A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. NR indicates the debtor was not rated, and should not be interpreted as indicating low quality. If securities are rated differently by the rating agencies, the higher rating is applied. Credit ratings are based largely on the rating agency's investment analysis at the time of rating and the rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condition. The rating assigned to a security by a rating agency does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. For more information on the rating methodology, please visit the following NRSRO websites: www.standardandpoors.com and select 'Understanding Ratings' under Rating Resources on the homepage; www.moodys.com and select 'Rating Methodologies' under Research and Ratings on the homepage; www.fitchratings.com and select 'Ratings Definitions' on the homepage.

 About risk
			 


Active Trading Risk. Active trading of portfolio securities may result in
high brokerage costs, which may lower the Fund's actual return. Active
trading also may increase the proportion of the Fund's gains that are short
term, which are taxed at a higher rate than long term gains. 

Changing Fixed Income Market Conditions Risk. The current low interest
rate environment was created in part by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB)
and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent
foreign rates at or near zero. Increases in the federal funds and equivalent
foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and
reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments, particularly those with
longer maturities. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer
market-making capacity may persist in the future, potentially leading to
heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets. As a
result, the value of the Fund's investments and share price may decline. In
addition, because of changing central bank policies, the Fund may
experience higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could
potentially increase portfolio turnover and the Fund's transaction costs and
potentially lower the Fund's performance returns. 

Collateralized Loan Obligations Risk. CLOs are subject to the risks of
substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers, which will
be greater during periods of economic or financial stress. CLOs may also
lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate
tranches, market anticipation of defaults, and investor aversion to CLO
securities as a class. The risks of CLOs will be greater if the Fund invests in
CLOs that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the Fund holds
subordinate tranches of the CLO that absorbs losses from the defaults
before senior tranches. In addition, CLOs are subject to interest rate risk and
credit risk. 

Debt Securities Risk. The prices of debt securities held by the Fund will
be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness of the issuer
and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes
the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on
longer-duration debt securities and higher quality debt securities. Falling
interest rates will cause the Fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities
that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates. Falling interest
rates may also reduce the Fund's distributable income because interest
payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the Fund will decline.
The Fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or
borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments and/or to
repay principal in a timely manner. If an issuer seeks to restructure the
terms of its borrowings or the Fund is required to seek recovery upon a
default in the payment of interest or the repayment of principal, the Fund
may incur additional expenses. Changes in an issuer's financial strength, the
market's perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or
the security may affect the value of debt securities. The Adviser's credit
analysis may fail to anticipate such changes, which could result in buying a
debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in
advance of a price decline or other credit event. 

Derivatives Risk. A derivative is an instrument whose value depends
largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency,
commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an
underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the
use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, which are
described below.

Counterparty Risk. Certain derivatives do not trade on an established
    exchange (referred to as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives) and are
    simply financial contracts between the Fund and a counterparty.
    When the Fund is owed money on an OTC derivative, the Fund is
    dependent on the counterparty to pay or, in some cases, deliver the
    underlying asset, unless the Fund can otherwise sell its derivative
    contract to a third party prior to its expiration. Many counterparties
    are financial institutions such as banks and broker-dealers and their
    creditworthiness (and ability to pay or perform) may be negatively
    impacted by factors affecting financial institutions generally. In
    addition, in the event that a counterparty becomes bankrupt or
    insolvent, the Fund's ability to recover the collateral that the Fund has
    on deposit with the counterparty could be delayed or impaired. For
    derivatives traded on a centralized exchange, the Fund generally is
    dependent upon the solvency of the relevant exchange clearing house
    (which acts as a guarantor for each contractual obligation under such
    derivatives) for payment on derivative instruments for which the Fund
    is owed money.
Leverage Risk. Many derivatives do not require a payment up front
    equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative,
    which creates a form of leverage. As a result, an adverse change in
    the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a
    loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the
    derivative. Leverage may therefore make the Fund's returns more
    volatile and increase the risk of loss. The Fund segregates or
    earmarks liquid assets with a value at least equal to the amount that
    the Fund owes the derivative counterparty each day, if any, or
    otherwise holds instruments that offset the Fund's daily obligation
    under the derivatives instrument. This process is sometimes referred
    to as "cover." The amount of liquid assets needed as cover will
    fluctuate over time as the value of the derivative instrument rises and
    falls. If the value of the Fund's derivative positions or the value of the
    assets used as cover unexpectedly decreases, the Fund may be
    forced to segregate additional liquid assets as cover or sell assets at
    a disadvantageous time or price to meet its derivative obligations or
    to meet redemption requests, which could affect management of the
    Fund and the Fund's returns. In certain market conditions, losses on
    derivative instruments can grow larger while the value of the Fund's
    other assets fall, resulting in the Fund's derivative positions becoming
    a larger percentage of the Fund's investments.
Liquidity Risk. There is a smaller pool of buyers and sellers for certain
    derivatives, particularly OTC derivatives, than more traditional
    investments such as stocks. These buyers and sellers are often
    financial institutions that may be unable or unwilling to buy or sell
    derivatives during times of financial or market stress. Derivative
    instruments may therefore be less liquid than more traditional
    investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or exit its derivative
    positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute
    under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be
    most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. To the extent that
    the Fund is unable to exit a derivative position because of market
    illiquidity, the Fund may not be able to prevent further losses of value
    in its derivatives holdings and the liquidity of the Fund and its ability
    to meet redemption requests may be impaired to the extent that a
    substantial portion of the Fund's otherwise liquid assets must be used
    as margin or cover. Another consequence of illiquidity is that the Fund
    may be required to hold a derivative instrument to maturity and take
    or make delivery of the underlying asset that the Adviser would
    otherwise have attempted to avoid.
Other Risks. Compared to other types of investments, derivatives may
    be harder to value and may also be less tax efficient, as described
    under the "Taxes" section of the prospectus. In addition, changes in
    government regulation of derivative instruments could affect the
    character, timing and amount of the Fund's taxable income or gains,
    and may limit or prevent the Fund from using certain types of
    derivative instruments as a part of its investment strategy, which
    could make the investment strategy more costly to implement or
    require the Fund to change its investment strategy. To the extent that
    the Fund uses derivatives for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a
    particular market or market segment, there may be imperfect
    correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the
    value of the instrument being hedged or the relevant market or
    market segment, in which case the Fund may not realize the intended
    benefits. There is also the risk that during adverse market conditions,
    an instrument which would usually operate as a hedge provides no
    hedging benefits at all. The Fund's use of derivatives may be limited
    by the requirements for taxation of the Fund as a regulated
    investment company.

Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to
as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility,
political, social and economic instability, uncertainty regarding the existence
of trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment
than more developed markets. In addition, companies operating in emerging
markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price
fluctuations than companies in more developed markets. Securities law in
many emerging market countries is relatively new and unsettled. Therefore,
laws regarding foreign investment in emerging market securities, securities
regulation, title to securities, and shareholder rights may change quickly and
unpredictably. In addition, the enforcement of systems of taxation at federal,
regional and local levels in emerging market countries may be inconsistent,
and subject to sudden change. Other risks of investing in emerging markets
securities may include additional transaction costs, delays in settlement
procedures, and lack of timely information. 

Foreign Credit Exposure Risk. U.S. dollar-denominated securities
carrying foreign credit exposure may be affected by unfavorable political,
economic or governmental developments that could affect payments of
principal and interest. 

Foreign Government Debt Risk. Investments in foreign government debt
securities (sometimes referred to as sovereign debt securities) involve
certain risks in addition to those relating to foreign securities or debt
securities generally. The issuer of the debt or the governmental authorities
that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay
principal or interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt,
and the Fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default against the
defaulting government. A foreign government debtor's willingness or ability
to repay principal and pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by,
among other factors, its cash flow situation, the extent of its foreign
currency reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange, the relative
size of the debt burden, the foreign government debtor's policy toward its
principal international lenders and local political constraints. Certain issuers
of foreign government debt may be dependent on disbursements from
foreign governments, multinational agencies and other entities to reduce
principal and interest arrearages on their debt. Without the approval of debt
holders, some governmental debtors have in the past been able to
reschedule or restructure their debt payments or declare moratoria on
payments. 

Foreign Securities Risk. The value of the Fund's foreign investments
may be adversely affected by political and social instability in the home
countries of the issuers of the investments, by changes in economic or
taxation policies in those countries, or by the difficulty in enforcing
obligations in those countries. Foreign investments also involve the risk of
the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign
deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain
market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such
as exchange controls. Foreign companies generally may be subject to less
stringent regulations than U.S. companies, including financial reporting
requirements and auditing and accounting controls, and may therefore be
more susceptible to fraud or corruption. Also, there may be less publicly
available information about companies in certain foreign countries than
about U.S. companies making it more difficult for the Adviser to evaluate
those companies. The laws of certain countries may put limits on the Fund's
ability to recover its assets held at a foreign bank if the foreign bank,
depository or issuer of a security, or any of their agents, goes bankrupt.
Trading in many foreign securities may be less liquid and more volatile than
U.S. securities due to the size of the market or other factors. Unless the
Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also
involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may
cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other
instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to
decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over
short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always
successful. 

High Yield Debt Securities (Junk Bond) Risk. The Fund's investments in
high yield debt securities (commonly referred to as "junk bonds") and other
lower-rated securities will subject the Fund to substantial risk of loss. These
securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuer's
ability to pay interest and principal when due and are more susceptible to
default or decline in market value due to adverse economic, regulatory,
political or company developments than higher rated or investment grade
securities. Prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile. These
securities are less liquid than investment grade debt securities and may be
difficult to sell at a desirable time or price, particularly in times of negative
sentiment toward high yield securities. 

Liquidity Risk. The Fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the
time or price it desires and, as a result, could lose its entire investment in
such investments. An investment may be illiquid due to a lack of trading
volume in the investment or if the investment is privately placed and not
traded in any public market or is otherwise restricted from trading. Certain
restricted securities require special registration and pose valuation
difficulties. Liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market
stress. If a significant amount of the Fund's securities become illiquid, the
Fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to
sell securities at significantly reduced prices. 

Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily
on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the
attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular
investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience
losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. There can be no guarantee
that the Adviser's investment techniques or investment decisions will
produce the desired results. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax
developments may affect the investments or investment strategies available
to the investment manager in connection with managing the Fund, which
may also adversely affect the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment
objective. 

Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and
therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes
rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or
section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. The value of
the Fund's investments may go up or down due to general market
conditions which are not specifically related to the particular issuer, such as
real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general
outlook for revenues or corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency
rates, regional or global instability, or adverse investor sentiment generally.
The value of the Fund's investments may also go up or down due to factors
that affect an individual issuer or a particular industry or sector, such as
changes in production costs and competitive conditions within an industry.
Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those
of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general
downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in
value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific
investments held by the Fund will rise in value. 

Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risk. Mortgage- and
asset-backed securities, including collateralized debt obligations and
collateralized mortgage obligations, differ from conventional debt securities
because principal is paid back over the life of the security rather than at
maturity. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment
or call risk, which is the risk that a borrower's payments may be received
earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on
underlying loans. Faster prepayments often happen when interest rates are
falling. As a result, the Fund may reinvest these early payments at lower
interest rates, thereby reducing the Fund's income. Mortgage- and
asset-backed securities also are subject to extension risk. An unexpected
rise in interest rates could reduce the rate of prepayments and extend the
life of the mortgage- and asset-backed securities, causing the price of the
mortgage- and asset-backed securities and the Fund's share price to fall
and would make the mortgage- and asset-backed securities more sensitive
to interest rate changes. An unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the
mortgages held by a mortgage pool will adversely affect the value of
mortgage-backed securities and will result in losses to the Fund. The Fund
may invest in mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages, which are
loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower
capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages. Privately issued
mortgage-related securities are not subject to the same underwriting
requirements for the underlying mortgages that are applicable to those
mortgage-related securities that have government or
government-sponsored entity guarantees. As a result, the mortgage loans
underlying privately issued mortgage-related securities may, and frequently
do, have less favorable collateral, credit risk or other underwriting
characteristics than government or government-sponsored
mortgage-related securities and have wider variances in a number of terms
including interest rate, term, size, purpose and borrower characteristics. 

Municipal Securities Risk. The risk of a municipal obligation generally
depends on the financial and credit status of the issuer. Constitutional
amendments, legislative enactments, executive orders, administrative
regulations, voter initiatives, and the issuer's regional economic conditions
may affect the municipal security's value, interest payments, repayment of
principal and the Fund's ability to sell the security. Municipal obligations may
be more susceptible to downgrades or defaults during recessions or similar
periods of economic stress. Municipal securities structured as revenue
bonds are generally not backed by the taxing power of the issuing
municipality but rather the revenue from the particular project or entity for
which the bonds were issued. If the Internal Revenue Service determines
that an issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable tax
requirements, interest from the security could be treated as taxable, which
could result in a decline in the security's value. In addition, there could be
changes in applicable tax laws or tax treatments that reduce or eliminate
the current federal income tax exemption on municipal securities or
otherwise adversely affect the current federal or state tax status of
municipal securities. 

TBA Transactions Risk. TBA transactions involve the risk that the
securities received may be less favorable than what was anticipated by the
Fund when entering into the TBA transaction. TBA transactions also involve
the risk that the counterparty will fail to deliver the securities, exposing the
Fund to further losses. Whether or not the Fund takes delivery of the
securities at the termination date of a TBA transaction, the Fund will
nonetheless be exposed to changes in the value of the underlying
investments during the term of the agreement. If the Fund sells short TBA
mortgages that it does not own and the mortgages increase in value, the
Fund may be required to pay a higher price than anticipated to purchase the
deliverable mortgages to settle the short sale and thereby incur a loss. A
short position in TBA mortgages poses more risk than holding the same TBA
mortgages long. It is possible that the market value of the mortgage
securities the Fund holds in long positions will decline at the same time that
the market value of the mortgage securities the Fund has sold short
increases, thereby magnifying any losses. The more the Fund pays to
purchase the mortgage securities sold short, the more it will lose on the
transaction, which adversely affects its share price. The loss on a long
position is limited to what the Fund originally paid for the TBA mortgage,
together with any transaction costs. In short transactions, there is no limit on
how much the price of a security can increase, thus the Fund's exposure is
theoretically unlimited. The Fund normally closes a short sale of TBA
mortgages that it does not own by purchasing mortgage securities on the
open market and delivering them to the broker. The Fund may not always be
able to complete or "close out" the short position by purchasing mortgage
securities at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund incurs a
loss if the Fund is required to buy the deliverable mortgage securities at a
time when they have appreciated in value from the date of the short sale.
The Fund will incur increased transaction costs associated with selling TBA
mortgages short. In addition, taking short positions results in a form of
leverage. As a result, changes in the value of a Fund's investments will have
a larger effect on its share price than if it did not engage in these
transactions. 

U.S. Government Obligations Risk. Obligations of U.S. Government
agencies and authorities receive varying levels of support and may not be
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, which could
affect the Fund's ability to recover should they default. No assurance can be
given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies
and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.
When-Issued, Delayed Delivery and Forward Commitment Risks.
When-issued and delayed delivery transactions are subject to market risk as
the value or yield of a security at delivery may be more or less than the
purchase price or the yield generally available on securities when delivery
occurs. In addition, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk because it relies
on the buyer or seller, as the case may be, to consummate the transaction,
and failure by the counterparty to complete the transaction may result in the
Fund missing the opportunity of obtaining a price or yield considered to be
advantageous. These transactions have a leveraging effect on the Fund
because the Fund commits to purchase securities that it does not have to
pay for until a later date. These investments therefore increase the Fund's
overall investment exposure and, as a result, its volatility. Typically, no
income accrues on securities the Fund has committed to purchase prior to
the time delivery of the securities is made, although the Fund may earn
income on securities it has set aside to cover these positions. 

Zero Coupon or Pay-In-Kind Securities Risk. Zero coupon and
pay-in-kind securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in value and less
liquidity in the event of adverse market conditions than comparably rated
securities paying cash interest at regular interest payment periods. Prices
on non-cash-paying instruments may be more sensitive to changes in the
issuer's financial condition, fluctuation in interest rates and market
demand/supply imbalances than cash-paying securities with similar credit
ratings, and thus may be more speculative. Investors may purchase zero
coupon and pay-in-kind securities at a price below the amount payable at
maturity. Because such securities do not entitle the holder to any periodic
payments of interest prior to maturity, this prevents any reinvestment of
interest payments at prevailing interest rates if prevailing interest rates rise.
The higher yields and interest rates on pay-in-kind securities reflect the
payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments
and that such investments may represent a higher credit risk than coupon
loans. Pay-in-kind securities may have a potential variability in valuations
because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the
collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated
collateral. Special tax considerations are associated with investing in certain
lower-grade securities, such as zero coupon or pay-in-kind securities.

			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks total return, comprised of current income and capital appreciation by investing at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in senior secured floating rate loans made by banks and other financial institutions and in senior secured floating rate debt instruments.

			
			
				
			
		



Helping enhance income
Today's fixed income investors are facing new and unique challenges as traditional fixed income investments are providing historically low income and are increasingly vulnerable to the threat of rising interest rates. The characteristics of the Invesco Floating Rate Fund, such as attractive current income and  short duration, provide the potential to defend against rising rates and inflation and overall fixed income diversification within a portfolio.

Potentially higher yields in a rising rate environment
The floating rates and diversification potential of senior secured loans may help you enhance income during times when traditional bonds may come under pressure. The floating rate coupons may provide a potential hedge against inflation and rising interest rates.
Since inception, Floating Rate Fund has historically provided positive returns during the majority of rising rate periods



Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Click the performance tab for the most recent month end performance. Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV). Performance shown at NAV does not include maximum applicable front-end sales charge (2.50%). If sales charges had been reflected, performance would be lower. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. Fund performance reflects any applicable fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the adviser not waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses in the past, returns would have been lower.
 Source: Bloomberg L.P. as of June 30, 2017. Fund inception May 1, 1997. Bonds represented by the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index; US Government Credit represented by the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Government Credit Index. Fund performance shown is Class A shares at NAV. If sales charge had been included, performance would be lower. The fund may have experienced periods of underperformance during periods of declining rates. Performance during all periods is cumulative. Past performance cannot guarantee future results. An investment cannot be made directly in an index. Rising rates are defined as any period where interest rates, as represented by the 10-year Treasury rate, increased at least 1%, or 100 basis points. A basis point (bps) is the smallest measure used for quoting yields on bonds and notes. One basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point, or 0.01%. 
Index Definitions: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index represents securities that are SEC-registered, taxable, and dollar denominated. The index covers the US investment grade fixed rate bond market, with index components for government and corporate securities, mortgage pass-through securities, and asset-backed securities. Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Government Credit Index is a component of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and includes treasuries, agencies, publicly issued US corporate and foreign debentures and secured notes. 
Duration is the measure of a debt security's price sensitivity to interest rate changes, expressed in terms of years. Securities with longer durations usually are more sensitive to interest rate movements than those with shorter durations. Should interest rates change, the value of a fund that invests in securities with longer durations will fluctuate more than the value of a fund that invests in securities with shorter durations. 





Potentially low correlation
Incorporating senior loan funds in a portfolio may complement other traditional fixed income holdings and serve as a portfolio diversifier, which may help mitigate overall volatility.

Senior and secured, helping mitigate principal erosion
Senior secured loans are at the top of the capital structure, enabling its issuers to get paid first in the event of default or bankruptcy. Additionally, senior secured loans generate current income as companies pay their contractual interest on at least a quarterly basis. 
Senior secured loans are a priority of repayment in the event of default
      Senior secured loans rank highest in the capital structure.

Senior secured loans are secured by companies' collateral such as:

There is a risk that the value of the collateral required on investments in senior secured floating rate loans and debt securities may not be sufficient to cover the amount owed, may be found invalid, may be used to pay other outstanding obligations of the borrower or may be difficult to liquidate. 
Current income
Senior secured loans, like traditional bonds, generate current income as companies pay their contractual interest on — at least — a quarterly basis. Senior secured loans potentially  have  the added diversification  benefits of high  income  with short  duration.
Loans continued to offer investors a high level of current income with short duration

 About risk
			 


Bank Loan Risk. There are a number of risks associated with an investment in bank loans including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and prepayment risk. Lack of an active trading market, restrictions on resale, irregular trading activity, wide bid/ask spreads and extended trade settlement periods may impair the Fund's ability to sell bank loans within its desired time frame or at an acceptable price and its ability to accurately value existing and prospective investments. Extended trade settlement periods may result in cash not being immediately available to the Fund. As a result, the Fund may have to sell other investments or engage in borrowing transactions to raise cash to meet its obligations. The risk of holding bank loans is also directly tied to the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the issuing banks. These risks could cause the Fund to lose income or principal on a particular investment, which in turn could affect the Fund's returns. The value of bank loans can be affected by and sensitive to changes in government regulation and to economic downturns in the United States and abroad. Bank loans generally are floating rate loans, which are subject to interest rate risk as the interest paid on the floating rate loans adjusts periodically based on changes in widely accepted reference rates.
Borrowing Risk. Borrowing money to buy securities exposes the Fund to leverage and will cause the Fund's share price to be more volatile because leverage will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the Fund's portfolio securities. Borrowing money may also require the Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so. In addition, the Fund will incur interest expenses and other fees on borrowed money. There can be no assurance that the Fund's borrowing strategy will enhance and not reduce the Fund's returns.
Changing Fixed Income Market Conditions Risk. The current historically low interest rate environment was created in part by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero. There is a risk that interest rates will rise when the FRB and central banks raise these rates. This risk is heightened due to the completion of the FRB's quantitative easing program and the "tapering" of other similar foreign central bank actions. This eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments, particularly those with longer maturities. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets. As a result, the value of the Fund's investments and share price may decline. Changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions, which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the Fund's transaction costs.
Collateralized Loan Obligations Risk. CLOs are subject to the risks of substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers, which will be greater during periods of economic or financial stress. CLOs may also lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate tranches, market anticipation of defaults, and investor aversion to CLO securities as a class. The risks of CLOs will be greater if the Fund invests in CLOs that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the Fund holds subordinate tranches of the CLO that absorbs losses from the defaults before senior tranches. In addition, CLOs are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk.
Credit Linked Notes Risk. Risks of credit linked notes include those risks associated with the underlying reference obligation including but not limited to market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, default risk and, in some cases, foreign currency risk. An investor in a credit linked note bears counterparty risk or the risk that the issuer of the credit linked note will default or become bankrupt and not make timely payment of principal and interest of the structured security. Credit linked notes may be less liquid than other investments and therefore harder to dispose of at the desired time and price. In addition, credit linked notes may be leveraged and, as a result, small changes in the value of the underlying reference obligation may produce disproportionate losses to the Fund.
Debt Securities Risk. The prices of debt securities held by the Fund will be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longer-duration debt securities and higher quality debt securities. Falling interest rates will cause the Fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates. Falling interest rates may also reduce the Fund's distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the Fund will decline. The Fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments and/or to repay principal in a timely manner. Changes in an issuer's financial strength, the market's perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities. The Adviser's credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes, which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event.
Defaulted Securities Risk. Defaulted securities pose a greater risk that principal will not be repaid than non-defaulted securities. Defaulted securities and any securities received in an exchange for such securities may be subject to restrictions on resale.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency, commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the Fund's ability to use certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Financial Services Sector Risk. The Fund may be susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting the financial services sector. Financial services companies are subject to extensive government regulation and are disproportionately affected by unstable interest rates, each of which could adversely affect the profitability of such companies. Financial services companies may also have concentrated portfolios, which makes them especially vulnerable to unstable economic conditions.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
High Yield Debt Securities (Junk Bond) Risk. Investments in high yield debt securities ("junk bonds") and other lower-rated securities will subject the Fund to substantial risk of loss. These securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuer's ability to pay interest and principal when due, are more susceptible to default or decline in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities. Prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile.
Liquidity Risk. The Fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and, as a result, could lose its entire investment in such investments. Liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress. If a significant amount of the Fund's securities become illiquid, the Fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Risk of Subordinated Debt. Perpetual subordinated debt is a type of hybrid instrument that has no maturity date for the return of principal and does not need to be redeemed by the issuer. These investments typically have lower credit ratings and lower priority than other obligations of an issuer during bankruptcy, presenting a greater risk for nonpayment. This risk increases as the priority of the obligation becomes lower. Payments on these securities may be subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of subsidiaries and associated companies of an issuer. Additionally, some perpetual subordinated debt does not restrict the ability of an issuer’s subsidiaries to incur further unsecured indebtedness.
