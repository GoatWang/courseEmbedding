From Our Customers
"Garrett and Hunter were great to work with in purchasing and installing of our Niles Sound System
and our Graber Blinds.  Both of them went out of their way explaining each product as well as the benefits
of the sound system. They were always a phone call away when we had any questions including those
with our newly-purchased smart tv and their patience with us was impressive.  We consider Garrett and
Hunter to be our friends now and would highly recommend them to anyone in need of either of these services.
Thank you so much!"
- Judith Fletschock
"We had the pleasure of working with HomeTech Innovations LLC while we were building our home. Right from the start it was clear, both Hunter and Garrett love what they do and are very knowledgeable in their field. They provided us with wiring and equipment for our TV, Internet, multi-zone home audio sound, as well as a home theater system."
- Kim
"I knew that I wanted to pre-wire our home when we built it to be sure to take advantage of getting all the wiring we “may” need installed before it was finished. Our relationship started there and Hunter guided us through every step in our selections. He helped us pick locations to wire to in each room in order to be sure to have the best location for TV’s and data ports. He provided valuable suggestions and input on setting up our home theater area in our new home, and even helped us pick out the right TV and home theater for us…to fit our budget. Our plan wasn’t the best but HomeTech made it great. After complete in home installation and setup, Hunter took care of us with questions and concerns. I am definitely impressed with their service and knowledge and would recommend them hands down."
- Jeff

Labor and Skills Deficits in Construction: Not just at Jobsite Level
While construction labor shortages are getting a lot of warranted press lately, it’s also very apparent that the industry is suffering from a lack of experienced and skilled staff at the supervisory and project management levels. A lot of talent left construction during the Great Recession, and while the industry is rebounding, the talent pool may not have caught up with the improving economic climate. Find out what a recent Home Innovation focus group with ASHRAE members revealed about this situation.

6 Innovations Making the Smart Home Way Brighter | Time.comTechSearchSearchSign InSenateVulnerable GOP Senators May Pay A Price For Obamacare VotePoliticsObamacare SurvivesCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDWhite HouseJeff Sessions Wants to Mend His Tattered Relationship With President TrumpSmartThings Hub Starter Kit SmartThingsces 20156 of the Coolest Smart Home Innovations at CESJohn Patrick PullenJan 07, 2015This year, the year that Marty McFly crash lands into in Back to the Future Part II, holds a lot of water for technologists, since it gave the world a peek at then-fictional innovations like food hydrators, indoor gardens, and video calling. And while some of those home technologies have actually come to pass (hydrators, you have to Oct. 21 until Marty’s flux capacitor shorts out!) these six inventions—currently exhibiting at the International CES in Las Vegas—are ready to bring the future to your door, right now. For more on the smarter, more connected home of the future, check out Time's cover package.ADT PulseMark Haworth—ADTADT PulseEven though CES is packed with tech titans showing off their latest wares, entrenched services like cable and home security systems are often the target of upstart technologies at the event. This year, ADT strikes back with a setup that connects a wide range of sensors together through an intuitive smart phone app. Powered by IFTTT, a wide-ranging web service that already links everything from the Android operating system to Yahoo Fantasy Football (with other technologies ranging from Dropbox to text messaging to weather alerts in between), the company's Pulse app gives ADT home security subscribers the ability to turn on lights, monitor for carbon monoxide, arm alarms, and even control the heating, with their voice, alone. And with voice passwords, the app itself is locked down as tight as the home's security system.Budgee with angled basketBudgeeBudgeeMove over, Rosie, here comes something better. Alright, maybe this robot, built by Five Elements Robotics, can’t eclipse the Jetson’s legendary robo-maid, but it can serve as an able assistant, carrying up to 50 pounds indoors and out, over sidewalks and up ramps—basically most places you go. Designed to follow a transmitter that the owner (or is it master?) wears, the $1,399 droid can zip along up to 2.4 miles per hour. With a battery life of up to 10 hours, he can run about as long as most people, and when not needed, he can be folded up for easy storage—only weighing about 20 pounds and able to fit into the trunk of a car. When was the last time you stuffed your assistant in the trunk of your car? (Actually, don’t answer that.)Discovery™ iQ 30” Wall OvenDacorDacor Discovery IQWhat’s better than one wall oven? If you said a wall oven with the Android operating system baked into it, you’re right. (But "two wall ovens” would also also be acceptable.) Sporting solo and dual doors, Dacor’s Discovery convection ovens are Wi-Fi connected and have a graphic user interface to get your brownies baking like no other. With a Samsung one gigahertz processor and 512 megabytes of RAM, this setup isn’t just tech for tech’s sake. It’s designed to power the Discovery IQ cooking app, which guides users through all sorts of dishes and family recipes. And with the ability to download from Google Play store, there’s many more apps—and appetizers, I hope—to come.TribyInvoxiaInvoxia TribyFinally, some gear the whole family can enjoy. A kitchen communication appliance, Triby is first and foremost a Bluetooth speaker, able to take calls and stream music from your smart phone. But the magnetic-backed, rubber-edged device takes utility a step further by linking two a pair of phones (Mom's and Dad’s, perhaps) via the Triby app, so people can call them at the push of a button. The app also lets mobile users send hand written notes back to Triby, displaying them on the Wi-Fi connected device’s e-Ink display. And in addition to being able to play FM radio signals, the fridge phone also has a pair of “radio” buttons that lets users pre-program their favorite streaming radio stations. Toss in a battery that lasts a month and a $199 price tag, and you’ve got some smart tech, indeed.WelcomeNetamoNetatmo WelcomeSome people are put off by web security cameras in the home, but with a facial recognition feature that can identify the members of your household, Netatmo Welcome does something truly helpful. Notifying smartphone users when family members arrive home, this HD, night vision-capable camera is a must-have for connected latch key kids. And, paired with Netatmo Tags, the system can alert you when doors, windows, mailboxes or even drawers are opened. But perhaps the smartest thing about this camera is that it can store data on an onboard SD card, keeping your video recordings off the internet (and free from subscription services).SmartThings DevicesSmartThingsSamsung SmartThingsNamed as one of Time's Best Gadgets of 2014, SmartThings is not content to rest on its laurels, rolling out new hardware and premium services that may make it the most clever smart home setup, yet. Available in the summer, a new SmartThings hub will sport a better processor and backup battery power, making this a connected home system that stays in sync even when the power is out. In addition, the company's motion and multi-sensors are slimming down, providing more subtle home monitoring. But the smart home is all about being inter compatible with other products and services, something this system does better than anyone. For instance, the SmartThings hub will now play nice with everything from August locks to Racchio’s lawn irrigation controller.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

The patent and licensing process is designed to create opportunities for both established companies and new enterprises. Allowing other companies to benefit from Ericsson’s innovations, lowers the barriers to entry and enables new players to enter the marketplace.

We are part of a thriving ecosystem of innovators that provides others with access to our technology. Our objective is to allow the world to benefit from our cutting-edge innovations, constantly pushing the curve of what the industry can do.


Getting a fair return on our R&D investment when another company uses our standardized technology means we can keep investing in research and bring out new ideas, new standards, and new platforms for the benefit of all. That is why Ericsson strongly believes in fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) licensing terms, which support ‘deep standardization’ and allow for scalable manufacturing, thereby lower prices for consumers.

Why the telecoms industry is different        
In contrast to some industries where patents are primarily used to exclude other companies from a market, patents play an active role in developing the telecommunications industry through standardization and licensing. Members of standardization bodies, such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), voluntarily commit to license any essential patents they hold on FRAND licensing terms.

                Read our paper on FRAND and standards
            








What is FRAND licensing?








Ericsson supports licensing on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms, known as FRAND, ensuring a healthy ecosystem for the future. FRAND licensing has an established history of global market success because innovative companies that are compensated through patent royalties are then able to re-invest in the next generation of technology, unlocking the latest digital experiences for us all to enjoy. 















Fair access        
Anyone can access our technologies at a fair and reasonable rate, and this is at the heart of how Ericsson licenses its patents. Here we take a closer look at FRAND licensing.










Collaborate, share, inform        
When companies come together in mutual trust to exchange ideas, FRAND licensing is key to making this happen.

What is 5G and who gets to decide? In the video below, Dr. Stefan Parkvall, Principal Researcher at Ericsson and one of our many visionary people, discusses the value of this next generation of technology and the leading industry experts defining it, and our future.


 















Creating 5G is a very innovative process and Ericsson invests a lot, both time and money-wise, to develop the best possible standard.”
Stefan Parkvall, Principal Researcher at Ericsson

















Accelerating the Internet of Things        
One of the many benefits brought by the adoption of our 5G technology will be the acceleration of the Internet of Things (IoT), which will make the possibility of physical objects communicating and interacting with each other in real time a reality. Licensing of 5G patents coupled with the development of IoT standards will help connect billions of devices but this is only possible when companies come together and exchange ideas.
