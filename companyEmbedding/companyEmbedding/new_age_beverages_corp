New Age Beverages Acquires Premier Micronutrient Corporation

        More 












New Age Beverages is continuing upon its aggressive expansion strategy and today announced that it has acquired Premier Micronutrient Corporation (PMC), a maker of nutrient-dense supplements.

In picking up PMC, founded in 2000 to develop formulations in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), New Age secured intellectual property — including 10 major patents and patents pending in various areas of micronutrient-based treatments — that it plans to use to fuel product innovation in both the short and long term. The no-cash agreement brings 100 percent of the assets and interests of PMC, its portfolio of products, intellectual property, and the formulas for existing and planned healthy functional beverage products for the pharmacy, medical, sports and military, and other industries.
The move marks the third acquisition for New Age this year, following the purchase of Maverick Brands, makers of Coco Libre, and the full assets of Marley Beverage Company in April.
Speaking with BevNET, New Age CEO Brent Willis said that the PMC acquisition was another step forward in the company’s goal to be the global leader in healthy functional beverages, and that the research and scientific expertise gained in the deal will allow New Age to continue exploring new sales opportunities, including those within the medical industry, with less competitive intensity.
“Today, the products that address things like cardiovascular health or weight management have a delivery system of pills and powders,” he said. “That’s the evolution: it goes from pills to powders to a ready-to-drink, more consumer friendly and more efficacious delivery system.”
In addition to patents for micronutrient formulations for diabetes treatment, radiation, and other applications, PMC brings medical expertise, research, clinical trial insight and a strong reputation within the scientific community into the fold at New Age’s Health Sciences Division.
PediaAde, an organic coconut water-based rehydration drink, will be the first product to be released with input from the division when it debuts later this summer. Willis said the beverage, formulated to alleviate symptoms associated with significant dehydration, is indicative of the company’s strategy of identifying existing consumer behaviors and segments and designing new products around them.
“When you have the credibility and the science, and you start in the medical channel and pharmacy channel, ultimately when you want to take it out to broad based consumers it’s just that much more supported in terms of the benefits,” said Willis. “We want to be building off of existing large need states and segments versus coming up with crazy healthy niches.”
Willis pointed toward a soon-to-be-released new product, developed by the Health Sciences division in conjunction with scientists at the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic, aimed at reducing post-surgery stress and recovery time.
“The public is demanding that credible information done with legitimate studies, which we have, and that drives a hunger for products that are not a pill that a doctor prescribes from a pharmacy,” said Dr. Jerry Haase, chief scientific officer for the Health Sciences Division. “The number of interesting products that fill a definite need in the marketplace that we are developing and will develop is quite an impressive list.”
Reaffirming the company’s goal to push differentiated products in segments relatively unexplored by its competitors, Willis said the PMC acquisition was indicative of his overall vision for New Age’s place on the industry landscape.
“We have about an $85 million run rate with revenue,” he said. “We can’t afford to waste time and do little niche kind of things.”

Quote:We don't have an hemp-infused product.   Marley's Hemp-Infused Tea?  Can't think of a better match for Marley than any hemp-infused beverage.  I think as long as it is "hemp infused" and not CBD-based, the shipping across state lines isn't a problem.     Not sure how big of a market this is.  Rocky Mountain High Brands purports they are going to hit this market hard.  They have a couple former execs from $CELH on their team now so maybe they can pull something off.  Maybe.  But the fact that these industry vets think there is a market is telling.     Given the Marley cache, it's easy to see how $nBEV could dominate it, regardless of size.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

LLC or Incorporation?

Click here to see our comparison chart




The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
