William W. Hoke








William "Will" Hoke was raised on a ranch in a small country town in Texas and was taught to work hard by his father, who made his living as a pipeline welder; and his mother, who stayed home to raise him.  Mr. Hoke comes from a long family line of offshore oil rig workers and offshore pipeline welders, and his dad is a longstanding member of the Local 798 Pipeliners Union.  To assist with college, Mr. Hoke also worked in the oilfield - building, repairing and servicing oilfield equipment both inland and offshore.  Mr. Hoke has drawn upon his actual oilfield work experience in successfully handling dangerous workplace lawsuits against British Petroleum (BP) and other corporate giants.  
                    

                        Mr. Hoke earned his BBA in Business Management from Texas A&M University in 2000.  Mr. Hoke earned his Doctorate of Jurisprudence from South Texas College of Law in 2004.  While at South Texas, Mr. Hoke actively participated in Varsity Mock Trial and Moot Court and served as an Officer on the Board of Advocates from 2002 – 2004. 
                    

                        Upon graduating from law school, Mr. Hoke worked as an associate attorney for a prominent Houston personal injury law firm, and after only couple of years in practice, became the head of the litigation group at a longtime personal injury firm; primarily focusing on offshore accidents, trucking accidents, workplace accidents, refinery explosions, defective products, burn injuries and brain injuries.  
                    

                        In 2016, Mr. Hoke saw the need to treat clients as names instead of numbers.  He opened the doors of William Hoke & Associates, LLLP (“WHA”) to better serve seriously injured clients and victims of lost loved ones and treat them with compassion, attention and the respect they deserve.
                    

                        His Bar Admissions include: Texas (2004), U.S. District Court Northern District of Texas and the U.S. District Court Southern District of Texas.  
                    

                        In 2010, Mr. Hoke was selected to Texas SuperLawyers Rising Stars for 2011 as published in Texas Monthly Magazine and again selected to Texas SuperLawyers Rising Stars in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  SuperLawyers is a rating service of exceptional lawyers who have attained a high degree of peer recognition and professional achievement.  The selection process is multi-phased and includes independent research, peer nominations and peer evaluations.  Only 2% of all Texas attorneys are selected as SuperLawyers Rising Stars and Mr. Hoke is one of them.  
                    

                        In April 2010, H Texas Magazine named Mr. Hoke as one of Houston's Top Lawyers and again selected him in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. 
                    

                        In 2012, Mr. Hoke was part of the trial team who filed a wrongful death lawsuit arising from the June 2, 2012 Channelview, Texas explosion for the family of a welder (and injured co-workers) killed at the Oiltanking Houston oil storage terminal.  After 17 months of litigation, 5 1/2 weeks of trial and 3 days of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of $20.2 million in favor of the clients.  It was the top verdict in Harris County, Texas for 2013 and a top 100 verdict nationwide for 2013.  
                    

                        In 2017, Mr. Hoke was honored to receive the award for Top Ten Personal Injury Attorney by the National Academy of Personal Injury Attorneys and the award for Best Attorneys of America by Rue Ratings
                    

                        Additionally, in 2017, William Hoke & Associates, LLLP was honored to be awarded Best Law Firms of America.
                    

                        There are over 70,000 attorneys licensed to practice in Texas.  Only 7,000 have earned the right to be publicly recognized as Board Certified specialists in 1 of 21 select areas of law.  
                    

                        In the area of Personal Injury Trial Law, a lawyer must have significant experience and a variety of references for his or her handling of claims based on an individual’s injury by the negligence of another. Currently, only 1,606 of the 70,000 lawyers in Texas are Board Certified in Personal Injury Trial Law, and Mr. Hoke is one of them.

We called Manny’s office and were greeted by a very friendly and professional staff.  We met with Manny in his office that same week to discuss transferring our policies, and adjusting our level of homeowners coverage due to a recent major renovation of our home.  Manny was very attentive and had several good ideas as to how we could better calibrate our coverages and save some money. Especially helpful was his suggestion to have our remodeling contractor sign a certification statement confirming that our plumbing, electrical and heating & cooling systems had been updated.  This suggestion alone resulted in a significant decrease in our annual homeowners premium!Any time we have a question about any of our eight State Farm policies (homeowners, 2-life, umbrella, 2-auto, personal articles, and long term disability), all we have to do is pick up the phone or email Manny…he is very accessible, extremely knowledgeable, and always quick to respond.  We highly recommend Manny and his team!Manny Molinar - State Farm Insurance Agentdsjackson ratedThrough acquaintance, we met M...Through acquaintance, we met Manny prior to him becoming an agent. Because of his excellent marketing and networking abilities, came to know of him becoming a State Farm Insurance Agent. Manny Molinar’s State Farm agency in Houston, Texas (we are in Dallas, TX) whether through Manny himself, or one of his staff: (forgive me if I leave anyone out) Alicia, Alejandra, Jennifer, Jorge, or the excellent State Farm after hours support, reassures we can trust Manny and our insurance needs through State Farm. Manny is the consummate professional, and after being with State Farm for years now, I know that he and his team, will take care for our insurance, and financial needs in a timely, professional, and highly admired level of communication or Customer Care. I strongly recommend Manny Molinar, and his State Farm agency, regardless of where you are located in Houston, another city in Texas, or out of state. Consider this as my endorsement for Manny, and his continued success!Mike Harris - State Farm Insurance Agentanthonymcgrew ratedGreat LadyI was looking around for my first auto insurance when I was around 19 years old. When I walked into her facility I was greated immediately and respectfully. She sat down with me and I was nervous at the beginning but Renata explained everything beautifully and thoroughly. Made suggestions on what things I should have, what things are included in my coverage, and the different kinds of discounts I can receive from State Farm. There was a team member working for her that denied me a discount because she thought I was giving her a form that was not correct, but then Renata looked over it again and recorrected it. I am impressed as this was my first insurance I applied for and I am utterly impressed.

As much as she is very professional, she is also patient and understanding to the individual needs of us old folks who may not be so computer competent. I thought that eliminating PIP and Uninsured/Underinsured protection would save me money. I have since added these elements to my policy, thanks to excellent advise from Danielle. I now enjoy the peace of mind of having full coverage on my property. I recommend this agency to anyone who wants capable professionals handling their business.Farmers Insurancebecca.zakos ratedThis was an excellent experien...This was an excellent experience! Dave is one of the nicest insurance agents I have spoken with. I just bought a new car and got insurance from State Farm, but it was getting expensive. So I was just trying to get some quotes to see if I could find cheaper insurance anywhere. Dave made me feel welcome as soon as I got into his office. He is always smiling and really enjoys what he does. My visit was short and sweet. He knew what I was there for, and that's exactly what he did. He took the time to explain to me exactly how insurance works; I now know exactly what i'm paying for. I would definitely recommend Dave to everyone!Manny Molinar - State Farm Insurance Agentmelissadblake ratedI have been with State Farm and Manny Molinar for almost 10 years. They have the best customer service team! They don't just call me to promote their business, they actually call just to see how I am doing. It's not just the staff, Manny has personally called me several times just to see if I needed anything. Whatever I need, they take care of it immediately..no matter how big or small the problem. There are several agencies that are closer to my home but I really do love the care and attention Manny and his team give so it's worth every mile! #totally satisfiedFarmers InsuranceJasmine M. ratedOur water heaters needed to be replaced as they were very old. His price was fair and competitive and he was able to do the job by Tuesday. He came right on time Tuesday morning and made sure we were happy with the quality of his work. Top notch may I add. My previous plumber did a crappy job replacing the circulation pump and Jessie went the extra mile by returning back to my house to fix some leakage issues with the circulation pump. Jessie is the only plumber we will use now.Did You Know?Insurance BasicsTo mitigate the risk of loss, people purchase insurance policies from a company. When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.
