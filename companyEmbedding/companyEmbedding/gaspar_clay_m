This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

About/Employee Features/Clay Gaspar


Share this page






Clay GasparAs an engineer and a manager in a variety of roles, Clay Gaspar’s experience in energy has taken him out into the field, across the country, onshore and offshore, and around the world. He says he works best by rolling up his sleeves and bringing people together.
Overseeing the company’s operations in our three core basins is a natural fit for Clay as he begins his new role as WPX’s senior vice president and chief operating officer.
From operations to working in investor relations, Clay has gained both broad and specific perspectives of the industry.
“I’ve worked in many operations roles and really enjoyed field work,” says Clay, a Louisiana native and longtime Houston resident, who graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in petroleum engineering and from the University of Texas with a master’s degree in petroleum and geosciences engineering.
Clay started his career at Mewbourne Oil as a production drilling engineer before taking on numerous roles at Anadarko, including general manager for investor relations, business advisor for Worldwide Operations and general manager over East Texas Operations.
He also served in technical and managerial roles there covering projects in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Alaska, the Rockies and offshore Gulf of Mexico. 
Those roles gave Clay a bird’s eye view of the entire enterprise – experience that he looks forward to sharing at WPX.
“We are at a critical inflection point for the organization,” he says. “Many of our peer companies don’t have enough self-awareness to see opportunities for improvement, so they miss these game-changing events.  
“We have identified a strategy that will drive value and we have some great people who want to take it to the next level.”
After Anadarko, Clay became vice president of the Mid-Continent region for Newfield Exploration, based in Tulsa. He moved to Oklahoma about two and a half years ago.
When WPX’s CEO and President Rick Muncrief met with Clay about coming to WPX in a senior management role, Clay was eager to take on a new challenge.
“I knew of Rick and had heard great things about him, and I knew WPX was in a state of transition,” Clay says. “By focusing on our three core areas of operations – the San Juan, Williston and Piceance basins – it will allow us to focus and become best-in-class in those areas.”
Clay sees a lot of promise in our San Juan Gallup oil operations, and he’s encouraged by how WPX has maintained the Piceance as a highly efficient, productive and low-cost asset.
“And the Williston is one of the industry’s most prolific basins. I am excited about our strong footprint in the area,” he says.
As Clay starts his role at WPX, he wants to understand how we can share best practices between operations areas with the goal of becoming as efficient and cost-effective as possible.
“I realize that I need to establish credibility early on with the teams. I pride myself on being a good listener and want to hear ideas from others. I am especially interested in ideas that we haven’t tried or in evolving technology that we need to reevaluate,” he says.
“And I’m a big believer in looking across the fence – we’re not the only ones trying to solve problems in these basins. I’m confident we can learn something from each of our neighbors.”
Challenging the team and the company to be more efficient is certainly one of his goals, but Clay also knows it’s his job to help clear hurdles.
“The job of senior management is to set a course, clear the path and allow employees to add the most value to WPX” Clay says.
“For every project we launch, we need to start with a conversation about how we will add value to the company. This includes everything from a field project to an accounting or marketing project.”
Being transparent is also important to Clay.
“Communities are affected by our operations, and it’s incumbent upon us to work together,” he says. “Over the years, I’ve seen things done the right way, and I’ve seen decisions that hurt companies in the long run.
 “For every project, you want to not only add value, but also to leave things better than you found them.”  
“The job of senior management is to set a course, clear the path and allow employees to add the most value to WPX.”

 Memberships



Member

                  Current                


Society of Petroleum Engineers, Inc.

                  In 1957, the organization was officially founded as SPE, a constituent society of AIME. SPE became a separately incorporated organization in 1985.

Our history begins within the American Institute of Mining Engineers (AIME). AIME was founded in 1871 in Pennsylvania, USA, to advance the production of metals, minerals, and energy resources through the application of engineering. In 1913, a standing committee on oil and gas was created within AIME and proved to be the genesis of SPE. The Oil and Gas Committee of AIME soon evolved into the Petroleum Division of AIME as membership grew and as interest among the members was more clearly delineated among the mining, metallurgical, and petroleum specializations.
