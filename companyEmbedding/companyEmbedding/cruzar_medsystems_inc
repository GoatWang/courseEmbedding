Saphena Medical commercialized its Venapax® next generation endoscopic vessel harvesting device in eighteen months which is poised to capture significant market share and dramatically enhance its value, and is marketing its third-generation device across the United States. Cruzar Medsystems recently received FDA clearance of its novel Houdini® chronic vascular occlusion device and will launch commercially next month. Finally, Kaleidoscope Medical’s novel reversible inferior vena cava filter is at the FDA.PAVmed's principals have now created PAVmed as a long-term vehicle, armed with permanent capital, to expand the impact of their model to a broader and deeper pipeline and accelerate value creation in the process.

Cruzar Medsystems-Introducing the Houdini Catheter guidewire advancement






Cruzar Medsystems-Introducing the Houdini Catheter guidewire advancement


































































 








Cruzar Medsystems





















Introducing the Houdini® Catheter,
Streamlining guidewire advancement for a more predictable process





 




 














 




A remarkable advance for efficiency
Placement of the guidewire through vascular occlusions has always been a testament to your skill, not the tools you have available. It can be an unpredictable hurdle to getting down to real business. Until the wire is placed, time stands still in the room. Now, Cruzar Medsystems has developed a means of making guidewire placement more routine and efficient so that the procedure can continue.





The Houdini Catheter is a dual-lumen intravascular catheter intended for percutaneous use in the iliac, femoral, ilio-femoral and popliteal arteries. It faciltates guidewire advancement through challenging environments in a reliable, efficient manner using a balloon-actuated distal anchoring system coupled with a unique everting lumen with TrueForwardTM technology. This proprietary technology can give the operator a greater mechanical advantage at the tip of the guidewire even in the most discrete regions of the vasculature. The result? Now the tool at your disposal can be more in line with your skill.






Accommodates a standard commercially available 0.014” – 0.035” guidewire to access discrete regions of the peripheral vasculature


TrueForward™ technology grips the tip of the guidewire, creating pressure that simulates “thumb and forefinger” control


Distal tip incorporates a radiopaque marker for visualization under fluoroscopy


Once accessed, guidewires may be exchanged within the catheter


Everting distal lumen may reduce shear force when compared to standard catheters









 












 





A reliable and predictable
way to set the wire and
move onto the procedure

The go-to device to access the region, set the guidewire and move on to the procedure in a reliable, efficient manner








The curvature of arteries combined with the distance from the entrance site to the target area greatly reduces the tip force of an unsupported guidewire.
 
Houdini’s balloon-actuated distal anchoring system and the unique everting lumen with TrueForwardTM technology may give the operator a greater mechanical advantage at the tip of the guidewire even in the most discreet regions of the vasculature.



The Houdini Catheter is located proximal to the targeted area. A radiopaque marker at the tip provides visualization under fluoroscopy. The balloon catheter is inflated to 6atm with radiopaque contrast media using a standard manual indeflator to anchor the catheter against the inner arterial wall. Once anchored, internal pressurization is then transferred to the everting inner lumen.








The operator advances the guidewire by applying pressure to the plunger, which connects to the base of the everting distal lumen. This engages the TrueForwardTM system and transfers the pressure applied by the operator to the distal lumen—not the vessel—enabling it to grip and stabilize the guidewire at the very tip.



The TrueForwardTM System advances the guidewire with the unique rolling action of the everting distal lumen that delivers support to the guidewire. This gripping action advances the guidewire forward with a focused tip force that simulates the action of holding the wire with your thumb and forefinger.
