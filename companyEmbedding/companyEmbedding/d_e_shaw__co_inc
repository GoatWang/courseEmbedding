A global investment and technology development firm
The D. E. Shaw group is a global investment and technology development firm with more than $42
    billion in investment capital as of April 1, 2017, and offices in North America, Europe, and Asia. Since our
    founding in 1988, our firm has earned an international reputation for successful investing based on innovation,
    careful risk management, and the quality and depth of our staff. We have a significant presence in the world's
    capital markets, investing in a wide range of companies and financial instruments in both developed and developing
    economies.
Our culture rewards analytical rigor and adherence to the highest possible ethical and legal standards,
    and we've cultivated a collegial work environment that promotes collaboration across disciplines, geographies, and
    investment strategies. Our firm has been built in part by attempting to do what other companies might consider
    impossible, or never imagine at all. A single transformative idea that ultimately works—for a new business, a
    new trading model, or an improved back office process—is worth a dozen ideas that lead nowhere. We've learned
    that when an extraordinary team sets extraordinarily ambitious goals, astonishing breakthroughs can be expected.

Our firm has made a conscious effort to build a carefully selected team of uniquely talented
    individuals, each among the very best in his or her profession. Our colleagues come from varying disciplines but

Besides being keenly engaged in our work, we have diverse interests and backgrounds, many of which are far removed

        and Physics Olympiad medalists.
    
Over 60 of our investment professionals hold Ph.D.'s.
Approximately 20 percent of our staff are published authors, whose work ranges from papers in specialized
        academic journals to award-winning mystery novels.
    
Our staff members pursue wide-ranging personal interests as entrepreneurs, patent holders, competitive sailors
        and marathoners, professional opera singers, board members of nonprofit organizations, and champion bridge
        players.

A STIMULATING AND COLLEGIAL ENVIRONMENT 

The D. E. Shaw group offers opportunities for individuals of all backgrounds who display
    evidence of outstanding ability and have a track record of exceptional accomplishment. As a globally prominent
    alternative investment manager, our firm offers world-class technology infrastructure and research capabilities, but
    we are still small and nimble enough to remain deeply entrepreneurial, always looking for new hires who bring fresh
    perspectives.
Our firm prizes intellectual curiosity and integrity, creative idea generation, and the relentless pursuit of
    results. We recognize that different things help people thrive: some are more productive working in t-shirts or
    listening to music, while others need time away from the office to recharge after a challenging project. We offer
    great benefits and perks, from game rooms, plentiful snacks, and a gym to back-up childcare and creative social
    events. Our primary focus is to sustain a stimulating, supportive, and fun work environment where our employees can
    do their best work.


    Because we prioritize continual learning, we offer mentoring programs and onsite courses, as well as online
    resources to aid in professional development. We bring in external speakers from academia and industry on a range of
    topics, from highly technical to broadly educational. We aim to give all of our staff the opportunity to enjoy
    challenging work, friendly colleagues, and benefits that focus on personal growth and wellness.

GLOBAL INVESTING ACROSS MULTIPLE ASSET CLASSES AND DISCIPLINES
The D. E. Shaw group pursues attractive and sustainable risk-adjusted returns on the capital
    we invest for our clients. The firm invests globally using a broad array of strategies in both public and private
    markets. Widely recognized as a pioneer in quantitative investing, particularly in equities, futures, and options,
    the firm also has formidable expertise in areas that involve fundamental analysis or portfolio manager discretion,
    such as credit, energy, and macro investing. Regardless of the particular strategy, each investment decision is made
    in the context of a rigorous analytical approach that seeks to carefully identify and weigh potential risks and
    rewards.
The firm's investment activities fall into two broad areas:
Alternative Investments
Strategies focused on the delivery of absolute returns, with low targeted correlation to traditional assets like
    equities, account for around $26 billion of the firm's investment capital. Our alternative investment
    program dates to 1989 and consists of both larger, core multi-strategy investment vehicles and more focused,
    strategy-specific investment products.
Benchmark-Relative and Global Asset Class Investments
Long-biased strategies focusing on major, liquid asset classes represent approximately $15 billion of the
    firm's investment capital. Launched in 2000, a suite of long-only and "130/30" benchmark-relative equity investment
    strategies deploy a systematic investment process that enables institutional investors to customize their exposure
    to a particular index. A discretionary strategy launched in 2013 seeks dynamic exposures to multiple global asset
    classes, enhanced by select alpha opportunities.

History[edit]
The firm was founded by David E. Shaw, a former Columbia University faculty member, and has more than 1,300 employees.[3] David Shaw directed the company from 1988 to 2001. In 2002, David Shaw removed himself from day to day involvement in the firm, and transitioned leadership to a team of six managing directors: Anne Dinning, Julius Gaudio, Louis Salkind, Stuart Steckler, Max Stone and Eric Wepsic.[4] The firm's management structure of the same six-member executive committee remained intact through 2010.[3][5]
In 1997, the firm returned capital to most of its early investors in favor of a structured credit facility of nearly $2 billion from Bank of America, with terms that allowed D.E. Shaw & Co. to keep a higher fraction of profits than hedge fund investors normally allow.[6] After the Russian debt default in 1998, the company suffered losses in its fixed-income trading.[7]
In December 2003, a subsidiary of one of the company's funds acquired the toy store FAO Schwarz, which reopened for business in New York and Las Vegas in the fall of 2004. In the same year, D. E. Shaw affiliate, Laminar Portfolios, acquired the online assets of KB Toys, which continued operating as eToys.com.[8] In August 2004, D. E. Shaw & Co., along with MIC Capital, proposed to inject $50M into the bankrupt WCI Steel. In December 2004, D.E. Shaw & Co. bought 6.6% of USG Corp, a wallboard manufacturer seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of rising asbestos liabilities.[9]
In 2006, Lawrence Summers became managing director at D.E. Shaw & Co. and left in 2008, receiving $5.2 million in compensation for that period.[10] In late 2009 during the Financial Crisis it was reported that D.E. Shaw & Co. had set up a Portfolio Acquisitions Unit, the aim of which was to acquire illiquid assets from rival hedge funds.[11]
D.E. Shaw entered the Indian market in 2006,[12] with Anil Chawla, then the CEO of GE-Commercial finance, India & South East Asia, as the Country Manager. The India operations are headquartered in Hyderabad, Telangana. Under Anil Chawla as the CEO for India, D.E. Shaw entered into several large private equity deals in the country. This included the setting up of a joint-venture company with India's largest private sector company Reliance Industries [13] to provide financial services; real estate company DLF Assets Limited; publishing group Amar Ujala Publications; animation company, Crest Communications and renewable energy company, Soham Energy. After stepping down as CEO of D.E.Shaw in 2012, Anil Chawla continued as an advisor to the company until 2014.
In 2007, David Shaw sold a 20% minority stake to Lehman Brothers, as part of a broader strategy to diversify his personal holdings.[14] At the time of its bankruptcy in September 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. had holdings in D.E. Shaw & Co.[15]
Investment strategy[edit]
The company manages a variety of investment funds[16] that make extensive use of quantitative methods and proprietary computational technology to support fundamental research in the management of its investments.[3][17][18] The Company also uses qualitative analysis to make private equity investments in technology, wind power, real estate, and financial services firms and in distressed company financing.[4] In addition to its financial businesses, D. E. Shaw & Co. has provided private equity capital to technology-related business ventures, including Juno Online Services, an Internet access provider, and Farsight, an online financial services platform that was acquired by Merrill Lynch.[19] The company has $40 billion in aggregate capital[20][21] and in 2011 had $15.6 billion in hedge fund assets under management and was ranked as the 21st largest hedge fund by Institutional Investor.[20][22][23]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
D. E. Shaw supports educational programs such as Math-M-Addicts (teachers are D. E. Shaw & Co. employees),[24] American Regions Mathematics League,[25] Worldwide Online Olympiad Training (WOOT), United States of America Mathematics Olympiad and the International Mathematics Olympiad, Mathematical Olympiad Program, the MIT 6.370 Battlecode Competition,[26] and The Center for Excellence in Education.[27]

History[edit]
The firm was founded by David E. Shaw, a former Columbia University faculty member, and has more than 1,300 employees.[3] David Shaw directed the company from 1988 to 2001. In 2002, David Shaw removed himself from day to day involvement in the firm, and transitioned leadership to a team of six managing directors: Anne Dinning, Julius Gaudio, Louis Salkind, Stuart Steckler, Max Stone and Eric Wepsic.[4] The firm's management structure of the same six-member executive committee remained intact through 2010.[3][5]
In 1997, the firm returned capital to most of its early investors in favor of a structured credit facility of nearly $2 billion from Bank of America, with terms that allowed D.E. Shaw & Co. to keep a higher fraction of profits than hedge fund investors normally allow.[6] After the Russian debt default in 1998, the company suffered losses in its fixed-income trading.[7]
In December 2003, a subsidiary of one of the company's funds acquired the toy store FAO Schwarz, which reopened for business in New York and Las Vegas in the fall of 2004. In the same year, D. E. Shaw affiliate, Laminar Portfolios, acquired the online assets of KB Toys, which continued operating as eToys.com.[8] In August 2004, D. E. Shaw & Co., along with MIC Capital, proposed to inject $50M into the bankrupt WCI Steel. In December 2004, D.E. Shaw & Co. bought 6.6% of USG Corp, a wallboard manufacturer seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of rising asbestos liabilities.[9]
In 2006, Lawrence Summers became managing director at D.E. Shaw & Co. and left in 2008, receiving $5.2 million in compensation for that period.[10] In late 2009 during the Financial Crisis it was reported that D.E. Shaw & Co. had set up a Portfolio Acquisitions Unit, the aim of which was to acquire illiquid assets from rival hedge funds.[11]
D.E. Shaw entered the Indian market in 2006,[12] with Anil Chawla, then the CEO of GE-Commercial finance, India & South East Asia, as the Country Manager. The India operations are headquartered in Hyderabad, Telangana. Under Anil Chawla as the CEO for India, D.E. Shaw entered into several large private equity deals in the country. This included the setting up of a joint-venture company with India's largest private sector company Reliance Industries [13] to provide financial services; real estate company DLF Assets Limited; publishing group Amar Ujala Publications; animation company, Crest Communications and renewable energy company, Soham Energy. After stepping down as CEO of D.E.Shaw in 2012, Anil Chawla continued as an advisor to the company until 2014.
In 2007, David Shaw sold a 20% minority stake to Lehman Brothers, as part of a broader strategy to diversify his personal holdings.[14] At the time of its bankruptcy in September 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. had holdings in D.E. Shaw & Co.[15]
Investment strategy[edit]
The company manages a variety of investment funds[16] that make extensive use of quantitative methods and proprietary computational technology to support fundamental research in the management of its investments.[3][17][18] The Company also uses qualitative analysis to make private equity investments in technology, wind power, real estate, and financial services firms and in distressed company financing.[4] In addition to its financial businesses, D. E. Shaw & Co. has provided private equity capital to technology-related business ventures, including Juno Online Services, an Internet access provider, and Farsight, an online financial services platform that was acquired by Merrill Lynch.[19] The company has $40 billion in aggregate capital[20][21] and in 2011 had $15.6 billion in hedge fund assets under management and was ranked as the 21st largest hedge fund by Institutional Investor.[20][22][23]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
D. E. Shaw supports educational programs such as Math-M-Addicts (teachers are D. E. Shaw & Co. employees),[24] American Regions Mathematics League,[25] Worldwide Online Olympiad Training (WOOT), United States of America Mathematics Olympiad and the International Mathematics Olympiad, Mathematical Olympiad Program, the MIT 6.370 Battlecode Competition,[26] and The Center for Excellence in Education.[27]

Overview
Investment Approach
Investment Strategies
Infrastructure
Industry Leadership







GLOBAL INVESTING ACROSS MULTIPLE ASSET CLASSES AND DISCIPLINES
The D. E. Shaw group pursues attractive and sustainable risk-adjusted returns on the capital
    we invest for our clients. The firm invests globally using a broad array of strategies in both public and private
    markets. Widely recognized as a pioneer in quantitative investing, particularly in equities, futures, and options,
    the firm also has formidable expertise in areas that involve fundamental analysis or portfolio manager discretion,
    such as credit, energy, and macro investing. Regardless of the particular strategy, each investment decision is made
    in the context of a rigorous analytical approach that seeks to carefully identify and weigh potential risks and
    rewards.
The firm's investment activities fall into two broad areas:
Alternative Investments
Strategies focused on the delivery of absolute returns, with low targeted correlation to traditional assets like
    equities, account for around $26 billion of the firm's investment capital. Our alternative investment
    program dates to 1989 and consists of both larger, core multi-strategy investment vehicles and more focused,
    strategy-specific investment products.
Benchmark-Relative and Global Asset Class Investments
Long-biased strategies focusing on major, liquid asset classes represent approximately $15 billion of the
    firm's investment capital. Launched in 2000, a suite of long-only and "130/30" benchmark-relative equity investment
    strategies deploy a systematic investment process that enables institutional investors to customize their exposure
    to a particular index. A discretionary strategy launched in 2013 seeks dynamic exposures to multiple global asset
    classes, enhanced by select alpha opportunities.

Since our founding in 1988, our firm has earned an international reputation for successful investing based on innovation, careful risk management, and the quality and depth of our staff. We have a significant presence in the world's capital markets, investing in a wide range of companies and financial instruments in both developed and developing economies.

Our culture demands and rewards analytical rigor and adherence to the highest possible ethical and legal standards, and we've cultivated a collegial work environment that promotes collaboration across disciplines, geographies, and investment strategies. Our firm has been built in part by attempting to do what other companies might consider impossible, or never imagine at all. A single transformative idea that ultimately works—for a new business, a new trading model, or an improved back office process—is worth a dozen ideas that lead nowhere. We've learned that when an extraordinary team sets extraordinarily ambitious goals, astonishing breakthroughs can be expected

D. E. Shaw & Co. LP


                  The D. E. Shaw group pursues attractive and sustainable risk-adjusted returns on the capital we invest for our clients. The firm invests globally using a broad array of strategies in both public and private markets. Widely recognized as a pioneer in quantitative investing, particularly in equities, futures, and options, the firm also has formidable expertise in areas that involve fundamental analysis or portfolio manager discretion, such as credit, energy, and macro investing. Regardless of the particular strategy, each investment decision is made in the context of a rigorous analytical approach that seeks to carefully identify and weigh potential risks and rewards.

The firm's investment activities fall into two broad areas:
Alternative Investments

Strategies focused on the delivery of absolute returns, with low targeted correlation to traditional assets like equities, account for around $21 billion of the firm's investment capital. Our alternative investment program dates to 1989 and consists of both larger, core multi-strategy investment vehicles and more focused, strategy-specific investment products.
Benchmark-Relative Investments

A suite of long-only and "130/30" equity investment strategies, in either commingled investment vehicles or separately managed accounts, collectively represent approximately $7 billion of the firm's investment capital. These strategies, begun in the year 2000, enable institutional investors to customize their exposure to a particular benchmark index and to choose a targeted level of risk.

History[edit]
The firm was founded by David E. Shaw, a former Columbia University faculty member, and has more than 1,300 employees.[3] David Shaw directed the company from 1988 to 2001. In 2002, David Shaw removed himself from day to day involvement in the firm, and transitioned leadership to a team of six managing directors: Anne Dinning, Julius Gaudio, Louis Salkind, Stuart Steckler, Max Stone and Eric Wepsic.[4] The firm's management structure of the same six-member executive committee remained intact through 2010.[3][5]
In 1997, the firm returned capital to most of its early investors in favor of a structured credit facility of nearly $2 billion from Bank of America, with terms that allowed D.E. Shaw & Co. to keep a higher fraction of profits than hedge fund investors normally allow.[6] After the Russian debt default in 1998, the company suffered losses in its fixed-income trading.[7]
In December 2003, a subsidiary of one of the company's funds acquired the toy store FAO Schwarz, which reopened for business in New York and Las Vegas in the fall of 2004. In the same year, D. E. Shaw affiliate, Laminar Portfolios, acquired the online assets of KB Toys, which continued operating as eToys.com.[8] In August 2004, D. E. Shaw & Co., along with MIC Capital, proposed to inject $50M into the bankrupt WCI Steel. In December 2004, D.E. Shaw & Co. bought 6.6% of USG Corp, a wallboard manufacturer seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of rising asbestos liabilities.[9]
In 2006, Lawrence Summers became managing director at D.E. Shaw & Co. and left in 2008, receiving $5.2 million in compensation for that period.[10] In late 2009 during the Financial Crisis it was reported that D.E. Shaw & Co. had set up a Portfolio Acquisitions Unit, the aim of which was to acquire illiquid assets from rival hedge funds.[11]
D.E. Shaw entered the Indian market in 2006,[12] with Anil Chawla, then the CEO of GE-Commercial finance, India & South East Asia, as the Country Manager. The India operations are headquartered in Hyderabad, Telangana. Under Anil Chawla as the CEO for India, D.E. Shaw entered into several large private equity deals in the country. This included the setting up of a joint-venture company with India's largest private sector company Reliance Industries [13] to provide financial services; real estate company DLF Assets Limited; publishing group Amar Ujala Publications; animation company, Crest Communications and renewable energy company, Soham Energy. After stepping down as CEO of D.E.Shaw in 2012, Anil Chawla continued as an advisor to the company until 2014.
In 2007, David Shaw sold a 20% minority stake to Lehman Brothers, as part of a broader strategy to diversify his personal holdings.[14] At the time of its bankruptcy in September 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. had holdings in D.E. Shaw & Co.[15]
Investment strategy[edit]
The company manages a variety of investment funds[16] that make extensive use of quantitative methods and proprietary computational technology to support fundamental research in the management of its investments.[3][17][18] The Company also uses qualitative analysis to make private equity investments in technology, wind power, real estate, and financial services firms and in distressed company financing.[4] In addition to its financial businesses, D. E. Shaw & Co. has provided private equity capital to technology-related business ventures, including Juno Online Services, an Internet access provider, and Farsight, an online financial services platform that was acquired by Merrill Lynch.[19] The company has $40 billion in aggregate capital[20][21] and in 2011 had $15.6 billion in hedge fund assets under management and was ranked as the 21st largest hedge fund by Institutional Investor.[20][22][23]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
D. E. Shaw supports educational programs such as Math-M-Addicts (teachers are D. E. Shaw & Co. employees),[24] American Regions Mathematics League,[25] Worldwide Online Olympiad Training (WOOT), United States of America Mathematics Olympiad and the International Mathematics Olympiad, Mathematical Olympiad Program, the MIT 6.370 Battlecode Competition,[26] and The Center for Excellence in Education.[27]

History[edit]
The firm was founded by David E. Shaw, a former Columbia University faculty member, and has more than 1,300 employees.[3] David Shaw directed the company from 1988 to 2001. In 2002, David Shaw removed himself from day to day involvement in the firm, and transitioned leadership to a team of six managing directors: Anne Dinning, Julius Gaudio, Louis Salkind, Stuart Steckler, Max Stone and Eric Wepsic.[4] The firm's management structure of the same six-member executive committee remained intact through 2010.[3][5]
In 1997, the firm returned capital to most of its early investors in favor of a structured credit facility of nearly $2 billion from Bank of America, with terms that allowed D.E. Shaw & Co. to keep a higher fraction of profits than hedge fund investors normally allow.[6] After the Russian debt default in 1998, the company suffered losses in its fixed-income trading.[7]
In December 2003, a subsidiary of one of the company's funds acquired the toy store FAO Schwarz, which reopened for business in New York and Las Vegas in the fall of 2004. In the same year, D. E. Shaw affiliate, Laminar Portfolios, acquired the online assets of KB Toys, which continued operating as eToys.com.[8] In August 2004, D. E. Shaw & Co., along with MIC Capital, proposed to inject $50M into the bankrupt WCI Steel. In December 2004, D.E. Shaw & Co. bought 6.6% of USG Corp, a wallboard manufacturer seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of rising asbestos liabilities.[9]
In 2006, Lawrence Summers became managing director at D.E. Shaw & Co. and left in 2008, receiving $5.2 million in compensation for that period.[10] In late 2009 during the Financial Crisis it was reported that D.E. Shaw & Co. had set up a Portfolio Acquisitions Unit, the aim of which was to acquire illiquid assets from rival hedge funds.[11]
D.E. Shaw entered the Indian market in 2006,[12] with Anil Chawla, then the CEO of GE-Commercial finance, India & South East Asia, as the Country Manager. The India operations are headquartered in Hyderabad, Telangana. Under Anil Chawla as the CEO for India, D.E. Shaw entered into several large private equity deals in the country. This included the setting up of a joint-venture company with India's largest private sector company Reliance Industries [13] to provide financial services; real estate company DLF Assets Limited; publishing group Amar Ujala Publications; animation company, Crest Communications and renewable energy company, Soham Energy. After stepping down as CEO of D.E.Shaw in 2012, Anil Chawla continued as an advisor to the company until 2014.
In 2007, David Shaw sold a 20% minority stake to Lehman Brothers, as part of a broader strategy to diversify his personal holdings.[14] At the time of its bankruptcy in September 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. had holdings in D.E. Shaw & Co.[15]
Investment strategy[edit]
The company manages a variety of investment funds[16] that make extensive use of quantitative methods and proprietary computational technology to support fundamental research in the management of its investments.[3][17][18] The Company also uses qualitative analysis to make private equity investments in technology, wind power, real estate, and financial services firms and in distressed company financing.[4] In addition to its financial businesses, D. E. Shaw & Co. has provided private equity capital to technology-related business ventures, including Juno Online Services, an Internet access provider, and Farsight, an online financial services platform that was acquired by Merrill Lynch.[19] The company has $40 billion in aggregate capital[20][21] and in 2011 had $15.6 billion in hedge fund assets under management and was ranked as the 21st largest hedge fund by Institutional Investor.[20][22][23]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
D. E. Shaw supports educational programs such as Math-M-Addicts (teachers are D. E. Shaw & Co. employees),[24] American Regions Mathematics League,[25] Worldwide Online Olympiad Training (WOOT), United States of America Mathematics Olympiad and the International Mathematics Olympiad, Mathematical Olympiad Program, the MIT 6.370 Battlecode Competition,[26] and The Center for Excellence in Education.[27]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
