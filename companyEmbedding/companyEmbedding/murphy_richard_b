The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

                I reviewed Rich in another practice area earlier today and had a typo in my review.  It should be obvious, but I wanted to make it clear that Rich's high level of legal work has remained constant since I've known him.  He's an AV lawyer.

                I worked with Rich 10 years ago and found his work exceptional at that time.  I have since had cases against him, and there has been drop off in the quality of his work.  He is an excellent lawyer and a true professional in every sense.  In short, an AV lawyer.

                I have known Mr. Murphy for over a decade.  He possesses exceptional legal ability and comports himself at all times in a very professional and ethical manner.  Mr. Murphy is deserving of an AV rating.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Past results are not a guarantee of any future results as each case must be decided on its own merits. Client Review Ratings and/or Peer Review Ratings may not be available for all firms and/or lawyers and the fact that a firm or lawyer has not been reviewed should not be construed as unfavorable.

LEGAL TERMS

(more...)A determination of the value of something, such as a house, jewelry or stock. A professional appraiser -- a qualified, disinterested expert -- makes an estimate by examining the property, and looking at the initial purchase price and comparing it with recent sales of similar property. Courts commonly order appraisals in probate, condemnation, bankruptcy or foreclosure proceedings in order to determine the fair market value of property. Banks and real estate companies use appraisals to ascertain the worth of real estate for lending purposes. And insurance companies require appraisals to determine the amount of damage done to covered property before settling insurance claims.

HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATIONAn organization comprising neighbors concerned with managing the common areas of a subdivision or condominium complex. These associations take on issues such as... (more...)An organization comprising neighbors concerned with managing the common areas of a subdivision or condominium complex. These associations take on issues such as salting and sanding a subdivision when it snows and collecting dues from residents. The homeowners' association is also responsible for enforcing any covenants, conditions & restrictions that apply to the property.

ASSIGNMENTA transfer of property rights from one person to another, called the assignee.

MECHANIC'S LIENA legal claim placed on real estate by someone who is owed money for labor, services or supplies contributed to the property for the purpose of improving it. Ty... (more...)A legal claim placed on real estate by someone who is owed money for labor, services or supplies contributed to the property for the purpose of improving it. Typical lien claimants are general contractors, subcontractors and suppliers of building materials. A mechanics' lien claimant can sue to have the real estate sold at auction and recover the debt from the proceeds. Because property with a lien on it cannot be easily sold until the lien is satisfied (paid off), owners have a great incentive to pay their bills.

CONTINGENCYA provision in a contract stating that some or all of the terms of the contract will be altered or voided by the occurrence of a specific event. For example, a ... (more...)A provision in a contract stating that some or all of the terms of the contract will be altered or voided by the occurrence of a specific event. For example, a contingency in a contract for the purchase of a house might state that if the buyer does not approve the inspection report of the physical condition of the property, the buyer does not have to complete the purchase.

ASSIGNEEA person to whom a property right is transferred. For example, an assignee may take over a lease from a tenant who wants to permanently move out before the leas... (more...)A person to whom a property right is transferred. For example, an assignee may take over a lease from a tenant who wants to permanently move out before the lease expires. The assignee takes control of the property and assumes all the legal rights and responsibilities of the tenant, including payment of rent. However, the original tenant remains legally responsible if the assignee fails to pay the rent.

LEGACYAn outdated legal word meaning personal property left by a will. The more common term for this type of property is bequest. Compare devise.

INDISPENSABLE PARTYA person or entity (such as a corporation) that must be included in a lawsuit in order for the court to render a final judgment that will be just to everyone co... (more...)A person or entity (such as a corporation) that must be included in a lawsuit in order for the court to render a final judgment that will be just to everyone concerned. For example, if a person sues his neighbors to force them to prune a tree that poses a danger to his house, he must name all owners of the neighboring property in the suit.

SEVERABILITY CLAUSEA provision in a contract that preserves the rest of the contract if a portion of it is invalidated by a court. Without a severability clause, a decision by the... (more...)A provision in a contract that preserves the rest of the contract if a portion of it is invalidated by a court. Without a severability clause, a decision by the court finding one part of the contract unenforceable would invalidate the entire document.

Leaking kettle

I have to say the that I was given this kettle as a gift 18 months ago but due to it leaking all over the bench I am unable to use it as I worry about electrical and water as well as everything getting wet, it seems a shame to replace it as it is still in good order and looks great but I do not have a receipt?

Leaking Kettle

I love the look of my kettle but find the temperature of the water is not very hot when supposed to be at boiling point.
I find puddles under my kettle all the time. I fill it up to the 1.5lt level before I go to bed and when I get up in the morning there is a huge puddle on my bench and under my kettle which now has less than 2 cups of water in it according to the guage. There is always a puddle of water on the on/off switch.
I bought my kettle/toaster through my shopping points so have no idea what I can do. I bought them both for moving into our new house which was probably about 10 months ago but they have only been in use for approx 6 months from when we moved in.

As I thought this was covered by the 2 year guarantee and as it's now dangerous to use. I phone Murphy Richard but was tol

d they could only offer a replacement for £39.99 (original cost was £50 on 29th September 2015). The big joke about this offer is I can get the latest version 102032 of this kettle from Argos for £29.99. So the 2 year guarantee is of no use as I was expecting a free replacement as it's dangerous to use and not fit for purpose due to design of window. Your offer given is £10 more that the shop price! What is the point Murphy Richard customer care?

Purchased kettle at Harvey Norman, love the shape, style , colour.  Had not purchased this brand before but staff assured me I had nothing to worry about Morphy Richards was very good.   Kettle is still going very well, I love everything about the kettle and its  a nice piece to look at on my new kitchen bench.  Unfortunately the only draw back is that when heating it is extremely noisy.  Have to always adjust the volume on tv or radio until kettle has finished boiling.  I leave for work at 5.25am in morning and have been asked by household (ad

Was interesting to read that others had commented on noise as I thought I might have just had bad luck and got one that missed the final check.  I wont replace it until I have to as apart from the noise I love everything else about it.

I purchased this kettle a few years ago because I liked the style and appearance. It looks great in the kitchen and I like the glossy white. 
It's reliable and does what it says on the tin. I don't know if it's the fastest kettle around but I've had no problems with it.

Love the look of these kettles but very dispointed when after a year the paint peeled off! It was also incredibly noisy. 
I would buy morphy Richards again. When I called to advise of the paint peel customer services was not helpful and told me they could give me another one at a discounted rate but I would need to pay postage, worked out the same as buying brand new!

This Kettle was the best I have ever had so far, it lasted two years before I had to toss it out which is good in my household! It is not like other kettles that make a lot of noise whilst heating, it is nice and silent so you don't have to try talk over it or strain to listen to someone speaking....the non-interfering kettle!  lol

Very stylish look brightens up the kitchen. Boils in great time and love the whistle to let you know it's boiled. So far nice and easy to clean. Very easy to see how much water is in it with a wider than normal gauge. Also nice and quiet whilst boiling.

I absolutely love the Accent , Toaster & Kettle, this a great combination, Firstly they both work brilliantly, the Toaster is a four slice which is great for the family. The Kettle boils very quickly . I love the Azzure colour they make my kitchen look modern. I highly recommend.

This is a great kettle. It looks great and works well although a little noisy maybe on a still quiet night if you want a late night cuppa. It has a large capacity and it is great to see the level of the water through the window. A great kettle.

I've had my kettle for three years, has always worked well... still looks like new.  However recently the base has started to elicit a crackling noise after boiling. If I turn it off at the wall the noise stops.  I'm worried it might be an electrical fault.  is it time to buy a new kettle?

                            Hi Cheryle - you may just need to replace the base. Please contact our Customer Care team by phone: 1300 556 816 or email: customer.care@glendimplex.com.au to be advised of pricing and availability (dependent on model number)

i just bought this kettle. boil water for the first time and threw the water away as instructed. after that boil and drank water for the first time and water tasted like chemical. was wondering if the plastic filter is safe health wise under high heat all the time?does this melt over time?

Answer this








                            Hi. Despite my issue of the exterior coating flaking around the level indicator, I have no other issues with taste. I do use filtered water plus I have to clean the interior f sediments which build up over time. Not sure how the sediment gets there, but it does. I would not buy this brand of kettle again.
