Fitch Expects to Rate Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2012-B; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Expects to Rate Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2012-B; Presale Issued
    





April 16, 2012 02:37 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings to the Ford Credit 
      Auto Owner Trust 2012-B notes:
    

      --$306,300,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$422,100,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$450,700,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$120,710,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$41,060,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$27,360,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$27,360,000 class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Key Rating Drivers
    

      Stable Credit Quality: The 2012-B pool is relatively consistent with 
      prior deals. The WA FICO score is 722. Despite this, there is a slight 
      shift down in the credit/FICO tiers versus recent deals. The pool 
      comprises 87.3% new vehicles, has more 60+ month term loans, and is 
      geographically diverse.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure, consistent with prior transactions. Initial 
      hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A notes totals 5.50%, 
      consisting of 7.00% subordination and a 0.50% non-declining reserve 
      offset by under-collateralization of 2.00%. Initial hard CE is 0.50% 
      lower than recent 2012 and 2011 transactions.
    

      Improved Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on Ford Credit's 
      portfolio and 2009-2011 FCAOT securitizations have declined, supported 
      by the improving U.S. economy albeit volatile, and strong used vehicle 
      values resulting in higher recovery rates.
    

      Positive Corporate Performance: Fitch currently rates the long-term 
      Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of Ford, the parent of Ford Credit, and Ford 
      Credit 'BB+' with a Positive Rating Outlook.
    

      Strong Wholesale Vehicle Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market 
      rebounded considerably during late 2009?2010 and remained strong in 
      2012. However, Fitch remains cautious as to the potential impact of 
      general economic weakness and rising fuel prices on demand for and 
      values of used vehicles.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates 
      good capabilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, evidenced by 
      historical delinquency and loss performance of its managed portfolio and 
      securitizations. Fitch deems Ford Credit capable to adequately service 
      2012-B.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      For more information about Fitch's comprehensive subscription service 
      FitchResearch, which includes all presale reports, surveillance, and 
      credit reports on more than 20 asset classes, contact product sales at

      Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

Fitch Rates Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C
    





October 25, 2016 02:07 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C:
    


      --$286,700,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$315,000,000 class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$150,000,000 class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$377,500,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$121,570,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$39,520,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$26,350,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Credit Quality: The pool is consistent with recent deals, the 
      highest weighted average (WA) FICO score seen to date at 736, and the 
      highest percentage of new vehicles seen to date at 89.8%. The pool is 
      geographically diverse and has WA seasoning of 7.8 months, and 54.5% of 
      the loans have terms of 61 months or more.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the 
      class A notes totals 5.54%, consisting of 5.00% subordination and a 
      0.54% non-declining reserve, all consistent with recent transactions.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on 
      Ford Credit's portfolio and 2012 - 2015 securitizations are currently at 
      low levels, supported by the stable U.S. economy and healthy used 
      vehicle values, although they are expected to soften over the next year. 
      Fitch's initial base case cumulative net loss (CNL) assumption is 1.50%.
    

      Stable Corporate Performance: Fitch's current Long-Term Issuer Default 
      Rating (IDR) for Ford Motor Company (Ford), parent of Ford Credit, and 
      Ford Credit, is 'BBB'/Stable Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as an originator, underwriter and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization delinquency and 
      loss performance. Fitch deems Ford Credit an adequate servicer for this 
      series.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the 
      notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all 
      classes of 2016-C to increased losses over the life of the transaction. 
      Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and losses. Under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario the notes would be unlikely to experience any downgrade. 
      However, the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating 
      categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or re-computing certain information with respect to 125 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on its analysis. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled "Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions," dated May 31, 2016.

      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone:

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
