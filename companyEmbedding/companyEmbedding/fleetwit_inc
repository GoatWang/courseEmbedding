Missing



?

The meta description for fleetwit.com is missing.Meta descriptions allow you to influence how your web pages are described and displayed in search results. A good description acts as a potential organic advertisement and encourages the viewer to click through to your site.Keep it short and to the point; the ideal meta description should be between 70 and 160 characters (spaces included).Ensure that each of your web pages have a unique meta description that is explicit and contains your most important keywords for each page. These keywords are especially important because they appear in bold when they match the user’s search query (See the Google Preview below).Check your Google Search Console (Search Appearance > HTML Improvements) for any warning messages to identify meta descriptions that are too long/short or duplicated across more than one page.

Improve the Meta Description

So it’s important to be clear, concise and within the suggested character limit.

Medium impact











Easy to solve





      We did not find HTML headings (<H1> to <H6>) on this page.
      
    


?

HTML header tags (or simply header tags) differentiate between headings, subheadings and the rest of the content on the page.fleetwit.com currently has 0 HTML header tags. Each page should have one, and only one, <H1> tag. Use keywords in your headings with your most important keywords in the top level, and be sure to maintain the <H1> to <H6> hierarchy.While it is important to ensure every page has an <H1> tag, only include more than one per page if you're using HTML5. Instead, use multiple <H2> - <H6> tags.

Add the important keywords in <H> headings

Easy to solve





      No images with missing alt attributes were found.
      
    


?

Alternative text allows you to add a description to an image. Since search engine crawlers cannot see images, they rely on alternative text attributes to determine relevance to a search query. Alternative text also helps makes an image more likely to appear in a Google image search and is used by screen readers to provide context for visually impaired users.It looks like most or all of your images have alternative text. Check the images on your website to make sure accurate and relevant alternative text is specified for each image on the page. Try to minimize the number of alt text characters to 150 or less (including spaces!) to optimize page load times.

Set a name for all your images

A low number can indicate that bots are unable to discover your pages, which is commonly caused by bad site architecture & internal linking, or you're unknowingly preventing bots and search engines from crawling & indexing your pages. An unusually high number could be an indication of duplicate content due to URL parameters.Make sure your website's XML sitemap is present and that you've submitted it to the major search engines. Building backlinks to your website's internal pages will also help bots to discover, crawl and index them, while building authority to help them rank in search results at the same time.Check Index Status and Crawl Errors in Google Search Console to track the status of your crawled/indexed pages.If you use parameters in your URL like session IDs or sorting and filtering, use the rel="canonical" tag  tag to tell search engines which version of those pages is the original.
                                    A low number of Discovered pages can indicate that bad site architecture and internal linking are preventing bots from finding all your pages, or you've accidentally disallowed bots via your robots.txt file.

Broken links send users to non-existent web pages. They hurt a site's usability and reputation, which impacts SEO.Fortunately your page doesn't contain any broken links. Be proactive in checking your pages to make sure they don't have any broken links.

      Warning, no 301 redirects are in place to redirect traffic to your preferred domain. Pages that load successfully both with and without www. are treated as duplicate content!
      
    


?

Search engines see www.fleetwit.com and fleetwit.com as two different websites with the same content. This causes them to see a lot of duplicate content, which they don't like.Right now your website is not directing traffic to www.fleetwit.com and fleetwit.com to the same URL. It is crucial that you fix this.Set a preferred domain in Google Search Console and use a 301 redirect to divert traffic from your secondary domain.

Redirect non-www to www

A robots.txt file allows you to restrict the access of search engine crawlers to prevent them from accessing specific pages or directories. They also point the web crawler to your page’s XML sitemap file.We checked fleetwit.com/robots.txt didn't find a robots.txt file. Use Google Search Console to submit and test your robot.txt file. You can also test individual pages to make sure Google isn't crawling any restricted files.

Easy to solve





Missing



?

We checked fleetwit.com but couldn't find an XML sitemap.XML sitemaps contain the list of your URLs that are available to index and allows the search engines to read your pages more intelligently. They can also include information like your site’s latest updates, frequency of changes and the importance of URLs.Your site is currently missing an XML sitemap. We recommend you generate one for your site and submit it through both Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. Normally, your XML sitemap would be found at fleetwit.com/sitemap.Make sure to only include the pages you want search engines to crawl, so leave out any that have been blocked in a robots.txt file. Avoid using any URLs that cause redirects or error codes and be consistent in using your preferred URLs (with or without www.), correct protocols (http vs. https) and trailing slashes. You should also use your robots.txt file to point search engine crawlers to the location of your sitemap.

Add and Optimize your XML sitemap






















                                      URL Parameters
                                    







      Good, the URLs look clean.
      
    


?

                                    URL parameters are used to track user behaviors on site (session IDs), traffic sources (referrer IDs) or to give users control over the content on the page (sorting and filtering). The issue with URL parameters is that Google sees each unique parameter value as a new URL hosting the same thing - meaning you could have a duplicate content problem. Sometimes, it’s able to recognize these URLs and group them together. It then algorithmically decides which URL is the best representation of the group and uses it to consolidate ranking signals and display in search results. You can help Google recognize the best URL by using the rel=”canonical” tag.Use the URL Parameters Tool in Google Search Console to tell Google how your URL parameters affect page content and how to to crawl URLs with parameters. Use this tool very carefully - you can easily prevent Google from crawling pages you want indexed through overly restrictive crawling settings, especially if you have URLs with multiple parameters.
                                    
                                
Rewrite your URLs and clean them up.






















                                      Underscores in the URLs
                                    













Low impact











Hard to solve





      Great, you are not using ‪underscores (these_are_underscores) in your URLs.
      
    


?

Great, you aren't using ‪underscores (these_are_underscores) in your URLs. Google sees hyphens as word separators while underscores aren't recognized. So the search engine sees www.example.com/green_dress as www.example.com/greendress. The bots will have a hard time determining this URL's relevance to a keyword.
























                                      Blocking Factors
                                    













Medium impact











Hard to solve








Flash: No







Frames: No



?

Great, you aren't using Flash or frames on your site.While it often looks nicer, Flash content can't be properly indexed by search engines. Maximize your SEO efforts by avoiding Flash.Search engines also have problems with frames because they can't crawl or index the content within them. Avoid them if you can and use a NoFrames tag when you can't.

Keep your URLs short and clean and avoid long domain names when possible.A descriptive URL is better recognized by search engines. A user should be able to look at the address bar and make an accurate guess about the content of the page before reaching it (e.g., http://www.mysite.com/en/products).Keep in mind that URLs are also an important part of a comprehensive SEO strategy. Use clean URLs to make your site more "crawlable" by Google™.Resource: Search for a good domain name. If no good names are available, consider a second hand domain. To prevent brand theft, you might consider trademarking your domain name.

                                    Modern websites tend to be SSL secured (HTTPS) as it provides an extra security layer while logging in to your Web Service. In 2014, Google announced that an HTTPS (vs HTTP) website would receive an extra boost in their ranking. While switching to HTTPS, make sure your site remains optimized and see to it that your website will still run quickly. Follow these best practices for a smooth transition:Use a serious issuer to purchase your SSL certificateRedirect all of your HTTP pages to the HTTPS version of your websiteUse HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) in your headersRenew your SSL certificate every year, before it expiresMake sure that all of your content (CSS, etc.) is linked to HTTPSUpdate your XML sitemap to ensure the URLs include HTTPS and update the robots.txt file to reference this versionRegister the HTTPS website in Google & Bing Search Console/Webmaster Tools
