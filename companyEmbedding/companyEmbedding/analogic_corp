About Us




Our Mission
Analogic Creates Innovative Technology That Improves the Practice of Medicine and Saves Lives.
For over 40 years Analogic has created markets by anticipating and solving some of the world’s most complex medical and engineering challenges. Today, our specific areas of expertise include developing enabling technologies used in computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, digital mammography (DM), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We also develop state-of-the-art threat detection systems for airport checked-baggage screening and checkpoint screening as well as motion controls.




 

Worldwide Installation of Our Medical and Security Imaging Products
Many of the largest, best-known medical imaging companies incorporate our high-performance imaging subsystems into their products. These products are used in most major healthcare facilities around the world to detect and treat disease.
Our state-of-the-art airport security imaging systems are installed in airports around the world, helping to make air travel safer. With high levels of detection, our systems accelerate baggage and passenger throughput, reduce costs for airports and airlines, and minimize passenger inconvenience.



 

More than Forty Years of Engineering Innovation
Founded in 1967 by Bernard Gordon, Analogic is known for solving the most difficult engineering problems through innovation. Many of our customers have been with us, relying on our expertise, for decades.
We provide extensive design, development, manufacturing, and test capabilities, and offer a unique combination of clinical knowledge and product design experience. We support our customers during development and throughout the product life cycle, enabling them to bring their products to market faster and support their own customers in the field.



 

Unrivaled Production and Test Facilities
One of the advantages we have over our competition is that much of our design, development, global supply chain management, and production processes is accomplished under one roof, in more than 500,000 square feet in our headquarters facility in Peabody, Massachusetts. In addition, we have a 92,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Shanghai, China.

Analogic Corporation




Nucleus RTOS helped Analogic control their development costs for several products, allowing them to pass these savings on to their customers.



“We selected Nucleus RTOS because it's the leading source-code embedded OS available and because our chosen CPU model was explicitly supported. This is not always true of competing OSes. We found Nucleus RTOS very easy to integrate into our product and debugging environment. In fact, the board-support code was invaluable in bringing up our hardware. We haven't had any problems with Nucleus RTOS or run into any bugs over the two years we've used it. It will definitely be a part of our next product, too.”

Mark Egler, Principal Engineer, Analogic


Analogic Chooses Nucleus RTOS for their kernel Developers at Analogic had previously used the pSOS kernel. But, required to control expenses, the company switched to an embedded kernel with a more flexible business model, Nucleus RTOS, so they could save unnecessary costs that would normally be passed on to their customers. Another reason for choosing Nucleus RTOS was the well-documented source code. Even though problems never surfaced with the development process, having access to the source code was a tremendous benefit. It was for these reasons that Nucleus RTOS was selected for development of the fetal monitor using the MPC823 processor from Freescale. Nucleus RTOS perfectly met the needs for the newest product, the FETALGARD Lite, in Analogic's fetal monitoring product line. The scalable, robust, flexible, and high performance characteristics of Nucleus RTOS seamlessly met the demands of developing the medical industry's most innovative fetal monitor. Fetal Monitoring  The FETALGARD Lite™ is a low-cost, modular, portable, antepartum fetal monitor that can be configured to satisfy a variety of applications and tight budget requirements. Feature rich, it offers tremendous value in a rugged, compact, and lightweight unit, with excellent communications capabilities. Extensive communications abilities allow the portable device to be used in the office, the clinic and even the home setting. Direct connection to an office PC allows annotation and storage of test results to FETALGARD Lite View software. In a clinical setting, the device conveniently interfaces to a Central Nurses' Station. In remote locations, patient data can be transmitted to a computer via a telephone and modem with the FETALGARD Lite software.
About Analogic Corporation

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.
