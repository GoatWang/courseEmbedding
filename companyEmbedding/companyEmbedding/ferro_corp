Ferro Corp. Of Interest To Paint Companies? - Ferro Corporation (NYSE:FOE) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Ferro Corp. Of Interest To Paint Companies?Feb.20.17 | About: Ferro Corporation (FOE) Dr. Harold Goldmeier Growth, momentum, growth at reasonable pricelinkdenSummaryFerro Corp. products complement those in the paint manufacturing industry; it's relatively small and inexpensive, and will benefit from takeover and marketing of its products by legacy paint manufacturers.Ferro is a relatively safe investment but it's greatest value is as an acquisition target - more from paint companies than investment houses, from which there have been offers.It is a chemical company into polymer and material sciences, heavy on developing technologies for glass, paint and other industries.Ferro Corp. (NYSE:FOE) makes products that complement those in the paint manufacturing industry. Ferro is relatively small and inexpensive, and will benefit from the marketing of its products to firms to which larger paint companies are already selling. Ferro's investment attractiveness is mostly as a merger or acquisition. I have written articles over the past year for Seeking Alpha encouraging investment in the rather uncelebrated paint manufacturing industry. It's not a glitzy business, and is the object of a lot of snickering. But the dramatic increases in share prices of most of the companies I highlight are leaving investors laughing all the way to the bank. These include:  Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) shares rising from the mid-$200s topping $310. PPG Industries (NYSE: PPG) shares selling for below $90 then reaching a 52-week high of $117. Valspar Corp. (NYSE: VAL) shares rose after my article, from $76 to a SHW buyout offer of $113. Two of my less pricey favorites, RPM International (NYSE: RPM) and Axalta Coating Systems (NYSE: AXTA).  A stock I'm recommending today is Ferro Corp. This is not a paint company per se like those above, though it was founded nearly a hundred years ago (1919), manufacturing porcelain enamel coatings for appliances and, later on, boats. It is more a chemical company into polymer and material sciences, heavy on developing technologies for performance materials selling into the glass, ceramic, paint and other industries. By the mid-1980s, FOE's core businesses included custom-engineered plastics, coatings, colors, chemicals and ceramics. The company bought or opened forty factories and a customer sales pipeline from China, for its growing middle class, to other parts of the world, e.g., Egypt, India, Turkey, Spain and Portugal.
 

 (Image Source: Company Website) S1de ONE enhances beauty, durability of Amsterdam's "The Rock" Office Tower FOE's technologies in powder, auto and industrial coatings might make it of special takeover interest to legacy paint companies that are consolidating the industry, according to PCI Magazine. Three months ago, Ferro itself completed the acquisition of Belgium-based Cappelle Pigments, a leader in specialty, high-performance inorganic and organic pigments used in coatings, inks and plastics. FOE's products of interest to paint companies on the hunt include:  Porcelain enamel products for coating appliances, cookware, sanitary ware, water heaters, building panels, signage and chemical storage vessels. Complex inorganic color pigments for the paint, plastics and ceramics industries that are highly heat stable, lightfast and chemical/weather resistant. Black enamels and conductive pastes for automotive glass. Colors, inks and coatings for appliance and architectural flat glass; functional coatings and pigments and specialty glasses used in dental applications, grinding wheels, spark plugs and other industrial applications; Process Temperature Control Rings (PTCR), materials for laser marking and nanofilm coatings for glass surfaces. Complex inorganic color pigments for the paint, plastics and ceramics industries that are highly heat stable, lightfast, and chemical and weather resistant. Ultramarines, specialty iron oxides, chrome oxide greens and corrosion inhibitors. Ferro's liquid and paste color dispersions are produced using resin-matched vehicles that are totally compatible and/or reactive with all thermoplastic and thermoset plastics - suitable for a wide variety of processes. 
 FOE shares are selling above the 52-week low ($8.51) and below the high ($16.17) at a tad above $14. Its market cap is $1.18 billion. In 2013, A. Schulman (NSDAQ: SHLM) offered $6.50 per share for FOE. Schulman and subsequent offers have been shunted. In 2016, Ferro received and rebuffed acquisition offers allegedly below $14 from Apollo Global Management LLC and Capital Partners Ltd. One shareholder, according to Reuters, believes management ought to pursue buyers with the company's "significant operational improvement, strong market share positions, robust free cash flow generation and deep acquisition pipeline." Ferro continues to hum along with admirable commentaries from analysts over the past four years. On February 14, 2017, the company announced the closing of a new $625 million senior-secured term loan to repay outstanding balances and extend debt maturity. Also, a new $400 million senior-secured revolving credit facility has been made. Analysts currently set a target price of $16.10. CapitalCube's analysis gives Ferro Corp. an investment outlook score of 59, "with a relative valuation of UNDERVALUED" based on comparing the company with its peers in the paint and chemical industries. Institutions and mutual funds hold almost 96 percent of the 83 million shares outstanding. The short ratio is 5.45. FOE enjoys a 30.8 percent gross profit margin and a 10.5 percent operating margin. On the whole, this is a pretty safe investment. There is nothing exceptional about Ferro Corp. to warrant significant investment except for its potential to get swept up in the M&A winds - but that's been the talk for years. Perhaps this is the year with the share price creeping above $14 and insiders growing impatient?

Ferro Corp.
Manufacturing





            
            
            (This story was updated at 10:57 a.m.)Ferro Corp. (NYSE: FOE) said it has sold its precious metals-based powders and flakes product lines in North America and Asia to Ames Advanced Materials Corp., a subsidiary of Ames Goldsmith Corp., a producer of precious metal products. Ferro said the sale consists of the manufacturing assets of the company's South Plainfield, N.J., operation, including associated inventory, and the assets of its precious metals powders and flakes business line in Tsukuba, Japan. Besides to the asset sale, Ferro and Ames have entered into a seven-year supply agreement. Through the agreement, Ferro said, it “secures a reliable source of key raw materials for its downstream businesses while protecting its cost position.”Ferro said net cash proceeds from the sale were $13 million. In addition, Ames provided Ferro with precious metals valued at approximately $43 million to satisfy its precious metal lease obligations outstanding.Ferro estimates the transaction, including the supply agreement, will result in a financial reporting gain in excess of the net cash proceeds and a tax loss estimated at approximately $5 million.In commenting on the transaction, Ferro president and CEO Peter Thomas said, “The sale of these assets is a result of our continuing business and asset portfolio evaluation process and the harvesting of underperforming and non-core businesses. This transaction allows us to redeploy assets into attractive growth opportunities."Mary Abood, director of corporate communications for Ferro, said in an email that the product lines did not meet the company’s expectation of return on invested capital. Ferro’s “value creation strategy” relies heavily on increasing this type of return on investment overall, Ms. Abood wrote, and that the company is working “to strategically align the portfolio with core businesses having strongest growth profile.” In addition to the sale of the metals-based powder and flakes product lines, Ferro has sold it solar pastes assets and its pharmaceuticals business this year. The company began implementing the strategy about a year ago. Mr. Thomas last May told Crain’s that Ferro intended to continue cutting non-core businesses and lowering costs throughout 2013.Ferro said the latest transaction does not include the company's precious metals business in Hanau, Germany, which produces gold, palladium and platinum precious metal products.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
