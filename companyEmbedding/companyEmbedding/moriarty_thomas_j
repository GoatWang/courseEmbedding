               Company: Oneonta Country Club Inc
Job Details
               The Oneonta Country Club is an 18-hole, member-owned club originally Established in 1913 with the purchase of 85 acres of land, with money provided by an initial 100 subscribers. According to one author, the Club opened with two tennis courts and nine golf holes. The expansion to 18 holes was accomplished by 1928, although the tennis courts were eliminated. The arrangement of holes has changed over time, with the current alignment adopted in the 1950's. The Club is a traditional member-oriented championship course, unsurpassed in the area for challenging play. It offers golfers a wide variety of terrain with eighteen holes guarded by water, woods, and sand traps, and provides an exciting test of any golfer's skills. It was also one of the first courses in the area that utilized fully watered fairways and greens, which makes it possible to offer a consistently well manicured course. The club also has a practice facility and putting green for member advancement and enjoyment. The clubhouse offers accommodations for special social events. The extensive social program includes parties, barbecues, holiday dinner dances and entertainment that will please every type of member. Our facilities are also available for business/personal meetings, private parties, weddings and outside corporate events. Membership privileges include unlimited golf on our well-maintained course and access to carts, golf lessons, golf equipment and club storage, the use of men's and ladies locker rooms, practice range / putting greens and the finest food and beverages in our restaurant and lounge "Roundhouse Pub & Grill". We provide membership categories for men, women and families. There are numerous opportunities for individual competition and social play. The Oneonta Country Club is an exceptional place to meet new friends, play a casual game of golf, enjoy a wonderful meal, or to just sit outside and take in the beautiful scenery while sharing a cocktail with friends. In addition to regular golf play, there are men's, women's and a Friday night couples leagues, special men's and women's competitions, and regularly scheduled social events. Members of the Oneonta Country Club are also welcomed at ten other New York State golf clubs under reciprocal agreements with those clubs. The Golf Shop is operated by Director of Golf (TBD). A variety of lesson opportunities are available to suit golfers of all skill levels. The shop provides a full line of golf apparel, professional equipment and club repair services for men, women and juniors. The current number of members is approximately 225, plus spouses and children. Membership is open to any resident of the area. Anyone interested in membership should complete an application (see Membership Information) and submit it to the Board of Directors.
