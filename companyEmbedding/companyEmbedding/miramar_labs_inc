miraDry® has been a great investment for my practice. It delivers unparalleled clinical results and uniformly high patient satisfaction. It has opened an untapped revenue stream in my practice. With miraDry, sweating becomes a choice, not a chance.
Christopher Khorsandi, MD
Plastic Surgeon
Las Vegas, NV



miraDry has been an invaluable tool in our practice. The device is configured to predictably and permanently damage the underarm sweat glands. Other therapies can be effective but are either temporary or invasive.
E. Victor Ross, MD
Dermatologist
La Jolla, CA



miraDry has revolutionized the treatment of underarm sweating. It has one of the highest patient satisfaction rates among the more than 30 energy-based devices that I offer in my practice.
Cameron Rokhsar, MD
Dermatologist
New York City and Garden City, NY



While patient satisfaction with miraDry is already among the highest of the non-invasive procedures we offer, with the new protocol (OTP), patient satisfaction is even higher.
Larry Fan, MD
Plastic Surgeon
San Francisco, CA



The miraDry technology fits well in a busy dermatology practice. We’ve been able to serve our sweat-bothered patients more effectively using miraDry. We see real results and the treatment is relatively easy, cost effective, and satisfying.
Chad Tingey, MD
Dermatologist
Ogden, UT



miraDry is bringing new patients to our practice, which gives us the opportunity to expose them to all of the treatments we offer.
Susan Van Dyke, MD
Dermatologist
Scottsdale, AZ



I was rendered almost entirely sweat free after one application. I was so impressed, I decided then and there to acquire a machine for my practice, which has proven to be a very sound investment and extremely popular with patients.
David Eccleston, MD
Cosmetic Physician
Sutton Coldfield, England



For the physician, the ROI is great, miraDry pays for itself after only a few months. The consumable is inexpensive, and the device is relatively inexpensive when you compare it to the revenue stream.
Grant Stevens, MD
Plastic Surgeon
Marina Del Rey, CA



My patients love the confidence they get with permanent relief from their underarm sweat and odor. Patient satisfaction with miraDry is among the highest of the procedures we offer.
Sue Ellen Cox, MD
Dermatologist
Chapel Hill, NC



miraDry is a breakthrough technology that changes the paradigm for people concerned about sweating – not just excess sweating, but sweating in general. With this incredible technology, we can now offer to our patients, mainly in one treatment session, a permanent reduction in the amount they sweat. This is great news for our patients and for your practice.
Michael Gold, MD
Dermatologist
Nashville, TN



miraDry has clearly been a good investment in my practice. Once we got going, we have not stopped. We find that our aesthetic patients, who come in for other treatments, become our miraDry patients, and conversely, miraDry attracts new patients that go on to do other procedures.
David J. Goldberg, MD, JD
Dermatologist
Hackensack, NJ, and New York, NY



For me it is not just another device. It is a game changer that has transformed how we work and treat both hyperhidrosis and those who suffer from unpleasant sweating. It is one of the major breakthroughs in the industry.
Itzhak Vider, MD
Head of Medical OR
Herzliya, Israel

Recent NewsMore >06/12/2017Sientra to Acquire Miramar Labs®



Investor Overview
Corporate Profile
Miramar Labs Inc. (OTCQB:MRLB) is a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing our proprietary microwave technology platform. Our first commercial product, the miraDry System, is designed to ablate axillary, or underarm, sweat glands through the precise and non-invasive delivery of energy to the region where sweat glands reside.  The energy generates heat which results in thermolysis of the sweat glands.  At the same time, a continuous hydro-ceramic cooling system protects the superficial dermis and keeps the heat focused at the sweat glands.  Because sweat glands do not regenerate after the treatment, we believe the results are lasting.  Microwaves are the ideal technology as the energy can be focused directly at the fat and dermal junction where the glands reside. We estimate that over 70,000 miraDry procedures have been performed around the world.

Miramar Labs, Inc.® Reports Q1 2017 Financial Results







Print
Share
Font-size








            05/15/17 05:08 PM EDT
        


Highlights:
- First quarter revenue of $3.8 million- Strong sales in Europe/Middle East with 26% year-over-year growth- Continued momentum in North America sales with 18% year-over-year growth- Decline in Asia sales of 54% year-over-year due to timing of orders in Japan and China- Gross margin expands to 56%, up from 53%- Cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 million at March 31, 2017






SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 15, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Miramar Labs, Inc., (OTCQB:MRLB), a global aesthetic company, announced today financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Michael Kleine, President and Chief Executive Officer of Miramar Labs, said, "We continue to see excitement around the miraDry® technology in our global markets during the first quarter.  We are pleased with our growth in Europe/Middle East and North America and in particular the 47% and 25% growth in consumables products respectively, which indicates there is robust patient interest in the miraDry procedure.  While we are disappointed with the 54% sales decline in Asia, the decrease was primarily due to the timing of China and Japan orders and going forward, we remain positive that our new "miraDry is Confidence"   campaign is generating excitement, not only in the US market but across Europe, the Middle East and Asia."
"Despite these positive trends, we continue to be challenged by a lack of financial capital, which has impeded our ability to invest in initiatives to accelerate our growth.  As a result, we are carefully managing our cash and securing additional capital as this continues to be a major focus of the Company," added Michael Kleine.
The latest Miramar Labs financing occurred in January 2017 and involved the issuance of convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.7 million.  In the event of a future equity financing, the amount equivalent to the outstanding balance of each note multiplied by five will convert into shares of securities issued at such equity financing, either automatically or at the election of holders holding a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes, depending on the amount of proceeds from such equity financing. In the event of a change of control before the next equity financing, the amount equivalent to the outstanding balance of each note multiplied by three will convert into shares of the acquiring company in a stock-for-stock merger or will be paid out in cash in a cash-for-stock merger.
Financial Results
Total revenue in the first quarter of 2017 was $3.8 million, an 11% decrease compared to $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2016. This revenue reflects a 10% growth in consumable product sales worldwide, which partially offset the decrease in capital sales.  As mentioned above, North America growth was 18%, including 25% growth in consumable product sales, and Europe/Middle East growth was 26%, including 47% growth in consumable sales.  In Asia, revenue declined 54%, primarily due to the timing of China and Japan orders.
Cost of product revenue was $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2016. Total gross margin in the first quarter of 2017 was $2.1 million, or 56% of revenue, compared to $2.3 million, or 53% of revenue, in the same period in 2016. The increase in gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, is primarily attributable to a higher percentage of sales of consumables worldwide, especially in North America and Europe, where we have a higher gross margin as compared to capital sales.
Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017, were $5.3 million, compared to $5.3 million for the same period in 2016.  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, higher general and administrative expenses due to public company costs and stock option compensation charges were offset by lower research and development expense for the same period.
Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $7.3 million, or $0.78 per share, compared to a loss of $3.3 million or $8.32 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 included a non-cash interest expense charge of $3.2 million for the derivative liability incurred for the convertible promissory notes issued in January 2017.
Miramar Labs had total cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 million at March 31, 2017.

miraDry® has been a great investment for my practice. It delivers unparalleled clinical results and uniformly high patient satisfaction. It has opened an untapped revenue stream in my practice. With miraDry, sweating becomes a choice, not a chance.
Christopher Khorsandi, MD
Plastic Surgeon
Las Vegas, NV



miraDry has been an invaluable tool in our practice. The device is configured to predictably and permanently damage the underarm sweat glands. Other therapies can be effective but are either temporary or invasive.
E. Victor Ross, MD
Dermatologist
La Jolla, CA



miraDry has revolutionized the treatment of underarm sweating. It has one of the highest patient satisfaction rates among the more than 30 energy-based devices that I offer in my practice.
Cameron Rokhsar, MD
Dermatologist
New York City and Garden City, NY



While patient satisfaction with miraDry is already among the highest of the non-invasive procedures we offer, with the new protocol (OTP), patient satisfaction is even higher.
Larry Fan, MD
Plastic Surgeon
San Francisco, CA



The miraDry technology fits well in a busy dermatology practice. We’ve been able to serve our sweat-bothered patients more effectively using miraDry. We see real results and the treatment is relatively easy, cost effective, and satisfying.
Chad Tingey, MD
Dermatologist
Ogden, UT



miraDry is bringing new patients to our practice, which gives us the opportunity to expose them to all of the treatments we offer.
Susan Van Dyke, MD
Dermatologist
Scottsdale, AZ



I was rendered almost entirely sweat free after one application. I was so impressed, I decided then and there to acquire a machine for my practice, which has proven to be a very sound investment and extremely popular with patients.
David Eccleston, MD
Cosmetic Physician
Sutton Coldfield, England



For the physician, the ROI is great, miraDry pays for itself after only a few months. The consumable is inexpensive, and the device is relatively inexpensive when you compare it to the revenue stream.
Grant Stevens, MD
Plastic Surgeon
Marina Del Rey, CA



My patients love the confidence they get with permanent relief from their underarm sweat and odor. Patient satisfaction with miraDry is among the highest of the procedures we offer.
Sue Ellen Cox, MD
Dermatologist
Chapel Hill, NC



miraDry is a breakthrough technology that changes the paradigm for people concerned about sweating – not just excess sweating, but sweating in general. With this incredible technology, we can now offer to our patients, mainly in one treatment session, a permanent reduction in the amount they sweat. This is great news for our patients and for your practice.
Michael Gold, MD
Dermatologist
Nashville, TN



miraDry has clearly been a good investment in my practice. Once we got going, we have not stopped. We find that our aesthetic patients, who come in for other treatments, become our miraDry patients, and conversely, miraDry attracts new patients that go on to do other procedures.
David J. Goldberg, MD, JD
Dermatologist
Hackensack, NJ, and New York, NY



For me it is not just another device. It is a game changer that has transformed how we work and treat both hyperhidrosis and those who suffer from unpleasant sweating. It is one of the major breakthroughs in the industry.
Itzhak Vider, MD
Head of Medical OR
Herzliya, Israel
