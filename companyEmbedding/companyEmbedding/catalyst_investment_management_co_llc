Catalyst Investors leads $41M Series C for Fusion Risk Management


June 13, 2017

Fusion Risk Management Raises $41 Million in Series C Funding Led by Catalyst Investors
 
Proceeds to support continued growth in operational risk and preparedness capabilities for the business continuity software leader
 
JUNE 13, 2017 — CHICAGO — Fusion Risk Management, Inc., the leading provider of SaaS software for business continuity risk management, announced today an investment of $41 million in funding led by Catalyst Investors, a New York-based growth equity firm. Catalyst is a new investor to the company, joining existing investor Level Equity. Fusion Risk Management (“Fusion”) will use the latest investment round to support product development, customer service, sales and marketing initiatives.
Fusion helps companies manage operational risk through a strategic approach to business resilience, response and recovery programs. Deep domain expertise, market understanding, customer service and mobile applications give the company a distinct advantage in a marketplace characterized primarily by legacy software and traditional consulting services.
“Our company is experiencing tremendous growth in revenues, customers, employees and facilities. This investment provides us with the resources to continue to capitalize on the growing market awareness of the value and need for state-of-the-art operational risk and business resilience management software,” said David Nolan, CEO and Founder. “In addition to tripling our Chicago office at 2 N. Riverside Plaza to support the rapid expansion of our employee base here, we will be investing heavily to ensure that we continue to lead our markets with world-class service and unmatched innovation. Catalyst, with its long and successful history of investing in enterprise software businesses, is the perfect partner to help us dominate this market.”
“Fusion has built a reputation with its Fortune 500 customers as not only an exceptional risk management platform, but also as one of the tech industry’s top customer service practices,” said Ryan McNally, partner at Catalyst Investors. “The company is a clear leader in its space and is growing rapidly and profitably while gaining market share. The management team consists of world-class industry veterans with impressive track records of delivering enterprise-grade products to the largest corporate customers. We look forward to helping the company continue to gain market share, develop new products and expand internationally.”
The company serves large financial services firms, health care and insurance companies, retailers, and manufacturers, among other industries. Its flagship SaaS solution, the Fusion Framework® System™, is complemented by a suite of offerings that includes the Fusion Enterprise Community™ mobile application for employee safety and security, Fusion Connector Series™ for managed pre-built integrations to enterprise and third party systems, and Fusion Fuel℠ advisory consulting services, which delivers expert guidance and resources to advance clients’ risk management programs. Fusion’s investments in its Fusion Community of customers include launching a comprehensive knowledgebase to complement its customer support services, an active and growing user group program, and Solutions 2017, the first annual three-day customer training event being held in Chicago. The internationally recognized Business Continuity Institute awarded Fusion the Global Award for Continuity and Resilience Provider of the Year in the fall of 2016.
“We have been very impressed with the pace at which Fusion has grown. The company has seen a huge acceleration in virtually every metric since our investment,” said Ben Levin, Founder and Partner at Level Equity. “More and more companies see the necessity of having a hardened enterprise risk management strategy in place and the Fusion Framework allows companies to rapidly address their operational risk so they can manage the unexpected. We welcome Catalyst to the team and look forward to creating the category leader together.”
Vaquero Capital LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Fusion in connection with the transaction.
About Fusion Risk Management, Inc.
Founded in 2006 by an experienced team of industry leaders, Fusion Risk Management is now the most innovative and fastest growing provider of business continuity and risk management solutions. With its introduction in 2010, the Fusion Framework® System™ signaled a paradigm shift in the marketplace for enterprise software addressing Business Continuity, Crisis/Incident Management, IT Disaster Recovery, and Operational Risk Management agendas. Built by experts and delivered via Software as a Service, the Fusion Framework adapts and evolves with your business. For more information, visit www.fusionrm.com.

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.
