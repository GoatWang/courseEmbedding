ATTENTION ADVISORS:
 
The Hartford SMART529 and CHET 529 Savings Plan recently changed transfer agent providers from DST Vision to 529 QuickView.

Please see the “529 QuickView” button at the bottom of this page to gain access to The Hartford SMART529 and CHET 529 Savings Plan accounts. You can also call (888)-823-4348 for assistance.

About Us


































About Us
At Hartford Funds, we think differently about money management. Because as much as fund companies and asset managers would like our business to be all about the numbers, it’s not.

 It’s about much more.

 It’s about investors. It’s about advisors. It’s about relationships, confidence and trust.























That’s why our approach is something we call human-centric investing. Human-centric investing works to understand the relationships between investors, their money and their financial advisors…and then create the products and advisor tools designed to serve those investors and their mindsets.
We believe that human-centric investing can create products and advisor tools that not only strengthen bottom lines, but strengthen advisor-client relationships by helping investors better realize their true life goals.
Hartford Funds has $87.1 billion total assets under management as of March 31, 2017 (excluding assets used in certain annuity products). Our line-up includes more than 55 mutual funds in a variety of styles and asset classes and five strategic beta ETFs and two active ETFs. Our mutual funds (with the exception of certain fund of funds) are primarily sub-advised by Wellington Management Company LLP or Schroder Investment Management North America Inc., two institutional managers with comprehensive global investment capabilities. The strategic beta ETFs offered by Hartford Funds are designed to help address investors' evolving needs by leveraging a distinct risk-optimized approach, which identifies risks within each asset class and then deliberately and systematically re-allocates capital toward risks more likely to enhance return potential.
No matter the asset class or type of fund, Hartford Funds will always strive to meet or exceed traditional industry benchmarks, but through human-centric investing, we intend to also raise the bar on performance, and make it mean more than numbers alone.
Because at Hartford Funds…
 
Our benchmark is the investor.

Class A shares with sales charges performance reflects the maximum 5.5% sales charge, with the following exceptions: Class A shares of Hartford Unconstrained Bond, Hartford Emerging Markets Local Debt, Hartford High Yield, Hartford Inflation Plus, Hartford Municipal Opportunities, Hartford Municipal Real Return, Hartford Strategic Income, Hartford Total Return Bond, Hartford World Bond, Hartford Schroders Emerging Markets Debt and Currency, Hartford Schroders Tax-Aware Bond, Hartford Schroders Emerging Markets Multi-Sector Bond, Hartford Schroders Global Strategic Bond, and Hartford Schroders Income Builder reflect a maximum 4.5% sales charge; Class A shares of Hartford Floating Rate and Hartford Floating Rate High Income reflect a maximum 3.0% sales charge; Class A shares of Hartford Short Duration reflect a maximum 2.0% sales charge.
The performance at NAV does not reflect the impact of sales charges.  If sales charges were reflected the performance shown would have been lower.

Class B shares with sales charges performance reflects a six-year declining Contingent Deferred Sales Charge of 5%, 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 1%, respectively. 

Effective September 30, 2009, Class B shares of Hartford Funds closed to new investors, and no new or additional investments, including investments through a systematic investment plan, will be allowed in Class B shares, except for permitted exchanges. For additional information about your privileges with respect to Class B shares, please refer to your prospectus and its supplements.
Class C shares have no up-front sales charge and a 1% Contingent Deferred Sales Charge for 12 months. 

Class F shares, Class I shares, Class R3 shares, Class R4 shares, and Class R5 shares do not assess a sales charge.
R shares are institutional shares and are only available through employer-sponsored retirement plans and 529 college savings plans. R shares do not have front-end or deferred sales charges. However, distribution and other charges apply.
Please see a prospectus for more information about sales charges.
On 10/24/16, certain Schroder Funds ("Predecessor Funds") were reorganized into the Hartford Schroders Funds, that have substantially the same objectives and strategies as their corresponding Predecessor Fund. Performance prior to 10/24/16 reflects performance of the corresponding Predecessor Fund. If fees and expenses were reflected, performance would have differed. Please see the Fund’s detail page for additional Predecessor Fund performance information.

Distribution Yield at NAV (%) Distribution Yield at NAV is calculated by annualizing the distribution for the current period and dividing by the NAV. The Fund's distribution may be comprised of ordinary income and/or returns of capital. The distribution yield is not indicative of current or future fund performance.
Trailing 12 Month Distribution Yield (%) Trailing 12 Month Distribution Yield is the percentage of income aportfolio returned over the past 12 months.

The SEC Yield (%) is the fund’s 30-Day SEC Yield, which represents the hypothetical net investment income earned by the fund over a 30-day period, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on the fund’s share price at the end of the 30-day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times significantly) from the fund’s actual experience; income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield. Note: The SEC Yield displayed for the Inflation Plus Fund is the yield of the securities within the portfolio adjusted for inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Because of the inflation adjustment, this Fund’s 30-day yield may be more volatile, and differ substantially from one month to the next, than 30-day SEC yields quoted on traditional (nominal) bond investments.
The Unsub SEC Yield (%) is the Fund's Unsubsidized 30-Day SEC yield without the impact of fee/expense waivers.
On 10/24/16, certain Schroder Funds (“Predecessor Funds”) were reorganized into the Hartford Schroders Funds, that have substantially the same objectives and strategies as their corresponding Predecessor Fund. Performance prior to 10/24/16 reflects performance of the corresponding Predecessor Fund. If fees and expenses were reflected, performance would have differed. Please see the Fund’s detail page for additional Predecessor Fund performance information.
