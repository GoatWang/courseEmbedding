CAREERS








“It wasn’t until I purchased my Global microscope that I discovered that I was not seeing my preps as well as I thought I was with my loupes. The illumination offered by the Global microscope, in combination with the different levels of magnification, has allowed me to consistently perform the type of restorative dentistry that I can be proud of”

- Keith Asarkof, DMD - Lexington, MA
