Sullivan Tire & Auto

Sullivan Tire & Auto

Background
Sullivan Tire & Auto Service was founded in 1955 by Bob Sullivan, and despite rapid expansion remains a family owned business to this day.  Now boasting over 1,100 associates across five states, the business consists of over 60 Complete Auto Care Facilities, 14 Commercial Truck Centers and 3 Bandag Retreading manufacturing facilities.  The company operates ten wholesale centers and has over 160,000 square feet of warehouse space and stocks every major tire brand.
Situation
Sullivan Tire & Auto Service had historically used a DOS-based system to manage their business operations.  However, as time went on and the company expanded in size, it became increasingly apparent that this legacy system was no longer suitable for a modern enterprise of its size.  "We had our old DOS system for over 20 years" recalls Joseph Zaccheo, CFO of Sullivan Tire & Auto Service.  "The old system certainly gave us our money's worth, but we knew we needed to upgrade to modern technology.  We wanted to improve the experience for our customers, and the only way to do this was to look for a better solution and make the switch..."
Solution
"We were looking for a modern, state-of-the-art, Windows-based system" said Joe.  "The X and Y generations have grown up on Windows technology and it is easier to train new employees on a Windows based platform; a huge time-saver considering our rapid growth.  As far as functionality was concerned, we needed something that had integrated parts, labor lookup and factory scheduled maintenance data embedded into the system."
Benefits
Upon upgrading to VAST, the improvements to Sullivan Tire & Auto Service were significant and numerous.  “We saw an immediate improvement to our profit margins as a result of VAST’s pricing matrixes”, Joe says. "Also, the declined services feature has helped us increase the trust we have with our customers by keeping track of all services needed to properly maintain their vehicles.  Sales associates simply tag services or items that have been suggested or declined and when the customer returns or calls for an appointment these items can be reviewed and offered on a return visit.
"History lookup in VAST is a breeze; you can drill down to see where a part or tire was purchased and what the cost was, including the PO and vendor invoice number.  Email and fax capabilities have reduced the costs and time involved in delivering work-orders and invoices to customers.  Using the factory maintenance scheduling information when inputting vehicle mileage and the subsequent recommended service printout is quick and informative, and can be easily explained to the customer.  The way in which VAST displays tire images at the counter is also invaluable, especially when you are explaining the attributes to customers and do not have the specific tire in stock."

Challenge
Along with the new business came an unfamiliar software system. Pfau faced challenges with the system and struggled to get the software to do what he wanted it to do. Processing information and tracking down parts was slow and reporting was very limited. Pfau wanted to have data available that could help make his business more profitable, such as analyzing technician efficiency of hours produced versus hours sold. The existing system did not provide the flexibility to dive deeper into data to uncover both problems and opportunities. 
“Being a business owner, I recognize that time and information are very valuable. I wanted to do everything I could to make good business decisions, and that means having data and usable reports readily available,” said Pfau. “If there is a discrepancy, you need to figure out where you are losing money – and on the flip side, have access to information that shows new areas for profitability.
Solution
Find out how Tom Pfau's Meineke Car Care Center used VAST Enterprise Retail to achieve: 

Faster processing of vehicles to get the customers through faster 
An automated decision process that takes the guesswork out for employees and ensuring accurate margins are applied 
Automated parts ordering to give immediate information on availability and the best price on goods 
Less employee time on the phone and internet chasing down parts, giving them more time with customers 
Improved productivity because staff can view supplier parts inventory and place orders in seconds 
Detailed and customizable reports to identify trends and increase sales

Brex Inc

Car-X Tire & Auto franchisee enjoys significant success after upgrade to VAST
Brex Inc is a franchisee of Car-X Tire & Auto, a nationwide auto-care and tire service center. With 19 stores and a corporate office, Brex is the second largest Car-X Tire & Auto franchisee in the country.
Car-X was founded in 1971, primarily as an exhaust specialist, and today it has adapted to provide a wide array of tires and automotive repair services. Its 168 franchise locations provide full scheduled maintenance services including belts, batteries, brake jobs, wheel alignments, exhaust, tires, air conditioner and suspension system work.
Situation
Due to the time demands of a modern auto repair environment, Brex required a more modern, efficient business management solution. "We needed a system that would improve our estimating time and incorporate an electronic parts catalog that would allow to identify the parts, electronically order them and add the required labor" said John Keeley, General Manager & Co-owner of Brex Inc. "Our old system simply wasn't providing that. In addition, the support was limited and software updates always presented a problem."
Solution
The staff at Brex first heard about VAST during a presentation MAM Software gave to the Car-X Tire & Auto dealer council, and in March 2009 it was up and running with MAM Software's cutting edge solution. The benefits to workflow and customer quotes were immediately apparent to John Keeley, "Our ability to generate a timely work order for a customer has made a huge difference in our production. We also have a much better handle now on our cost of goods with VAST."
The customizable nature of the software has also impressed, in this case making previously laborious tasks a breeze. "The maintenance packages that can be customized have been a tremendous help with our oil programs and fluid flushing. In addition, the utilities for sales reporting and inventory & pricing changes have made back office tasks much easier."
"Brex Inc is yet another example of how VAST's modern, feature-rich environment can benefit tire dealers and service centers" said John Fischer, Vice President of Sales & Marketing at MAM Software. "Thanks to a tailored installation Brex has benefited from industry specific maintenance packages, customized to fit the workflow of their business. VAST's extensive stock control features have also allowed the company to enjoy a much clearer overview of its inventory and costs."

An idea is born             Jamf was born from the desire to create a better technology management solution for the hundreds of Macs on the University of Wisconsin — Eau Claire (UWEC) campus. As a student at UWEC, Zach Halmstad, Jamf co-founder, worked full-time in the IT department deploying, updating and tracking over 400 student and faculty Macs. After years of wishing there was a smarter, more efficient way to do his job, he decided to create one himself. As Zach worked, went to class and studied, he coded a solution that revolutionized Apple management and changed the perception of Mac in education and enterprises around the world.           Apple to the core             While Zach was spending time at coffee shops and Eau Claire's famed Joynt writing version one of his Apple management software, Chip Pearson was leading a Minneapolis IT consultancy. As fate would have it, the two kindred spirits collided and – based on their love of the Apple platform – Jamf was born. Founded in 2002, Jamf has a straight-forward mission: Help organizations succeed with Apple.                15   Top 25 Fortune 500 Companies        4K   Plus schools around the globe        20   Top 25 most valuable brands                       Apple device management done right       Today, more than 11,000 global customers rely on Jamf to manage over 8 million Apple devices.
