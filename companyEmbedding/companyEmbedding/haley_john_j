                           This book offers a comprehensive interpretive study of the role of law in contemporary Japan. Haley argues that the weakness
                              of legal controls throughout Japanese history has assured the development and strength of informal community controls based
                              on custom and consensus to maintain order--an order characterized by remarkable stability, with an equally significant degree
                              of autonomy for individuals, communities, and businesses. Haley concludes by showing how Japan's weak legal system has reinforced
                              preexisting patterns of extralegal social control, thus explaining many of the fundamental paradoxes of political and social
                              life in contemporary Japan

                           The Spirit of Japanese Law focuses on the century following the Meiji Constitution, Japan's initial reception of continental
                              European law. While most westerners may view judges as Japanese law's least significant actors, Haley argues that they have
                              the last word because their interpretations of constitution and codes define the authority and powers they and others hold.
                              Based on a "sense of society," the judiciary confirms bonds of village, family, and firm, and "abuse of rights" and "good
                              faith" similarly affirm community. The Spirit of Japanese Law concludes with constitutional cases that help explain the endurance
                              of community in contemporary Japan

                                 as they relate to the practice and study of law in Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea and Southeast Asia. Students and scholars of
                                 Asian law will find this a timely and fascinating read, as will legal practitioners and colleagues of the Asian Law Center."

                              Law's Political Foundations explains the development of the two basic systems of public and private law and their historical
                                 transformations. Examining the historical development of law in China, Japan, Western Europe, and Hispanic America, Haley
                                 argues that law is a product, rather than a constitutive element, of political systems. Four narrative chapters commence with
                                 the development of Chinese legal tradition as a public law order in which regulatory and penal rules were central, compared
                                 to the primacy of private law in Western Europe. China was not only among the earliest but also historically the most enduring
                                 example of public law order. The European Legal Tradition, in contrast, became the source of the private law structures of
                                 legal systems worldwide. The Japanese and Hispanic American experiences are explored as pivotal links that help to identify
                                 foundational factors that underpin the historical development of public and private law orders. Also explained in both contexts
                                 is the endurance of private ordering both within and beyond the law. These vivid comparisons and analyses in these stories
                                 of rivers, rifles, rice, and religion will serve as an excellent critical resource for scholars and academics of comparative
                                 law and legal theory.--Résumé de l'éditeur

                                 detail the institutional structure and processes for the enforcement of antitrust controls as well as the system of remedies
                                 and sanctions available under each statue. it notes the debates in Germany and Japan over the effectiveness of statutes, particularly
                                 the still timely debate in 1970s Germany over a proposal for criminal sanctions
