Microsoft Dynamics NAV Training
Empowering your people to work smarter
Are you fully utilizing Microsoft Dynamics NAV to run your business? As with any complex solution, it takes time and continuing education to take full advantage of all the powerful features that can bring value to your organization.

Find out why ArcherPoint's Dynamics NAV training is different than most. Read the blog, Why ArcherPoint Takes a Customer-Centric Approach to Training, to find out more.

Are you considering choosing Dynamics NAV as your new ERP solution? You’ll want to be sure your employees know how to use it to do their jobs so you get the most value possible out of your investment. An ERP solution must include a thorough training plan, or it is not a complete solution.
Since your Dynamics NAV solution is tailored to meet the way you do business, ArcherPoint offers tailored training along with it, including the specific needs of every role within. Whatever type of training you need, our Microsoft Dynamics NAV experts can sharpen your team’s skills. All ArcherPoint training is conducted by instructors certified in Dynamics NAV, and training is conducted on-site at your company so your staff is trained in a familiar environment, with access to your systems and actual Dynamics NAV solution.
Here is what one happy customer had to say about ArcherPoint training:
“Although I have been working with Dynamics NAV 5.0 on SQL Server for more than three years, I was both surprised and quite impressed with the volume and quality of information presented in this brief four hour training session.  Cory Power from ArcherPoint (a true Dynamics NAV professional with expert teaching skills) did an outstanding job of packing in quite a few critical topics, such as installation, configuration (an in-depth presentation of SQL Server Management Studio), database and security optimization, and the creation and execution of T-SQL scripts – all aimed at ensuring that all those in attendance had a solid understanding about important considerations for the Dynamics NAV SQL environment.  At the conclusion of this one training seminar, I had not only a better understanding of my SQL environment, but also was able to develop a list of areas that required attention and further work to improve overall system performance, saving our company not only time and money, but resulted in helping our end users to do their job more efficiently and effectively.  This training seminar was definitely worth the investment and dovetailed very nicely into the follow-on four hour training session on Security. I am looking forward to attending more sessions in the upcoming 2013 conference.”
-  James Everett Kochheiser, CIO, Otis McAllister, Inc.
If you’re looking for online training, general training, or training materials, there are many resources available in the Dynamics NAV community. Microsoft's CustomerSource is an information-packed, password protected site for Microsoft Dynamics customers. Visit ArcherPoint’s Community page for additional training resources in the Dynamics NAV community, including NAVUG, the Dynamics NAV User Group.

	We are always asking ourselves if there is a better way to do what we do. That is why we started rethinking how ERP projects are implemented and became one of the first in our industry to adopt agile methods.



	We are 100% dedicated to NAV. We believe it is the best ERP product on the market, so we do not support other product lines. This also means that we know NAV. We pride ourselves on working with the product everyday.

Microsoft Dynamics NAV Training
Empowering your people to work smarter
Are you fully utilizing Microsoft Dynamics NAV to run your business? As with any complex solution, it takes time and continuing education to take full advantage of all the powerful features that can bring value to your organization.

Find out why ArcherPoint's Dynamics NAV training is different than most. Read the blog, Why ArcherPoint Takes a Customer-Centric Approach to Training, to find out more.

Are you considering choosing Dynamics NAV as your new ERP solution? You’ll want to be sure your employees know how to use it to do their jobs so you get the most value possible out of your investment. An ERP solution must include a thorough training plan, or it is not a complete solution.
Since your Dynamics NAV solution is tailored to meet the way you do business, ArcherPoint offers tailored training along with it, including the specific needs of every role within. Whatever type of training you need, our Microsoft Dynamics NAV experts can sharpen your team’s skills. All ArcherPoint training is conducted by instructors certified in Dynamics NAV, and training is conducted on-site at your company so your staff is trained in a familiar environment, with access to your systems and actual Dynamics NAV solution.
Here is what one happy customer had to say about ArcherPoint training:
“Although I have been working with Dynamics NAV 5.0 on SQL Server for more than three years, I was both surprised and quite impressed with the volume and quality of information presented in this brief four hour training session.  Cory Power from ArcherPoint (a true Dynamics NAV professional with expert teaching skills) did an outstanding job of packing in quite a few critical topics, such as installation, configuration (an in-depth presentation of SQL Server Management Studio), database and security optimization, and the creation and execution of T-SQL scripts – all aimed at ensuring that all those in attendance had a solid understanding about important considerations for the Dynamics NAV SQL environment.  At the conclusion of this one training seminar, I had not only a better understanding of my SQL environment, but also was able to develop a list of areas that required attention and further work to improve overall system performance, saving our company not only time and money, but resulted in helping our end users to do their job more efficiently and effectively.  This training seminar was definitely worth the investment and dovetailed very nicely into the follow-on four hour training session on Security. I am looking forward to attending more sessions in the upcoming 2013 conference.”
-  James Everett Kochheiser, CIO, Otis McAllister, Inc.
If you’re looking for online training, general training, or training materials, there are many resources available in the Dynamics NAV community. Microsoft's CustomerSource is an information-packed, password protected site for Microsoft Dynamics customers. Visit ArcherPoint’s Community page for additional training resources in the Dynamics NAV community, including NAVUG, the Dynamics NAV User Group.

ArcherPoint ERP Support Services
At ArcherPoint, our goal is to deliver exceptional value by exceeding your needs, and excellent technical support plays a key role.

We offer 24/7 ERP support and a dedicated online portal to make it more convenient to get the support you need, when you need it.
Cost is a major barrier to using support services to their fullest potential, so we’ve structured our Support Center Plans to break down that barrier. Each plan helps eliminate the peaks and valleys associated with ERP support, keeping costs consistent and predictable without compromising quality and breadth of services.
