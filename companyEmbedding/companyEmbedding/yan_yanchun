Why Yan Yanchun Just Disclosed Huge New Efuture Information Technology Inc Stake


07/20/2015  by OctaStaff 
			in SEC 13G & 13D Filings 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Why Yan Yanchun Just Disclosed Huge New Efuture Information Technology Inc Stake and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/why-yan-yanchun-just-disclosed-huge-new-efuture-information-technology-inc-stake/107695/.CaptchaSubmitYan Yanchun New Position in eFuture Information Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:EFUT)
Yan Yanchun has filled a SC 13G/A form regarding Efuture Information Technology Inc  0.0000 0.00 %. Filing Link: 000117184315003902.  Per Yan Yanchun’s filing, the filler now owns 15.5% of the company, holding 744,031 shares.
 eFuture Information Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:EFUT) is a newly disclosed equity position  and the filing was required due to activity on April 20, 2015. This most probably shows Yan Yanchun’s confidence and optimism in the future of the company.
Form 13G is used when the filer owns between 5% and 20% of the company and plans to hold it only as a passive investor. If the filler intend to exert control and if the stake’s size exceeds 20%, then a 13D must be filed. Therefore, activist investors and practices such as: hostile takeovers, company breakups, and other “change of control” events, are not permitted by 13G filers.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREEeg Signal Analysis And Classification: Techniques And Applicationsby Siuly, Siuly/ Li, Yan/ Zhang, YanchunThis book presents advanced methodologies in two areas related to electroencephalogram (EEG) signals: detection of epileptic seizures and identification of mental states in brain computer interface (BCI) systems. The proposed methods enable the extraction of this vital information from EEG signals in order to accurately detect abnormalities revealed by the EEG. New methods will relieve the time-consuming and error-prone practices that are currently in use.  Common signal processing methodologies include wavelet transformation and Fourier transformation, but these methods are not capable of managing the size of EEG data. Addressing the issue, this book examines new EEG signal analysis approaches with a combination of statistical techniques (e.g. random sampling, optimum allocation) and machine learning methods. The developed methods provide better results than the existing methods. The book also offers applications of the developed methodologies that have been tested on several real-time benchmark databases. This book concludes with thoughts on the future of the field and anticipated research challenges. It gives new direction to the field of analysis and classification of EEG signals through these more efficient methodologies. Researchers and experts will benefit from its suggested improvements to the current computer-aided based diagnostic systems for the precise analysis and management of EEG signals.Artificial Intelligence, General, GeneralCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

E-mail: yliu@lbl.gov.AbstractAs more research findings have shown the correlation between ordering in organic semiconductor thin films and device performance, it is becoming more essential to exercise control of the ordering through structural tuning. Many recent studies have focused on the influence of side chain engineering on polymer packing orientation in thin films. However, the impact of the size and conformation of aromatic surfaces on thin film ordering has not been investigated in great detail. Here we introduce a disk-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon building block with a large π surface, namely, thienoazacoronenes (TACs), as a donor monomer for conjugated polymers. A series of medium bandgap conjugated polymers have been synthesized by copolymerizing TAC with electron donating monomers of varying size. The incorporation of the TAC unit in such semiconducting polymers allows a systematic investigation, both experimentally and theoretically, of the relationships between polymer conformation, electronic structure, thin film morphology, and charge transport properties. Field effect transistors based on these polymers have shown good hole mobilities and photoresponses, proving that TAC is a promising building block for high performance optoelectronic materials.Keywords: charge transport; morphology; organic semiconductors; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; thienoazacoronene; time-dependent density functional theory;  Supporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acsami.5b04907.Synthesis and characterization of the precursors and polymers.

		Research AREAS



Conjugated polymers with the processing advantages of 
		polymers have been used for active semiconducting layers in 
		light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic cells, and field-effect transistors. 
		Our principal interest is to understand how specific micro- and 
		nanoscale structures are generated and how these structures in turn 
		affect macroscopic properties and device performance. With improved 
		understanding on these materials, we hope to exploit their 
		structure-property relationships in the development of various 
		applications in advanced technologies. 
1 Morphology Control of Conjugated Polymer Systems: The 
		fundamental understanding of the morphologies in conjugated polymer 
		systems and their use in the fabrication of nanoscale devices is of high 
		technological and scientific interest. Our research is focused on 
    -Long-range order, polymer-packing orientation of conjugated 
		polymer 
    -Phase separation of conjugated polymer blends 
    -Microphase separation of conjugated block copolymers 
2 Solution Processing of Plastic Electronics: Our research is 
		focused on the development of new patterning and fabrication processes 
		that are integratable with current processing
		techniques, such as 
    -Inkjet printing
    -Zone casting
    -Solvent directional evaporation

Research highlights:

1. Crystallization and microphase 
			separation of crystalline block copolymer thin film: The 
			investigation of the relationship and interaction between 
			crystallization and microphase separation plays a key role in 
			realize the modulation of the self-assembly of block copolymer. We 
			carried out three-part work around the crystallization and 
			microphase separation of crystalline block copolymer: (1) 
			Investigated the effects of molecular weight and film thickness on 
			the crystallization and microphase separation by in-situ hot stage 
			atomic force microscope. Molecular weight determined the phase 
			separation strength and molecular migration rate, affect the crystal 
			nucleation and phase separation; Film thickness affected the 
			crystalline rate. Crystals grew very slowly in much thinner film. 
			The incompatibility drove the film evolved into spinodal-like 
			morphology. (2) The competition between single crystal and 
			microphase separation. Realized the transition between 
			crystallization and microphase separation under the effect of 
			solvent vapor selectivity. The gain of free volume of soluble block 
			and the low swelling of crystalline block are key for microphase 
			separation and crystallization, respectively. (3) The 
			crystallization and microphase separation of all-conjugated block 
			copolymer film. Crystallization and microphase separation coexisted 
			during thin film forming process, Through the modulation of the 
			block composition and annealing process, the competition between the 
			microphase separation and crystallization was tuned, leading to 
			observations of confined crystallization and breakout 
			crystallization. 
2. Transfer printing technology based on the differences of 
			interface adhesions and its applications: in order to avoid the 
			flee between optoelectronic devices and the damage of performance of 
			optoelectronic devices in wet micromachining. We developed a 
			transfer printing technology with the interface interaction as the 
			driving force, and realized the patterning of functional polymer 
			film on flexible substrate. It offers a new possibility for the 
			roll-to-roll fabrication of plastic electronic devices.. 
			19 research papers have been published in international journals 
			including Macromolecules, Applied Physics Letters etc, and 4 Chinese 
			Patents.

			Research Interest: Micro-fabrication of Organic Optoelectronic

			Research highlights: Inkjet printing can be the most potential 
			technology for patterning of organic light-emitting displays. Our 
			focus are the key problems of patterning organic light-emitting 
			displays by inkjet printing, such as low patterning resolution, 
			non-uniform thickness of inkjet printed films and aggregation of 
			molecules, which would decrease the light-emitting efficiency 
			dramatically. Some methods and corresponding theories have been 
			explored to resolve these problems. (1) Separators with T-shape 
			cross section and low surface energy were patterned by soft 
			lithography. Assisted by low surface energy separators, the inkjet 
			printing has double patterning resolution. (2) We have posed the 
			idea of adjustment of thickness uniformity combined with 
			microstructure for inkjet printed organic light-emitting films and 
			the establishing design principle of solution systems. Two kinds of 
			solution systems, which can form flow field in the drying solution, 
			such as convection churning and restrained edge flow, were 
			established and used to improve thickness uniformity. Used good 
			solvent combined with accelerated drying to restrain aggregation of 
			molecules from thermodynamics and kinetics, smooth and amorphous 
			organic light-emitting films were inkjet printed. Based on the 
			upward research results, we have established the design principle of 
			solution system which can improve films thickness uniformity 
			cooperate with aggregation restraining. (3) Improvement of films 
			forming property and aggregation restraining for inkjet printed 
			small molecular light-emitting films. Solvent with high viscosity 
			and low volatility was used to restrain dewetting from 
			thermodynamics and kinetics. Uniform and pin-hole free organic small 
			molecule light-emitting films were patterned by inkjet printing and 
			used in the fabrication of electroluminescent devices. By 
			accelerated drying process to decrease the moving time of molecule 
			and restrain aggregation, the light-emitting efficiency has about 
			double increase.
			More than 20 research papers have been published in international 
			journals including Organic ElectronicsŁŹPolymer etc. 6 Chinese 
			patents applicated and 2 patents granted.

Research Interests: Polymer 
			solar cells.
ĄĄ

Research highlights:

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-type polymer 
			solar cells (PSCs) have attracted attention as potential competitors 
			to silicon solar cells for its light weight, low cost, mechanical 
			flexibility, ease of fabrication and processibility to large area. 
			The photoactive layers in BHJ-PSCs consist of a blend of an electron 
			donor conjugated polymer and an electron acceptor fullerene 
			derivative and play a central role in generating photocurrents. Our 
			research is focused on the core problem based on the morphology of 
			conjugated polymer films: 1. The mechanisms for additive to modify 
			the P3HT/PCBM Morphology: The mechanisms for introduction of the 
			additive to improve the P3HT/PCBM organic solar cells performance 
			are investigated. The results reveal that n-dodecylthiol reduces the 
			P3HT chains entanglement in the solution and the influence of PCBM 
			on the P3HT molecular interaction during the film-forming process. 
			2. A Quasi-ordered Bulk Heterojuction of P3HT/PCBM Solar Cells 
			Fabricated by Zone-casting: A quasi-ordered bulk hetertojuction, in 
			which P3HT nanofibers aligned in an oriented manner due to the shear 
			stress and solute concentration gradient, was fabricated by 
			zone-casting. The oriented alignment of nanofibers could facilitate 
			P3HT chains to bridge nanofibers. Furthermore, the bridging chains 
			tended to adopt an untwisted conformation, which result in a reduced 
			energy barrier of hole transfer and better device performance. 3. 
			Mixed-Solvent Vapor Annealing to inhibit intercalated behavior: we 
			inhibited the intercalated behavior and constructed the 
			nanointerpenetrating structure of PCDTBT/PC70BM induced by 
			aggregation of PC70BM via mixed-solvent vapor annealing (M-SVA) 
			(tetrahydrofuran (THF)/carbon disulfide (CS2)). After the M-SVA, the 
			PC70BM molecules having good solubility with THF diffused out of 
			PCDTBT side chains and formed large aggregates, which induced phase 
			separation. Meanwhile, the migration ability of PCDTBT chains was 
			improved due to its good solubility with CS2, which enhanced its 
			self-organization ability and facilitated the formation of 
			nanofibrils. The improved morphology facilitated the charge
