AFTER graduating from Queens College in 2005, Arash Vakil worked as a product manager for a software company. Living on the second floor of his parents’ house in Flushing, Queens, he had few expenses. Over time, his savings grew.So Mr. Vakil bought a one-bedroom condominium in a brand-new building on Purves Street in Hunters Point, a quickly developing area.He did not intend to live there. The condo was much too nice for him, he said. “I don’t need high-end finishes or heated floors in the bathroom. I saw it as an investment opportunity.”

All he needed to be happy at home? “A couch and a high-speed Internet connection,” he said.Mr. Vakil, 28, whose family immigrated from Iran when he was an infant, continued studying for an M.B.A. at Baruch College. When he graduated two years ago, he began hunting for another place. This time, he wanted to buy a small building; he could occupy one unit and rent out the rest.

He didn’t want another condo. Every month, when he paid the common charge, he felt the money was going for some intangible use. As a building owner, he would be able to “actually see where it’s going,” he said. “I have more flexibility with what I want to do with that money.”

Mr. Vakil loved Queens, “the most diverse place on the planet,” he said. But he was in the market for something near Manhattan or an express subway stop, because he was eager to shed his lengthy commute from Flushing, which was a bus ride from the last stop on the 7 train.He wanted an occupied place, too, so he would have rent coming in immediately. His top price was $300,000 per unit.Mr. Vakil, who is now a product manager for a video chat company, set up computer feeds from assorted real-estate sites, checking daily. “I could filter down exactly what I wanted,” he said. Suitable houses, however, were in short supply.He was interested in a Hunters Point house listed for $895,000. But the commercial space on the ground floor was used as two studio apartments. No certificate of occupancy was on file with the Department of Buildings. “I couldn’t spend that time or aggravation” to convert the structure to a legal three-family, Mr. Vakil said.At a three-family on 63rd Street in Woodside, Queens, listed for $869,000, the inspection showed some problems he was unwilling to tackle. The building was co-owned by two parties, one of whom later bought out the other.

His favorite was a lovely four-family house on 71st Street in Elmhurst, listed at $868,000. “It was fully occupied and I knew I was going to have rent from Day 1,” Mr. Vakil said. But negotiations with another buyer were already far along. That house sold for $810,000.

So he took another look at a three-family brick row house he had seen in Astoria on 43rd Street. The owner, who had lived in the middle unit, had died and had left the house to his niece and nephew.Mr. Vakil was glad it was a brick building. “I think they look nicer, I think they stand stronger,” he said. It had a small paved backyard with rose bushes, and the property included a two-car garage, reached by an alley behind the house. The place, near three train stops, was much closer to Manhattan than his parents’ house.At $899,000, however, the house seemed overpriced. The inspector found some leaks. The roof was adequate, but wouldn’t last much longer. The garage, which had termite damage, needed an overhaul.“Those were points of negotiation,” Mr. Vakil sadi, “so I could bring the price down even further.”

Last fall he bought the house for $790,000. Annual taxes are around $5,000. The top-floor tenant was paying $1,200 a month for a two-bedroom with an office. The ground-floor tenants, a couple who had been there for decades, paid $800 a month, garage included.He renovated the middle floor and rented it out for $2,000 — more than he expected. When it came time to renovate the apartments of the tenants on the other two floors, they left willingly, he said. “They knew they had been getting a great deal for many, many years.”He did most of the work, which included plumbing and painting, on the upper floors. He learned a great deal from his father, he said — and more from how-to videos online.“YouTube has been fantastic for showing me how to lay down tiles or even the most efficient way to paint,” he said. “It’s someone who’s going to walk you through it and show you exactly what you are going to be doing. I have friends who are also handy and are more than willing to help me. I am always learning something new, which is cool.”

He rented out the top floor for $2,300 a month — again, more than he expected. The rent includes Wi-Fi, which he set up for his tenants.

For the ground floor, to be his apartment, he brought in a contractor. His 1,000-square-foot two-bedroom is nearing the end of a gut renovation.Last winter, despite the mild weather, “oil costs were astounding,” Mr. Vakil said. The house came with an old and inefficient boiler, “and I couldn’t wait to sign a contract to get that out of the way.” The new heating system uses gas instead, and each unit will have its own thermostat.The renovation is taking longer than he anticipated and, at around $125,000, costing more. He expects to move in sometime next month.His parents keep asking, “Are you sure you want to leave?” he said. “They think I won’t know what to do in the kitchen, but I think I am quite all right there.” His mother worries he won’t eat enough fruit.He did briefly consider renting out the ground floor and staying put in Flushing. “A lot of my friends and older co-workers, they are always trying to give me advice,” he said. “And they always said stay home for as long as you possibly can and save that money.”But he thought about the long Flushing commute and concluded that “this was the right path for me.”With his high-speed Internet in place, he is now in the market for furniture. For that very important couch, “I was thinking something large and L-shaped,” he said, “so that I can have people over and have it as an entertaining space, too.”
