Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value fluctuate so your units, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than quoted.
		









Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value fluctuate so your units, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than quoted.
		









Important Performance Information





Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such subsidies and waivers the series' performance results would be less favorable. All results assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. The performance is as of the date shown; it may not include the series' entire investment portfolio and is subject to change.
		





Initial Class shares have no sales charge.
		





The returns for the series shown do not reflect the deduction of expenses associated with variable products, such as mortality and expense risk charges, separate account charges, and sales charges imposed by insurance company separate accounts. Such expenses would reduce the overall returns shown. Please refer to the variable product's annual report for performance that reflects the deduction of the fees and charges imposed by insurance company separate accounts.
		





 Withdrawals of earnings or other taxable amounts are subject to income tax and, if made prior to age 59 1/2, may be subject to an additional 10% federal tax penalty. Early withdrawals reduce the death benefit.
		





No representation is made, and no assurance can be given, that any investment's results will be comparable to the investment results of any other product with similar investment objectives and policies, including products with the same investment professional or manager. Differences in portfolio size, investments held, contract and portfolio expenses, and other factors can be expected to affect performance.
		





Important Risk Considerations




The series may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in the series.
		





Stock markets and investments in individual stocks  are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions.
		





Please see the prospectus for further information on these and other risk considerations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. Each Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. Each Trust may consist of one or more series and may offer additional series in the future (“Funds”). MFS, a Delaware corporation, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Start Printed Page 62471serves as the investment adviser to each Fund.[1] 

2. Some Funds, including money market Funds that rely on rule 2a-7 under the Act (“Money Market Funds”), may lend money to banks or other entities by entering into repurchase agreements, purchasing other short-term instruments, or, in the case of Funds other than the Money Market Funds, investing in the MFS Institutional Money Market Fund (“IMMF”) pursuant to rule 12d1-1 under the Act. Other Funds may borrow money from the same or similar banks for temporary purposes to satisfy redemption requests, to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls such as a trade “fail” in which cash payment for a security sold by a Fund has been delayed, or for other temporary purposes. Currently, the Trusts have a committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders and uncommitted lines of credit with two separate banks (collectively, the “Loan Agreements”). The Funds also have an overdraft facility with their custodians.
3. If a Fund were to borrow money under a Loan Agreement, the Fund would pay interest on the borrowed cash at a rate which would be higher than the rate that would be earned by other (non-borrowing) Funds on investments in repurchase agreements and other short-term instruments of the same maturity as the bank loan. In addition, while bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails, the borrowing Funds incur commitment fees and/or other charges involved in obtaining a bank loan.
4. Applicants request an order that would permit each Trust to enter into master interfund lending agreements (“Interfund Lending Agreements”) that would permit each Fund to lend and borrow money for temporary purposes directly to and from each other Fund through a credit facility (“Interfund Loan”). Applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would reduce the Funds' borrowing costs and enhance their ability to earn higher interest rates on short-term lendings. Although the proposed credit facility would reduce the Funds' need to borrow from banks, the Funds would be free to establish or renew committed lines of credit or other borrowing arrangements with unaffiliated banks.
5. Applicants anticipate that the credit facility would provide a borrowing Fund with significant savings when the cash position of the Fund is insufficient to meet temporary cash requirements. This situation could arise when redemptions exceed anticipated volumes and certain Funds have insufficient cash on hand to satisfy such redemptions. When a Fund liquidates portfolio securities to meet redemption requests, it often does not receive payment in settlement for up to three days (or longer for certain foreign transactions). The credit facility would provide a source of immediate, short-term liquidity pending settlement of the sale of portfolio securities.
6. Applicants also propose using the credit facility when a sale of securities “fails” due to circumstances such as a delay in the delivery of cash to a Fund's custodian or improper delivery instructions by the broker effecting the transaction. Sales fails may present a cash shortfall if a Fund has undertaken to purchase securities using the proceeds from the securities sold. As a result, the Fund could fail on its intended purchase due to lack of funds from the previous sale, resulting in additional cost to the Fund, or sell a security on a same-day settlement basis, earning a lower return on the investment. Use of the credit facility under these circumstances would enable the Fund to have access to immediate short-term liquidity.
7. While bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails, under the proposed credit facility a borrowing Fund would pay lower interest rates than those offered by banks on short-term loans. In addition, Funds making short-term cash loans directly to other Funds would earn interest at a rate higher than they otherwise could obtain from investing their cash in repurchase agreements. Thus, applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would benefit both borrowing and lending Funds.
8. The interest rate charged to a Fund on any Interfund Loan (“Interfund Loan Rate”) would be the average of the “Repo Rate” and the “Bank Loan Rate,” both as defined below. The Repo Rate on any day would be the highest rate available to a lending Fund from investing in overnight repurchase agreements. The Bank Loan Rate on any day would be calculated by the “Interfund Lending Committee” (as defined below) each day an Interfund Loan is made according to a formula established by each Fund's board of trustees (“Fund Board”) intended to approximate the lowest interest rate at which bank short-term loans would be available to the Funds. The formula would be based upon a publicly available rate (e.g., Federal funds rates and/or Libor), plus an additional spread of basis points and would vary with this rate so as to reflect changing bank loan rates. The initial formula and any subsequent modifications to the formula would be subject to the approval of each Fund Board. Each Fund Board would at least annually review the continuing appropriateness of using the method of calculating the Bank Loan Rate, as well as the relationship between the Bank Loan Rate and current bank loan rates that would be available to the Funds.
9. The credit facility would be administered by investment professionals and administrative personnel from MFS (the “Interfund Lending Committee”). No portfolio manager, including research analysts with portfolio management responsibilities, for any Fund will serve as a member of the Interfund Lending Committee. Under the proposed credit facility, senior members of MFS' investment management team and senior administrative and management personnel (the “Investment Management Committee”) or a portfolio manager for each participating Fund could provide standing instructions to the Interfund Lending Committee that the participating Fund is authorized to participate as a borrower or lender; alternatively, the portfolio manager could provide instructions from time to time as to when the Fund wishes to participate as a borrower or a lender. The Interfund Lending Committee, no more frequently than once daily in the morning of each business day that a transaction is requested under the credit facility pursuant to instructions (an “Interfund Lending Day”), would request and collect data on the uninvested cash and borrowing requirements of all participating Funds from the Funds' custodian. Once it has determined the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand, the Interfund Lending Committee would allocate loans among borrowing Funds without any further communication from a Fund's portfolio managers. Applicants expect there will typically be more available uninvested cash each day than borrowing demand. After the Interfund Lending Committee Start Printed Page 62472has allocated cash for Interfund Loans, MFS' cash desk personnel would invest any remaining cash in accordance with the Funds' investment policies and practices in the ordinary course.
10. The Interfund Lending Committee would allocate borrowing demand and cash available for lending among the Funds on what the Interfund Lending Committee believes to be an equitable basis, subject to certain administrative considerations applicable to all participating Funds, such as the time of filing requests to participate, minimum loan lot sizes, the need to minimize the number of transactions and associated administrative costs, and the amount of the existing borrowings outstanding. To reduce transaction costs, each Interfund Loan normally would be allocated in a manner intended to minimize the number of participants necessary to complete the loan transaction. The method of allocation and related administrative procedures would be approved by each Fund Board, including a majority of trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Fund, as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act (“Independent Fund Board Members”), to ensure that both borrowing and lending Funds participate on an equitable basis.
11. The Interfund Lending Committee would (a) monitor the Interfund Loan Rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the Interfund Loans; (b) limit the borrowings and loans entered into by each Fund to ensure that they comply with the Fund's investment policies and limitations; (c) ensure equitable treatment of each Fund; and (d) directly or through MFS make quarterly reports to each Fund Board concerning any transactions by the Funds under the credit facility and the Interfund Loan Rate charged.
12. MFS, through the Interfund Lending Committee, would administer the credit facility as a fiduciary as part of its duties under the investment management contract with each Fund and provide administrative support pursuant to the administrative services agreement between each Fund and MFS and would receive no additional fee as compensation for its services.
13. No Fund may participate in the credit facility unless: (a) The Fund has obtained shareholder approval for its participation, if such approval is required by law; (b) the Fund has fully disclosed all material information concerning the credit facility in its prospectus and/or statement of additional information (“SAI”); and (c) the Fund's participation in the credit facility is consistent with its investment objectives, limitations and organizational documents.
14. In connection with the credit facility, applicants request an order under (a) section 6(c) of the Act granting relief from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act; (b) section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act granting relief from section 12(d)(1) of the Act; (c) sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting relief from sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Act; and (d) under section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain joint arrangements.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(a)(3) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, from borrowing money or other property from a registered investment company. Section 21(b) of the Act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person if that person controls or is under common control with the company. Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person, in part, to be any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the other person. Applicants state that the Funds may be under common control by virtue of having MFS as their common investment adviser and/or by having a common Fund Board and officers.
2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) provided that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the Act and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangements satisfy these standards for the reasons discussed below.
3. Applicants submit that sections 17(a)(3) and 21(b) of the Act were intended to prevent a party with strong potential adverse interests to, and some influence over the investment decisions of, a registered investment company from causing or inducing the investment company to engage in lending transactions that unfairly inure to the benefit of such party and that are detrimental to the best interests of the investment company and its shareholders. Applicants assert that the proposed credit facility transactions do not raise these concerns because: (a) MFS, through the Interfund Lending Committee, would administer the program as a fiduciary; (b) all Interfund Loans would consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the lending Fund otherwise would invest in short-term repurchase agreements or other short-term instruments; (c) the Interfund Loans would not involve a greater risk than such other investments; (d) the lending Fund would receive interest at a rate higher than it could otherwise obtain through such other investments; and (e) the borrowing Fund would pay interest at a rate lower than otherwise available to it under its bank loan agreements. Moreover, applicants believe that the other terms and conditions in the application would effectively preclude the possibility of any Fund obtaining an undue advantage over any other Fund.
4. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, from selling any securities or other property to the company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act generally makes it unlawful for a registered investment company to purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section.
5. Applicants state that the obligation of a borrowing Fund to repay an Interfund Loan may constitute a security for the purposes of sections 17(a)(1) and 12(d)(1). Applicants also state that any pledge of assets in connection with an Interfund Loan could be construed as a purchase of the borrowing Fund's securities or other property for purposes of section 17(a)(2) of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if and to the extent such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Applicants contend that the standards under sections 6(c), 17(b), and 12(d)(1)(J) are satisfied for all the reasons set forth above in support of their request for relief from sections Start Printed Page 6247317(a)(3) and 21(b) and for the reasons discussed below. Applicants also state that the requested relief from section 17(a)(2) of the Act meets the standards of section 6(c) and 17(b) because any collateral pledged to secure an Interfund Loan would be subject to the same conditions imposed by any other lender to a Fund that imposes conditions on the quality of or access to collateral for a borrowing (if the lender is another Fund) or the same or less restrictive conditions (in any other circumstance). Any collateral pledged to secure an Interfund Loan will be available solely to secure repayment of such Interfund Loan.
6. Applicants state that, among other things, section 12(d)(1) was intended to prevent the pyramiding of investment companies in order to avoid imposing on investors additional and duplicative costs and fees attendant upon multiple layers of investment companies. Applicants submit that the proposed credit facility does not involve these abuses. Applicants note that there will be no duplicative costs or fees to the Funds or shareholders, and that MFS will receive no additional compensation for its services in administering the credit facility through the Interfund Lending Committee. Applicants also note that the entire purpose of the proposed credit facility is to provide economic benefits for all of the participating Funds and their shareholders.
7. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act prohibits open-end investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank; provided, that immediately after the borrowing, there is asset coverage of at least 300 per centum for all borrowings of the company. Under section 18(g) of the Act, the term “senior security” includes any bond, debenture, note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness. Applicants request relief from section 18(f)(1) to the limited extent necessary to implement the credit facility (because the lending Funds are not banks).
8. Applicants believe that granting relief under section 6(c) is appropriate because the Funds would remain subject to the requirement of section 18(f)(1) that all borrowings of a Fund, including combined interfund and bank borrowings, have at least 300% asset coverage. Based on the conditions and safeguards described in the application, applicants also submit that to allow the Funds to borrow from other Funds pursuant to the proposed credit facility is consistent with the purposes and policies of section 18(f)(1).
9. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, when acting as principal, from effecting any joint transactions in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the Commission. Rule 17d-1(b) provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule, the Commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the company's participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
10. Applicants submit that the purpose of section 17(d) is to avoid overreaching by and unfair advantage to investment company insiders. Applicants believe that the credit facility is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act in that it offers both reduced borrowing costs and enhanced returns on loaned funds to all participating Funds and their shareholders. Applicants note that each Fund would have an equal opportunity to borrow and lend on equal terms consistent with its investment policies and fundamental investment limitations. Applicants therefore believe that each Fund's participation in the credit facility will be on terms that are no different from or less advantageous than that of other participating Funds.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The Interfund Loan Rate will be the average of the Repo Rate and the Bank Loan Rate.
2. On each business day that the Interfund Lending Committee considers whether to use Interfund Loans, the Interfund Lending Committee will compare the Bank Loan Rate with the Repo Rate and will make cash available for Interfund Loans only if the Interfund Loan Rate is: (a) More favorable to the lending Fund than the Repo Rate and, if applicable, the yield of any money market fund approved by the Investment Management Committee as a money market fund in which the lending Fund could otherwise invest; and (b) more favorable to the borrowing Fund than the Bank Loan Rate.
3. If a Fund has outstanding borrowings, any Interfund Loans to the Fund: (a) Will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan; (b) will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral; (c) will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days); and (d) will provide that, if an event of default by the Fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the Fund, that event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under the Interfund Lending Agreement entitling the lending Fund to call the Interfund Loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral) and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing Fund.
4. A Fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the proposed credit facility if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total 10% or less of its total assets, provided that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another Fund, the Fund's interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral. If a Fund's total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than 10% of its total assets, the Fund may borrow through the proposed credit facility only on a secured basis. A Fund may not borrow through the proposed credit facility or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after such borrowing would be more than 331/3% of its total assets.
5. Before any Fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may, through additional borrowings, cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund must first secure each outstanding Interfund Loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan. If the total outstanding borrowings of a Fund with outstanding Interfund Loans exceed 10% of its total assets for any other reason (such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions), the Fund will within one business day thereafter: (a) Repay all its outstanding Interfund Loans; (b) reduce its outstanding indebtedness to 10% or less of its total assets; or (c) secure each outstanding Interfund Loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a Start Printed Page 62474market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, at which time the collateral called for by this condition 5 shall no longer be required. Until each Interfund Loan that is outstanding at any time that a Fund's total outstanding borrowings exceeds 10% is repaid or the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding Interfund Loan at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the Interfund Loan.
6. No Fund may lend to another Fund through the proposed credit facility if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the proposed credit facility to exceed 15% of the lending Fund's current net assets at the time of the loan.
7. A Fund's Interfund Loans to any one Fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending Fund's net assets.
8. The duration of Interfund Loans will be limited to no more than the number of days required to receive payment for securities sold, up to a maximum of seven days. Loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition.
9. The Fund's borrowings through the proposed credit facility, as measured on the day when the most recent loan was made, will not exceed the greater of 125% of the Fund's total net cash redemptions or 102% of sales fails for the preceding seven calendar days.
10. Each Interfund Loan may be called on one business day's notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing Fund.
11. A Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents.
12. The Interfund Lending Committee, on each Interfund Lending Day, will calculate total Fund borrowing and lending demand through the proposed credit facility, and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the Funds, without the intervention of any portfolio manager of participating Funds. The Interfund Lending Committee will not solicit cash for loans from any Fund or prospectively publish or disseminate the amount of current borrowing demand to the Investment Management Committee or portfolio managers of the Funds. Once it determines the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand, the Interfund Lending Committee will allocate loans among borrowing Funds without any further communication from a Fund's portfolio managers. If there is more available uninvested cash than borrowing demand on any Interfund Lending Day, any remaining cash will be invested in accordance with the Funds' investment policies and practices in the ordinary course.
13. The Interfund Lending Committee will monitor the Interfund Loan Rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the Interfund Loans and will make a quarterly report to each Fund Board concerning the participation of the Funds in the proposed credit facility and the terms and other conditions of any extensions of credit under the credit facility.
14. Each Fund Board, including a majority of the Independent Fund Board Members, will:
(a) Review, no less frequently than quarterly, each Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility during the preceding quarter for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions;
(b) Review at least annually the continuing appropriateness of the method used to calculate the Bank Loan Rate; and
(c) Review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of each Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility.
15. In the event an Interfund Loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the lending Fund makes a demand for payment under the provisions of the Interfund Lending Agreement, MFS will promptly refer such loan for arbitration to an independent arbitrator who was selected by each Fund Board involved in the loan who will serve as arbitrator of disputes concerning Interfund Loans.[2] 
           The arbitrator will resolve any dispute promptly, and the arbitrator's decision will be binding on both Funds. The arbitrator will submit, at least annually, a written report to each Fund Board setting forth a description of the nature of any dispute and the actions taken by the Funds to resolve the dispute.
16. Each Fund will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction by it under the proposed credit facility occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, written records of all such transactions setting forth a description of the terms of the transactions, including the amount, the maturity and the Interfund Loan Rate, the rate of interest available at the time on overnight repurchase agreements and commercial bank borrowings, and such other information presented to the Fund Board in connection with the review required by conditions 13 and 14.
17. MFS, through or on behalf of the Interfund Lending Committee, will prepare and submit to the Fund Board for review an initial report describing how the proposed credit facility will operate and the procedures to be implemented to ensure that all Funds are treated fairly. For each calendar quarter after the commencement of the credit facility, the Interfund Lending Committee will report on the operations of the credit facility at the Fund Board's quarterly meetings.
Each Fund's chief compliance officer (“CCO”), as defined in rule 38a-1(4) under the Act, shall prepare an annual report for its Fund Board each year that the Fund participates in the proposed credit facility, that evaluates the Fund's compliance with the terms and conditions of the application and the procedures established to achieve such compliance. Each Fund's CCO will also annually file a certification pursuant to Item 77Q3 of Form N-SAR as such Form may be revised, amended, or superseded from time to time for each year that the Fund participates in the proposed credit facility, that certifies that the Fund and MFS have established procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the terms and conditions of the order. In particular, such certification will address procedures designed to achieve the following objectives:
(a) That the Interfund Loan Rate is higher than the Repo Rate, but lower than the Bank Loan Rate;
(b) Compliance with the collateral requirements as set forth in the Interfund Loan Borrowing Conditions;
(c) Compliance with the percentage limitations on interfund borrowing and lending;
(d) Allocation of interfund borrowing and lending demand in an equitable manner and in accordance with procedures established by the Fund Board; and
(e) That the interest rate on any Interfund Loan does not exceed the interest rate on any third-party borrowings of a borrowing Fund at the time of the Interfund Loan. Start Printed Page 62475Additionally, each Fund's independent auditors, in connection with their audit examinations of the Fund, will review the operation of the credit facility for compliance with the Interfund Loan Borrowing Conditions and their review will form the basis, in part, of the auditor's report on internal accounting controls in Form N-SAR.
18. No Fund will participate in the proposed credit facility upon receipt of requisite regulatory approval unless it has fully disclosed in its prospectus and/or SAI all material facts about its intended participation.

LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN 

[Photo of Jeffrey L. Shames]

Dear Shareholders,                                                              

In 1999, MFS celebrates its 75th anniversary. The nation's first mutual fund    
-- our Massachusetts Investors Trust (MIT) -- was introduced to the public on   
March 21, 1924. Since then, MFS Investment Management(R), the company that grew 
out of that original fund, has helped guide shareholders through many economic  
and investment cycles, primarily by focusing on the long-term opportunities     
created by an expanding global economy. As of November 30, 1998, MFS manages    
over $90 billion, and the firm's 2,000 people serve 3.9 million investors and   
their financial advisers worldwide. Meanwhile, MIT's assets have grown to over  
$10 billion, and 56 mutual funds are offered in the MFS Family of Funds(R).     

One of the elements in the success of MIT did not exist before our founders     
invented it in 1924. That is daily redemption. This innovation means that if you
want to sell your investment in any MFS mutual fund, you have the security of   
knowing that you may do so immediately by exchanging into another MFS fund. Or, 
if you need your money for other purposes, it can quickly be wired or mailed to 
you. This daily redemption feature, through which new shares were created when  
people invested in MIT and were redeemed when people sold, brought another      
important change to the industry. Now, the price of a mutual fund's shares      
wasn't determined by supply and demand, but by the value of the securities owned
by each portfolio.                                                              

Another factor in our growth was the development of one of the industry's       
first in-house research departments in 1932. Unlike companies that rely on      
Wall Street research reports, which can be used by many investors at the same   
time, MIT's managers built its long-term track record by visiting companies,    
talking to managers and competitors, and "kicking the tires" so they could      
judge the quality and potential of each company's products and services for     
themselves. Today, MFS has more than 100 full-time portfolio managers, stock    
analysts, and credit analysts who track the equity and bond markets. That       
number includes over 35 equity analysts who specialize in industries such as    
aviation, media, technology, automobiles, and utilities.                        

While MIT introduced liquidity, that was not our only invention. We also        
established the nation's first global bond fund, first high-yield municipal     
bond fund, and first high-yield municipal closed-end bond fund.                 

We are proud of the record of MIT and of the funds in the MFS Family of Funds,  
but we are also proud of our long-standing relationship with financial          
advisers. Not only do we believe investors can benefit from the advice of       
these experts but, as was shown during the market volatility of 1998, people    
who work with financial advisers are less likely to abandon their carefully     
designed, long-term investment strategies.                                      

Our ability to service your investment and information needs is also extremely  
important to us. The MFS Service Center handles millions of transactions and    
phone calls every year. Supporting the work of financial advisers, promptly     
sending out statements and confirmations, and answering hundreds of investors'  
questions every day are crucial elements in maintaining long-term relationships 
with our fund shareholders. That link to our investors has also been enhanced by
our site on the World Wide Web: WWW.MFS.COM. Since 1996, this site has given    
investors and the general public access to up-to- date information about MFS    
products and services, as well as market outlooks and retirement information.   
The site has rapidly become one of our primary vehicles for communicating with  
our investors and educating the public about mutual funds in general and MFS in 
particular.                                                                     

If there is a common thread running through these milestones, it is our         
always-increasing commitment to providing you with the best possible            
investment management and shareholder service, just as we have done for the     
past 75 years.                                                                  

As we celebrate this anniversary, it is also a time for MFS to look ahead and   
build on our 75 years of innovation and experience to help meet your            
investment needs in the next century. We appreciate your confidence and         
welcome any questions or comments you may have.                                 

Respectfully,

MANAGEMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK 

[Photo of Stephen Pesek]

For the 12 months ended November 30, 1998, Class A shares of the Fund provided  
a total return of 20.89%, Class B shares 20.08%, and Class I shares 21.37%.     
These returns include the reinvestment of distributions but exclude the         
effects of any sales charges and compare to a 23.52% return for the Standard &  
Poor's 500 Composite Index (the S&P 500), a popular, unmanaged index of common  
stock total return performance.                                                 

Q. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS THAT AFFECTED THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE THIS   
YEAR?                                                                     

A. Some of the core positions in the health care industry helped. Also,         
several technology companies, particularly the ones creating software, did
 well. Both of these industries, in fact, held up relatively well during the
market turmoil that began in mid-July.                                    

Q. COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY?                            

A. Primarily, we seek good businesses that exhibit some kind of sustainable     
competitive advantage. This can include a strong market share, low        
production costs, research and development strength, distribution         
expertise, and good customer service. Besides this, we seek companies     
benefiting from mismatches in supply and demand, in health care, for      
example, a sector which is being driven by the natural aging of the       
population. As people get older, their drug use goes up, and with managed 
care it's easier and cheaper to get pharmaceuticals, which means doctors  
write more prescriptions. All this benefits pharmaceutical companies such 
 as Schering Plough, Pfizer, and Elan, drug stores such as Rite Aid and CVS,
and distributors such as McKesson.                                        

Q. HOWEVER, THE FUND'S LARGEST SECTOR IS TECHNOLOGY. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT  
FOR A MINUTE?                                                             

A. As I mentioned earlier, this sector is mainly made up of software companies  
such as Microsoft and Compuware. These are fast-growing companies with    
recurring revenues, high margins, and the ability to generate free cash   
 flow. They are also benefiting from a fundamental shift of labor capital in
corporate America, that is, cost cutting. Another sector benefiting from  
technology as well as from firms' trend to outsource business is service  
companies such as Ceridian Corp., a payroll processor, and Computer       
Sciences, a computer services and consulting company.                     

Q. DID YOU MAKE ANY NOTABLE CHANGES IN THE PORTFOLIO DURING THE MARKET DOWNTURN 
THAT BEGAN IN JULY?                                                       

A. The most notable thing we did was to increase the technology weighting.      
These companies performed relatively well during the volatility and even  
 better after the Federal Reserve Board's interest-rate cuts. Also, economic
trends in Asia started to bottom, and technology companies benefited from 
that. The second thing we did was to increase our financial services      
holdings, including our weighting in the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.,
or Freddie Mac. Here, we believe favorable credit spreads and a strong    
housing market should sustain a favorable operating environment. We also  
increased our weighting in Associates First Capital, a spinoff of the Ford
 Motor Co. It's had a great 20-year track record of consistent, high-quality
 earnings growth. Over 70% of the company's business is in consumer finance,
and because a lot of the smaller consumer finance companies went out of   
business, it picked up a lot of that business. Finally, Morgan Stanley    
became a big position. A lot of investment companies went through turmoil,
but market shares of a few of the blue-chip companies such as Morgan      
Stanley increased dramatically. These companies were conservative and     
weren't making a lot of speculative loans. In an environment in which the 
underwriting business in investment banking almost went to zero, there was
a huge flight to quality, so Morgan and a few of the other leading firms  
 got the lion's share of initial public offerings. Going forward, we believe
these companies should also benefit from lower interest rates.            

Q. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT ANY STOCKS THAT HAVE PERFORMED BETTER THAN EXPECTED?    

A. One of the best has been Tyco. The company has made a couple of very         
creative acquisitions. It bought ADT, the security systems company, and it
bought AT&T's undersea cable business. A lot of companies are laying      
 fiberoptic cables under the ocean to increase capacity for the Internet and
other communications, and Tyco is getting good growth from that business. 
 Another surprise was WorldCom, which bought MCI Communications and seems to
 be absorbing it very well. The stock has doubled this year for two reasons.
First, it is a low-cost provider of telecommunications services, including
Internet service, and, second, it is big in data communications. These are
the two fastest-growing sectors of the communications business.           

Q. AND WHAT ABOUT STOCKS THAT HAVE NOT PERFORMED AS WELL AS YOU WOULD HAVE      
WISHED?                                                                   

A. Disappointments included Cendant, which came about from a merger between     
HFS and CUC International. Subsequently, it was found that accounting     
practices in one division of CUC were fraudulent. Although the stock has  
recovered somewhat since this discovery, the price plunged more than 50%  
when the fraud was revealed. Another disappointment was HealthSouth, a    
company that experienced pricing pressure from its managed care companies.

Q. LOOKING AHEAD, WHAT KIND OF MARKET OR ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT DO YOU EXPECT, AND
HOW MIGHT THIS AFFECT SOME OF YOUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS FOR THE FUND?     

A. I think we have to assume a slowing domestic economy and a slowdown in       
corporate profits in the first half of 1999. Although I don't think we're 
going to go into a recession and that we'll probably see a bottoming next 
year, we want to focus on companies that we think have the ability to     
sustain earnings growth and to produce defensible earnings streams. This  
includes companies in industries like health care and technology,         
particularly the software companies, and some business services companies.

Q. FINALLY, AS YOU KNOW, 1999 MARKS THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF MASSACHUSETTS       
INVESTORS TRUST (MIT), THE FIRST MFS FUND AND, IN FACT, THE FIRST MUTUAL  
FUND. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS FUND FITTING INTO THE MIT/MFS TRADITION?        

A. I would just say that, like MIT, all of the ideas for this Fund are          
completely driven by the bottom-up, fundamental analysis of our research  
staff. Research was the primary tool for MIT 75 years ago, and it still is
today for all of our funds. This means talking to companies, understanding
their industries, and keeping track of the competition.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY                                                    

Class A share  ("A") SEC results include the maximum 5.75% sales charge. Class  
B share ("B") SEC results reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales      
charge (CDSC), which declines over six years from 4% to 0%. Class I shares      
("I") have no sales charge or Rule 12b-1 fees and are only available to         
certain institutional investors.                                                

A results include the performance and the operating expenses (e.g., Rule 12b-1  
fees) of B for periods prior to the inception of A. Because operating expenses  
of B are greater than those of A, A performance generally would have been       
higher than B performance. The B performance included within the A SEC          
performance has been adjusted to reflect the maximum initial sales charge       
generally applicable to A rather than the CDSC generally applicable to B.       

I results include the performance  and the operating expenses (e.g., Rule       
12b-1 fees) of B for periods prior to the inception of I. Because operating     
expenses of B are greater than those of I, I performance generally would have   
been higher than B performance. The B performance included in the               
I performance has been adjusted to reflect the fact that I have no CDSC.        

Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers,       
without which the results would have been less favorable. Subsidies and         
waivers may be rescinded at any time. See the prospectus for details.           
All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and         
capital gains.                                                                  

INVESTMENT RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE, AND SHARES, WHEN          
REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST. PAST PERFORMANCE  
IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(1) Business and Organization                                                   
MFS Large Cap Growth Fund (the Fund) is a diversified series of MFS Series      
Trust II (the Trust). The Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust  
and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as an   
open-end management investment company.                                         

(2) Significant Accounting Policies                                             
General - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally  
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and        
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and      
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial    
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the         
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.             
Investments in foreign securities are vulnerable to the effects of changes in   
the relative values of the local currency and the U.S. dollar and to the        
effects of changes in each country's legal, political, and economic             
environment.                                                                    

Investment Valuations - Equity securities listed on securities exchanges or     
reported through the NASDAQ system are reported at market value using last sale 
prices. Unlisted equity securities or listed equity securities for which last   
sale prices are not available are reported at market value using last quoted bid
prices. Debt securities (other than short-term obligations which mature in 60   
days or less), including listed issues, forward contracts, and swap agreements, 
are valued on the basis of valuations furnished by dealers or by a pricing      
service with consideration to factors such as institutional-size trading in     
similar groups of securities, yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of    
issue, trading characteristics, and other market data, without exclusive        
reliance upon exchange or over-the-counter prices. Short- term obligations,     
which mature in 60 days or less, are valued at amortized cost, which            
approximates market value. Securities for which there are no such quotations or 
valuations are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or at the    
direction of the Trustees.                                                      

Foreign Currency Translation - Investment valuations, other assets, and         
liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies are converted each        
business day into U.S. dollars based upon current exchange rates. Purchases     
and sales of foreign investments, income, and expenses are converted into U.S.  
dollars based upon currency exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates   
of such transactions. Gains and losses attributable to foreign currency         
exchange rates on sales of securities are recorded for financial statement      
purposes as net realized gains and losses on investments. Gains and losses      
attributable to foreign exchange rate movements on income and expenses are      
recorded for financial statement purposes as foreign currency transaction       
gains and losses. That portion of both realized and unrealized gains and        
losses on investments that results from fluctuations in foreign currency        
exchange rates is not separately disclosed.                                     

Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts - The Fund may enter into forward   
foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a specific      
foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date. Risks may arise upon        
entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to 
meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value 
of a foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The Fund may enter into      
forward contracts for hedging purposes as well as for non-hedging purposes. For 
hedging purposes, the Fund may enter into contracts to deliver or receive       
foreign currency it will receive from or require for its normal investment      
activities. The Fund may also use contracts in a manner intended to protect     
foreign-currency-denominated securities from declines in value due to           
unfavorable exchange rate movements. For non-hedging purposes, the Fund may     
enter into contracts with the intent of changing the relative exposure of the   
Fund's portfolio of securities to different currencies to take advantage of     
anticipated changes. The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are        
adjusted by the daily exchange rate of the underlying currency and any gains or 
losses are recorded as unrealized until the contract settlement date. On        
contract settlement date, the gains or losses are recorded as realized gains or 
losses on foreign currency transactions.                                        

Investment Transactions and Income - Investment transactions are recorded on    
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All discount  
is accreted for financial statement and tax reporting purposes as required by   
federal income tax regulations. Dividends received in cash are recorded on the  
ex-dividend date. Dividend payments received in additional securities are       
recorded on the ex-dividend date in an amount equal to the value of the         
security on such date.                                                          

Fees Paid Indirectly - The Fund's custody fee is calculated as a percentage of  
the Fund's month end net assets. The fee is reduced according to an             
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by     
the Fund. This amount is shown as a reduction of expenses on the Statement of   
Operations.                                                                     

Tax Matters and Distributions - The Fund's policy is to comply with the         
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated      
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its taxable       
income, including any net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no         
provision for federal income or excise tax is provided. The Fund files a tax    
return annually using tax accounting methods required under provisions of the   
Code, which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles, the       
basis on which these financial statements are prepared. Accordingly, the        
amount of net investment income and net realized gain reported on these         
financial statements may differ from that reported on the Fund's tax return     
and, consequently, the character of distributions to shareholders reported in   
the financial highlights may differ from that reported to shareholders on       
Form 1099-DIV.                                                                  

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The Fund    
distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting    
basis and requires that only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and  
profits are reported in the financial statements as a tax return of capital.    
Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the          
financial statements and tax earnings and profits, which result in temporary    
over-distributions for financial statement purposes, are classified as          
distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains. During  
the year ended November 30, 1998, accumulated net investment loss was           
decreased by $5,559,144, accumulated undistributed net realized gain on         
investments was decreased by $12,858,982 and paid-in capital was increased by   
$7,299,838 due to differences between book and tax accounting for currency      
transactions and the offset of net investment loss against short term capital   
gains. This change had no effect on the net assets or net asset value per       
share. At November 30, 1998, accumulated net realized gain on investments and   
foreign currency transactions under book accounting were different from tax     
accounting due to temporary differences in accounting for losses on wash sale   
transactions.                                                                   

Multiple Classes of Shares of Beneficial Interest - The Fund offers multiple    
classes of shares, which differ in their respective distribution and service    
fees. All shareholders bear the common expenses of the Fund based on average    
daily net assets of each class, without distinction between share classes.      
Dividends are declared separately for each class. No class has preferential     
dividend rights; differences in per share dividend rates are generally due to   
differences in separate class expenses. Class B shares will convert to Class A  
shares approximately eight years after purchase.                                

(3) Transactions with Affiliates                                                
Investment Adviser - The Fund has an investment advisory agreement with         
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment    
advisory and administrative services, and general office facilities. The        
management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at an annual rate of 0.75%    
of the Fund's average daily net assets.                                         

The Fund pays no compensation directly to its Trustees who are officers of the  
investment adviser, or to officers of the Fund, all of whom receive remuneration
for their services to the Fund from MFS. Certain officers and Trustees of the   
Fund are officers or directors of MFS, MFS Fund Distributors, Inc. (MFD), and   
MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC). The Fund has an unfunded defined benefit plan  
for all of its independent Trustees and Mr. Bailey. Included in Trustees'       
compensation is a net periodic pension expense of $11,096 for the year ended    
November 30, 1998.                                                              

Administrator - The Fund has an administrative services agreement with MFS to   
provide the Fund with certain financial, legal, shareholder servicing,          
compliance, and other administrative services. As a partial reimbursement for   
the cost of providing these services, the Fund pays MFS an administrative fee   
at the following annual percentages of the Fund's average daily net assets:     

First $1 billion                                             0.0150%
Next $1 billion                                              0.0125%
Next $1 billion                                              0.0100%
In excess of $3 billion                                      0.0000%

Distributor - MFD, a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS, as distributor, received   
$60,643 for the year ended November 30, 1998, as its portion of the sales       
charge on sales of Class A shares of the Fund.                                  

The Trustees have adopted a distribution plan for Class A and Class B shares    
pursuant to Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as follows:        

The Fund's distribution plan provides that the Fund will pay MFD up to 0.35%    
per annum of its average daily net assets attributable to Class A shares in     
order that MFD may pay expenses on behalf of the Fund related to the            
distribution and servicing of its shares. These expenses include a service fee  
paid to each securities dealer that enters into a sales agreement with MFD of   
up to 0.25% per annum of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to    
Class A shares which are attributable to that securities dealer and a           
distribution fee to MFD of up to 0.10% per annum of the Fund's average daily    
net assets attributable to Class A shares. Payment of the 0.10% per annum       
Class A distribution fee will be implemented on such date as the Trustees of    
the Trust may determine. MFD retains the service fee for accounts not           
attributable to a securities dealer, which amounted to $93,638 for the year     
ended November 30, 1998. Fees incurred under the distribution plan during the   
year ended November 30, 1998, were 0.25% of average daily net assets            
attributable to Class A shares on an annualized basis.                          

The Fund's distribution plan provides that the Fund will pay MFD a              
distribution fee of 0.75% per annum, and a service fee of up to 0.25% per       
annum, of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Class B shares.   
MFD will pay to securities dealers that enter into a sales agreement with MFD   
all or a portion of the service fee attributable to Class B shares. The         
service fee is intended to be consideration for services rendered by the        
dealer with respect to Class B shares. MFD retains the service fee for          
accounts not attributable to a securities dealer, which amounted to $82,394     
for Class B shares, for the year ended November 30, 1998. Fees incurred under   
the distribution plan during the year ended November 30, 1998, were 1.00% of    
average daily net assets attributable to Class B shares on an annualized        
basis.                                                                          

Certain Class A are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge in the event  
of a shareholder redemption within 12 months following purchase. A contingent   
deferred sales charge is imposed on shareholder redemption's of Class B shares  
in the event of a shareholder redemption within six years of purchase. MFD      
receives all contingent deferred sales charges. Contingent deferred sales       
charges imposed during the year ended November 30, 1998, were $950 and          
$259,850 for Class A and Class B shares, respectively.                          

Shareholder Servicing Agent - MFSC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS, earns a   
fee for its services as shareholder servicing agent. The fee is calculated as   
a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets at an effective annual      
rate of 0.1125%. Prior to January 1, 1998, the fee was calculated as a          
percentage of the average Fund's daily net assets at an effective annual rate   
of 0.13%.                                                                       

(4) Portfolio Securities                                                        
Purchases and sales of investments, other than purchased option transactions    
and short-term obligations, were as follows:

(6) Line of Credit                                                              
The Fund and other affiliated funds participate in an $805 million unsecured    
line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a line of credit        
agreement. Borrowings may be made to temporarily finance the repurchase of      
Fund shares. Interest is charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, at a    
rate equal to the bank's base rate. In addition, a commitment fee, based on     
the average daily unused portion of the line of credit, is allocated among the  
participating funds at the end of each quarter. The commitment fee allocated    
to the Fund for the year ended November 30, 1998, was $5,174.                   

(7) Financial Instruments                                                       
The Fund trades financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the        
normal course of its investing activities in order to manage exposure to        
market risks such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These  
financial instruments include forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The  
notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment   
the Fund has in particular classes of financial instruments and does not        
necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement  
of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all      
related and offsetting transactions are considered.                             

Forward foreign currency purchases and sales under master netting agreements    
amounted to a net receivable of $118,247 with First Boston Corp. at             
November 30, 1998.                                                              

At November 30, 1998, the Fund had sufficient cash and/or securities to cover   
any commitments under these contracts.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT 

To the Trustees of MFS Series Trust II and Shareholders of MFS Large Cap        
Growth Fund:                                                                    

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities,          
including the portfolio of investments, of MFS Large Cap Growth Fund (one of    
the series constituting MFS Series Trust II) as of November 30, 1998, the       
related statements of operations for the year then ended, the statement of      
changes in net assets for the years ended November 30, 1998 and 1997, and the   
financial highlights for each of the years in the five-year period ended        
November 30, 1998. These financial statements and financial highlights are the  
responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an    
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our     
audits.                                                                         

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to        
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and          
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes       
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included      
confirmation of securities owned as of November 30, 1998, by correspondence     
with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not received from brokers,   
we performed other auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the    
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as     
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe     
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                     

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights present      
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MFS Large Cap       
Growth Fund at November 30, 1998, and the results of its operations, the
