CONFORMIS INC - S-1/A - 20150611 - STOCKHOLDERS













	PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS






	        The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of April 30, 2015
	by:






	




	each person, or group of affiliated persons, who is known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock;








	




	each of our named executive officers;








	




	each of our directors; and








	




	all of our directors and executive officers as a group.






	        Beneficial
	ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole
	or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities and include shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants that are immediately exercisable
	or exercisable within 60 days after April 30, 2015. Except as otherwise indicated, all of the shares reflected in the table are shares of common stock and all persons listed below have
	sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws, where applicable. The information is not necessarily indicative of
	beneficial ownership for any other purpose.




	        The
	number of shares beneficially owned in the following table assumes the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into shares of common stock upon closing
	of this offering. The percentage ownership calculations for beneficial ownership prior to this offering are based on 59,677,247 shares outstanding as of April 30, 2015, assuming the
	automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into shares of common stock upon closing of this offering. Percentage ownership calculations for beneficial ownership after this
	offering also include the shares we are offering hereby. Except as otherwise indicated in the table below, addresses of named beneficial owners are in care of ConforMIS, Inc., 28 Crosby Drive,
	Bedford, Massachusetts 01730.




	        In
	computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares of common stock subject to
	options or warrants held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days after April 30, 2015. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the
	purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.
