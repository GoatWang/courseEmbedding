					Full Description



Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc., incorporated on September 16, 1998, is the holding company for Southern Bank (the Bank). The principal business of the Bank consists primarily of attracting retail deposits from the public and using such deposits along with wholesale funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (FHLB), and brokered deposits. The Bank attracts deposits to invest in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate, commercial non-mortgage business loans and consumer loans. These funds are also used to purchase mortgage-backed and related securities (MBS), the United States Government Agency obligations, municipal bonds and other permissible investments. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had total assets of $1.4 billion and stockholders' equity of $126 million.
