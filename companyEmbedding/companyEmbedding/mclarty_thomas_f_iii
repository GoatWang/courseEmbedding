Early life[edit]
McLarty was born in Hope, Arkansas, and graduated from the University of Arkansas in 1969. He is a member of Sigma Chi Fraternity. He worked through the ranks of Hope Auto Company, the business founded by his grandfather, Thomas F. "Mr. Tom" McLarty. After serving a term in the Arkansas House of Representatives, he concentrated his efforts on growing the family's truck leasing business, first called M&M Leasing, later to become McLarty Leasing. He expanded the family's Arkansas dealership network to locations in Hope, Texarkana, Magnolia, and Little Rock. He was urged in many Democratic Party circles to seek the governor's chair vacated by David Pryor in 1978, but he deferred to his friend and fellow Hope native, Bill Clinton. He was elected to the state legislature at the age of 24, serving a single term from 1971–1973 and served as chairman of the state Democratic Party, from 1974–1976."[1]
In 1976, he became the youngest member ever elected to the board of directors of the Arkla Gas/Arkla, Inc., a Fortune 500 natural gas company. In 1983 he became Arkla's chairman and chief executive officer. During his tenure, the company was recognized by Forbes, The Wall Street Transcript, and The Financial Times for management excellence, in addition to his automotive endeavors.[2]
He has a distinguished record of business leadership and public service, including various roles advising three presidents: Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
White House years[edit]
He served as White House chief of staff to Bill Clinton, from 1993 until 1994. In 1994, the president asked his OMB director, Leon Panetta, what was wrong with his administration and was told about the lack of order in the White House. McLarty was out. According to author Nigel Hamilton, "Panetta replaced McLarty for the rest of Clinton's first term—and the rest is history. To be a great leader, a modern president must have a great chief of staff—and in Leon Panetta, Clinton got the enforcer he deserved."[3]
McLarty is a lifelong friend of Clinton's, having been in the same kindergarten class. He was also a counselor to the president after leaving the chief of staff position; and was simultaneously appointed special envoy for the Americas until his resignation, April 24, 1998. He also served for five years on the National Economic Council."[2]
Serving as Clinton's "special envoy for the Americas," he was a key figure in the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), which was supported by the Council of the Americas, established by David Rockefeller, in 1965. He was a top official at the 1994 Miami Summit of the Americas, which laid the groundwork for this Trade bloc; as well as serving as a key liaison to Clinton for Rockefeller's Council in the implementation of this trade agreement.[4]
McLarty companies[edit]
The McLarty Companies comprises 11 automotive dealerships located in five states that generate in excess of $600 million. McLarty began his career building the company his grandfather founded, McLarty Leasing Systems, into one of the nation's largest transportation companies. Upon leaving the White House in July 1998, McLarty returned to the McLarty Companies, as its chairman.[2]

Early life[edit]
McLarty was born in Hope, Arkansas, and graduated from the University of Arkansas in 1969. He is a member of Sigma Chi Fraternity. He worked through the ranks of Hope Auto Company, the business founded by his grandfather, Thomas F. "Mr. Tom" McLarty. After serving a term in the Arkansas House of Representatives, he concentrated his efforts on growing the family's truck leasing business, first called M&M Leasing, later to become McLarty Leasing. He expanded the family's Arkansas dealership network to locations in Hope, Texarkana, Magnolia, and Little Rock. He was urged in many Democratic Party circles to seek the governor's chair vacated by David Pryor in 1978, but he deferred to his friend and fellow Hope native, Bill Clinton. He was elected to the state legislature at the age of 24, serving a single term from 1971–1973 and served as chairman of the state Democratic Party, from 1974–1976."[1]
In 1976, he became the youngest member ever elected to the board of directors of the Arkla Gas/Arkla, Inc., a Fortune 500 natural gas company. In 1983 he became Arkla's chairman and chief executive officer. During his tenure, the company was recognized by Forbes, The Wall Street Transcript, and The Financial Times for management excellence, in addition to his automotive endeavors.[2]
He has a distinguished record of business leadership and public service, including various roles advising three presidents: Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
White House years[edit]
He served as White House chief of staff to Bill Clinton, from 1993 until 1994. In 1994, the president asked his OMB director, Leon Panetta, what was wrong with his administration and was told about the lack of order in the White House. McLarty was out. According to author Nigel Hamilton, "Panetta replaced McLarty for the rest of Clinton's first term—and the rest is history. To be a great leader, a modern president must have a great chief of staff—and in Leon Panetta, Clinton got the enforcer he deserved."[3]
McLarty is a lifelong friend of Clinton's, having been in the same kindergarten class. He was also a counselor to the president after leaving the chief of staff position; and was simultaneously appointed special envoy for the Americas until his resignation, April 24, 1998. He also served for five years on the National Economic Council."[2]
Serving as Clinton's "special envoy for the Americas," he was a key figure in the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), which was supported by the Council of the Americas, established by David Rockefeller, in 1965. He was a top official at the 1994 Miami Summit of the Americas, which laid the groundwork for this Trade bloc; as well as serving as a key liaison to Clinton for Rockefeller's Council in the implementation of this trade agreement.[4]
McLarty companies[edit]
The McLarty Companies comprises 11 automotive dealerships located in five states that generate in excess of $600 million. McLarty began his career building the company his grandfather founded, McLarty Leasing Systems, into one of the nation's largest transportation companies. Upon leaving the White House in July 1998, McLarty returned to the McLarty Companies, as its chairman.[2]

Early life[edit]
McLarty was born in Hope, Arkansas, and graduated from the University of Arkansas in 1969. He is a member of Sigma Chi Fraternity. He worked through the ranks of Hope Auto Company, the business founded by his grandfather, Thomas F. "Mr. Tom" McLarty. After serving a term in the Arkansas House of Representatives, he concentrated his efforts on growing the family's truck leasing business, first called M&M Leasing, later to become McLarty Leasing. He expanded the family's Arkansas dealership network to locations in Hope, Texarkana, Magnolia, and Little Rock. He was urged in many Democratic Party circles to seek the governor's chair vacated by David Pryor in 1978, but he deferred to his friend and fellow Hope native, Bill Clinton. He was elected to the state legislature at the age of 24, serving a single term from 1971–1973 and served as chairman of the state Democratic Party, from 1974–1976."[1]
In 1976, he became the youngest member ever elected to the board of directors of the Arkla Gas/Arkla, Inc., a Fortune 500 natural gas company. In 1983 he became Arkla's chairman and chief executive officer. During his tenure, the company was recognized by Forbes, The Wall Street Transcript, and The Financial Times for management excellence, in addition to his automotive endeavors.[2]
He has a distinguished record of business leadership and public service, including various roles advising three presidents: Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
White House years[edit]
He served as White House chief of staff to Bill Clinton, from 1993 until 1994. In 1994, the president asked his OMB director, Leon Panetta, what was wrong with his administration and was told about the lack of order in the White House. McLarty was out. According to author Nigel Hamilton, "Panetta replaced McLarty for the rest of Clinton's first term—and the rest is history. To be a great leader, a modern president must have a great chief of staff—and in Leon Panetta, Clinton got the enforcer he deserved."[3]
McLarty is a lifelong friend of Clinton's, having been in the same kindergarten class. He was also a counselor to the president after leaving the chief of staff position; and was simultaneously appointed special envoy for the Americas until his resignation, April 24, 1998. He also served for five years on the National Economic Council."[2]
Serving as Clinton's "special envoy for the Americas," he was a key figure in the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), which was supported by the Council of the Americas, established by David Rockefeller, in 1965. He was a top official at the 1994 Miami Summit of the Americas, which laid the groundwork for this Trade bloc; as well as serving as a key liaison to Clinton for Rockefeller's Council in the implementation of this trade agreement.[4]
McLarty companies[edit]
The McLarty Companies comprises 11 automotive dealerships located in five states that generate in excess of $600 million. McLarty began his career building the company his grandfather founded, McLarty Leasing Systems, into one of the nation's largest transportation companies. Upon leaving the White House in July 1998, McLarty returned to the McLarty Companies, as its chairman.[2]

RLJ-McLarty-Landers vice chairman Thomas F.”Mack” McLarty has a distinguished record of business leadership and public service, with roots in the automotive business that reach back to 1921, when his grandfather opened a Ford dealership in Hope, Arkansas. Today, the McLarty family enterprise is in its fourth generation, building extensive operations at home and in Brazil, Mexico, and China.
Mr. McLarty joined the McLarty Companies in 1969, after graduating with honors from the University of Arkansas. Under his direction, the family’s innovative leasing operation became one of the country’s largest, even as their automotive dealerships expanded throughout the southern United States.
In 1979, the McLarty Companies bought the assets of one of the nation’s largest school bus manufacturers, Ward Industries, and turned the struggling enterprise around. In this same era, the McLarty Companies merged McLarty Leasing with the New York Stock Exchange listed company Leaseway Transportation, and Mr. McLarty became an officer of Leaseway, responsible for the southern region. By 1998, the McLarty Companies was one of the top 50 dealer groups in the United States, with 19 automobile dealership franchises in Arkansas and Texas and annual sales of roughly $750 million. The McLartys merged their business with Asbury Automotive Group of Pennsylvania, and Mr. McLarty became vice chair and a director on the Asbury board, helping successfully take that company public in 2002.
Today, having reestablished the family’s dealership holdings, Mr. McLarty and his sons Franklin and Mark are building RLJ-McLarty-Landers at home and expanding their dealership operations abroad, including as the exclusive importer of Jaguar Land Rover in Mexico, the leading BMW dealer group in the Beijing and Dalian regions of China, and the top Toyota dealer in Brazil.
A strong believer in public service, Mr. McLarty served more than five years as a member of President Bill Clinton’s cabinet, first as White House Chief of Staff and then as Counselor to the President and Special Envoy for the Americas. He was also appointed by President George H.W. Bush to the National Petroleum Council and the National Council on Environmental Quality, and served as a governor on the St. Louis Federal Reserve Board.
Upon leaving the White House in 1998, Mr. McLarty formed an international strategic advisory firm formed in partnership with former secretary of state Henry Kissinger. He continues that work as president of McLarty Associates, based in Washington DC. Previously, he spent a decade as Chairman and CEO of Arkla, a Fortune 500 natural gas company. Under his leadership, ARKLA grew into one of the largest natural gas distributors in the United States and won recognition for management excellence, environmental initiatives and minority enterprise development.

Mack McLarty (1946–)

aka: Thomas Franklin McLarty III






Thomas Franklin “Mack” McLarty III was the first Arkansan to serve as White House chief of staff. A kindergarten classmate and lifelong friend of President Bill Clinton, McLarty served as Clinton’s chief of staff from 1993 to 1994 and, later, as his special envoy for the Americas. 





He is now president of McLarty Associates, originally Kissinger McLarty Associates, an international advisory firm created in partnership with former secretary of state Henry Kissinger.
Mack McLarty was born on June 14, 1946, in Hope (Hempstead County) to Thomas F. McLarty Jr. and Helen Hesterly McLarty. He has one younger brother. His father owned and operated an automobile dealership started by McLarty’s grandfather. His mother, active in community and charitable endeavors, became the first woman named to the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission, the forerunner of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission (AEDC).
McLarty was raised in Hope and graduated from Hope High School. He and Clinton attended kindergarten at Miss Mary Purkins School. He was an all-state high school quarterback and was elected governor of Arkansas Boys State. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of Arkansas (UA) in Fayetteville (Washington County) in 1968, receiving a BA in business administration. He was UA student body president and initiated the school’s first mass transit system. After graduation, he returned to Hope, where he helped expand McLarty Companies, the family auto business, of which he still serves as chairman. At twenty-three, he was elected state representative but served only one term, choosing not to seek reelection because of growing business responsibilities. From 1983 to 1992, he was chief executive officer of Arkla, Inc., a Fortune 500 natural gas company with headquarters in Shreveport, Louisiana, and Little Rock (Pulaski County).
In 1969, he married Donna Cochran of Texarkana (Miller County), whom he met while attending UA. They have two sons.
Clinton chose McLarty as White House chief of staff because of their long friendship, his trust in McLarty’s judgment and skill, and McLarty’s successful experiences in both the public and private sector, which included positions to which he was appointed by Clinton’s predecessor as president, George H. W. Bush. During his tenure as chief of staff, McLarty championed the 1993 deficit reduction package that led the federal budget from a deficit to a surplus for the first time since 1969. He played key roles in the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Family and Medical Leave Act, and welfare reform legislation.
His collegial demeanor and bipartisan outreach as chief of staff earned him the nickname “Mack the Nice,” which some portrayed as a lack of toughness in imposing discipline in the Clinton White House. But others contended that McLarty’s niceness and inclusive approach were key to the passage of NAFTA and welfare reform while helping bridge partisan and philosophical divides. 
McLarty resigned his post as chief of staff to become White House counselor for the Americas, which led to his being named special envoy to the Americas. In that post, McLarty served as the White House coordinator for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, and received the Olympic Shield, the highest award given by the U.S. Olympic Committee. In 1998, he received the secretary of state’s Distinguished Service Medal for his work in international relations.
After leaving government service, he co-founded Kissinger McLarty Associates, a firm that offers strategic advisory and advocacy services to U.S. and multinational companies. In addition, he is a senior adviser for the Carlyle Private Equity Group and is director of both Union Pacific and Acxiom. He has served on the boards of the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund, the Council of the Americas, the InterAmerican Dialogue, Ford's Theatre, and the Center for the Study of the Presidency. He is a senior international fellow at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.McLarty maintains offices in New York City, Washington DC, and Little Rock. He has residences in Washington DC, Little Rock, and Hope.
