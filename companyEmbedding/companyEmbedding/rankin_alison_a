Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Beyond words...
Translating someone else’s words is a formidable responsibility. My clients’ credibility, project success or turnover may depend on the quality of their English documentation. As a qualified, experienced and diligent translator, my objectives are to understand the content, context and ambition of the text as well as its author and audience, to help craft your perfect message in English.
Specialized fields

A good English translation:

Enhances your international visibility and helps grow your business
Shows respect for your clients; your documentation is in articulate, idiomatic English, adapted to their activity, market and culture
Reflects the calibre of your products or services, as well as your professionalism

A bad English translation: 

May be inaccurate, incomprehensible or give a misleading message or information
May harm your reputation by making you or your business appear slap-dash
May make you sound ridiculous or, worse, offend your clients or readers



Why choose ARTraduction

Clients’ verdicts




Alison Rankin worked for our company as a translator and reviser, as part of a team of professional English and French translators, for almost five years.

Alison was much appreciated by her peers, in particular for her conscientiousness, her translation skills and the quality of her work. She was always receptive to discussion and was well liked by her clients and colleagues. She worked well independently and had a keen sense of personal and professional responsibility. Her cheerful nature, sense of humor and commitment to the team made her a popular member. We were sorry to see her leave the department, a decision she made for family and personal reasons.

Alison is an asset to any company and it is therefore without hesitation that I warmly recommend her candidacy.


Danielle Bergeron, Manager Language Services, Desjardins Insurance




I have called on Alison Rankin’s services on frequent occasions to translate technical documents into English (safety data sheets, our HACCP manual, operating procedures, etc.) and to help compose marketing documents such as the presentation of our company and of new products. Alison’s translations have always fully met my and my clients’ expectations, both in terms of their quality and the delivery deadlines. 
I can therefore very warmly recommend Alison’s services.


Christophe DUREAU, Customer service manager Coexpan




A few months ago, we were looking to have our website translated into English. I contacted Alison on the recommendation of a client of mine. Her response was fast, professional and efficient, and we therefore felt comfortable going ahead and assigning the contract to her, a decision we did not regret especially given that the technical complexity of our products made the task far from straightforward. We have therefore had no hesitation in entrusting subsequent translations to her, including complex correspondence and our general terms of sale. We will continue to call on her for our future translation needs. We appreciated the rapid response time, whether by letter, telephone or email. PICARD Technologies is therefore happy to recommend Alison’s services and thanks her once again.

Frédéric Picard, company director PICARD Technologies




The speed of your response time is outstanding, as is your sense of detail. You don’t hesitate to get back to me if you have the slightest doubt, with the result that your translations are accurate, adapted to the context, and meet our demanding requirements. The deadlines are always respected. I will not hesitate to assign future translations to you or recommend your services to other people or companies.

Manuela Tessier, Corporate Marketing Executive Evolis




The translations were of a very high standard, the deadlines met, and the fact that you were very easy to contact and receptive to discussion was appreciated. Your translations helped us to finalize a Web site that is adapted to our English-speaking markets, addresses the specific local context, and which prioritizes key words for search engine optimization purposes. I am happy to recommend your services, in particular, for the ease of discussion about our company’s particular needs – a vital exchange which really sets you apart from a lot of translation companies who just act as middlemen and do not give nearly the same level of detail.

Jean-Gabriel Martin, Marketing Communication Manager Evolis




I have known and worked with Alison Rankin for 23 years, both as her colleague and her supervisor. I can therefore confidently say that she is a very serious and talented translator. She does her research diligently to ensure that she is using the right terminology. Her English is refined and concise and she has a knack for translating even the most convoluted French into clear, comprehensible, flowing English. I highly recommend her services.

Christine Mooij Certified translator, Team leader Great-West Life Assurance Company
