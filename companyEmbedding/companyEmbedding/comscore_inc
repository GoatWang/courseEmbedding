Nobody Knows Data Like We Do


To provide the kind of in-depth marketing insight that Jumpshot delivers, it’s not just the size of the data pool that matters, but what kind of information you can extract. Jumpshot not only has the largest consumer panel in the industry with more than 100 million consumers, we also have the most comprehensive – with unmatched depth and detail, including insight into https traffic.





QUALITY


In addition to the sheer volume of panelists feeding Jumpshot, our level of insight into the data is unique.



Every Data Point
We collect every click that a panelist makes online, giving us a very rich stream of online behavioral data that is unmatched in the industry.



Secure Traffic
We see both http and https clicks, which gives us insight into most critical conversion behaviors that are often hidden from other data sources.



Persistent User ID
Our data isn’t cookie based, which means we can track user behavior over a much longer period of time than any other marketing analytics platform.



High Resolution
We calculate statistics with day, location, device, and platform adjustments to clean the data for any bias.



Continually Calibrated
We constantly measure our accuracy and refine our algorithm against known and established data sources.



Right Insight
Because our data captures the full URL, Jumpshot can report on anything from the domain level to a product category, to a specific product ID.



Size Matters


With more than 100 million consumers clicking around the Internet, Jumpshot’s panel is almost twice the size of our nearest competitor. A larger panel means more statistically significant results.



Diversity


If you want true diversity, our panel includes people in almost every country around the world, using multiple types of desktop and mobile devices.



Data Processing


We run a highly scalable Hadoop Distributed File System across backend data-processing clusters, database-server farms, and frontend servers to process more than 5 billion clicks each day.



Storage


We have four server clusters in secure data centers distributed around the world — two in Europe and one on each coast of the United States — to make it faster for customers to access data.





 Do you know your customer’s entire online journey?

1


Data is Stripped, Cleaned, and Calculated
We use our algorithm to identify & remove PII. The data is then cleaned & calculated to make it representative of the Internet.





2


Data Science Determines Socio-Demographics
After analyzing billions of websites visited by millions of panelists, our data scientists can accurately predict age and gender without PII.



 

3


Data is Calculated into Statistical Information
We aggregate & extrapolate our data to online population (3 billion) using algorithms that calibrate by location, socio-demographics, device, etc.





4


Data is Packaged and Stored For Use
We employ the latest big-data technologies to process 1-2 PB (petabytes) of data, growing by 1.5TB (terabytes) of data daily.

History[edit]
ComScore Networks was founded in July 1999 in Reston, Virginia.[3] The company was co-founded by Gian Fulgoni, who was for many years the CEO of market research company Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) and Magid Abraham, who was also an ex-IRI employee and had served as president of IRI in the mid-1990s.
Magid and Gian came up with the idea while working with one of the original investors in the company, Mike Santer, who thought up the concept of creating a very large consumer panel online to track online commerce. The problem was that the traditional methods in which companies were tracking online behavior would not work in tracking commerce, because of the lower incidence of buying online. Normal panels in tracking visitation would be around 20-30K and, with less than 2-3% of the population buying online, the panel size needed to be at least 1-2MM. They decided to build a very large panel using more aggressive recruiting methodology and managing for the error by using advanced statistical methods and controls. Years and tens of millions of dollars went into finding the best ways to measure online buying and other behaviors, plus the level of accuracy required for Fortune 1000 companies to buy.[citation needed]
In 2000, comScore bought certain assets and the customer agreements of PC Data of Reston, Virginia, which was founded by Ann Stephens in 1991. PC Data was among the earliest Web measurement firms, but increasing competitive challenges (including a threat of a patent infringement lawsuit by industry pioneer Media Metrix) put PC Data's future in doubt. The acquisition of PC Data's large customer base helped accelerate the growth of comScore's syndicated measurement service.
By 2001, Media Metrix had built a market share lead but had been unable to create a sustainable financial structure. NetRatings, its closest competitor, was armed with strong capital reserves and announced its intention to acquire and integrate Media Metrix. However, after several months, the FTC announced its intention to block the acquisition and accordingly, NetRatings canceled the transaction. comScore was subsequently able to acquire Media Metrix in a deal announced in June 2002.
Media Metrix originated as PC Meter, a business unit of market research company NPD Group and began publishing statistics in January 1996.[4] In July 1997, it changed its name to Media Metrix, citing the desire to track a wider variety of interactive traffic.[5] In October 1998, Media Metrix merged with its nearest rival, Relevant Knowledge.[6] The company went public as NASDAQ:MMXI in May 1999, reaching a market cap of $135 million on its first day of trading.[7] In June 2000, the company acquired Jupiter Communications for $414 million in stock and changed its name to Jupiter Media Metrix.[8] In the aftermath of the dot-com bubble collapse and associated downturn in internet marketing spending, Jupiter sold the Media Metrix service to rival comScore for $1.5 million in June 2002.[9]
On March 30, 2007, comScore announced its intent to sell shares in an initial public offering and be traded on the Nasdaq using the symbol "SCOR".[10][11]
In May 2008, comScore announced its acquisition of M:Metrics, a company measuring mobile content consumption. The transaction involved a cash payment of $44.3 million and the issue of approximately 50,000 options to purchase shares of comScore common stock to certain M:Metrics unvested option holders.[12]
comScore announced in October 2009 the acquisition of Certifica, a provider of real-time web measurement and digital marketing technology solutions in Latin America. Based in Santiago, Chile, Certifica has offices throughout Latin America, including Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Peru. The acquisition enhanced comScore’s presence in the rapidly developing Latin American market.[13]
In February 2010, comScore announced it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the ARSgroup in an all-cash acquisition. Headquartered in Evansville, Indiana, ARSgroup’s areas of expertise included brand strategy, all stages of creative development, campaign evaluation across all marketing and media channels, media planning, return on investment, and forecasting.[14]
On July 1, 2010, comScore announced that it has acquired the products division of Nexius, Inc.[15]
comScore then acquired web analytics and video measurement solutions provider Nedstat (nl) for approximately $36.7 million. Announced on September 1, 2010, the acquisition helps comScore accelerate its global expansion strategy, particularly in European markets.[16]
On February 11, 2014, comScore announced the appointment of Serge Matta as chief executive officer, effective March 1.[17] In February 2015 comScore US entered into a partnership with Kantar owned by WPP with an equity stake purchase.[18]
In September 2015, comScore and Rentrak announced a merger of the two companies. The move was meant to combine comScore's digital media measurement capabilities with the TV measurement capabilities of Rentrak to create a cross-platform media measurement firm, perhaps capable of challenging Nielsen N.V. in the media measurement space.[19] Under terms of the agreement, comScore agreed to acquire Rentrak in an all-stock deal valued at about $732 million, with Rentrak shareholders receiving 1.15 shares of comScore per owned share of Rentrak.[20]
The comScore-Rentrak deal closed on February 1, 2016, with the final transaction being valued at $767.7 million.[21]
Co-founder Gian Fulgoni, who had been serving as chairman emeritus since 2014, abruptly replaced Serge Matta as chief executive officer on August 10, 2016.[22] On September 2, 2016, comScore received a letter from NASDAQ that it was in danger of being delisted from the exchange on September 12 unless comScore filed its 2015 annual report (form 10-K) and reports for the first two quarters of 2016.[23] On Feb 6, 2017, comScore announced they would not meet the NASDAQ-imposed deadline to "complete its financial restatement and regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements."[24] Because of this missed deadline being missed, "comScore's common stock may be suspended from trading and delisted from Nasdaq."[24] If comScore is delisted from NASDAQ and their trading is suspended, they advise they intend to "be quoted on the OTC Markets."[24]
Data collection and reporting[edit]
comScore maintains a group of users who have monitoring software (with brands including PermissionResearch, OpinionSquare and VoiceFive Networks)[25] installed on their computers.[citation needed] In exchange for joining the comScore research panels, users are presented with various benefits, including computer security software, Internet data storage, virus scanning and chances to win cash or prizes.[citation needed]
comScore estimates that two million users are part of the monitoring program.[11] However, self-selected populations, no matter how large, may not be representative of the population as a whole. To obtain the most accurate data, comScore adjusts the statistics using weights to make sure that each population segment is adequately represented. To calculate these weights, comScore regularly recruits panelists using random digit dialing and other offline recruiting methods to accurately determine how many users are online, aggregated by geography, income, and age.[26][27][28] Correcting the comScore data requires having accurate demographics about the larger pool of users. However, some comScore users are recruited without being asked to give demographic information and, in other cases, users may not be truthful about their demographics. To ensure the accuracy of the data, comScore verifies its users' demographics during the course of measuring statistical data.[29]
The corrected data is used to generate reports on topics ranging from web traffic[30] to video streaming activity[31] and consumer buying power.[32]
Unified Digital Measurement[edit]
With the introduction of Unified Digital Measurement (UDM) in May 2009, comScore implemented a solution to digital audience measurement that organically blended both panel and census-based measurement approaches into a single unified methodology. comScore has developed this proprietary methodology to calculate audience reach in a manner not affected by variables such as cookie deletion and cookie blocking/rejection to help reconcile longstanding differences between the two measurement approaches.[33]
Campaign measurement[edit]
comScore debuted Campaign Essentials in 2010 to measure how digital campaigns are reaching their audiences. In March 2012, comScore launched validated Campaign Essentials (vCE), which introduced the notion of “validated” impressions.[34] In January 2013, comScore announced that it had evaluated 4,000 campaigns for clients covering more than 75 advertising agencies.[35]
Criticism[edit]
In 2006, Ben Edelman, a Harvard researcher, alleged that there were cases where comScore software had been installed on users' computers without their knowledge.[36] comScore admitted that it was in discussion with a spyware firm called DollarRevenue but said that no contract was ever signed, and that once it realized DollarRevenue was distributing comScore's software, months later, it took steps to prevent the DollarRevenue-distributed software from sending data to comScore.[37] Stanford IT notes that the monitoring software has been bundled with file sharing program iMesh without users being aware of it,[38] although comScore's relationship with iMesh was short-lived and occurred several years ago.[37]
In the past, the software forwarded users' internet traffic through comScore proxy servers, provoking criticism about speed performance.[38][39] As a result, several universities and banks took steps to block the proxy servers.[40][41] In response to these concerns, comScore no longer uses this technology.[citation needed]
In June 2010, a warning about Mac Spyware being launched from free applications like screensavers, from security company Intego[42] was reported in the media and implicated VoiceFive, Inc. as the source of certain alleged spyware software.[43]
Additionally, noted blogger and angel investor Jason Calacanis claimed that ComScore was running an 'extorting ring' by vastly undercounting publisher traffic numbers and forcing them to pay fees for direct measurement via a tracking pixel.[44] ComScore responded to these allegations by offering their direct measurement tracking pixel to long-tail web publishers for free.[45]
Awards[edit]

Magid Abraham, comScore's co-founder, received the 2009 Charles Coolidge Parlin Marketing Research Award at the 2009 American Marketing Association Marketing Research Conference.[46]
comScore was selected as a winner of the 2009 Chicago Innovation Awards for its creative development of AdEffx in October 2009.[47]
In June 2009, comScore and the GSM Association won the M.E.F. Award for Business Intelligence in Mobile Media.[48]
comScore was rated as the preferred audience measurement service by 50.4 percent of respondents to the William Blair & Company 6th semiannual survey of the members of the Chicago Interactive Marketing Association (CIMA).[49]
comScore was ranked as the 15th largest U.S. market research firm based on 2008 domestic revenues, growing faster than each of the largest 25 research firms, according to the 2008 Honomichl Top 50 report.[50]
comScore was selected by World Economic Forum as one of 2007's 47 most innovative companies.[51]
comScore co-founder Magid Abraham was honored with the Eighth Annual Buck Weaver Award for Marketing. The award recognizes individuals who have made important contributions to the advancement of theory and practice in marketing science.[52]
In 2014, comScore has been awarded the "New Technology of the Year Award" by Digital Analytics Association. With its multi-platform capability, Digital Analytix is able to unify users across devices and platforms using comScore’s proprietary browser unification methodology.[53][54]
According to the third-party analysts' Alexa Internet and SimilarWeb researches, comScore is one of the best rated marketing companies.[55][56]

Competitors and alliances[edit]
Competitors in internet market research include Alexa, Nielsen Online, Quantcast, SimilarWeb, SRDS by Kantar Media, Thalamus, and Compete, a TNS Media company.
In February 2011, The Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement (CIMM) and comScore announced they were working together to measure three-screen users and their behavior with content and advertising across television, Internet, and mobile.

History[edit]
ComScore Networks was founded in July 1999 in Reston, Virginia.[3] The company was co-founded by Gian Fulgoni, who was for many years the CEO of market research company Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) and Magid Abraham, who was also an ex-IRI employee and had served as president of IRI in the mid-1990s.
Magid and Gian came up with the idea while working with one of the original investors in the company, Mike Santer, who thought up the concept of creating a very large consumer panel online to track online commerce. The problem was that the traditional methods in which companies were tracking online behavior would not work in tracking commerce, because of the lower incidence of buying online. Normal panels in tracking visitation would be around 20-30K and, with less than 2-3% of the population buying online, the panel size needed to be at least 1-2MM. They decided to build a very large panel using more aggressive recruiting methodology and managing for the error by using advanced statistical methods and controls. Years and tens of millions of dollars went into finding the best ways to measure online buying and other behaviors, plus the level of accuracy required for Fortune 1000 companies to buy.[citation needed]
In 2000, comScore bought certain assets and the customer agreements of PC Data of Reston, Virginia, which was founded by Ann Stephens in 1991. PC Data was among the earliest Web measurement firms, but increasing competitive challenges (including a threat of a patent infringement lawsuit by industry pioneer Media Metrix) put PC Data's future in doubt. The acquisition of PC Data's large customer base helped accelerate the growth of comScore's syndicated measurement service.
By 2001, Media Metrix had built a market share lead but had been unable to create a sustainable financial structure. NetRatings, its closest competitor, was armed with strong capital reserves and announced its intention to acquire and integrate Media Metrix. However, after several months, the FTC announced its intention to block the acquisition and accordingly, NetRatings canceled the transaction. comScore was subsequently able to acquire Media Metrix in a deal announced in June 2002.
Media Metrix originated as PC Meter, a business unit of market research company NPD Group and began publishing statistics in January 1996.[4] In July 1997, it changed its name to Media Metrix, citing the desire to track a wider variety of interactive traffic.[5] In October 1998, Media Metrix merged with its nearest rival, Relevant Knowledge.[6] The company went public as NASDAQ:MMXI in May 1999, reaching a market cap of $135 million on its first day of trading.[7] In June 2000, the company acquired Jupiter Communications for $414 million in stock and changed its name to Jupiter Media Metrix.[8] In the aftermath of the dot-com bubble collapse and associated downturn in internet marketing spending, Jupiter sold the Media Metrix service to rival comScore for $1.5 million in June 2002.[9]
On March 30, 2007, comScore announced its intent to sell shares in an initial public offering and be traded on the Nasdaq using the symbol "SCOR".[10][11]
In May 2008, comScore announced its acquisition of M:Metrics, a company measuring mobile content consumption. The transaction involved a cash payment of $44.3 million and the issue of approximately 50,000 options to purchase shares of comScore common stock to certain M:Metrics unvested option holders.[12]
comScore announced in October 2009 the acquisition of Certifica, a provider of real-time web measurement and digital marketing technology solutions in Latin America. Based in Santiago, Chile, Certifica has offices throughout Latin America, including Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Peru. The acquisition enhanced comScore’s presence in the rapidly developing Latin American market.[13]
In February 2010, comScore announced it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the ARSgroup in an all-cash acquisition. Headquartered in Evansville, Indiana, ARSgroup’s areas of expertise included brand strategy, all stages of creative development, campaign evaluation across all marketing and media channels, media planning, return on investment, and forecasting.[14]
On July 1, 2010, comScore announced that it has acquired the products division of Nexius, Inc.[15]
comScore then acquired web analytics and video measurement solutions provider Nedstat (nl) for approximately $36.7 million. Announced on September 1, 2010, the acquisition helps comScore accelerate its global expansion strategy, particularly in European markets.[16]
On February 11, 2014, comScore announced the appointment of Serge Matta as chief executive officer, effective March 1.[17] In February 2015 comScore US entered into a partnership with Kantar owned by WPP with an equity stake purchase.[18]
In September 2015, comScore and Rentrak announced a merger of the two companies. The move was meant to combine comScore's digital media measurement capabilities with the TV measurement capabilities of Rentrak to create a cross-platform media measurement firm, perhaps capable of challenging Nielsen N.V. in the media measurement space.[19] Under terms of the agreement, comScore agreed to acquire Rentrak in an all-stock deal valued at about $732 million, with Rentrak shareholders receiving 1.15 shares of comScore per owned share of Rentrak.[20]
The comScore-Rentrak deal closed on February 1, 2016, with the final transaction being valued at $767.7 million.[21]
Co-founder Gian Fulgoni, who had been serving as chairman emeritus since 2014, abruptly replaced Serge Matta as chief executive officer on August 10, 2016.[22] On September 2, 2016, comScore received a letter from NASDAQ that it was in danger of being delisted from the exchange on September 12 unless comScore filed its 2015 annual report (form 10-K) and reports for the first two quarters of 2016.[23] On Feb 6, 2017, comScore announced they would not meet the NASDAQ-imposed deadline to "complete its financial restatement and regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements."[24] Because of this missed deadline being missed, "comScore's common stock may be suspended from trading and delisted from Nasdaq."[24] If comScore is delisted from NASDAQ and their trading is suspended, they advise they intend to "be quoted on the OTC Markets."[24]
Data collection and reporting[edit]
comScore maintains a group of users who have monitoring software (with brands including PermissionResearch, OpinionSquare and VoiceFive Networks)[25] installed on their computers.[citation needed] In exchange for joining the comScore research panels, users are presented with various benefits, including computer security software, Internet data storage, virus scanning and chances to win cash or prizes.[citation needed]
comScore estimates that two million users are part of the monitoring program.[11] However, self-selected populations, no matter how large, may not be representative of the population as a whole. To obtain the most accurate data, comScore adjusts the statistics using weights to make sure that each population segment is adequately represented. To calculate these weights, comScore regularly recruits panelists using random digit dialing and other offline recruiting methods to accurately determine how many users are online, aggregated by geography, income, and age.[26][27][28] Correcting the comScore data requires having accurate demographics about the larger pool of users. However, some comScore users are recruited without being asked to give demographic information and, in other cases, users may not be truthful about their demographics. To ensure the accuracy of the data, comScore verifies its users' demographics during the course of measuring statistical data.[29]
The corrected data is used to generate reports on topics ranging from web traffic[30] to video streaming activity[31] and consumer buying power.[32]
Unified Digital Measurement[edit]
With the introduction of Unified Digital Measurement (UDM) in May 2009, comScore implemented a solution to digital audience measurement that organically blended both panel and census-based measurement approaches into a single unified methodology. comScore has developed this proprietary methodology to calculate audience reach in a manner not affected by variables such as cookie deletion and cookie blocking/rejection to help reconcile longstanding differences between the two measurement approaches.[33]
Campaign measurement[edit]
comScore debuted Campaign Essentials in 2010 to measure how digital campaigns are reaching their audiences. In March 2012, comScore launched validated Campaign Essentials (vCE), which introduced the notion of “validated” impressions.[34] In January 2013, comScore announced that it had evaluated 4,000 campaigns for clients covering more than 75 advertising agencies.[35]
Criticism[edit]
In 2006, Ben Edelman, a Harvard researcher, alleged that there were cases where comScore software had been installed on users' computers without their knowledge.[36] comScore admitted that it was in discussion with a spyware firm called DollarRevenue but said that no contract was ever signed, and that once it realized DollarRevenue was distributing comScore's software, months later, it took steps to prevent the DollarRevenue-distributed software from sending data to comScore.[37] Stanford IT notes that the monitoring software has been bundled with file sharing program iMesh without users being aware of it,[38] although comScore's relationship with iMesh was short-lived and occurred several years ago.[37]
In the past, the software forwarded users' internet traffic through comScore proxy servers, provoking criticism about speed performance.[38][39] As a result, several universities and banks took steps to block the proxy servers.[40][41] In response to these concerns, comScore no longer uses this technology.[citation needed]
In June 2010, a warning about Mac Spyware being launched from free applications like screensavers, from security company Intego[42] was reported in the media and implicated VoiceFive, Inc. as the source of certain alleged spyware software.[43]
Additionally, noted blogger and angel investor Jason Calacanis claimed that ComScore was running an 'extorting ring' by vastly undercounting publisher traffic numbers and forcing them to pay fees for direct measurement via a tracking pixel.[44] ComScore responded to these allegations by offering their direct measurement tracking pixel to long-tail web publishers for free.[45]
Awards[edit]

Magid Abraham, comScore's co-founder, received the 2009 Charles Coolidge Parlin Marketing Research Award at the 2009 American Marketing Association Marketing Research Conference.[46]
comScore was selected as a winner of the 2009 Chicago Innovation Awards for its creative development of AdEffx in October 2009.[47]
In June 2009, comScore and the GSM Association won the M.E.F. Award for Business Intelligence in Mobile Media.[48]
comScore was rated as the preferred audience measurement service by 50.4 percent of respondents to the William Blair & Company 6th semiannual survey of the members of the Chicago Interactive Marketing Association (CIMA).[49]
comScore was ranked as the 15th largest U.S. market research firm based on 2008 domestic revenues, growing faster than each of the largest 25 research firms, according to the 2008 Honomichl Top 50 report.[50]
comScore was selected by World Economic Forum as one of 2007's 47 most innovative companies.[51]
comScore co-founder Magid Abraham was honored with the Eighth Annual Buck Weaver Award for Marketing. The award recognizes individuals who have made important contributions to the advancement of theory and practice in marketing science.[52]
In 2014, comScore has been awarded the "New Technology of the Year Award" by Digital Analytics Association. With its multi-platform capability, Digital Analytix is able to unify users across devices and platforms using comScore’s proprietary browser unification methodology.[53][54]
According to the third-party analysts' Alexa Internet and SimilarWeb researches, comScore is one of the best rated marketing companies.[55][56]

Competitors and alliances[edit]
Competitors in internet market research include Alexa, Nielsen Online, Quantcast, SimilarWeb, SRDS by Kantar Media, Thalamus, and Compete, a TNS Media company.
In February 2011, The Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement (CIMM) and comScore announced they were working together to measure three-screen users and their behavior with content and advertising across television, Internet, and mobile.

History[edit]
ComScore Networks was founded in July 1999 in Reston, Virginia.[3] The company was co-founded by Gian Fulgoni, who was for many years the CEO of market research company Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) and Magid Abraham, who was also an ex-IRI employee and had served as president of IRI in the mid-1990s.
Magid and Gian came up with the idea while working with one of the original investors in the company, Mike Santer, who thought up the concept of creating a very large consumer panel online to track online commerce. The problem was that the traditional methods in which companies were tracking online behavior would not work in tracking commerce, because of the lower incidence of buying online. Normal panels in tracking visitation would be around 20-30K and, with less than 2-3% of the population buying online, the panel size needed to be at least 1-2MM. They decided to build a very large panel using more aggressive recruiting methodology and managing for the error by using advanced statistical methods and controls. Years and tens of millions of dollars went into finding the best ways to measure online buying and other behaviors, plus the level of accuracy required for Fortune 1000 companies to buy.[citation needed]
In 2000, comScore bought certain assets and the customer agreements of PC Data of Reston, Virginia, which was founded by Ann Stephens in 1991. PC Data was among the earliest Web measurement firms, but increasing competitive challenges (including a threat of a patent infringement lawsuit by industry pioneer Media Metrix) put PC Data's future in doubt. The acquisition of PC Data's large customer base helped accelerate the growth of comScore's syndicated measurement service.
By 2001, Media Metrix had built a market share lead but had been unable to create a sustainable financial structure. NetRatings, its closest competitor, was armed with strong capital reserves and announced its intention to acquire and integrate Media Metrix. However, after several months, the FTC announced its intention to block the acquisition and accordingly, NetRatings canceled the transaction. comScore was subsequently able to acquire Media Metrix in a deal announced in June 2002.
Media Metrix originated as PC Meter, a business unit of market research company NPD Group and began publishing statistics in January 1996.[4] In July 1997, it changed its name to Media Metrix, citing the desire to track a wider variety of interactive traffic.[5] In October 1998, Media Metrix merged with its nearest rival, Relevant Knowledge.[6] The company went public as NASDAQ:MMXI in May 1999, reaching a market cap of $135 million on its first day of trading.[7] In June 2000, the company acquired Jupiter Communications for $414 million in stock and changed its name to Jupiter Media Metrix.[8] In the aftermath of the dot-com bubble collapse and associated downturn in internet marketing spending, Jupiter sold the Media Metrix service to rival comScore for $1.5 million in June 2002.[9]
On March 30, 2007, comScore announced its intent to sell shares in an initial public offering and be traded on the Nasdaq using the symbol "SCOR".[10][11]
In May 2008, comScore announced its acquisition of M:Metrics, a company measuring mobile content consumption. The transaction involved a cash payment of $44.3 million and the issue of approximately 50,000 options to purchase shares of comScore common stock to certain M:Metrics unvested option holders.[12]
comScore announced in October 2009 the acquisition of Certifica, a provider of real-time web measurement and digital marketing technology solutions in Latin America. Based in Santiago, Chile, Certifica has offices throughout Latin America, including Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Peru. The acquisition enhanced comScore’s presence in the rapidly developing Latin American market.[13]
In February 2010, comScore announced it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the ARSgroup in an all-cash acquisition. Headquartered in Evansville, Indiana, ARSgroup’s areas of expertise included brand strategy, all stages of creative development, campaign evaluation across all marketing and media channels, media planning, return on investment, and forecasting.[14]
On July 1, 2010, comScore announced that it has acquired the products division of Nexius, Inc.[15]
comScore then acquired web analytics and video measurement solutions provider Nedstat (nl) for approximately $36.7 million. Announced on September 1, 2010, the acquisition helps comScore accelerate its global expansion strategy, particularly in European markets.[16]
On February 11, 2014, comScore announced the appointment of Serge Matta as chief executive officer, effective March 1.[17] In February 2015 comScore US entered into a partnership with Kantar owned by WPP with an equity stake purchase.[18]
In September 2015, comScore and Rentrak announced a merger of the two companies. The move was meant to combine comScore's digital media measurement capabilities with the TV measurement capabilities of Rentrak to create a cross-platform media measurement firm, perhaps capable of challenging Nielsen N.V. in the media measurement space.[19] Under terms of the agreement, comScore agreed to acquire Rentrak in an all-stock deal valued at about $732 million, with Rentrak shareholders receiving 1.15 shares of comScore per owned share of Rentrak.[20]
The comScore-Rentrak deal closed on February 1, 2016, with the final transaction being valued at $767.7 million.[21]
Co-founder Gian Fulgoni, who had been serving as chairman emeritus since 2014, abruptly replaced Serge Matta as chief executive officer on August 10, 2016.[22] On September 2, 2016, comScore received a letter from NASDAQ that it was in danger of being delisted from the exchange on September 12 unless comScore filed its 2015 annual report (form 10-K) and reports for the first two quarters of 2016.[23] On Feb 6, 2017, comScore announced they would not meet the NASDAQ-imposed deadline to "complete its financial restatement and regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements."[24] Because of this missed deadline being missed, "comScore's common stock may be suspended from trading and delisted from Nasdaq."[24] If comScore is delisted from NASDAQ and their trading is suspended, they advise they intend to "be quoted on the OTC Markets."[24]
Data collection and reporting[edit]
comScore maintains a group of users who have monitoring software (with brands including PermissionResearch, OpinionSquare and VoiceFive Networks)[25] installed on their computers.[citation needed] In exchange for joining the comScore research panels, users are presented with various benefits, including computer security software, Internet data storage, virus scanning and chances to win cash or prizes.[citation needed]
comScore estimates that two million users are part of the monitoring program.[11] However, self-selected populations, no matter how large, may not be representative of the population as a whole. To obtain the most accurate data, comScore adjusts the statistics using weights to make sure that each population segment is adequately represented. To calculate these weights, comScore regularly recruits panelists using random digit dialing and other offline recruiting methods to accurately determine how many users are online, aggregated by geography, income, and age.[26][27][28] Correcting the comScore data requires having accurate demographics about the larger pool of users. However, some comScore users are recruited without being asked to give demographic information and, in other cases, users may not be truthful about their demographics. To ensure the accuracy of the data, comScore verifies its users' demographics during the course of measuring statistical data.[29]
The corrected data is used to generate reports on topics ranging from web traffic[30] to video streaming activity[31] and consumer buying power.[32]
Unified Digital Measurement[edit]
With the introduction of Unified Digital Measurement (UDM) in May 2009, comScore implemented a solution to digital audience measurement that organically blended both panel and census-based measurement approaches into a single unified methodology. comScore has developed this proprietary methodology to calculate audience reach in a manner not affected by variables such as cookie deletion and cookie blocking/rejection to help reconcile longstanding differences between the two measurement approaches.[33]
Campaign measurement[edit]
comScore debuted Campaign Essentials in 2010 to measure how digital campaigns are reaching their audiences. In March 2012, comScore launched validated Campaign Essentials (vCE), which introduced the notion of “validated” impressions.[34] In January 2013, comScore announced that it had evaluated 4,000 campaigns for clients covering more than 75 advertising agencies.[35]
Criticism[edit]
In 2006, Ben Edelman, a Harvard researcher, alleged that there were cases where comScore software had been installed on users' computers without their knowledge.[36] comScore admitted that it was in discussion with a spyware firm called DollarRevenue but said that no contract was ever signed, and that once it realized DollarRevenue was distributing comScore's software, months later, it took steps to prevent the DollarRevenue-distributed software from sending data to comScore.[37] Stanford IT notes that the monitoring software has been bundled with file sharing program iMesh without users being aware of it,[38] although comScore's relationship with iMesh was short-lived and occurred several years ago.[37]
In the past, the software forwarded users' internet traffic through comScore proxy servers, provoking criticism about speed performance.[38][39] As a result, several universities and banks took steps to block the proxy servers.[40][41] In response to these concerns, comScore no longer uses this technology.[citation needed]
In June 2010, a warning about Mac Spyware being launched from free applications like screensavers, from security company Intego[42] was reported in the media and implicated VoiceFive, Inc. as the source of certain alleged spyware software.[43]
Additionally, noted blogger and angel investor Jason Calacanis claimed that ComScore was running an 'extorting ring' by vastly undercounting publisher traffic numbers and forcing them to pay fees for direct measurement via a tracking pixel.[44] ComScore responded to these allegations by offering their direct measurement tracking pixel to long-tail web publishers for free.[45]
Awards[edit]

Magid Abraham, comScore's co-founder, received the 2009 Charles Coolidge Parlin Marketing Research Award at the 2009 American Marketing Association Marketing Research Conference.[46]
comScore was selected as a winner of the 2009 Chicago Innovation Awards for its creative development of AdEffx in October 2009.[47]
In June 2009, comScore and the GSM Association won the M.E.F. Award for Business Intelligence in Mobile Media.[48]
comScore was rated as the preferred audience measurement service by 50.4 percent of respondents to the William Blair & Company 6th semiannual survey of the members of the Chicago Interactive Marketing Association (CIMA).[49]
comScore was ranked as the 15th largest U.S. market research firm based on 2008 domestic revenues, growing faster than each of the largest 25 research firms, according to the 2008 Honomichl Top 50 report.[50]
comScore was selected by World Economic Forum as one of 2007's 47 most innovative companies.[51]
comScore co-founder Magid Abraham was honored with the Eighth Annual Buck Weaver Award for Marketing. The award recognizes individuals who have made important contributions to the advancement of theory and practice in marketing science.[52]
In 2014, comScore has been awarded the "New Technology of the Year Award" by Digital Analytics Association. With its multi-platform capability, Digital Analytix is able to unify users across devices and platforms using comScore’s proprietary browser unification methodology.[53][54]
According to the third-party analysts' Alexa Internet and SimilarWeb researches, comScore is one of the best rated marketing companies.[55][56]

Competitors and alliances[edit]
Competitors in internet market research include Alexa, Nielsen Online, Quantcast, SimilarWeb, SRDS by Kantar Media, Thalamus, and Compete, a TNS Media company.
In February 2011, The Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement (CIMM) and comScore announced they were working together to measure three-screen users and their behavior with content and advertising across television, Internet, and mobile.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
