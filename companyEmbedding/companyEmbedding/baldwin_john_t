		About	


Since 1928, our family business has earned its reputation as a leading commercial and residential development contractor by providing service and quality that is second to none. Reliable Contracting is now Anne Arundel County’s largest site-work contractor, boasting more than 400 employees, 100 trucks and 250 pieces of earthmoving equipment.
We offer a wide variety of services for site development and property maintenance needs including:

Asphalt paving and road construction
Concrete installation
Grading and excavating
Utility installation
Stormwater management
Trucking

We are also one of Central Maryland’s leading asphalt manufactures with two NAPA recognized locations in Anne Arundel County. At both locations we carry a variety of sand and aggregate materials. Reliable Contracting has a wide service area including: Millersville, Gambrills, Fort Meade, Odenton, Crofton, Baltimore , Bowie, Waldorf, White Plains, La Plata, Kent Island, Laurel and Severna Park.  We also serve the following counties: Anne Arundel County, Prince George’s County, St. Mary’s County, Charles County, Montgomery County, Baltimore County, Kent County, Queen Anne’s County and Howard County.
Today, Reliable Contracting is managed by the second and third generation of the Baldwin family: Jay Baldwin was elected as our corporate President in 2002 when his father, Tom Baldwin retired as President after 52 years of service to the company. Meade Baldwin Sr. and Jack Baldwin, the sons of co-founder, Bill Baldwin, have both spent their entire careers at Reliable and continue to actively serve as Divisional Vice Presidents. In fact, over a third of our employees have been with the firm for 10 years or more, and many represent their family’s second or third generation of Reliable employees. However, Reliable Contracting beginnings were much more humble.
Our Mission
To have a positive and significant impact on the construction industry by setting the standard for excellence in construction services. Reliable is dedicated to delivering quality products, displaying professionalism within the firm, seeking new opportunities for expansion and profitability, and providing an environment for individual success.
History
In 1928, brothers Bill and Frank Baldwin purchased a $200 used dump truck and entered the hauling business. It wasn’t until 1938 that their first State contract was awarded – for backfilling the bulkheads at St. George Island. With a few more dump trucks, a bulldozer and a handful of employees, the company incorporated in 1942, but the brothers returned to farming after World War II and all but abandoned the construction business. Frank Baldwin’s son Tom, a recent college graduate, purchased his father’s share of the company in 1950, sought out new business in road construction and excavating, and built the company into a strong and dynamic industry leader.

Quick Overview

Imagine this--there are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on all the beaches in the world! What we see when we look up-- that's like a handful of sand. In a universe this big, our little planet is just a speck, barely worth noticing.In this book, we will explore some of the wonders of the universe and of life on our little planet. But most importantly, we will explore the wonder of our own existence. Since the earliest days of human history, people have struggled with the big questions of life. Why are we here? Where are we going? What happens to us when we die?Some people believe that science offers all the answers we seek; others feel that science leaves them empty. It doesn't offer answers for some of the deepest longings of the human heart. But that doesn't mean that those answers can't be found.Come along on a journey to discover not only the wonders of life but, even more remarkable, a love that is beyond imagination.

Baldwin Hardware Manufacturing FactsBaldwin's superior quality is derived from a fusion of quality materials and expert craftsmanship. See below for facts about the materials and process followed to manufacture a single piece of Baldwin hardware. 100,000 lbs of brass is received at the Baldwin manufacturing facility from local foundries per weekBrass billets are heated to 1300 degrees before forging.200 tons of force forms brass billets into Baldwin hardware.30 people will work on a single Baldwin piece on average.All heavy gauge steel lock mechanisms are coated with a rust resistant compound.





Baldwin CollectionsBaldwin hardware is separated into three main collections. Each Baldwin collection is designed and built to meet specific customer needs. Below is a quick preview of the collections, so you can choose the best Baldwin product for your home.

Baldwin Brass ManufacturingBaldwin uses brass for its door hardware due to its durability, strength, and appearance. You only need to hold a solid brass Baldwin product to feel the quality and durability. Brass is heavier, stronger, and provides smoother operation compared to steel or aluminum door hardware. Baldwin is forged, not cast, so it is denser and heavier. Solid brass arrives at the Baldwin manufacturing facility in bars where it is super heated and forged by expert craftsman into its final shape. It is then trimmed and polished with extreme detail. Resulting in a very high quality piece of hardware. Baldwin is committed to providing quality door hardware, thus brass will be their material for as long as they are around.








Baldwin Luxurious FinishesBaldwin hardwares product line is extensive and now offers up to 22 unique finishes. This kind of selection allows customers to pick the exact style they are looking for, from contemporary and modern to rustic and classic. Each finish has its own manufacturer technique, of which Baldwin has nearly perfected. Chrome, Nickel, and Bronze are created with up to 30 layers of metal plating over solid brass for maximum durability.Living Finishes are aged 6 to 12 months and will continually change over time to reveal a classic vintage feel.

	For the most reliable and long lasting finish, choose a piece with Baldwin's Lifetime PVD finish. PVD stands for physical vapor deposition, which offers a superior quality, especially in coastal areas. The creation process includes adding a formula of layered nickel alloys to protect against aging and to provide high levels of resistance to corrosion from air with high salt. Baldwin pioneered the Lifetime PVD finishes for decorative hardware. Baldwin is the only manufacturer that has lifetime finishes in Satin and Polished Nickel.

Handing



X

Handing is a term used to describe which way a door handle turns. To
    determine the handing of a door, stand on the outside of the room you are
    going to enter. For example, if you are entering your house, stand outside
    the house entirely; if you are considering your bathroom door, stand in the
    room that connects to the bathroom. Face the door. Notice which side the
    hinges are on.


Door Swings Inward

Left handing - The hinges are on the left
Right handing - The hinges are on the right




Door Swings Outward

Left hand reverse - The hinges are on the left

Door Thickness

Door Thickness




Most interior doors are 1-3/8 inches
            thick, while most exterior doors measure 1-3/4 inches. If your door
            is thicker than this, you may need an
            additional component known as a 'thick door kit.'

Backset




The backset describes the length of
            the latch itself. To determine this, start at the edge of the door
            and measure out to the center of the borehole drilled in your
            door.

Center to Center
Center to Center is the measurement from the center of the top bore hole to the center of the bottom bore hole. Most commonly this measurement is 5-1/2". If your door has an uncommon center to center, consider a Sectional Handleset which will work on any Center to Center.

Handing



X
Handing

Handing is a term used to describe which way a door handle turns. To
    determine the handing of a door, stand on the outside of the room you are
    going to enter. For example, if you are entering your house, stand outside
    the house entirely; if you are considering your bathroom door, stand in the
    room that connects to the bathroom. Face the door. Notice which side the
    hinges are on.


Door Swings Inward

Left handing - The hinges are on the left
Right handing - The hinges are on the right




Door Swings Outward

Left hand reverse - The hinges are on the left
Right hand reverse - The hinges are on the right

Solid Construction



X
Solid Construction


Solid Construction is used to describe products composed entirely from a premium material like brass, stainless steel or bronze, and manufactured as one solid piece, with no hollow spaces or interior gaps. Representing a significant increase in quality, these products are typically more expensive than both their hollow counterparts and those that use lesser metals like zinc or aluminum. Heavier, more durable, and often times naturally corrosion resistant, they are made to last a lifetime and the difference is noticeable.

28 Degree Latch



X
28 Degree Latch
A 28 Degree Latch requires less rotation than a standard latch, fully retracting at 28 degrees. This provides smoother operation and a more ergonomic feel when turning the handle.








										28 Degree Latch

Concealed Screws



X
Concealed Screws
On many knobs and levers, the screws that mount the hardware on the door are visible on the interior. Concealed Screws means that these screws are hidden behind the rosette, providing a cleaner more decorative look to your door hardware.

Solid Construction



X
Solid Construction


Solid Construction is used to describe products composed entirely from a premium material like brass, stainless steel or bronze, and manufactured as one solid piece, with no hollow spaces or interior gaps. Representing a significant increase in quality, these products are typically more expensive than both their hollow counterparts and those that use lesser metals like zinc or aluminum. Heavier, more durable, and often times naturally corrosion resistant, they are made to last a lifetime and the difference is noticeable.

Concealed Screws

Concealed Screws
On many knobs and levers, the screws that mount the hardware on the door are visible on the interior. Concealed Screws means that these screws are hidden behind the rosette, providing a cleaner more decorative look to your door hardware.

28 Degree Latch



X
28 Degree Latch
A 28 Degree Latch requires less rotation than a standard latch, fully retracting at 28 degrees. This provides smoother operation and a more ergonomic feel when turning the handle.

Door Thickness

Door Thickness




Most interior doors are 1-3/8 inches
            thick, while most exterior doors measure 1-3/4 inches. If your door
            is thicker than this, you may need an
            additional component known as a 'thick door kit.'

Backset




The backset describes the length of
            the latch itself. To determine this, start at the edge of the door
            and measure out to the center of the borehole drilled in your
            door.
