We undertake no obligation to update or to revise the information provided on this call as a result of new information or future results or developments.
Today, Richard Pops will provide introductory remarks. Jim Frates will then discuss our financial results; and Richard will close with a brief update on the company. After remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Richard.
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
That's great. Thank you, Eva. Good morning everyone. So, since our release last month of the top-line results of the first two FORWARD efficacy studies for ALKS 5461 for major depressive disorder, we've talked to many of you, in some cases, multiple times, but I still wanted to start today's call by acknowledging the significant decline in our stock price and in the biotech market in general, and reaffirming the strength of our company. The first is, we built this company to last, to be able to withstand and even thrive in tough market conditions, and to endure setbacks in any of our development programs.
Our business is comprised of a portfolio of differentiated commercial products, novel product candidates in development and substantial and growing revenue streams. We built this over many years, and we're continuously adapting it in order to create additional value.
In the current environment, the resiliency of Alkermes becomes apparent. We have a robust and growing base business, generating more than $400 million of manufacturing and royalty revenues from our partners; J&J, AstraZeneca, Biogen and Acorda, for patented medicines that will persist into the 2020s.
On top of this base, we're launching ARISTADA into a rapidly growing long-acting atypical antipsychotic market, bring distinctive features important to physicians, nurses, and patients at a time when the huge economic burden and human suffering associated with schizophrenia is becoming even more evident in our communities.

The most directly comparable product in terms of flexibility and dosing features, INVEGA SUSTENNA, is already a $1.3 billion drug in the U.S. and growing rapidly. VIVITROL is beginning to hit its stride, generating nearly $145 million of revenue last year and growing at a 40% rate, providing a one-of-a-kind treatment alternative for opioid dependence at a time when politicians at the federal and state level, the media, and healthcare and criminal justice systems around the country are mobilizing to address what has become a national crisis. We have great expectations for this medicine and it's gratifying to see the numbers beginning to bear this out.
So from a financial and strategic perspective, we believe we've never been stronger. We are in a phase of launching and growing products, and growing revenues off of an already-strong foundation. We're diversified, we have plenty of cash, and we're building capabilities for the future in very distinctive segments of huge therapeutic markets.
The second point is with respect to our development pipeline. We have arguably one of the most diverse medically and economically important late-stage CNS pipelines in the industry. We're tackling serious chronic diseases with devastating consequences for patients and families and we're making excellent progress.
Three medicines are in pivotal study, ALKS 5461, for major depressive disorder, ALKS 3831 for schizophrenia, and ALKS 8700 for multiple sclerosis. Each of these is based on a foundation of scientific evidence that is substantial and growing. This is true for 5461. As you've heard me say over the last several weeks, we believe that we're dialing in on the dosing, testing and analysis of 5461 in the setting of treatment-resistant depression.
We've had time to analyze the data more completely and share it with experts who were more convinced than ever that we have unambiguous evidence of activity. At the same time, I've also told you that you should be skeptical as to whether FORWARD-5 will be successful as it's clear that we have not eliminated a potential for high placebo response even with our advanced study designs.
But you should know that our scientists, statisticians and clinicians are excited to keep going. This is science, we're learning and adapting in a difficult indication where many, if not most, active drugs frequently fail to separate from placebo in clinical trials. We would stop in a second if we thought this medicine did not have the chance to potentially help many, many people suffering from a very serious condition. But we believe that it does, and we think it's revealing itself through these experiments.
I'm going to turn the call over to Jim now to provide the financial overview and guidance. But I wanted to set the stage this morning with this perspective. This is a very strong company, and we're in the process of building it into something special. When Jim is finished, I'll have some additional detail on the individual elements of the commercial and development portfolios.
I'll give it to Jim.
James M. Frates - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Richard. Good morning everyone. 2015 was an important year for us. We continued the evolution from a business built around partnered products to a proprietary model that would drive our own top-line growth marked by the expanded use of VIVITROL and our newest proprietary product ARISTADA, which received FDA approval and was subsequently launched in October.
We also continue to invest in our future growth, by advancing our late-stage pipeline of CNS medicines. Financially, our results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 2015 were in line with our expectations and were characterized by strong revenues from our base business of commercial products and focused investments both in our proprietary commercial portfolio and in our pipeline. We believe our strong and growing commercial business, together with our diversified CNS pipeline, will drive significant growth and profitability over the next few years.

Let's start with our key financial highlights. In 2015, we generated total revenues of $628 million, a 12% increase over last year, when we exclude our divested Gainesfield business, and we recorded a $53 million non-GAAP net loss. For the fourth quarter, our total revenues were $163 million and we recorded a non-GAAP net loss of approximately $23 million.
Let me now review some of the key drivers of our financial performance during the quarter, starting with VIVITROL, our novel once-monthly injectable product for the treatment of opioid and alcohol dependence.
In the fourth quarter, VIVITROL had net sales of $38 million, compared to approximately $30 million for the same period last year, demonstrating growth of 29%. On a sequential quarter basis, unit growth was 7% while net sales growth was 1% as a result of increased Medicaid reserves in the fourth order, as our government business accelerated.
This is a positive development, showing our success in accessing this important public payer market, which will be a key part of VIVITROL's long-term growth. If we look at the net sales growth for VIVITROL over the entire year, the underlying trend is more apparent, where VIVITROL grew 53% year-over-year.
Turning to 2016, we expect VIVITROL net sales to range from $180 million to $200 million, representing top-end growth of nearly 40% and reflecting our belief that VIVITROL is still early in its growth phase.
Let me just elaborate a moment on the trends that we see behind the accelerating growth in VIVITROL. It's being driven by two main factors, the commercial business and the public sector. First on the commercial side, physicians' and systems' increased experience using our product is driving more adoption and we've seen a steady expansion of the depth and breadth of the key accounts using VIVITROL.
Our commercial business is growing at a steady rate of 20% across the country with certain states growing as much as 58% where key plans have improved access by changing prior authorizations and fail-first policies.
Second, we're beginning to see our work in the public sector lead to increased treatment with VIVITROL. Growth in state-funded and Medicaid programs is accelerating. As an example, our Medicaid business doubled this year and now makes up almost 30% of our total business. This is encouraging for us because in large measure this is where the majority of patients are covered and we believe we're still only in the early stages of tapping into this important market.
Turning to ARISTADA, we see the long-acting injectable, or LAI, market in schizophrenia as another exciting opportunity where our medication can support patient care in a market that is currently plagued by poor outcomes.
We believe our launch is off to an excellent start. Our team of 175 territory business managers is targeting a well-defined group of physicians who have a history of prescribing LAIs for the treatment of schizophrenia. And while prescriptions in these early weeks number in the hundreds, we have distributed more than 11,000 samples nationwide to meet the request of healthcare providers, treating patients in the outpatient setting and in our Hospital Inpatient Trial Program.
These programs will play an important role in raising awareness about the attributes of ARISTADA and we believe they will help us achieve long-term success. The key to this market is securing access to reimbursement, and this happens gradually over the course of the calendar year.
Because of the patchwork of Medicare Part D, Managed Medicaid, and Medicaid fee-for-service plans in all 50 states, we expect to have more than 200 planned meetings in 2016 with more than 50 happening in the first quarter alone with payer decisions to be made over the next few months. We're confident that our commercial team has in-depth knowledge of the commercial dynamics here, and a sophisticated strategy to address them to assure a successful launch.

As a result of this work, we're off to a solid start for ARISTADA with $4.6 million of net sales, which included wholesaler stocking. We would also – excuse me, we would expect Q1 2016 sales to be lower sequentially over this past quarter due to inventory drawdown, as well as a normal launch process of gaining formulary access.
Looking more broadly at 2016 for ARISTADA, we'll provide more specific net sales guidance during the year as we gain further experience with the launch. We would note as a reference point that the most recent product launched in the LAI class achieved U.S. net sales of around $60 million for the second through fifth quarters of its launch. And we believe the shape of its launch curve and early results are a reasonable benchmark for ARISTADA's early launch phase.
Moving on to our key partner products, we saw overall revenues of $401 million in 2015, an increase of 10% from last year. Revenues were driven by $250 million from our partnered long-acting atypical franchise and $105 million from AMPYRA and FAMPYRA.
In terms of expenses, our total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $230 million, compared to approximately $191 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by the focused investment in clinical studies, investment in the launch of ARISTADA, and investment in profitable growth of VIVITROL.
For the full year, we had R&D expenses of approximately $344 million and SG&A expenses of approximately $312 million. Turning ahead to 2016, we expect R&D expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $400 million.
This expectation reflects investment in the recently initiated pivotal development programs for ALKS 3831 and ALKS 8700, while also continuing the ongoing FORWARD-5 efficacy study for ALKS 5461, as well as the advancement of our earlier-stage candidates, ALKS 7119 and RDB 1450 into the clinic.
For SG&A, we expect to be in the range of $360 million to $390 million. This increase is primarily driven by the full year cost of the ARISTADA field sales team.
Turning to our balance sheet, we're in a strong position and ended the fourth quarter of 2015 with close to $800 million in cash in total investments and approximately $350 million in debt.
So, looking forward to 2016, we're well-positioned to execute on our plans to drive the next stage of Alkermes' growth while maintaining our financial strength.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Richard.
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
That's excellent. Thank you, Jim. Let me wrap up quickly with a review of our business and some of our upcoming milestones and let's start with ARISTADA.
As you heard Jim say, the nationwide launch is well underway and early returns are good. Physician feedback on the product has been encouraging and consistent with our expectations.
ARISTADA embodies key attributes important to patients and healthcare providers. Efficacy, flexibility with a range of doses and durations and a simple, ready-to-use format. We designed ARISTADA to have features that address the real-world needs of patients and healthcare professionals. That pursuit continues with the positive news on the potential two-month dosing regimen of ARISTADA that we announced this morning.
Based on these results, we plan to submit a supplemental NDA in the second half of 2016 for the 1064 milligram dose, which will expand the current offering to three dosing intervals, four weeks, six weeks, and eight weeks. This is an unprecedented range of options for treatment with aripiprazole.
The opportunity that ARISTADA represents for us is clear, it's transformed our commercial presence, and has established a new foundation for our growth. It's an important medicine, well-positioned to compete in a $2 billion U.S. market that is growing rapidly, and has the clear potential to become our most significant product yet.

Moving now to VIVITROL, we are seeing a groundswell of enthusiasm and clearly expanding use of this medicine. It's growing because of its increasing use in a wide variety of settings, as the U.S. treatment system begins to change in response to the growing prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.
What's most exciting is how an expanding array of states, counties, and municipalities are beginning to integrate the use of VIVITROL into their criminal justice and healthcare systems. More than 100 programs are ongoing in 30 states, many of which are just getting going. These are the harbingers of the future and have the potential to dramatically change and expand the way addiction is addressed in our society.
VIVITROL is a one-of-a-kind product, on patent until 2029, whose value is coming into focus. So in many ways, we see this as just the beginning for VIVITROL.
Now, on to ALKS 5461, our once-daily oral investigational medicine for patients with major depressive disorder and an inadequate response to standard therapies. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that we are dialing in on the dosing, evaluation and analysis of 5461. While we did not meet the pre-specified primary endpoint for either FORWARD-3 or FORWARD-4, the two studies provided us with a wealth of new data from over 800 patients.
We have been analyzing results and feel quite confident that ALKS 5461 administered as the 2 mg/2 mg dose continues to show clear signs of efficacy. We see FORWARD-4 as a supportive study. And its comparison to FORWARD-3 is instructive.
We're excited to share this data with you and the scientific community, and we've submitted the results to the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology Meeting or ASCP which will take place at the end of May. This was just recently accepted for an oral presentation.
The path forward is as follows; FORWARD-5 continues to enroll; we have a significant increment of new data to inform our analysis plan. We will increase the study size slightly and now plan to enroll approximately 420 patients, and we should report top-line data by year end 2016.
In the case of a clear positive outcome for FORWARD-5, we will proceed to meeting with FDA. We believe the evidence provided by a positive FORWARD-5 trial and a previously completed successful randomized placebo-controlled Phase 2 study, together with supportive evidence from FORWARD-4 collectively could provide substantial evidence of efficacy for 5461 in the treatment of major depressive disorder.
Developing new drugs for the treatment of refractory depression is difficult and it's risky. We're clearly not immune to that, but it's also important. We believe that we're harnessing one of most compelling new mechanisms for treating this disease in the past 30 years. Millions of patients stand to benefit.
We think we're going to figure this out. We may not. And if the data begins to suggest that we're wrong, we'll stop. But I want you to know that we're far from that today.
Turning now to ALKS 3831, our novel oral broad-spectrum antipsychotic drug candidate for the treatment of schizophrenia. Both of the core studies in the Phase 3 program are now underway. The first is a four-week study, evaluating the antipsychotic properties of 3831 in approximately 390 patients with schizophrenia.
The second study initiated two weeks ago is evaluating weight gain with ALKS 3831 compared to olanzapine in approximately 540 patients with stable schizophrenia over six months.
These two core studies will enroll throughout 2016 and, like we've done with past clinical programs, we will update you on our progress and our estimated completion window as we get further underway.
This is a very streamlined registration program for an exciting new medicine for schizophrenia, one with the potential to bring the proven efficacy of olanzapine with a differentiated safety profile, with favorable weight and metabolic properties.

Beyond these two studies, we're further interested in elucidating the metabolic profile of ALKS 3831. Our preclinical work has demonstrated that 3831 has favorable metabolic properties compared to olanzapine, and we're gaining an understanding of samidorphan's role in mitigating olanzapine's central and peripheral effects.
We plan to conduct a metabolic study of ALKS 3831 in adult volunteers as part of the pivotal program later this year. Also enrolling in its pivotal program is ALKS 8700, our monomethyl fumarate, or MMF, for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
8700 is an oral molecule that's designed to rapidly and efficiently convert to MMF in the body, and offer differentiated features as compared to the current marketed dimethyl fumarate, TECFIDERA.
Our registration pathway is based on a 505(b)(2) strategy referencing TECFIDERA. Pharmacokinetic bridging studies, as well as a two-year safety study in approximately 600 patients with MS, are underway.
In addition, we're very interested in determining the gastrointestinal tolerability of 8700 compared to TECFIDERA. So we're choosing to conduct a randomized head-to-head comparison in approximately 420 patients, which we plan to initiate mid-2016. We expect to be able to submit the NDA for ALKS 8700 in 2018.
Beyond the pivotal stage clinical programs, we continue to develop compelling new medicines from our R&D engine. Two earlier-stage candidates are moving into man (20:09) this year, ALKS 7119 and RDB 1450. For 1450, our immuno-oncology candidate, we will file the IND this quarter and plan to initiate clinical testing in the second quarter.
ALKS 7119, our novel chemical entity for the treatment of Alzheimer's agitation and other psychiatric indications, is now in the clinic. We expect data from the study in the second half of this year.
So, in conclusion, the business is strong with a major product launch underway with ARISTADA, VIVITROL continuing to grow, a diversified and growing base business, and three late-stage development candidates in pivotal development, we're incredibly excited about the prospects for Alkermes in 2016 and beyond.
So I'll finish there and turn it back over to Eva for questions.
Eva Stroynowski - Investor Relations Contact
Thanks, Richard. We'll now take your questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And from Barclays we have Jon Eckard on the line. Please go ahead.
Jonathan M. Eckard - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Jon.
Jonathan M. Eckard - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Real quick on VIVITROL guidance for 2016. Based on the 30% Medicaid mix that Jim referenced, what does the new guidance reflect with regards to unit growth versus dollar growth because of the change in the gross and net? And I have a question on ARISTADA after.
James M. Frates - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Jon, good morning. It's Jim. I won't go into specifics on the unit growth, obviously because we're giving a range. But it actually contemplates continued rapid growth in the share of Medicaid business that we're getting. So I think that's why you're seeing – we feel like VIVITROL is doing very well. Its growth has accelerated from 2014 into 2015 in terms of units and we still see that unit growth accelerating at those rates going forward, a little bit less growth maybe on net sales, because again, the Medicaid proportion is still growing fast. Does that make sense?
Jonathan M. Eckard - Barclays Capital, Inc.
It does, thank you.
James M. Frates - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah.
Jonathan M. Eckard - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And then quickly to you again, Jim, your comments about the ABILIFY MAINTENA quarters two through five being like a reasonable guide or proxy to – for an ARISTADA launch.

James M. Frates - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah.
Jonathan M. Eckard - Barclays Capital, Inc.
I'm guessing that number for what you're saying for ARISTADA, would exclude the 11,000 samples that you referenced? And, based on your competitive intelligence, what's the level of sampling that was done with ABILIFY MAINTENA so that we could do a more clear apples-to-apples comparison for the demand of the two products?
James M. Frates - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. That's really an important point, Jon. I'm glad you asked about it. So, there wasn't a sample program that our competitor launched with back in 2013. And first, let me take a further step back. They launched in March. If you remember, we obviously launched in October. As we are moving into our quarters two through five, as you line up the launch curves, it makes sense to look at their quarters two through five, right? That's trying to line up apples-to-apples.
The thing that's different is we have 11,000 samples in the field and they had zero. So all their demand came through net sales, which is obviously going to be part of that roughly $60 million for the first year. And we haven't yet seen our samples start to pull through. So, that's one of the things – it's one of the reasons why we may be trailing now, but it's also one of the things that our market research showed us that was really, really important, is that people want to be able to use samples and, before the reimbursement gets worked out, they want to be able to use it in the right patients and their practice and that's where they can use samples.
So, it's not exactly apples-to-apples, but, again, we're early in the launch phase. These are just guides, and we think that the important point is that the full year of reimbursement cycle that we need to get through these government payers before people start to make conclusions about how big the long-term potential in this product is.
Jonathan M. Eckard - Barclays Capital, Inc.
If I could squeeze in one quick. I noticed that the scripts for ARISTADA are mainly – are mostly driven towards a high dose, is there anything to look into for – from that mix of the different doses that being used? And that would be my end. Thank you very much.
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hey Jon, it's Rich. I'll just take that one. Yeah, it's interesting to see that some of the first trials that we're getting from physicians using ARISTADA has been to take patients that have not been getting adequate clinical coverage from other medicines and trying them on a higher dose. And early returns are they're getting a good experience with that.
We think that's great. I think at equilibrium, we expect a more even distribution across the doses, but I think the fact that we're starting at 882 mg with so many first trials, represents a need in the marketplace.
Jonathan M. Eckard - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thank you very much.

From Leerink, we have Paul Matteis on the line. Please, go ahead.
Paul A. Matteis - Leerink Partners LLC
Great. Thanks very much. Can you hear me okay?
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Paul.
Paul A. Matteis - Leerink Partners LLC
Great. Thank you. I have a few. One is on 5461. I'm wondering – so you talked about FORWARD-4 being supported at a study of the 2 mg/2 mg dose, to the degree that you're able, could you expound upon the actual magnitude of drug placebo difference you saw in that study, in light of other drugs like SEROQUEL and ABILIFY that saw two point to three point differences on the (25:36) between them and placebo?
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I won't, other than to say we think it's a very healthy response and you'll see the data when we present the data at ASCP. And so why don't we talk about it as you see it. Because what I really want people to understand is that these analyses of FORWARD-4 are only really relevant in the context of a submission that would come with a positive FORWARD-5 or a subsequent study.

So, in that setting, I think that you'll be able to take a look at the data and make your own conclusions. But I think there's very little ambiguity from our perspective and our KOL perspective the 2 mg/2 mg dose is separating really nicely in FORWARD-4.
Paul A. Matteis - Leerink Partners LLC
Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, you, Rich, and I'm not sure if you specified this in your prepared remarks, but for FORWARD-5 you talked about making a few changes. One of them was increasing the end, and another one was actually tweaking the stats plan. So for increasing the end, I know one concern was the potential for an associated increase in variability. So maybe you could address that.
And secondarily, with the stats change you've made, can you just confirm that the new statistical analysis plan for this study would be something that you think the FDA would okay and has approved other drugs in this area?
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think it's a fairly obvious statement that we wouldn't submit a stat plan if we didn't think the FDA would approve them also. In fact, the final stat plan has not even been submitted for FORWARD-5, so it's flexible up until the time that we underlined. But, what was the first part of the question, I forgot that?
Paul A. Matteis - Leerink Partners LLC
Just the end, and does that include (27:03)?
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
That's right. Yeah, the decision we made to increase the end is really based on kind of looking the way the study is proceeding right now. So, we would not add new sites or new investigators in order to drive them. So this is kind of a naturalistic, logical landing place if we let the well-enrolling sites that are doing a good job continue on their enrollment path for a reasonable period of time.
So that's why I'd say it's a gentle increase in the sample size. The studies architecture is still its basic architecture and so, I think that the primary change will come from this modest increase in sample size and a more refined statistical plan that incorporates the learnings from the additional 800 patients' worth of data.
Paul A. Matteis - Leerink Partners LLC
Okay. Thanks for taking my question.
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

From JP Morgan we have Cory Kasimov on line. Please go ahead.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I just – I guess, Rich, want to first follow up on FORWARD-5 and just try to get a better sense of, what ultimately drives the decision to modify the statistical plan and analysis for that study? Is it just the continued learnings that you're getting from 3 and 4, is it – are you waiting for feedback from kind of your consultants on that? Or it's – because it sounds like this kind of has been ongoing – a decision hasn't been finalized yet. I'm wondering kind of what the additional variables or inputs are that may make that decision for you.
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think it's not particularly esoteric. It's just the fact that when we first designed this statistical analysis for FORWARD-3 and 4 it was based on a 142-patient randomized study in Stage 2 – in Phase 2, which was quite successful. But that's a certain-sized data set and we provide the way of modeling the two curves.
Now, with another 800 patients' worth of data, we just have a more nuanced way of looking at the analytical plan over that distribution. So, I think it's really just a way you do the math.
And we'll continue to refine it statistically and figure out the best way to do it. And what I'm also struck by is the fact within FORWARD-4, recall that we tested three – there were three treatment arms, there was placebo, there was the 2 mg/2 mg dose, as well as the 0.5 mg/0.5 mg dose which was ineffective in that study.

So, within the setting of a single study, we can actually can see what an efficacious dose looks like at 2 mg/2 mg and ineffective dose of 0.5 mg/0.5 mg compared to placebo. So, we're just getting a little bit able more resolution statistically in the best way to model this and to demonstrate the difference in a large study.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, all right. Great. And then quickly on ARISTADA, really just wondered if you could characterize the physician feedback your sales force has gotten on the product. You guys have been very clear for some time on the marketing message that you'd have and the differentiating features, how has that been resonating with doctors and considering that you're going into – you're at least initially targeting prescribers of LAIs, is there much education or do they kind of get it right away?
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think it's really consistent with what we would have hoped for given the kind of explicit differences and attributes that ARISTADA has versus the competition.
And the point I made about the 882 mg, I think underscores – I think it's probably the most interesting new learning since we've been in the real world of the marketplace, which is how many physicians are interested in exploring that higher dose.
But the fact that we have this range of intervals, the existence of the six-week dosing interval is instructive, because it's not just the physicians say, I can go ahead and dose it every six weeks. It reflects the fact that there's a little bit more dosing forgiveness on the back end, because the PK profile is different than other products. So the fact that 882 mg can be dosed every six weeks just underscores the fact that we've got a different wave form of presentation in ARISTADA.
So I think the flexibility of three doses, and that being underscored by the range of intervals. And then, of course, while not in the marketplace at all, but I think today's data on the two-month at a higher mass just underscores the fact that ARISTADA is going to be a really, really robust product family, more analogous to what SUSTENNA has brought to the market on the risperidone side.
And that's a $1 billion drug in the U.S. and growing rapidly. And I think that we've mimicked those features and that flexibility in the ARISTADA side of – in the aripiprazole side of the market, and that's why we're so confident against the backdrop of a market that's growing so rapidly, given the features that we have in the product that are kind of self-evident. You don't really need to explain them at great length and to draw distinction between one dose and multiple doses, and multiple durations. I think we're going to do just fine.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
You're welcome.

From Jefferies, we have Biren Amin. Please go ahead.
Biren Amin - Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks guys for taking my question. On the ARISTADA two-month data, are you planning at all to – evaluating a switch study from MAINTENA to this two-month dosing schedule as a way of potentially transitioning and trying to convert patients away from MAINTENA?
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think the switches from MAINTENA will come naturally, based on limitations that physicians are seeing with MAINTENA to the extent those exist. Now, I think that the two-month is really, as you've heard us say before, Biren, you think about it this way. If you're going to initiate a patient on a LAI, initiating one on one like ARISTADA, where if your patient is compliant and enjoying being on that medicine, you can cut their number of injections in half each year. That's really the offering rather than we're going to try to shift the market toward two-month. In the same way that we see in INVEGA, SUSTENNA's three-month we think the two-month will do that for us as well.

So, I guess, the answer to your question, which I didn't answer directly, which is, no, I don't see immediately, we'll leave it to the team. I don't think immediately the need to run the study, to switch people from MAINTENA.

Operator, it looks like we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. From UBS we have Marc Goodman. Please go ahead.
Ami Fadia - UBS Securities LLC
Hi, good morning. This is Ami Fadia on behalf of Marc. Couple of questions, firstly, on ARISTADA, in your guidance – well, you didn't give specific guidance. But, as you thought about your 2016 guidance, how much more sampling are you anticipating in 2016? And if you could just give us the amount of inventory stocking in the fourth quarter, that would be helpful. And then I have another one.
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Ami, why can't you ask a question on behalf of Ami? No, we're not going to disclose our sampling plan, that's competitive in 2016. Jim, did you want to answer that?
James M. Frates - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Well, and I would say on inventory – again, I mentioned, I think, there has been some stocking. Obviously, that's being worked through. We think the second quarter of launch, this 2016's first quarter will be down a little bit from last year. But, again, we won't give specifics. I think IMS has started to track the data quite nicely. And, again, these are very small numbers. So through the year, we're quite comfortable. We don't think there are high inventory levels right now.
Ami Fadia - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So, now, all the sort of prescriptions are being pulled through?
James M. Frates - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I think that's a fair statement. And again, in a normal base, because it's going to be growing much more than we believed than the $4.5 million in sales we saw last quarter.
Ami Fadia - UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then just another question on 5461, have you had conversations with the FDA around kind of some of the outcomes of the FORWARD studies and how the FDA might look at a positive FORWARD-5 study along with Phase 2, would that be enough for them to really approve a drug?
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we will. We haven't yet. One of the reasons we want to present at ASCP is that the FDA typically attends ASCP. It's a fairly small community of folks that are involved in these studies around major depressive disorder.
But what we would do with a positive FORWARD-5, well we have a pre-NDA meeting with FDA, and discuss the filing package. But we – yes, we do think it would be sufficient and based on historical precedent, we think that there's a pathway absolutely for 5 and for successful registration based on that clinical trial program.
Ami Fadia - UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then just thirdly on VIVITROL, the drug has been continuing to grow nicely. Have you changed your thinking around the sales resources behind that product? Do you need to put in more? Or do you feel like it's at a steady-state and you don't need to and you could probably repurpose some of them towards ARISTADA or some other product?
Richard F. Pops - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think that there's a couple different alternatives in there. One thing we're not going to do is repurpose people. What's happening with VIVITROL, VIVITROL has an enormous amount of excitement within our commercial team and I think increasingly in the country. And it's still promoted in the U.S. with a very small team of people in the field, on the order of 70 people. What we've been augmenting over the past couple years has not the field team as much as it's been on the policy at the state and the federal level, and that's going to continue.

I think there's no question that if VIVITROL continues to grow at this rate, we will expand the field base force, as what happens typically is a territory will get particularly lively and we'll break a particular territory into two, as opposed to opening new parts of the country that were not being covered. So I think it will happen organically, and all of that's embodied in the guidance that Jim has given you.
Eva Stroynowski - Investor Relations Contact

Good morning, and welcome to the Alkermes Plc First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Call. My name is Brandon, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded.
And I will now turn it over to Sandra Coombs, Director of Investor Relations. Sandra, you may begin.
Sandra Coombs
Thank you. Welcome to the Alkermes Plc conference call to discuss our first quarter 2017 financial results. With me today, are Richard Pops, our CEO; and Jim Frates, our CFO.
Before we begin, I encourage, everyone, to go to the Investors section of alkermes.com to find our press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. We believe the non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business.
Our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please see our press release and 10-Q issued today and also our 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise the information provided on this call as a result of new information or future results or developments.
Today, Jim Frates will discuss our financial results and Richard Pops will provide an update on the company. After our remarks, we'll open the call for Q&A.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim.
James M. Frates
Thanks, Sandy. Good morning, everyone. During the first quarter we continued to execute on our business strategy and our results reflect strong year-over-year growth driven by our proprietary products. We remain confident in our financial expectations for the year which we are reiterating today.
During Q1 our sequential quarter-over-quarter unique growth for VIVITROL and ARISTADA were somewhat mashed by our net sales results and I'll explain that more in a moment.
Let me start with an overview of our key financial highlights. During the first quarter we generated total revenues of $191.8 million and recorded a $27.9 million non-GAAP net loss. In the quarter VIVITROL had net sales of $58.5 million compared to $43.8 million for the same period last year demonstrating growth of approximately 33% driven by underlying unit growth of 43% and robust expansion across the country.
Typically, first quarter net sales are impacted by deductable resets in commercial plans that happen at the beginning of the year and inventory build at our wholesalers during the preceding fourth quarter. The inventory build of $3 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 was largely worked down during the first quarter.
Adjusting for these inventory fluctuations on a sequential basis VIVITROL units grew approximately 4%. With channel inventory at current levels and the commercial insurance plan deductible reset behind us we expected growth rates to accelerate throughout the year and we are reiterating our expectations for VIVITROL net sales in the range of $280 to $300 million in 2017.
The underlying fundamentals of VIVITROL's growth and potential are strong. Since our year end results call in February we've seen a number of state expand from approximately 400 programs in 36 days to nearly 450 programs in 39 states. The robust growth of these programs which range from public health initiatives to criminal justice programs in drug courts, prisons and jails represents a leading indicator of the sustained growth of VIVITROL.

Further, last year the comprehensive addiction recovery act and the 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law and we'll begin to see the initial impact of these major pieces of legislation later this year as state access funding and implement new treatment programs to address the opioid epidemic.
Turning to ARISTADA the launch continues to gain traction in the growing long acting atypical market with $18 million of net sales during the first quarter. As with VIVITROL the underlying growth of ARISTADA was somewhat obscured in our net sales results. During the first quarter ARISTADA prescriptions grew approximately 16% compared to the fourth quarter.
In March contracting for two major payer plans SilverScript, and WellCare took effect. Together, these two plans open up a significant pool of patients representing 35% of the Medicare Part D market. As these payer contracts took effect, gross to net deductions increased during the quarter. Additionally inventory in the channel stayed flat from the end of 2016 after sequentially increasing each quarter since launch.
Looking ahead to the second quarter we expect the net sales will be in the range of $19 million to $21 million. Our Q2 expectations reflect a lower average selling price as the contracting that took effect in March is in place for a full quarter and ARISTADA sales volumes increased in these channels.
Net sales should track prescription and unit growth more closely in the second half of the year as gross to net adjustments to the payer mix stabilize. Also in the second quarter we expect the approval for the 1064 mg two-month dose in June and are preparing for that launch shortly thereafter.
We're making steady progress and we're optimistic about ARISTADA as our growth in new prescribers and the depth of prescriptions among our highest users continues to increase. In March our market share for new prescriptions in the long-acting aripiprazole market grew to approximately 20% compared to 10% in March of last year. When healthcare providers use ARISTADA they appreciate its unique attributes and we remain on track with our expectations for net sales to increase by at least 100% this year.
Moving on to our key partner products, we saw overall revenues of $101.5 million in the first quarter compared to $93.4 million in the first quarter of last year. This included manufacturing and royalty revenues of $60 million related to RISPERDAL CONSTA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and INVEGA TRINZA compared to $54.7 million for the same period last year.
For AMPYRA and FAMPYRA we recorded manufacturing and royalty revenues of $29.2 million during the first quarter compared to $28.2 million for the same period last year. Generic competition to AMPYRA is expected in July of 2018 and at this time our total revenue guidance for 2017 is not affected.
In terms of expenses, our total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 were $262.6 million compared to $233.7 million for the same period last year reflecting targeted investments in our late-stage pipeline and in our commercial infrastructure to support the growth of our proprietary products as well as increased manufacturing activity.
Turning to our balance sheet, we're in a strong position and entered the first quarter of 2017 with approximately $590 million in cash and total investments. The financial underpinnings of our business are solid. We look forward to accelerating the growth of our proprietary products and executing on our development pipeline to deliver our important medicines to patients.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Richard.
Richard F. Pops
Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. Our commercial portfolio and our late-stage pipeline are in a state of rapid evolution. VIVITROL and ARISTADA are growing and they'll continue to do so because they are important differentiated products addressing profound societal needs which are only becoming more prominent. From an operational perspective the commercial and development teams are full throttle and excited to be fielding data and capabilities around medicines with incredible long-term potential.

In the fields we operate in serious mental illness and addiction things take time, but you can see from our experience with VIVITROL and in the long-acting injectable antipsychotic market that good medicines priced fairly were built steadily over time.
As you heard in Jim's remarks, the trends underlying VIVITROL's potential and growth are strong and supported by the activation of policymakers at the local, state and federal levels. Just yesterday Health and Human Services Secretary, Tom Price visited our Wilmington, Ohio facility to learn more about VIVITROL and Alkermes commitment to the treatment of addiction.
The opioid epidemic is affecting every state and district across the country. Advancing treatment and prevention strategies have become national, political, health and criminal justice issues with bipartisan support. VIVITROL is in the central part of that discussion and it was inspiring for the whole company to hear the Secretary recognize our dedication to this field and our growing impact on it.
Turning to ARISTADA, our long-acting injectable atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia, like addiction, approving the treatment of serious mental illness is a national priority and long-acting injectable treatments are growing in importance for both medical and economic reasons.
We designed ARISTADA for market leadership and we continue to build the ARISTADA product family to provide more options and flexibility for patients, physicians, and payers. This continues with the expected approval of the 1064 mg two-month dose in June which would add to our current offerings of once monthly and once every six-week dosing options. This will be the only two-month antipsychotic on the market and our launch preparations are well underway.
Now on to the late-stage pipeline, we have three late-stage candidates approaching registration or completion of the pivotal programs. This pipeline is moving quickly and we expect a number of important milestones in the next few months.
I'll start with ALKS 5461. We're developing 5461 as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of major depressive disorder in patients not achieving adequate clinical response to their first-line therapy. It's important to understand the clinical context. These patients are several weeks or months into their major depressive episode and can experience debilitating and potentially fatal symptoms of their disease. Treatment options are limited and introduce new and significant risks.
ALKS 5461 is doing different things for patients than other depression medications. It is a well-established that the guidance [ph] opioid system is intimately involved in motivation, social connection and resiliency and that its function is dis-regulated in the context of major depression and other psychiatric disorders. 5461 is specifically designed for therapeutic benefit via the endogenous opioid system while avoiding the risk of abuse, dependence and addiction associated with opiate agonists.
We did this specifically and intentionally by including a prudent opioid antagonist component. This is a fast-track designated medicine. With the pivotal program completed, we've requested the pre-NDA meeting and we expect it to occur in the late June or early July timeframe. We're preparing the new drug application and are on track to submit the NDA later this year. Our belief in the safety and efficacy of 5461 is based on data. Last year we presented data from FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 at ASCP.
In May we will present the balance of the data from the FORWARD pivotal program at the Society of Biological Psychiatry Medical Meeting and will host a webcast conference call for analysts and investors. These data will include FORWARD-5, the prespecified pooled analysis of FORWARD-4 and FORWARD-5 as well as a holistic overview of the consistent efficacy and safety profile of 5461 demonstrated throughout the development program.

As we continue to build the evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of ALKS 5461 and share it with key opinion leaders in the field, we recognize that we're just getting started reviewing the clinical importance of this new pharmacology. The approval of 5461 is an adjunctive agent in patients failing to get adequate clinical relief from first-line treatments as measured by MADRAS should just be the beginning.
We're going to continue to expand the data set supporting ALKS 5461 to think its clinical profile through a new clinical trial. This begins later this quarter as we initiate Study 217. This study will continue our focus on patients suffering from treatment of refractory depression. In addition to the MADRAS this study will utilize scales and endpoints to assess additional domains such as social interaction, anhedonia and resilience which are regulated by the opioid system and where ALKS 5461 may have particular benefit.
So finishing up on 5461 we will present the FORWARD-4 and the FORWARD-5 pooled data at SOBP in May. We have submitted our request for the pre-NDA meeting and expect that to be scheduled soon. We will start the next study by the end of the quarter and we're on track with our preparations for submitting the NDA by year-end.
Turning to ALKS 3831, we're entering a data rich period as the pivotal program matures. 3831 is our novel oral antipsychotic designed to harness the efficacy of olanzapine with a more favorable weight and metabolic profile. The first piece of new data comes from our recently completed exploratory Phase 2 study in patients with schizophrenia and co-occurring alcohol use disorder. Despite representing more than a third of patients with schizophrenia, these patients are generally excluded from clinical trials and represented undertreated and underserved patient population.
Our study was designed to assess ALKS 3831's efficacy, safety and tolerability compared to olanzapine in this population and breaks new ground in testing antipsychotic medications in patients many physicians are unsure how to treat. The hypothesis was that because 3831 seems samidorphan it might have a greater effect on drinking behavior than olanzapine alone and thereby avoid some of the deleterious outcomes associated with alcohol use.
We pre-specified the primary endpoints as a novel composite measure of disease exacerbation as measured by a series of potential events ranging from hospitalization to arrest. The study did not show a difference on this endpoint as the ALKS 3831 in olanzapine treatment groups performed similarly well. The study did however, provide a wealth of data supportive of the safety and real world efficacy of 3831 compared to olanzapine in this complicated and underserved patient population.
Perhaps the most striking finding was in terms of long-term antipsychotic efficacy. While both groups experienced an improvement in PANSS scores which is the positive and negative syndrome scale, subjects on ALKS 3831 had greater long-term improvement. This is remarkable as olanzapine is regarded as among the most effective of all the antipsychotic agents. This underscores our fundamental positioning of ALKS 3831 as a new antipsychotic agent.
As its favorable weight and metabolic profile is established through the development program, the focus shift to its potential is to have a profound impact on the treatment of schizophrenia based on its efficacy, this study provides additional support for that positioning. We will complete the analysis of the study and look forward to presenting the data at a future medical meeting.
The next study to read out will be the pivotal Phase 3 study of evaluating the antipsychotic efficacy of ALKS 3831 compared to placebo and olanzapine in approximately 390 patients. We have moved in the time lines for this study and now expect to complete enrollment in the next couple of weeks with top-line data expected around mid-year compared to our previous expectation at year-end. The pivotal study of evaluating the effect of ALKS 3831 on olanzapine associated weight gain will continue its enrollment throughout this year with data expected in mid 2018.

Next is ALKS 8700 for the treatment of multiple sclerosis which is also enrolling in this pivotal program. 8700 is a novel oral molecule formulated in an advanced controlled release dosage form that’s designed to compete against Biogen's TECFIDERA which represents a $3 billion class in the U.S. In March, there were a number of positive developments in the intellectual property around dimethyl fumarate which resulted in TECFIDERA patent protection being upheld through 2028.
While our branded fumarate market is positive for the long-term potential of ALKS 8700 we expect the IP surrounding dimethyl fumarate will continue to be challenged. To more completely elaborate the potential competitive advantages of ALKS 8700 we are conducting an elective head-to-head study of evaluating the GI tolerability of 8700 compared to TECFIDERA. This 420-patient study began in March and will provide updates on expected timing of data as we get more experience with enrollment trends.
The pivotal program for 8700 consists of two elements. Completed pharmacokinetic bridging studies enabling a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway referencing TECFIDERA, and a two-year open label safety study. This study has enrolled now over 550 patients and the data continue to support a differentiated GI profile of 8700. We expect to complete the safety exposure requirements for registration later this year and remain on track to submit the NDA in 2018.
I will finish with ALKS 4230, our novel immune therapy, designed for selective activation of the IL-2 receptor in order to increase the number of tumor killing immune cells. We have recently presented three posters at AACR showing some of the pre-clinical data which served the foundation of the program, including data that demonstrated the selective expansion of CDA T-cell and natural killer cells with minimal expansion of the immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells.
We are currently engaged in the dose escalation phase of our first clinical trial and we expect to see initial data later this year. So I’ll finish there. We have a lot of important milestones on the new horizon and we look forward to updating you over the course of the coming weeks.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Sandy for questions.
Sandra Coombs
Thanks, Richard. Brandon, we'll now open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] From Credit Suisse, we have Vamil Divan online, please go ahead.
Vamil Divan
Hi, great good morning, thanks for taking my question. So, just two questions, you mentioned on 3831 the timeline that’s coming a little bit for the top line data there, can you just explain what change was just enrollment came in faster than you thought or were there any other changes there that have taken place with the study?
And then the second one on VIVITROL, I appreciate the comments you made on the volume, can you give a little more color just in terms of pricing, as that has been the area of focus there in terms of the net price you are getting any changes or anything unusual on what happened this quarter? Thanks.
Richard F. Pops
Okay Vamil, I'll take the first one and let Jim answer the second. The 3831 study is this efficacy study which is analogous of the study we ran for the approval of ARISTADA. All along in all of our psychiatric studies we say that we will trade time for quality or quality for time. In this case we just had really excellent enrollment in the back half of the study which allowed us to hit our patient enrollment numbers sooner than we would have conservatively modeled; other than that, all systems are good.
James M. Frates
Yes, and on VIVITROL, I think the change sequentially from quarter-to-quarter was really due to the seasonality that we have seen in the first quarter typically. Our pricing was very stable and our gross to net were 43.6% last quarter and 44% this quarter, so pricing wasn’t an issue. There really was just as those commercial plans reset and we head into the year-end. You know we’ve seen that VIVITROL fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter in the past, so we are confident about where we are headed for the rest of the year.

Vamil Divan
Okay, thanks so much.
James M. Frates
You’re welcome.
Operator
From Leerink we have Paul Matteis online. Please go ahead.
Paul Matteis
Great, thanks so much. A couple of questions on 5461 and 3831, first one on 5461, was this study that you are initiating always planned or was it in reaction to any feedback from FDA, and do you have plans to initiate additional study in the future this year?
Richard F. Pops
Good morning, Paul. No, this was not based on any feedback from FDA. This is based on our recognition that we're just at the beginning of elaborating the clinical potential of this new pharmacology. We had, as you may know, we had about a dozen or more of the top KOLs for depression at Logan Airport a few weeks ago. And it was interesting because we reviewed all the data from the FORWARD program and since there was a strong consensus the drug is doing as intended and will be approvable in that indication, so the conversation then shifts to what do we do next. Because in a way we’ve developed 5461 pursuant to the old rules up until this point, testing it as adjunctive agent in patients with major depressive disorder failing to get adequate clinical relief using MADRAS as the endpoint.
But it’s doing different things in patients brains and monoamine reuptake inhibitors, particularly on these domains really the social resiliency, anhedonia, social connectivity and things like that. So, this next study will begin to explore that. We also have some imaging ideas that we want to do just looking directly in the brain at different domains, then of course other clinical indications other than adjunctive use in major depressive disorders. So, we will be in the clinic with the drug for the next decade.
Paul Matteis
Okay, got it. So, we should potentially expect more studies in the future. And then separately on…
Richard F. Pops
Absolutely.
Paul Matteis
Great, thanks, Rich for clarifying that, I appreciate it. And then on 8700, you conveyed that from the safety study you are continuing to see a differentiated [indiscernible], are you seeing lower rates of diarrhea and flushing, how much of a window into the data do you have from your [indiscernible]?
Richard F. Pops
Our team has lot of data, and what I can tell you based on what I know, I’ve been mostly looking at the major AEs so SAEs and also GI discons [ph] and they are extremely low. So, the weakness of that observation is despite the large number of patients that we have now which is significant, this is in trivial end now we're over 500 patients, but now we go head-to-head. It just underscores our interest and belief in the larger the brain head-to-head study.
Paul Matteis
Okay, thanks. May be just one more on 3831 if you don’t mind, this study, so is the timing as timing pulls into midyear, do you think that this study is long enough and I guess you tweaked the run into, I mean based on the design, do you think that its realistic to see a benefit or differentiation on metabolic or so?
Richard F. Pops
You are breaking up a little bit, Paul, but I think I understand the question, I just want to make sure we are not confusing two different studies. We’ve got the study that we’re going to have data on midyear now is part of the two study pivotal program as agreed with FDA. This is the formal definition description of efficacy with the primary compared to being placebo in acute schizophrenia, it’s a four or five weeks study.
We also have olanzapine arm, so we are not powered for [indiscernible]. The primary statistical comparison is to placebo. And of course that duration, that’s how we ran the ARISTADA Phase 3. This is a standard efficacy study for antipsychotic agent.
Separately, we're running a much more exploratory human metabolic study in volunteers that's an inpatient study for almost a month where we're trying to see whether we can picture in the humans what we’re seeing in the rodents which is the peripheral metabolic effects of olanzapine and the corresponding effects when samidorphan in the form of 3831 is also deployed.

So, in the animals we've learnt a tremendous amount about why olanzapine is causing weight gain, separate from our central hypothesis about the reward systems. And if that's borne out in human, we want to begin to explore that to underscore the pharmacology of 3831. Those data will also be available midyear, but they are not part of the pivotal program.
Paul Matteis
Okay, thanks Rich. I guess my question was on this study that’s going to read out in the year, you see differentiation on weight gain really closer to, are you anticipating that you may see differentiation from the olanzapine arm on metabolic side effects for 3831, actually that was my question.
Richard F. Pops
I see, I'm sorry, I gave you a long answer to a question you didn’t ask. But in a four-week study we don’t expect to see major changes in a way, plus all patients who are hospitalized are getting care, it’s a different experiment.
Paul Matteis
Okay, okay, super helpful. Thanks, very much.
Richard F. Pops
Take care.

From JPMorgan, we have Cory Kasimov. Please go ahead.
Cory Kasimov
Hey, good morning guys, thanks for taking the question, actually two of them for you as well. So, I guess, first when thinking about VIVITROL traction over the course of the year, how much insight do you guys typically have ahead of time as to when utilization of the product could or is kind of poised to pick up in certain states or systems? And I have one follow up for Jim.
James M. Frates
Yes, Cory, that’s one of the things that makes it difficult to predict VIVITROL because we are changing care and the use of a long-acting relapse prevention medicine which is an antagonist, so different. The state programs are - when state programs start they can accelerate quite quickly. The question is when exactly do they start? Right? When are the systems in place, when does the funding come through? How quickly do physicians get up and running?
So I think the thing that makes us optimistic over time is that in all of our territories across the country as I tried to refer to in my remarks we are seeing that steady growth still occurring. And we are also seeing many states accelerate that growth. And our concentration in growth remains very high in those five key states still providing more than 50% of our sales.
So it is very difficult quarter-to-quarter to know exactly which state is going to pop next, but given our market share and the movement we see across the country we are very confident that it will happen. You know you add to that the additional funding that’s going to come in the second half of the year through 21st Century Cures and the CARA legislation that was passed last year. And what we are hearing on the ground from our sales team is we remain very optimistic about the growth.
Cory Kasimov
Okay, great. And then the follow up is, it looks like there was a step-up in your cost of goods this quarter, anything in at least as a percent of your total sales, or anything in particular behind that is it more driven by the 1Q commercial dynamics you discussed?
James M. Frates
Yes, you know, we do fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter on cost of goods and it has a lot of things to do with product mix and the amount of manufacturing that we are doing. Obviously, we did more in the first quarter this year than we did last year. And we also brought on some additional capacity too, so that works through the system and volumes increase and we get more efficient on that. We are very confident that cost of goods will get back into that kind of 82% range versus the 79% we saw this quarter, so really just quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.
Cory Kasimov
Okay, great. Thanks taking the questions.
James M. Frates
You bet.
Operator
From Cowen, we have Chris Shibutani. Please go ahead.

Chris Shibutani
Yes, thanks for taking the question. On VIVITROL can you comment a little bit about some of the trends you're seeing and underlying drivers such as the number of kind of the higher volume prescribers? You did comment on the programs which are improving. As new programs come on I know that they tend to be a little bit slower, but a lot of the traction has historically seemed to come from the higher volume prescribers. Duration of use, if you could comment there? And then secondly, this has been a drug that has kind of needed a constellation of events to come through, payer backdrop recognition of demand et cetera.
I think we've discussed in the past sort of what are the pushes and pulls, where are you able to push and invest? I know that you tried to do so with that naltrexone kit, do you speak to efforts that you feel you can proactively invest in and employ to somehow encourage growth in the market rather than sort of needing everything to move in sort of coincident fashion as it has, but how can you sort of accelerate or push growth? Thank you.
Richard F. Pops
Chris I'll let, I let Jim answer some and then I'll give you some color myself.
James M. Frates
Yes, so I think it's a good question, Chris and this again relates to the complexities of the VIVITROL system. We will point you back to Analyst Day with that the expansion of our provider network. The policy overlay in a state and the access in reimbursement and when we get all three of those things working that's when we can drive and maybe add another sales person to the territory. We can do some micro marketing, that sort of more traditional marketing in a sense.
And so, what we're trying to do is continue to move those states up to highly developed states as we've talked about. We don't do that count every quarter, but we absolutely are moving in the right direction with states moving to highly developed states. And it really is a coordinated effort between our reimbursement folks, our sales folks and our policy folks in the states to move that along.
We are making progress. I think the key thing that we look at is year-over-year growth for VIVITROL because again the first quarter with those commercial resets is very different from other quarters. We've typically seen the highest growth rates in the second and third quarters and we have no, we have little doubt that that will change as we go into the year.
Some of the more specifics that you asked about in terms of the number of high prescribers, our key accounts and maybe the depths of prescriptions and the duration, we are seeing improvements. The other thing is prescription fulfilment rates, that sort of thing we are seeing improvements in those underlying trends. Those are slow, percentage point, percentage point a month-to-month at a time and we're definitely continuing to see that growth occurring in the background. So as I say we've reiterated guidance for the year and hopefully we'll see and expect to see VIVITROL accelerating through the course of the year.
Richard F. Pops
Chris the only thing I'll add to that is, as we highlighted yesterday with Secretary Price is to the moment to cite, the basic hydraulics in the market are that more VIVITROL is going to be used. That's why it's a little bit sarcastic in a way and that's why we've used the 450 state programs compared to 400 even in February as a leading indicator. It's very difficult to predict any one of those 450, but again the aggregate there's just more and more people using more and more VIVITROL and it's got about 2% market share right now with a lot of states, municipalities, counties just beginning to get exposure to the product.
So it's at the kind of highest level at the systematic level, the basic instinct is due to - for more use of long acting antagonist medication. You will see from us even in this quarter. I got e-mails from a number of you all, and you saw the buses in Manhattan that had the VIVITROL ad on them. We’re beginning to expand these micro marketing approaches and I think you'll be seeing more of VIVITROL.

Chris Shibutani
Great and then just one quick additional seasonal question we're heading into the cancer time of year, 4230 you see that when will see some color in terms of data or thinking about, what you're going to do with that asset? Thank you.
Richard F. Pops
I don't think you'll see anything at ASCO, but I think for the fall, that will be the timing where we'll be into those dosing cohorts where therapeutic concentrations we expect to start to seeing activity.
Chris Shibutani
Thank you.

From Jefferies we have Biren Amin. Please go ahead.
Biren Amin
Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the new 5461 study can you just share how many patients you plan to enroll in that trial and what the primary endpoint would be? And I guess when should be expect data from this study? And I guess the other question is will you be discussing the design of the trial with FDA in your pre-NDA meeting in second quarter? Thanks.
Richard F. Pops
Good morning Biren. No, we won’t talk about it with FDA in the pre-NDA meeting. It's not really part of the submission package and we'll probably give you more specific details when we do the webcast around the SOBP presentation because we're finishing off the details on that. MADRAS will continue to be one of the primary endpoints that we're going to augment that with some new scales. One of the tensions in running these depression studies is that you don't want to invoke a number of scale. The more interventions with the patient tends to drive a higher placebo response.
So we're being very, very reductive and selective about trying to explore particular domains that we think map on to this endogenous opioid system pharmacology and those the team is settling on those and we'll tell you more about those as we get closer to launching it.
Biren Amin
So Rich, maybe a follow up on the MADRAS endpoint are you going to be evaluating an average across several weeks time such as what you did with 4 or 5?
Richard F. Pops
Yes, we think that's the more precise and accurate determination of separation of these curves in these studies. We know those are demonstrated. There is just inherently week-to-week variability and you can win and you can lose simply based on variability. So a more accurate approach is to capture more data in the analysis. And we will probably employ an SPCD or SPCD-like study design as well with the first days to filter out high placebo responders.
Biren Amin
And when do you hope to finish the trial like?
Richard F. Pops
Well, we have to start it first, so it depends on the end. So, I'm not sure, obviously it will be next year at a minimum, but we'll give you more details as we finish designs.
Biren Amin
Great, thank you.

From Evercore ISI, we have Umer Raffat. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, it's Dara [ph] standing in for Umer. I just had two questions, so first on 8700, in a scenario where 8700 differentiates in Phase IIb versus Taxotere [ph] do you intend on going it alone in this market or are you willing to partner?
Richard F. Pops
I think the answer is yes. So the most important thing is to really understand the clinical and economic value of 8700 relative to Taxotere [ph]. There are a number of people paying attention to this development program as you might imagine. Unlike 3831 or 5461 in our core psychiatry franchises where we know that we want to be launching those drugs ourselves and that would be a new foray for us. We could do it ourselves, it's certainly tractable, so we also could be collaborating around this as well.
Unidentified Analyst
Great and on ARISTADA what was the gross to net in the first quarter and what's really changed from Q4 and is this a trend, is there any trends we should expect to continue?

Richard F. Pops
Yes, thank you. Yes the gross to net did increase from quarter-to-quarter, so we were up about 3 points from 33% to 36% and our estimates for the full year is more in the mid 40s which is where you would see the other competitive products, given they are very heavy Medicare and Medicaid, that's 90% of the market here. So that's one of the things I talked about in the dynamics.
We're going to continue to see unit growth in the second quarter, but as those Medicare Part D plans came on in March for the second quarter we expect gross to nets probably to move up into the mid to low 40s from the mid 30s where they were in the first quarter and stabilizing that mid 40% going forward for the foreseeable future.
Unidentified Analyst
That's great and if and if I may just one quick question on the GI tolerability and of 8700 again. If that reads out in towards the end of the year is there any chance it would be included in the NDA package at the FDA?
Richard F. Pops
Our expectations it would not be in the initial label based on the 505b (2) approach and also having run a single study. With that said, we would expect at launch to have that the data published and if the data are clear and compelling we could consider running a second study for potential label inclusion.
Unidentified Analyst
That's great. Thank you very much.

From Citi we have Liav Abraham. Please go ahead.
Liav Abraham
Good morning, thanks for taking the question. A lot of mine have already been answered. Just a quick question on 54 61 and on your pre-N.D.A. meeting with FDA that's scheduled for later in the quarter, what feedback exactly do you plan on getting from FDA in this meeting or is it purely to tick the box and will you be communicating anything to the investment community after this meeting and if so how and when and in what formats? Thank you.
Richard F. Pops
Good morning, Liav. The pre-NDA meeting is a kind of statutory well known type B FDA interaction. All of our interactions with FDA are meaningful and have an opportunity to teach and to learn. This particular meeting is more typically focused on the structure of the NDA itself, the table of contents, the various analyses, the various figures, tables and listings that we'll be providing the NDA across the various elements, the various modules in the NDA itself, typically 90-minute meeting or working type meeting.
So we will absolutely give feedback coming out of it because that will give us more clarity on the timing of the submission and we've said year end and we'll tune that up as we come out of the meeting. And any other things we learn we will share with you.
Liav Abraham
Great, thank you.
Sandra Coombs
Okay, Brandon we have time for one more question.
Sure. From Barclays we have David Sell [ph]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Just in terms of CARA and 21st Century Cures Act and I think you referenced sort of some new money or state taxes and new money later in the year, is it your expectation or do you have a sense or is it too early whether that money is going to go into existing programs or do you think it this will be a catalyst for new program formation and therefore sort of translation and then how should we think about that for potentially sort of helping that they call it option?
Richard F. Pops
This is Rich. I’ll answer, that 21st Century Cures money really brings funding to the CARA legislation that was passed in the summer as well. So you can think about it as federal money that will be granted down to states largely for the initiation of new programs. So, we've been real strong advocates of this. And the new programs come in two domains, one is in the public health, traditional substance abuse treatment also in the criminal justice side where the whole logic that's beginning to build the idea of let's not incarcerate patients with addiction. Let's start intervening in their treatment sooner prior to diverting them into the criminal justice system. So I think you could see it in the form of new programs.

Some of those programs relate directly to funding that could support purchasing VIVITROL, but actually more importantly it could put in the systems in the community to be able to treat patients with medications and to treatment generally. Often in states there's access to VIVITROL through Medicaid expansion and what is lacking has been the human infrastructure to deploy the use of monthly injectable treatments along with lack of social counselling and monitoring. So that’s a long answer to a question but there's – it's quite a complicated system.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay and then one more question if I might on ARISTADA, you referenced the two planned additions for March just curious in terms of ARISTADA coverage right now, how do you feel, your positioned and especially relative to the competition and is there more work to be done or do you think that at this point it's a level playing field and then just maybe some context around how you think the two month dose and how significant in terms of volume trends that might be?
Richard F. Pops
We're effectively at parity now with the completion of those two big contracts in March where we want to be. We could always improve, but largely we're at parity. The two-month is important for a couple of reasons, not that it creates a step function in the sales in the quarter, not far from it because I think the model [ph] use of long-acting injectable will continue to be around that one month, but it's another reason for physicians to choose our product versus other competitive products, because it opens the opportunity to produce a patients number of injections going six per year if they're compliant and doing well on the medicines.
The second piece of it that's important over the long term that we're quite energized about is the hospital start. We expect labelling for the two months version to allow initiation on the two-month dose. This is different than INVEGA TRINZA which requires stabilization on monthly sustain before initiating TRINZA the three-month version.
If you could initiate a patient as they leave the hospital on a two-month formulation that maps it really well into a public health system now that is looking to reduce the number of hospital readmits for the same diagnosis and gives patients a chance to stable therapeutic levels of the drug for a couple months coming out of their acute episode. We think that from a personal and public health point of view that could be very powerful.
Unidentified Analyst
And then Richard I mean how many do you know how big the sort of hospital market or sort of initiating in the hospital market population is?
Richard F. Pops
We will follow up with you on this, but my God I'm looking at Jim, it is about a third or about 30% start to come out of the hospital.
James M. Frates
Yes, as you know the - unfortunately these patients cycled through a lot of times, the average duration of therapy is very short, four to six months. And so when therapy changes they often sadly end up back in the hospital and so therefore there are real opportunity for new starts on early [ph] on.

Richard Pops Elected BIO Chairman; 2003-2004 Board of Directors Announced 



Share

Print 



WASHINGTON, D.C. (June 24, 2003) - Richard F. Pops, CEO of Cambridge, Mass.-based Alkermes, Inc., has been elected chairman of the Biotechnology Industry Organization's board of directors. Pops will serve for two years and succeeds David E. Robinson, president, chairman and CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., of San Diego.  Pops was elected during BIO's annual membership meeting at the BIO 2003 Annual Convention in Washington, D.C.
"David Robinson will be one tough act to follow," said BIO President Carl B. Feldbaum. "He led BIO through the renewal of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, our challenge to Medicare's outpatient reimbursement formula, the stem cell and cloning controversies, and three extraordinarily successful industry conventions, including a breakthrough event in his hometown.
"But I cannot think of a better choice to take the baton than Richard Pops. Having guided Alkermes from R&D through multiple financings, clinical trials and partnerships, as well as an FDA product approval, Richard has lived and fought through the challenges biotechnology companies face at every stage of development. He is intimately familiar with the financial landscape for biotechnology, and as BIO's vice chairman for health care, he has already provided forceful leadership on issues such as Medicare reimbursement," said Feldbaum.
"This is an exciting time to be in a leadership role in the biotechnology industry, and I am delighted to accept this position," said Pops.  "Over the last six months, we've seen a resurgence of investor interest in biotechnology in tandem with a wave of important product approvals at the FDA.  Industrial, environmental and agricultural applications of the technology are also expanding, and biotechnology continues to be a vital area of innovation contributing to our economy and our quality of life.
"And yet the legislative, legal and regulatory challenges the industry faces remain significant.  Over the next two years, BIO will be dealing with follow-on biologics pathways, reimbursement, global health, biodefense incentives and regulations, agricultural regulations, and issues surrounding stem cell research and international trade.  It's a full agenda, and one that I look forward to taking on."
Pops has been CEO of Alkermes since February 1991.  Under his leadership, Alkermes has grown from a privately held company with 25 employees to a publicly traded, emerging pharmaceutical company with more than 400 employees in multiple locations throughout the United States.  He has served on BIO's board since 1996 and also serves on the boards of Alkermes; Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.; Reliant Pharmaceuticals, LLC; CombinatoRx, Inc.; the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council and the Harvard Medical School.
