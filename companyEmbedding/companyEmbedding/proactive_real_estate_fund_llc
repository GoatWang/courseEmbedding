How to Find the Best Acne Treatment for Your Situation
If you suffer from acne breakouts, you know how frustrating it can be.  An untimely blemish or breakout can seemingly ruin your confidence on an important day.  While many acne treatment consumers are in their teenage years, there are just as many adult acne sufferers.  Price, Speed and Overall Effectiveness is Important to most consumers, but that alone is not enough.
Many acne treatment products use harsh ingredients that can cause Free Radical Damage and promote premature aging.  You do not want to trade in one skin condition for another.  Take some time to do your homework.  While you may be in a rush, its better to choose the right product for you based upon your needs, wants and of course your budget.
Tips to Consider
Many consumers purchase their acne treatments at their local store, some at the advice of their friends and family.  They examine a handful of products, most of which are the same, and decide between them.  The problem is that this significantly limits the brands and treatments they are exposed to.  Finding the Right Acne Treatment means comparing many brands, not just 2-3 options.
Take a few minutes and read over the following tips for finding the right acne treatment products for you.  The more information you have the smarter your purchase decision will be.
Quality Ingredients – The vast majority of acne treatments you have tried use Benzoyl Peroxide.  Perhaps you are aware of the risks associated with using this ingredient, perhaps not.  But either way, we recommend you take the time to understand them.  Benzoyl Peroxide can cause discoloration, free radical damage and premature aging, not to mention serious risk like cancer, etc.
The Best Ingredients are All Natural.  Now, we understand they must be effective, but your skin needs to heal, not be damaged further. There are a host of natural ingredients which are capable of killing bacteria, eliminating redness and swelling and exfoliating the dead skin cells without Harming your skin.  Be sure to do your homework, you will be amazed by what you find.
Kill Acne Causing Bacteria –  By killing off the bacteria that causes acne, you are able to control future breakouts and better maintain your complexion.  While cleansing your skin and watching which foods you eat are important, at some point addressing the bacterial concerns is necessary if you want success.  Be sure to seek out anti bacterial solutions that do not further harm  your skin, as healing the red and damaged tissue is an equally important aspect to eliminating acne breakouts from your life.
Do not simply use the old stand by ingredients here, there are countless anti bacterial solutions that can work for you.
Eliminate Redness / Inflammation – The Swollen, Red bumps from acne breakouts are want really makes acne visible.  Constantly popping, squeezing and fidgeting with your blemish only makes matters worse.  The more damaged your tissue is, the more likely it is to have another breakout, so finding a product designed to soothe and calm inflammation is critical.  Just as killing acne causing bacteria is important, so too, is healing the damaged tissue and soothing the redness.
Try not to damage your skin further with harsh exfoliating scrubs.  Let the ingredients do the work, not some abrasive scrub, which will make matters worse.
Exfoliating Skin Cells –  Dead skin cells and trapped dirt and oils can also lead to breakouts. Find a product, or cleanser, that exfoliates you skin effectively without causing extra damage to your tissue.  Glycolic Acid is a favorite of ours, but there are certainly plenty of gentle exfoliants with can remove the necessary skin cells without causing more problems.
Exfoliating alone is not a solution for acne, do not let brands convince your otherwise.  While exfoliating is Part of the solution, it is not the only part.
Before you rush out to purchase your next acne treatment product, take 30 minutes to do some homework.  While your friends and family mean well, they are not skincare experts and should not be trusted with such an important purchase.  The ingredients and formula you choose should reflect the tips we outlined above for you.  That way you can ensure you are getting the best acne treatment for you.

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Virginia:













Does Proactive Real Estate Solutions Llc carry a valid contracting license?



In Virginia all remodeling and construction work with a cost of $1000 and up, requires a licensed contractor. There are three classes of license for contractors, from A to C. These are based on the size and scope of projects. 
Proactive Real Estate Solutions Llc currently holds license 2705108794 , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Virginia?



All applicants for A and B contractor licenses are required to complete a pre-license education course that has been approved by the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation's Board for Contractors. Additionally contractors must prove at least 2 years of work experience in their specific trade. 











Your liability risk when hiring Proactive Real Estate Solutions Llc



Licensed contractors in the state of Virginia are not required to carry general liabilty or workers' compensation insurance. It is always a good idea to only hire contractors that have current general liabilty and workers' compensation policies. Request copies of the insurance certifcates for each.











Financial recourse when hiring Proactive Real Estate Solutions Llc



Virginia does offer support to homeowners for construction projects gone wrong. The Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Act provides relief to eligible consumers who have incurred losses through the improper or dishonest conduct of a licensed residential contractor. The Recovery Fund is supported entirely by assessments paid by licensed contractors, not by any tax revenues. Filing a claim does not guarantee payment.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Virginia,be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids.Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process.Be wary of an abnormally low bid,they are not worth the risk.These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.

If you suffer from acne breakouts, you know how frustrating it can be.  An untimely blemish or breakout can seemingly ruin your confidence on an important day.  While many acne treatment consumers are in their teenage years, there are just as many adult acne sufferers.  Price, Speed and Overall Effectiveness is Important to most consumers, but that alone is not enough.
Many acne treatment products use harsh ingredients that can cause Free Radical Damage and promote premature aging.  You do not want to trade in one skin condition for another.  Take some time to do your homework.  While you may be in a rush, its better to choose the right product for you based upon your needs, wants and of course your budget.
Tips to Consider
Many consumers purchase their acne treatments at their local store, some at the advice of their friends and family.  They examine a handful of products, most of which are the same, and decide between them.  The problem is that this significantly limits the brands and treatments they are exposed to.  Finding the Right Acne Treatment means comparing many brands, not just 2-3 options.
Take a few minutes and read over the following tips for finding the right acne treatment products for you.  The more information you have the smarter your purchase decision will be.
Quality Ingredients – The vast majority of acne treatments you have tried use Benzoyl Peroxide.  Perhaps you are aware of the risks associated with using this ingredient, perhaps not.  But either way, we recommend you take the time to understand them.  Benzoyl Peroxide can cause discoloration, free radical damage and premature aging, not to mention serious risk like cancer, etc.
The Best Ingredients are All Natural.  Now, we understand they must be effective, but your skin needs to heal, not be damaged further. There are a host of natural ingredients which are capable of killing bacteria, eliminating redness and swelling and exfoliating the dead skin cells without Harming your skin.  Be sure to do your homework, you will be amazed by what you find.
Kill Acne Causing Bacteria –  By killing off the bacteria that causes acne, you are able to control future breakouts and better maintain your complexion.  While cleansing your skin and watching which foods you eat are important, at some point addressing the bacterial concerns is necessary if you want success.  Be sure to seek out anti bacterial solutions that do not further harm  your skin, as healing the red and damaged tissue is an equally important aspect to eliminating acne breakouts from your life.
Do not simply use the old stand by ingredients here, there are countless anti bacterial solutions that can work for you.
Eliminate Redness / Inflammation – The Swollen, Red bumps from acne breakouts are want really makes acne visible.  Constantly popping, squeezing and fidgeting with your blemish only makes matters worse.  The more damaged your tissue is, the more likely it is to have another breakout, so finding a product designed to soothe and calm inflammation is critical.  Just as killing acne causing bacteria is important, so too, is healing the damaged tissue and soothing the redness.
Try not to damage your skin further with harsh exfoliating scrubs.  Let the ingredients do the work, not some abrasive scrub, which will make matters worse.
Exfoliating Skin Cells –  Dead skin cells and trapped dirt and oils can also lead to breakouts. Find a product, or cleanser, that exfoliates you skin effectively without causing extra damage to your tissue.  Glycolic Acid is a favorite of ours, but there are certainly plenty of gentle exfoliants with can remove the necessary skin cells without causing more problems.
Exfoliating alone is not a solution for acne, do not let brands convince your otherwise.  While exfoliating is Part of the solution, it is not the only part.
Before you rush out to purchase your next acne treatment product, take 30 minutes to do some homework.  While your friends and family mean well, they are not skincare experts and should not be trusted with such an important purchase.  The ingredients and formula you choose should reflect the tips we outlined above for you.  That way you can ensure you are getting the best acne treatment for you.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
