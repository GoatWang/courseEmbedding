Ruth Crowley - Highlights









Your browser does not support script


Highlights


For the past two years Ruth has worked as an independent consultant with a focus on branding, brand development, retail segmentation, merchandise assortments, business strategy and international business.

"It has been an amazing experience to put prior career experiences to work in an extremely challenging business environment, working with people and businesses to create sustainable value while positioning business for the long haul. It is also a test of skill - to influence results with no control over the resources. In consulting, one learns or reinforces the value of building relationships� and patience!"

Ruth has had a diverse career with power brands, entertainment retail, product and concept development, brand development and retail segmentation. "Every stop along the career journey had a defined purpose for continued personal growth and learning, to continuously sharpen the edges, apply learning's and fill up the personal tool box, as it were. I am still a work in progress."

Prior to venturing into consulting, Ruth spent two years as president of Motorsports Authentics, the primary licensee for Nascar with responsibility for over 40 drivers and 12 teams together with a production, wholesale, retail and direct-to-consumer business. Ruth was recruited as the inaugural president to oversee and conclude a business acquisition, restructure and integrate five separate companies into one cohesive business. She developed a culture that valued relationships with a respect for integrity, responsiveness and service to help grow business for all stakeholders (drivers, teams, sponsors, owners etc.). Analyzed the brand portfolio (50 brands) and other company-owned businesses to convert dormant holdings into productive assets. In a collaborative effort she stabilized a five year sales decline and positioned the business for growth in 2007 and beyond.

Prior to joining Motorsports, Ruth spent over six years with Harley-Davidson, the quintessential iconic American brand. As Vice President and General Merchandise Manager over the merchandise business which included Motorclothes and Licensing in over 1200 dealer locations and specialty retail worldwide (approx $900 Million), Ruth was responsible for "anything that did not go on the motorcycle". "Except for the rider of course - we made them look better in our gear". Gear included fashion and functional apparel and product across categories. Ruth was heavily involved in the strategic process for growing business internationally and attracting younger audiences. She shared leadership for the company's 100th anniversary celebration: - a year long event spanning 4 continents and ending in Milwaukee in August 2003. The event was later named one of the most successful such events by advertising age.

"Harley-Davidson is one of my career highlights. I had a great team and a great brand to work with. The collaboration across functions and disciplines is what helped us grow the business over 60% in 3 years. Our customer satisfaction rose over 25 points and brand awareness and impressions improved significantly. What is even more rewarding is that the results sustained after I left�. That is cool".

Ruth spent a very productive time with Universal Studios Recreation Group as Senior Vice President responsible for merchandise concepts, product development, retail and design in theme parks world wide. Ruth was responsible for the opening of "Islands of Adventure" in Florida, which was cited as one of the most successful openings in the industry. She was also responsible for revamping the studios parks in Florida and Los Angeles, integrating a partnership venture in Spain and planning the opening for Osaka, Japan - all in two years. "We had a great challenge in Universal - to open a new park and update others while planning a fourth! We developed over 12,000 sku's in one year! Our unique task was to effectively represent each individual brand within the park (Marvel, Dr. Seuss, Jurassic Park etc.) while telling one cohesive Universal brand story to a diverse and discerning global audience. Together we created a customer experience second to none"

Prior to joining Universal, Ruth worked with Host Marriott services over 12 years leading the retail merchandise business in airports and tourist destinations in the US and internationally. With HMS, Ruth was involved in creating customized retail solutions for airports throughout the U.S. This included designing and creating a mix of products, proprietary concepts and branded tenants to optimize revenues while serving the needs of the unique audience. Beyond Airports the group were also responsible for creating "destination" experience-based retail concepts in locations such as the Empire State Building in NY and the Space Center in Houston. "Host Marriott Services is where I solidified the career foundation. I had the good fortune of having amazing people to work with as we evolved the business for sustainable success"

Ruth has also "served time" in department store and specialty store retail Inc. May Co. and the Limited.

Ruth serves on the Board of Directors for Associated Bank in Wisconsin and on the Board of Governors for the University of North Texas. She devotes time to charitable activities inc. MDA and Make a Wish Foundation. "I think it is critical to be involved and to give back. At the University of North Texas it is optimal - I get to teach classes several times a year as part of giving back but also motivating the next generation of Business Leaders. I find that I learn as much from the kids in MDA and Make a Wish and the students in U.N.T, as they learn from me".

Ruth currently resides in Orlando, Florida and makes frequent trips "home" to Ireland.
