“The lesson here is that we’re smart people, but we’re not clairvoyant, we’re not perfect, and things aren’t always caught in our manual QA. You need to have some sort of governance plan to catch them before, during and after the fact—preferably automatically. ObservePoint helps find high-priority problems within your data, automatically.”
Daryl Acumen, Adobe

Frequently Asked Questions

What is Tag Management?
Tag management is the process of monitoring and maintaining marketing tags integrated into digital properties. A tag management system (TMS) is a solution, usually provided by a third-party vendor, that simplifies the processes of implementing, maintaining and sunsetting the increasing number of tag implementations an organization employs. Tag management also includes auditing and scanning your digital properties to identify all third-party and custom tagging implementations to validate accurate deployment and data collection. Even after implementing a tag management solution, things break—tags go missing or are duplicated, links break and JavaScript code is corrupted, old third-party implementations are not fully eradicated, etc. This is why it is important to have people, tools and process in place to ensure effective tag management.
Discover more about Tag Management
What is the difference between an audit and a simulation?
Audits are prescriptive, simulations are protective. Audits can tell you about tagging issues that need to be fixed, and simulations can alert you when new tagging problems appear.
Read more on our blog. Site Audit and Simulations: What’s the difference?
Which vendors do you support?
ObservePoint is integrated with every major digital marketing technology.
We use Selenium, so would we use that in conjunction with ObservePoint?
Yes. ObservePoint contributes to an overall data quality practice. Manual page level debugging, automated site audits, tag regression testing, Selenium scripts and so forth can all contribute to improved data quality. It’s important to understand that none of these are one-time events—there has to be an ongoing commitment to achieve high-quality data.
Do you do mobile?
Yes! We support all mobile browsers.
Why have I not heard of ObservePoint before?
Hard to say. How long has it been since you took the red pill?
Can I see variable data?
Yes. Since ObservePoint is executing JavaScript, all JavaScript parameters and values are stored in the tag database after an audit, and available as test criteria in simulations.
Isn’t a one-time audit enough?
No. Websites are complex and always evolving. One audit is great for telling you what is a problem today, but data quality management is a process, most effectively performed on an ongoing basis.
If I have a Tag Management System, do I still need to audit?
Yes! Tag management systems are great and help teams become more efficient and sophisticated. They also introduce additional tagging to the site and can cause blind spots.
How difficult is an implementation with ObservePoint?
It’s not difficult—there’s no code to deploy! ObservePoint requires a configuration of the audits, simulations and reports rather than any deployment to your site(s).
Does page performance impact data collection?
It can. For example, if the tag is in the bottom portion of the page that is loading slowly, the page view might not be recorded in the web analytics solution. Consequently, this page might falsely show very low page views.
Can ObservePoint audit behind logins?
Yes. ObservePoint can simulate visitor actions, such as a user login. We recommend automating this and this is a very common practice among our customers.
How long does it take to implement ObservePoint?
A few days. There is no code to deploy, so all setup is done through our user interface.
How often do you recommend auditing?
This depends on your business needs, but generally our customers find the most value aligning with their release cycles, reacting to business conditions that dictate audits, and performing proactive audits in anticipation of large project releases. For more information about audit frequency and timing, read about the Data Quality Management Process.
We’re having data collection challenges with different browsers and devices. Can you help?
Yes. ObservePoint supports a variety of browser agents and devices.
Do you handle on-click or custom action events?
Yes. Our patented technology actively interacts with your website’s user interface and most of the time this is self-configured in our platform.
We’re about to change web analytics vendors. Should we wait to audit until the new deployment is done?
Don’t wait. Auditing now can help you be sure that you have completely removed any old tags from your website and correctly deployed your new solution.
My team doesn’t have much confidence in our web data. What should I do?
Start with some baseline audits to get an idea of what your data quality challenges are. Once you’ve done that, you can make a plan to measure, improve, and protect your data using our data quality management platform and processes.
How to use the ObservePoint TagDebugger™

ObservePoint TagDebugger™ is an excellent alternative for web analysts who may currently use one or more of the following: WASP, Charles, Fiddler, OmniBug, SiteCat Debugger, Omniture Debugger, DigitalPulse Debugger or Google Tag Assistant.
Use the TagDebugger™:

Install the tag debugger.
Ensure the extension is enabled by selecting Tools -> Extensions, and verifying the ObservePoint Tag Debugger is enabled. It should be enabled by default.
Open the Chrome Developer Tools. On Windows and Linux, press Control-Shift-i. On Mac, press
Command-Option-i.
Select the ObservePoint panel.

Use the Tag Debugger

Tag Name / Path: This is the name ObservePoint uses to uniquely identify each vendor and tagging technology. The path is the tag request up to the query string.
Account: This is the SiteCatalyst report suite, Google Analytics profile, Webtrends DCSID, etc. – within ObservePoint we call them accounts.
Category: ObservePoint’s classification of the kind of tag listed. Categories include analytics, advertising, tag management, video, voice of consumer, split testing, eCommerce and lead tracking. For a complete list of all tags we support please visit our supported tag vendors.
Status: The network status code of the tag request. Most should be status 200 (OK).
Request / Response Size: Request is the amount of data sent to the vendor’s collection servers. Response is the data sent back to your web browser by the vendor.
Total Time / Latency: Total time is measured from the initial request for the tag to time it is fully loaded. Latency is the time it takes from the initial request to the first response from the vendor.

Detailed view of SiteCatalyst, showing a listing of each of the variables found as part of the tag.
Can ObservePoint detect analytics tags that have been deployed multiple times on the same page?
Yes. Find this in the Duplicate or Multiple Requests report. Duplicate tags may be an indicator of data inflation.
Does ObservePoint support both old and new versions of a tag?
Most of the time yes, but it depends on the tag. For example, we support HBX all the way to the current SiteCatalyst tags. Typically if a tag has version data we will catalog it.
Will ObservePoint audit pages that redirect?
Yes. We follow all redirects and will audit the terminal page if it is allowed by filters defined in the audit. We also catalog all other server status codes such as broken and access denied pages.
Can you see tags that are in an include file and not directly on the page?
Yes. One item that makes ObservePoint unique in this area is that we observe actual image request for a given tag.
Can ObservePoint audit mobile websites for iPhone, iPad or Android?

Yes! Follow these steps to configure an audit to scan a mobile site.

Access the mobile version of the site in your web browser and copy the URL,
example: https://mobile.twitter.com/observepoint
Paste the mobile URL as the starting page of the audit.
Change the audit user agent to a mobile browser. Note that this is only a user agent change, the actual device that will be scanning the site does not change.
Verify that the include filter will only audit mobile pages.
Save.

Which Tag Vendors Do You Support?
The ObservePoint tag database is constantly growing and being updated.
When I run an audit will it check iframes as well?
Yes, we will typically see tags loading from iframes without a problem. We observe the network traffic for particular page tags that load from an iframe are part of the network requests.
How do I receive alerts on my phone?
Most people simply use the email feature on their smartphone, but we can send a text as well. If you want us to send you a text instead, follow these guidelines. Replace “phonenumber” with your own phone number, area code first. Do not include dashes, parentheses, or spaces.

Why should I use tag simulations?
We recommend setting page and tag alerts when you may have doubts concerning the reliability of page. Doubts, for example, could be triggered by a page impression report that shows a sudden drop in traffic, even though the tagging audit shows complete tagging implementation. Our alerting functionality can also be used to record a process or form being filled out. We can then replace this at a specified interval and alert you if the process breaks.
Which IP addresses do you audit from?
This information is privileged and is available to ObservePoint customers only.
If you are a customer please contact us and we’ll be happy to provide you with the information you need.

Our Mission
ObservePoint empowers data-informed companies to trust their data and better serve their customers through the application of best practices in web tag auditing.
Open Positions

Mt. Timpanogos, Utah






Why
As any data analyst in the trenches will admit, web analytics is hard. Reports from different analytics tools often don’t match. Tracking breaks, impacting reporting and site functionality. And manual audits of web and mobile app analytics implementations are expensive, time-consuming and still prone to human error. 








Our Technology
Founded in 2007 by John Pestana and Rob Seolas, ObservePoint pioneered automated
                        web and app analytics auditing. ObservePoint’s global network audits millions of pages every month to report data loss, inflation and leakage to web analytics managers and stakeholders of the world’s leading enterprise companies.






ObservePoint’s patented WebAssurance™ technology carefully renders all web page code on a site, looking for errors and gaps in reporting caused by data corruption, inflation and leakage.







AppAssurance™ is a cloud-based solution that scans an organization’s mobile app, analyzing third-party vendor implementations for integration and functionality errors. By validating functionality and data quality, users maximize the ROI on their mobile app investments and gain a competitive advantage by achieving accurate business insights.







ObservePoint’s Data Quality Assurance solution ensures that customer data is accurately collected, utilized, and safeguarded, giving your organization the confidence to make better decisions based on better data.














Meet our Founders
ObservePoint was founded by data pioneers who have continued to attract the very smartest leaders in the industry.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means:

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

“The lesson here is that we’re smart people, but we’re not clairvoyant, we’re not perfect, and things aren’t always caught in our manual QA. You need to have some sort of governance plan to catch them before, during and after the fact—preferably automatically. ObservePoint helps find high-priority problems within your data, automatically.”
Daryl Acumen, Adobe
