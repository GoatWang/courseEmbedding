This
  prospectus contains basic information you should understand about
  the
  contracts before investing.��Please read this prospectus
  carefully and keep it for future reference.
�
Variable
  annuities are complex investment products with unique benefits and
  advantages that may be particularly useful in meeting long-term savings
  and retirement needs. There are costs and charges associated with
  these
  benefits and advantages - costs and charges that are different, or
  do not
  exist at all, within other investment products.��With help from
  financial consultants and advisers, investors are encouraged to compare
  and contrast the costs and benefits of the variable annuity described
  in
  this prospectus against those of other investment products, especially
  other variable annuity and variable life insurance products offered
  by
  Nationwide and its affiliates.
�
Nationwide
  offers a wide array of such products, many with different charges,
  benefit
  features and underlying investment options.��This process of
  comparison and analysis should aid in determining whether the purchase
  of
  the contract described in this prospectus is consistent with your
  investment objectives, risk tolerance, investment time horizon, marital
  status, tax situation and other personal characteristics and
  needs.
�
The
  Statement of Additional Information (dated September 7, 2007), which
  contains additional information about the contracts and the variable
  account, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
  (�SEC�) and is incorporated herein by reference.��The table of

These
  annuities are NOT deposits or obligations of, or issued, guaranteed
  or
  endorsed by, any bank, and are NOT insured or guaranteed by the US
  Government, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the
  Federal
  Reserve Board or any other agency.��An investment in this
  annuity involves investment risks, including possible loss of value,
  even
  with respect to amounts allocated to the Nationwide Variable Insurance
  Trust � Nationwide NVIT Money Market Fund II.��Annuities that
  involve investment risk may lose value.�These
  securities
  have not been approved or disapproved by the SEC, nor has the SEC
  passed
  upon the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus.��Any
  representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.
�
This
  contract contains features that apply credits to the contract
  value.��The benefit of the credits may be more than offset by
  the additional fees that the contract owner will pay in connection
  with
  the credits.��A contract without credits may cost
  less.��Additionally, the cost of electing an Extra Value Option
  and the recapture of the credits (in the event of a surrender) could
  exceed any benefit of receiving the
  credits.

�
The
  minimum and maximum underlying mutual fund operating expenses indicated above
  do
  not reflect voluntary or contractual reimbursements and/or waivers applied
  to
  some underlying mutual funds.��Therefore, actual expenses could be
  lower.��Refer to the underlying mutual fund prospectuses for specific
  expense information.
�
Example
�
This
  Example is intended to help contract owners compare the cost of investing in
  the
  contract with the cost of investing in other variable annuity
  contracts.��These costs include contract fees, variable account annual
  expenses, and underlying mutual fund fees and expenses.��The Example
  does not reflect premium taxes which, if reflected, would result in higher
  expenses.
�
The
  Example assumes:




���


a
  $10,000 investment in the contract for the time periods
  indicated;








���


a
  5% return each year;








���


the
  maximum and the minimum fees and expenses of any of the underlying
  mutual
  funds; and








���


the
  total variable account charges associated with the most expensive
  combination of optional benefits
  (1.55%).




�
For
  those
  contracts that do not elect the most expensive combination of optional benefits,
  the expenses would be lower.

Condensed
  Financial
  Information

The
  value
  of an accumulation unit is determined on the basis of changes in the per share
  value of the underling mutual funds and the assessment of variable account
  charges which may vary from contract to contract (for more information on the
  calculation of accumulation unit values, see �Determining Variable Account Value
� Valuing an Accumulation Unit�). Since this annuity contract was first
  available for sale on September 7, 2007, there are no accumulation unit values
  available.

  subsequent purchase payment is $50.��Subsequent purchase payments are
  not permitted in some states under certain circumstances.
�
If
  the
  contract owner elects an Extra Value Option, amounts credited to the contract
  in
  excess of total purchase payments may not be used to meet the minimum initial
  and subsequent purchase payment requirements.
�
The
  Variable Account and Underlying Mutual Funds
�
Nationwide
  Variable Account-4 is a variable account that contains the underlying mutual
  funds listed in Appendix A.��The variable account was established on
  October 7, 1987, pursuant to Ohio law.��Although the variable account
  is registered with the SEC as a unit investment trust pursuant to the Investment
  Company Act of 1940 (�1940 Act�), the SEC does not supervise the management of
  Nationwide or the variable account.
�
Income,
  gains, and losses credited to, or charged against, the variable account reflect
  the variable account�s own investment experience and not the investment
  experience of Nationwide�s other assets.��The variable account�s
  assets are held separately from Nationwide�s assets and are not chargeable with
  liabilities incurred in any other business of Nationwide.��Nationwide
  is obligated to pay all amounts promised to contract owners under the
  contracts.
�
The
  variable account is divided into sub-accounts, each corresponding to a single
  underlying mutual fund.��Nationwide uses the assets of each
  sub-account to buy shares of the underlying mutual funds based on contract
  owner
  instructions.
�
Each
  underlying mutual fund�s prospectus contains more detailed information about
  that fund.��Prospectuses for the underlying mutual funds should be
  read in conjunction with this prospectus.
�
Underlying
  mutual funds in the variable account are NOT publicly traded
  funds.��They are only available as investment options in variable
  life insurance policies or variable annuity contracts issued by life insurance
  companies, or in some cases, through participation in certain qualified pension
  or retirement plans.
�
The
  investment advisers of the underlying mutual funds may manage publicly traded
  mutual funds with similar names and investment objectives.��However,
  the underlying mutual funds are NOT directly related to any publicly traded
  mutual fund.��Contract owners should not compare the performance of a
  publicly traded fund with the performance of underlying mutual funds
  participating in the variable account.��The performance of the
  underlying mutual funds could differ substantially from that of any publicly
  traded fund.
�
The
  particular underlying mutual funds available under the contract may change
  from
  time to time.��Specifically, underlying mutual funds or underlying
  mutual fund share classes that are currently available may be removed or closed
  off to future investment.��New underlying mutual funds or new share
  classes of currently available underlying mutual funds may be
  added.��Contract owners will receive notice of any such changes that
  affect their contract.��Additionally, not all of the underlying mutual
  funds are available in every state.
�
In
  the
  future, additional underlying mutual funds managed by certain financial
  institutions, brokerage firms or their affiliates may be added to the variable
  account.��These additional underlying mutual funds may be offered
  exclusively to purchasing customers of the particular financial institution
  or
  brokerage firm, or through other exclusive distribution
  arrangements.
�
Voting
  Rights
�
Contract
  owners who have allocated assets to the underlying mutual funds are entitled
  to
  certain voting rights.��Nationwide will vote contract owner shares at
  special shareholder meetings based on contract owner
  instructions.��However, if the law changes allowing Nationwide to vote
  in its own right, it may elect to do so.
�
Contract
  owners with voting interests in an underlying mutual fund will be notified
  of
  issues requiring the shareholders� vote as soon as possible before the
  shareholder meeting.��Notification will contain proxy materials and a
  form with which to give Nationwide voting instructions.��Nationwide
  will vote shares for which no instructions are received in the same proportion
  as those that are received. What this means to you is that when only a small
  number of contract owners vote, each vote has a greater impact on, and may
  control the outcome of the vote.


�


8





�


The
  number of shares which a contract owner may vote is determined by dividing
  the
  cash value of the amount they have allocated to an underlying mutual fund by
  the
  net asset value of the underlying mutual fund.��Nationwide will
  designate a date for this determination not more than 90 days before the
  shareholder meeting.
�
Material
  Conflicts
�
The
  underlying mutual funds may be offered through separate accounts of other
  insurance companies, as well as through other separate accounts of
  Nationwide.��Nationwide does not anticipate any disadvantages to
  this.��However, it is possible that a conflict may arise between the
  interests of the variable account and one or more of the other separate accounts
  in which these underlying mutual funds participate.
�
Material
  conflicts may occur due to a change in law affecting the operations of variable
  life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts, or differences in the
  voting instructions of the contract owners and those of other
  companies.��If a material conflict occurs, Nationwide will take
  whatever steps are necessary to protect contract owners and variable annuity
  payees, including withdrawal of the variable account from participation in
  the
  underlying mutual fund(s) involved in the conflict.
�
Substitution
  of Securities
�
Nationwide
  may substitute, eliminate, or combine shares of another underlying mutual fund
  for shares already purchased or to be purchased in the future if either of
  the
  following occurs:
�




(1)��


shares
  of a current underlying mutual fund are no longer available for
  investment; or




�




(2)��


further
  investment in an underlying mutual fund is
  inappropriate.




�
No
  substitution, elimination, or combination of shares may take place without
  the
  prior approval of the SEC.
�
Annuity
  Payments
�
Annuity
  payments begin on the annuitization date and will be based on the annuity
  payment option chosen prior to annuitization.��Nationwide will send
  annuity payments within 7 days after each annuity payment date.
�
Taxation
�
How
  a
  contract is taxed depends on the type of contract issued and the purpose for
  which the contract is purchased.��Nationwide will charge against the
  contract any premium taxes levied by any governmental authority (see �Federal
  Tax Considerations� in Appendix C: Contract Types and Tax Information and
�Premium Taxes�).
�
10
  Day Free Look
�
Under
  state insurance laws, you have the right, during a limited period of time,
  to
  examine your contract and decide if you want to keep it or cancel it. This
  right
  is referred to as your �free look� right. The length of this time period depends
  on the law of your state, and may vary depending on whether your purchase is
  a
  replacement or not. Check your contract for more details about your free look
  right.
�
The
  Contract in General
�
In
  order
  to comply with the USA Patriot Act and rules promulgated thereunder, Nationwide
  has implemented procedures designed to prevent contracts described in this
  prospectus from being used to facilitate money laundering or the financing
  of
  terrorist activities.
�
If
  this
  contract is purchased to replace another variable annuity, be aware that the
  mortality tables used to determine the amount of annuity payments may be less
  favorable than those in the contract being replaced.
�
Guarantees
  under the contracts are the sole responsibility of Nationwide.
�
In
  general, deferred variable annuities are long-term investments; they are not
  intended as short-term investments.��Accordingly, Nationwide has
  designed the contract to offer features, pricing, and investment options that
  encourage long-term ownership.��It is very important that contract
  owners and prospective contract owners understand all the costs associated
  with
  owning a contract, and if and how those costs change during the lifetime of
  the
  contract.��Contract and optional charges may not be the same in later
  contract years as they are in early contract years.��The various
  contract and optional benefit charges are assessed in order to compensate
  Nationwide for administrative services, distribution and operational expenses,
  and assumed actuarial risks associated with the contract.
�
Following
  is a discussion of some relevant factors that may be of particular interest
  to
  prospective investors.
�
Distribution
  and Promotional Expenses
�
Nationwide
  may pay the selling firms a marketing allowance, which is based on the firm�s
  ability and demonstrated willingness to promote and market Nationwide's
  products.��How any marketing allowance is spent is determined by the
  firm, but generally will be used to finance firm activities that may contribute
  to the promotion and marketing of Nationwide's products.��For more
  information on the exact compensation arrangement associated with this contract,
  please consult your registered representative.
�
Underlying
  Mutual Fund Payments
�
Nationwide�s
  Relationship with the Underlying Mutual Funds
�
The
  underlying mutual funds incur expenses each time they sell, administer, or
  redeem their shares.��The variable account aggregates contract owner
  purchase, redemption, and transfer requests and submits net or aggregated
  purchase/redemption requests to each underlying mutual fund
  daily.��The variable account (not the contract owners) is the
  underlying mutual fund shareholder.��When the variable account
  aggregates transactions, the underlying mutual fund does not incur the expense
  of processing individual transactions it would normally incur if it sold its
  shares directly to the public.��Nationwide incurs these expenses
  instead.


�


9





�


Nationwide
  also incurs the distribution costs of selling the contract (as discussed above),
  which benefit the underlying mutual funds by providing contract owners with
  sub-account options that correspond to the underlying mutual funds.

�
An
  investment adviser or subadviser of an underlying mutual fund or its affiliates
  may provide Nationwide or its affiliates with wholesaling services that assist
  in the distribution of the contract and may pay Nationwide or its affiliates
  to
  participate in educational and/or marketing activities.��These
  activities may provide the adviser or subadviser (or their affiliates) with
  increased exposure to persons involved in the distribution of the
  contract.
�
Types
  of Payments Nationwide Receives
�
In
  light
  of the above, the underlying mutual funds and their affiliates make certain
  payments to Nationwide or its affiliates (the �payments�).��The amount
  of these payments is typically based on a percentage of assets invested in
  the
  underlying mutual funds attributable to the contracts and other variable
  contracts Nationwide and its affiliates issue, but in some cases may involve
  a
  flat fee.��These payments may be used by us for any corporate purpose,
  which include reducing the prices of the contracts, paying expenses that
  Nationwide or its affiliates incur in promoting, marketing, and administering
  the contracts and the underlying mutual funds, and achieving a
  profit.
�
Nationwide
  or its affiliates receive the following types of payments:
�




���


Underlying
  mutual fund 12b-1 fees, which are deducted from underlying mutual
  fund
  assets;




�




���


Sub-transfer
  agent fees or fees pursuant to administrative service plans adopted
  by the
  underlying mutual fund, which may be deducted from underlying mutual
  fund
  assets; and




�




���


Payments
  by an underlying mutual fund�s adviser or subadviser (or its
  affiliates).��Such payments may be derived, in whole or in part,
  from the advisory fee, which is deducted from underlying mutual fund
  assets and is reflected in mutual fund
  charges.




�
Furthermore,
  Nationwide benefits from assets invested in Nationwide�s affiliated underlying
  mutual funds (i.e., Nationwide Variable Insurance Trust) because its
  affiliates also receive compensation from the underlying mutual funds for
  investment advisory, administrative, transfer agency, distribution, and/or
  other
  services.��Thus, Nationwide may receive more revenue with respect to
  affiliated underlying mutual funds than unaffiliated underlying mutual
  funds.��Nationwide took into consideration the anticipated payments
  from the underlying mutual funds when it determined the charges imposed under
  the contracts (apart from fees and expenses imposed by the underlying mutual
  funds).��Without these payments, Nationwide would have imposed
  higher charges under the contract.

Amount
  of Payments Nationwide Receives
�
Most
  underlying mutual funds or their affiliates have agreed to make payments to
  Nationwide or its affiliates, although the applicable percentages may vary
  from
  underlying mutual fund to underlying mutual fund and some may not make any
  payments at all.��Because the amount of the actual payments Nationwide
  and its affiliates receive depends on the assets of the underlying mutual funds
  attributable to the contract, Nationwide and its affiliates may receive higher
  payments from underlying mutual funds with lower percentages (but greater
  assets) than from underlying mutual funds that have higher percentages (but
  fewer assets).
�
For
  additional information related to amount of payments Nationwide receives, go
  to
  www.nationwide.com.
�
Identification
  of Underlying Mutual Funds
�
Nationwide
  may consider several criteria when identifying the underlying mutual funds,
  including some or all of the following:��investment objectives,
  investment process, investment performance, risk characteristics, investment
  capabilities, experience and resources, investment consistency, and fund
  expenses.��Another factor Nationwide considers during the
  identification process is whether the underlying mutual fund�s adviser or
  subadviser is one of our affiliates or whether the underlying mutual fund,
  its
  adviser, its subadviser(s), or an affiliate will make payments to us or our
  affiliates.��For the contracts sold with this prospectus, Nationwide
  also considers whether the underlying mutual fund has a policy that permits
  frequent transfers in and out of the corresponding sub-account.
�
There
  may
  be underlying mutual funds with lower fees, as well as other variable contracts
  that offer underlying mutual funds with lower fees.��You should
  consider all of the fees and charges of the contract in relation to its features
  and benefits when making your decision to invest.��Please note that
  higher contract and underlying mutual fund fees and charges have a direct effect
  on your investment performance.
�
Profitability
�
Nationwide
  does consider profitability when determining the charges in the
  contract.��In early contract years, Nationwide does not anticipate
  earning a profit, since that is a time when administrative and distribution
  expenses are typically higher.��Nationwide does, however, anticipate
  earning a profit in later contract years.��In general, Nationwide's
  profit will be greater the higher the investment return and the longer the
  contract is held.
�
Standard
  Charges and
  Deductions
�
Mortality
  and Expense Risk Charge
�
Nationwide
  deducts a Mortality and Expense Risk Charge from the variable
  account.��This amount is computed on a daily basis and is equal to an
  annualized rate of 0.25% of the daily net assets of the variable
  account
�
The
  Mortality and Expense Risk Charge compensates Nationwide for providing the
  insurance benefits under the contract, including the contract�s standard death
  benefit that
�


�


10





�


�
provides
  a guaranteed death benefit to the��beneficiary(ies) even if the market
  declines.��It also compensates Nationwide for assuming the risk that
  annuitants will live longer than assumed.��Finally, the Mortality and
  Expense Risk Charge compensates Nationwide for guaranteeing that charges will
  not increase regardless of actual expenses.��Nationwide may realize a
  profit from this charge, which Nationwide may use to finance the distribution
  of
  the contracts.
�
Administrative
  Charge
�
Nationwide
  deducts an Administrative Charge from the variable account.��This
  amount is computed on a daily basis and is equal to an annualized rate of 0.20%
  of the daily net assets of the variable account.
�
The
  Administrative Charge reimburses Nationwide for administrative costs it incurs
  resulting from providing contract benefits, including preparation of the
  contract and prospectus, confirmation statements, annual account statements
  and
  annual reports, legal and accounting fees as well as various related
  expenses.
�
Nationwide
  may realize a profit from this charge, which Nationwide may use to finance
  the
  distribution of contracts.
�
Premium
  Taxes
�
Nationwide
  will charge against the contract value any premium taxes levied by a state
  or
  other government entity.��Premium tax rates currently range from 0% to
  5.0%.��This range is subject to change.��The method used to
  assess premium tax will be determined by Nationwide at its sole discretion
  in
  compliance with state law.
�
Nationwide
  currently deducts premium taxes from the contract either at:
�




(1)��


the
  time the contract is surrendered;




�




(2)��


annuitization;
  or




�




(3)��


such
  earlier date as Nationwide becomes subject to premium
  taxes.




�
Premium
  taxes may be deducted from death benefit proceeds.
�
Optional
  Contract Benefits,
  Charges and Deductions
�
For
  an
  additional charge, the following optional benefits are available to contract
  owners.��Not all optional benefits are available in every
  state.��Unless otherwise indicated:
�




(1)��


optional
  benefits must be elected at the time of
  application;




�




(2)��


optional
  benefits, once elected, may not be terminated;
  and




�




(3)��


the
  charges associated with the optional benefits will be assessed until
  annuitization.




�
Return
  of Premium Enhanced Death Benefit Option
�
In
  lieu
  of the standard death benefit, and for an additional charge at an annualized
  rate of 0.20% of the daily net assets of the variable account, applicants for
  contracts with annuitants who are age 75 or younger at the time of application
  may elect the Return of Premium Enhanced Death Benefit
  Option.��Generally, if the annuitant dies before the annuitization
  date, the death benefit will be the greater of:
�




(1)��


the
  contract value; or




�




(2)��


the
  total of all purchase payments made to the contract, less an adjustment
  for amounts surrendered.




�
The
  adjustment for amounts surrendered will reduce item (2) above in the same
  proportion that the contract value was reduced on the date(s) of the partial
  surrender(s).
�
For
  contracts that have elected this option, if the total of all purchase payments
  made to the contract is greater than $3,000,000, the death benefit will be
  adjusted as described in the �Death Benefit Calculations� provision on page
  23.
�
Extra
  Value Options
�
For
  an
  additional charge, an applicant can elect one of two Extra Value
  Options.
�
Applicants
  should be aware of the following prior to electing an Extra Value
  Option:
�




(1)��


Nationwide
  believes that the Extra Value Options, even after the direct and
  indirect
  costs associated with the options, will benefit the majority of contract
  owners.��If you have questions about whether an Extra Value
  Option is appropriate for you, please consult your individual registered
  representative specifically about the
  option.




�




(2)��


Nationwide
  may make a profit from the Extra Value Option
  charge.




�




(3)��


Because
  the Extra Value Option charge will be assessed against the entire
  contract
  value for the first 7 contract years, contract owners who anticipate
  making additional purchase payments after the first contract year
  (which
  will not receive the bonus credit but will be assessed the Extra
  Value
  Option charge) should carefully examine the Extra Value Option and
  consult
  their financial adviser regarding its
  desirability.




�




(4)��


Nationwide
  may take back or �recapture� all or part of the amount credited under an
  Extra Value Option in the event of early surrenders, including revocation
  of the contract during the contractual free-look
  period.




�




(5)��


If
  the market declines during the period that the bonus credits are
  subject
  to recapture, the amount subject to recapture could decrease the
  amount of
  contract value available for
  surrender.




�




(6)��


The
  cost of the Extra Value Options and the recapture of the credits
  (in the
  event of a surrender) could exceed any benefit of receiving an Extra
  Value
  Option credits.




�
3%
  Extra Value Option
�
For
  an
  additional charge at an annualized rate of 0.40% of the daily net assets of
  the
  variable account, an applicant can elect the 3% Extra Value
  Option.��After the end of the 7th contract
  year,
  Nationwide will discontinue assessing the charge associated with the 3% Extra
  Value Option.


�


11





�


In
  exchange, for the first 12 months the contract is in force, Nationwide will
  apply a credit to the contract equal to 3% of each purchase payment made to
  the
  contract.��This credit, which is funded from Nationwide�s general
  account, will be allocated among the sub-accounts in the same proportion that
  the purchase payment is allocated to the contract.��For purposes of
  all benefits and taxes under these contracts, credits applied under this option
  are considered earnings, not purchase payments.
�
4%
  Extra Value Option
�
For
  an
  additional charge at an annualized rate of 0.55% of the daily net assets of
  the
  variable account, an applicant can elect the 4% Extra Value Option. After the
  end of the 7th
contract year, Nationwide will discontinue assessing the charge associated
  with
  the 4% Extra Value Option.
�
In
  exchange, for the first 12 months the contract is in force, Nationwide will
  apply a credit to the contract equal to 4% of each purchase payment made to
  the
  contract.��This credit, which is funded from Nationwide�s general
  account, will be allocated among the sub-accounts in the same proportion that
  the purchase payment is allocated to the contract.��For purposes of
  all benefits and taxes under these contracts, credits applied under this option
  are considered earnings, not purchase payments.
�
Recapture
  of Extra Value Option Credits
�
Nationwide
  will recapture amounts credited to the contract in connection with the Extra
  Value Options if:
�




(a)��


the
  contract owner cancels the contract pursuant to the contractual free-look
  provision;




�




(b)��


the
  contract owner takes a full surrender before the end of the 7th
contract
  year; or




�




(c)��


in
  any contract year before the end of the 7th
contract
  year, the contract owner takes one or more partial surrenders that
  total
  more than 10% of the total of all purchase payments made to the contract
  during the first contract year.




�
Contract
  owners should carefully consider the consequences of taking a surrender that
  subjects part or all of the credit to recapture.��If contract value
  decreases due to poor market performance, the recapture provisions could
  decrease the amount of contract value available for surrender.
�
Nationwide
  will not recapture credits under the Extra Value Options under
  the following circumstances:
�




(1)��


If
  the distribution is taken as a result of a death, annuitization,
  or to
  meet minimum distribution requirements under the Internal Revenue
  Code;




�




(2)��


If
  the distribution is taken in order to pay financial advisor fees;
  or




�




(3)��


If
  the surrender occurs after the end of the 7th
contract
  year.




�
Recapture
  Resulting from Exercising Free-Look Privilege
�
If
  the
  contract owner cancels the contract pursuant to the contractual free-look
  provision, Nationwide will recapture the entire amount credited to the contract
  under this option.��In those states that require the return of
  purchase payments for IRAs that are surrendered pursuant to the contractual
  free-look, Nationwide will recapture the entire amount credited to the contract
  under this option, but under no circumstances will the amount returned be less
  than the purchase payments made to the contract.��In those states that
  allow a return of contract value, the contract owner will retain any earnings
  attributable to the amount credited, but all losses attributable to the amount
  credited will be incurred by Nationwide.
�
Recapture
  Resulting from a Full Surrender
�
For
  contracts with the 3% Extra Value Option or the 4% Extra Value Option, if the
  contract owner takes a full surrender�of the contract
  before the end of the 7th contract
  year,
  Nationwide will recapture the entire amount credited to the contract under
  the
  option.
�
Recapture
  Resulting from a Partial Surrender
�
For
  contracts with the 3% Extra Value Option or the 4% Extra Value Option, if a
  contract owner, during the first 7 contract years, takes one or more partial
  surrenders each contract year that total more than 10% of the total of all
  purchase payments made to the contract during the first contract year,
  Nationwide will recapture a proportional part of the amount credited to the
  contract under this option.
�
For
  example, Mr. X, who elected the 3% Extra Value Option, makes a $100,000 initial
  deposit to his contract and receives a 3% credit of $3,000.��In
  contract year 2, Mr. X takes a $15,000 surrender.��Under the contract
  Mr. X is entitled to surrender up to 10% of purchase payments made to the
  contract during the first contract year without subjecting any of the bonus
  to
  recapture.��Thus, he can take ($100,000 x 10%) = $10,000 free of
  recapture.��That leaves $5,000 of the surrender subject to
  recapture.��For the recapture calculation, Nationwide will multiply
  that $5,000 by 3% to get the portion of the original credit that Nationwide
  will
  recapture.��Thus, the amount of the original credit recaptured as a
  result of the $15,000 partial surrender is $150.
�
The
  amount recaptured will be taken from the sub-accounts in the same proportion
  that purchase payments are allocated as of the surrender date.
�
Some
  state jurisdictions require a reduced recapture schedule.��Please
  refer to your contract for state specific information.
�
Dynamic
  Advantage
  Program
�
The
  Dynamic Advantage Program (�DAP�) may be elected at any time before
  annuitization.��While the DAP is in effect, Nationwide will deduct a
  charge equal to an annualized rate of not more than 0.35% of the daily net
  assets of the variable account.��In exchange, Nationwide will provide
  administrative services enabling contract owners to have their contract value
  allocated and reallocated according to actively managed
models,
  for which Rydex Advisory Services, LLC acts as investment
  adviser.

�
Removal
  of Variable Account Charges
�
For
  certain optional benefits, a charge is assessed only for a specified period
  of
  time.��To remove a variable account charge at the end of the specified
  charge period, Nationwide systematically re-rates the contract.��This
  re-rating results in lower contract charges, but no change in contract value
  or
  any other contractual benefit.
�
Re-rating
  involves two steps: the adjustment of contract expenses and the adjustment
  of
  the number of units in the contract.
�
The
  first
  step, the adjustment of contract expenses, involves removing the charge from
  the
  unit value calculation.��For example, on a contract where the only
  optional benefit elected is the 3% Extra Value Option, the variable account
  value will be calculated using unit values with variable account charges of
  0.85% for the first 7 contract years.��At the end of that period, the
  contract will be re-rated, and the 0.40% charge associated with the 3% Extra
  Value Option will be removed.��From that point on, the variable
  account value will be calculated using the unit values with variable account
  charges at 0.45%.��Thus, the 3% Extra Value Option charge is no longer
  included in the daily sub-account valuation for the contract.
�
The
  second step of the re-rating process, the adjustment of the number of units
  in
  the contract, is necessary in order to keep the re-rating process from altering
  the contract value.��Generally, for any given sub-account, the higher
  the variable account charges, the lower the unit value, and vice
  versa.��For example, sub-account X with charges of 0.85% will have a
  lower unit value than sub-account X with charges of 0.45% (higher expenses
  result in lower unit values).��When, upon re-rating, the unit values
  used in calculating variable account value are dropped from the higher expense
  level to the lower expense level, the higher unit values will cause an
  incidental increase in the contract value.��In order to avoid this
  incidental increase, Nationwide adjusts the number of units in the contract
  down
  so that the contract value after the re-rating is the same as the contract
  value
  before the re-rating.
�
Ownership
  and Interests in the
  Contract
�
Contract
  Owner
�
Prior
  to
  the annuitization date, the contract owner has all rights under the contract,
  unless a joint owner is named.��If a joint owner is named, each joint
  owner has all rights under the contract.��Purchasers who name
  someone other than themselves as the contract owner will have no rights under
  the contract.
�
On
  the
  annuitization date, the annuitant becomes the contract owner, unless the
  contract owner is a Charitable Remainder Trust.��If the contract owner
  is a Charitable Remainder Trust, the Charitable Remainder Trust continues to
  be
  the contract owner after annuitization.
�
Contract
  owners of Non-Qualified Contracts may name a new contract owner at any time
  before the annuitization date.��Any change of contract owner
  automatically revokes any prior contract owner designation.��Changes
  in contract ownership may result in federal income taxation and may be subject
  to state and federal gift taxes.
�
Joint
  Owner
�
Joint
  owners each own an undivided interest in the contract.
�
Non-Qualified
  contract owners can name a joint owner at any time before
  annuitization.��However, joint owners must be spouses at the time
  joint ownership is requested, unless state law requires Nationwide to allow
  non-spousal joint owners.
�
Generally,
  the exercise of any ownership rights under the contract must be in writing
  and
  signed by both joint owners.��However, if a written election, signed
  by both contract owners, authorizing Nationwide to allow the exercise of
  ownership rights independently by either joint owner is submitted, Nationwide
  will permit joint owners to act independently.��If such an
  authorization is submitted, Nationwide will not be liable for any loss,
  liability, cost, or expense for acting in accordance with the instructions
  of
  either joint owner.
�
If
  either
  joint owner dies before the annuitization date, the contract continues with
  the
  surviving joint owner as the remaining contract owner.
�
Contingent
  Owner
�
The
  contingent owner succeeds to the rights of a contract owner if a contract owner
  who is not the annuitant dies before the annuitization date, and there is no
  surviving joint owner.
�
If
  a
  contract owner who is the annuitant dies before the annuitization date, the
  contingent owner will not have any rights under the contract, unless such
  contingent owner is also the beneficiary.
�
The
  contract owner may name a contingent owner at any time before the annuitization
  date.��Contingent owners may only be named for Non-Qualified
  Contracts.
�
Annuitant
�
The
  annuitant is the person who will receive annuity payments and upon whose
  continuation of life any annuity payment involving life contingencies
  depends.��This person must be age 85 or younger at the time of
  contract issuance, unless Nationwide approves a request for an annuitant of
  greater age.
�
Only
  Non-Qualified Contract owners may name someone other than himself/herself as
  the
  annuitant.
�
The
  contract owner may not name a new annuitant without Nationwide�s
  consent.
�
Contingent
  Annuitant
�
If
  the
  annuitant dies before the annuitization date, the contingent annuitant becomes
  the annuitant.��The contingent annuitant must be age 85 or younger at
  the time of contract issuance, unless Nationwide approves a request for a
  contingent annuitant of greater age.��Contingent annuitants may only
  be named in Non-Qualified Contracts.
�
If
  a
  contingent annuitant is named, all provisions of the contract that are based
  on
  the annuitant�s death prior to the annuitization date will be based on the death
  of the last survivor of the annuitant and contingent annuitant.


�


13





�


Co-Annuitant
�
A
  co-annuitant, if named, must be the annuitant�s spouse.��The
  co-annuitant may be named at any time prior to annuitization and will receive
  the benefit of the Spousal Protection Feature (subject to the conditions set
  forth in the �Spousal Protection Feature� provision).
�
If
  either
  co-annuitant dies before the annuitization date, the surviving co-annuitant
  may
  continue the contract and will receive the benefit of the Spousal Protection
  Feature.
�
Beneficiary
  and Contingent Beneficiary
�
The
  beneficiary is the person who is entitled to the death benefit if the annuitant
  dies before the annuitization date and there is no joint owner.��The
  contract owner can name more than one beneficiary.��Multiple
  beneficiaries will share the death benefit equally, unless otherwise
  specified.
�
A
  contingent beneficiary will succeed to the rights of the beneficiary if no
  beneficiary is alive when a death benefit is paid.��The contract owner
  can name more than one contingent beneficiary.��Multiple contingent
  beneficiaries will share the death benefit equally, unless otherwise
  specified.
�
Changes
  to the Parties to the Contract
�
Prior
  to
  the annuitization date (and subject to any existing assignments), the contract
  owner may request to change the following:
�




���


contract
  owner (Non-Qualified Contracts
  only);




�




���


joint
  owner (must be the contract owner�s
  spouse);




�




���


contingent
  owner;




�




���


annuitant
  (subject to Nationwide�s underwriting and
  approval);




�




���


contingent
  annuitant (subject to Nationwide�s underwriting and
  approval);




�




���


co-annuitant
  (must be the annuitant�s spouse);




�




���


beneficiary;
  or




�




���


contingent
  beneficiary.




�
The
  contract owner must submit the request to Nationwide in writing and Nationwide
  must receive the request at its home office before the annuitization
  date.��No change will be effective unless and until it is received and
  recorded at Nationwide�s home office.��Once Nationwide receives and
  records the change request, the change will be effective as of the date the
  written request was signed.
�
In
  addition to the above requirements, any request to change the contract owner
  must be signed by the existing contract owner and the person designated as
  the
  new contract owner.��Nationwide may require a signature
  guarantee.
�
If
  the
  contract owner is not a natural person and there is a change of the annuitant,
  distributions will be made as if the contract owner died at the time of the
  change, regardless of whether the contract owner named a contingent
  annuitant.
�
Nationwide
  reserves the right to reject any change request that would alter the nature
  of
  the risk that Nationwide assumed when it originally issued the contract (see
  �Purpose of the Contract� earlier in this prospectus).

�
If
  the
  contract owner elects the Extra Value Option, amounts credited to the contract
  may not be used to meet the minimum initial and subsequent purchase payment
  requirements.
�
The
  cumulative total of all purchase payments under contracts issued by Nationwide
  on the life of any one annuitant cannot exceed $1,000,000 without Nationwide�s
  prior consent.
�
Pricing
�
Generally,
  Nationwide calculates accumulation and annuity unit values of the sub-accounts
  on each day that the New York Stock Exchange is open.��(Pricing is the
  calculation of a new accumulation unit value that reflects that day�s investment
  experience.)��Accumulation units and annuity units are not priced when
  the New York Stock Exchange is closed or on the following nationally recognized
  holidays:
�




���New
  Year�s Day


���Independence
  Day




���Martin
  Luther King, Jr. Day


���Labor
  Day




���Presidents�
  Day


���Thanksgiving




���Good
  Friday


���Christmas




���Memorial
  Day

�



�
Nationwide
  also will not price purchase payments if:
�




(1)��


trading
  on the New York Stock Exchange is
  restricted;




�




(2)��


an
  emergency exists making disposal or valuation of securities held
  in the
  variable account impracticable; or




�




(3)��


the
  SEC, by order, permits a suspension or postponement for the protection
  of
  security holders.




�
Rules
  and
  regulations of the SEC will govern as to when the conditions described in (2)
  and (3) exist.��On those days when the NYSE is open and Nationwide is
  closed, contract value may change and the contract owners will not have access
  to their accounts.


�

�


Application
  and Allocation of Purchase Payments
�
Initial
  Purchase Payments
�
Initial
  purchase payments will be priced at the accumulation unit value next determined
  no later than 2 business days after receipt of an order to purchase if the
  application and all necessary information are complete�and are received at
  Nationwide�s home office before the close of the New York Stock Exchange, which
  generally occurs at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.��If the order is received
  after the close of the New York Stock Exchange, the initial purchase payment
  will be priced within 2 business days after the next business day.
�
If
  an
  incomplete application is not completed within 5 business days of receipt at
  Nationwide�s home office, the prospective purchaser will be informed of the
  reason for the delay.��The purchase payment will be returned to the
  prospective purchaser unless he or she specifically consents to allow Nationwide
  to hold the purchase payment until the application is completed.
�
In
  some
  states, Nationwide will allocate initial purchase payments to the money market
  sub-account during the free look period.��After the free look period,
  Nationwide will reallocate the contract value among the sub-accounts based
  on
  the instructions contained on the application.��See the �Right to
  Examine and Cancel� provision.
�
Subsequent
  Purchase Payments
�
Any
  subsequent purchase payment received at Nationwide�s home office (along with all
  necessary information) before the close of the New York Stock Exchange will
  be
  priced at the accumulation unit value next determined after receipt of the
  purchase payment.��If a subsequent purchase payment is received at
  Nationwide�s home office (with all the necessary information) after the close of
  the New York Stock Exchange, it will be priced at the accumulation unit value
  determined on the following business day.
�
Allocation
  of Purchase Payments
�
Nationwide
  allocates purchase payments to sub-accounts as instructed by the contract
  owner.��Shares of the underlying mutual funds allocated to the
  sub-accounts are purchased at net asset value, then converted into accumulation
  units.
�
Contract
  owners can change allocations or make exchanges among the
  sub-accounts.��However, no change may be made that would result in an
  amount less than 1% of the purchase payments being allocated to any
  sub-account.��In the event that Nationwide receives such a request,
  Nationwide will inform the contract owner that the allocation instructions
  are
  invalid and that the contract�s allocations among the sub-accounts prior to the
  request will remain in effect.��Certain transactions may be subject to
  conditions imposed by the underlying mutual funds, as well as those set forth
  in
  the contract.
�
Determining
  the Contract Value
�
The
  contract value is the value of amounts allocated to the
  sub-accounts.
�
If
  part
  or all of the contract value is surrendered, or charges are assessed against
  the
  whole contract value, Nationwide will deduct a proportionate amount from each
  of
  the sub-accounts.

Determining
  Variable Account Value � Valuing an Accumulation Unit
�
Purchase
  payments or transfers allocated to sub-accounts are accounted for in
  accumulation units.��Accumulation unit values (for each sub-account)
  are determined by calculating the net investment factor for the underlying
  mutual funds for the current valuation period and multiplying that result with
  the accumulation unit values determined on the previous valuation
  period.
�
Nationwide
  uses the net investment factor as a way to calculate the investment performance
  of a sub-account from valuation period to valuation period.��For each
  sub-account, the net investment factor shows the investment performance of
  the
  underlying mutual fund in which a particular sub-account invests, including
  the
  charges assessed against that sub-account for a valuation period.
�
The
  net
  investment factor is determined by dividing (a) by (b), and then subtracting
  (c)
  from the result, where:
�




(a)��


is
  the sum of:




�




(1)��


the
  net asset value of the underlying mutual fund as of the end of the
  current
  valuation period; and




�




(2)��


the
  per share amount of any dividend or income distributions made by
  the
  underlying mutual fund (if the date of the dividend or income distribution
  occurs during the current valuation
  period);




�




(b)��


is
  the net asset value of the underlying mutual fund determined as of
  the end
  of the preceding valuation period;
  and




�




(c)��


is
  a factor representing the daily variable account charges, which may
  include charges for contract options chosen by the contract
  owner.��The factor is equal to an annualized rate ranging from
  0.45% to 1.55% of the daily net assets of the variable account, depending
  on which contract features the contract owner
  chose.




�
Based
  on
  the net investment factor, the value of an accumulation unit may increase or
  decrease.��Changes in the net investment factor may not be directly
  proportional to changes in the net asset value of the underlying mutual fund
  shares because of the deduction of variable account charges.
�
Though
  the number of accumulation units will not change as a result of investment
  experience, the value of an accumulation unit may increase or decrease from
  valuation period to valuation period.
�
Transfers
  Prior to Annuitization
�
Generally,
  allocations may be transferred among the sub-accounts once per valuation period
  without charges or penalties.
�
Frequent
  Trading and Transfer Restrictions
�
The
  contracts sold with this prospectus are designed to support active trading
  strategies that require frequent movement between or among
  sub-accounts.��A contract owner who does not intend to use an active
  trading strategy should consult his/her registered representative and request
  information on other Nationwide variable annuity contracts.


�


15





�


All
  of
  the sub-accounts are available for frequent transfers except for sub-accounts
  corresponding to the following underlying mutual funds of the Rydex Variable
  Trust:
�




���


Absolute
  Return Strategies Fund,




�




���


Commodities
  Strategy Fund,




�




���


Hedged
  Equity Fund,




�




���


Multi-Cap
  Core Equity Fund, and




�




���


Sector
  Rotation Fund.




�
For
  purposes of this provision, these sub-accounts are referred to as the �limited
  transfer� funds.
�
Nationwide
  discourages (and will take action to deter) inappropriate frequent transfers
  between and among the limited transfer funds because frequent movement between
  or among those sub-accounts may negatively impact other
  investors.��Frequent transfers among the limited transfer funds can
  result in:
�




���


the
  dilution of the value of the investors' interests in the underlying
  mutual
  fund;




�




���


underlying
  mutual fund managers taking actions that negatively impact performance
  (keeping a larger portion of the underlying mutual fund assets in
  cash or
  liquidating investments prematurely in order to support redemption
  requests); and/or




�




���


increased
  administrative costs due to frequent purchases and
  redemptions.




�
To
  protect investors in this contract from the potentially negative impact of
  frequent transfers among the limited transfer funds, Nationwide has implemented,
  or reserves the right to implement, several restrictions designed to deter
  frequent transfers among the limited transfer funds, while still permitting
  contract owners to actively trade among the remaining underlying mutual funds
  available under the contract.��Nationwide makes no assurance that all
  risks associated with frequent trading will be completely eliminated by these
  processes and/or restrictions.
�
If
  Nationwide is unable to deter frequent trading in the limited transfer funds,
  the performance of the sub-accounts may be adversely impacted.
�
U.S.
  Mail Restrictions
�
If
  Nationwide determines that a contract owner (or a third party acting on the
  contract owner's behalf) is engaging in harmful market timing, Nationwide
  reserves the right to take actions to protect investors, including exercising
  its right to terminate the ability of specified contract owners to submit
  transfer requests via telephone, facsimile, or over the Internet.��If
  Nationwide exercises this right, affected contract owners would be limited
  to
  submitting transfer requests via U.S. mail.

Other
  Restrictions
�
Nationwide
  reserves the right to refuse or limit transfer requests, or take any other
  action it deems necessary, in order to protect contract owners, annuitants,
  and
  beneficiaries from the negative investment results that may result from
  inappropriate market timing or other harmful investment practices employed
  by
  some contract owners (or third parties acting on their behalf).
�
Any
  restrictions that Nationwide implements will be applied consistently and
  uniformly.
�
Underlying
  Mutual Fund Restrictions and Prohibitions
�
Pursuant
  to regulations adopted by the SEC, Nationwide is required to enter into written
  agreements with the underlying mutual funds which allow the underlying mutual
  funds to:
�




(1)


request
  the taxpayer identification number, international taxpayer identification
  number, or other government issued identifier of any Nationwide contract
  owner;




�




(2)


request
  the amounts and dates of any purchase, redemption, transfer or exchange
  request (�transaction information�);
  and




�




(3)


instruct
  Nationwide to restrict or prohibit further purchases or exchanges
  into a
  specific underlying mutual fund by contract owners that violate policies
  established by the underlying mutual fund (whose policies may be
  more
  restrictive than Nationwide�s
  policies).




�
Nationwide
  is required to provide such transaction information to the underlying mutual
  funds upon their request.��In addition, Nationwide is required to
  restrict or prohibit further purchases or exchange requests into one or more
  underlying mutual funds based upon instruction from the underlying mutual
  fund.��Nationwide and any affected contract owner may not have advance
  notice of such instructions from an underlying mutual fund to restrict or
  prohibit further purchase requests.��If an underlying mutual fund
  refuses to accept a purchase request submitted by Nationwide, Nationwide will
  keep any affected contract owner in their current underlying mutual fund
  allocation.
�
Transfers
  After Annuitization
�
After
  annuitization, transfers among sub-accounts may only be made on the anniversary
  of the annuitization date.
�
Transfer
  Requests
�
Contract
  owners may submit transfer requests in writing, over the telephone, or via
  the
  Internet.��Nationwide will use reasonable procedures to confirm that
  instructions are genuine and will not be liable for following instructions
  that
  it reasonably determines to be genuine.��Nationwide may restrict or
  withdraw the telephone and/or Internet transfer privilege at any
  time.��Any restrictions on Internet use will not apply to contracts
  participating in the DAP.


�


16





�


�
Any
  request to transfer contract value among sub-accounts must be received by
  Nationwide�s home office no later than 1 hour before any announced closing of
  the New York Stock Exchange (the �cut-off� time) to be processed on the current
  valuation day.��The New York Stock Exchange typically closes at 4:00
  p.m. Eastern Time; thus, transfer requests must generally be received by
  Nationwide�s home office no later than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time for the request to
  be processed on the current valuation day.
�
Nationwide
  may extend the cut-off time to 25 minutes before any announced closing of the
  New York Stock Exchange (generally, 3:35 p.m. Eastern Time) for transfer
  requests submitted electronically through Nationwide�s Internet website
  (www.nationwide.com).
�
All
  transfer requests received after the applicable cut-off time will be processed
  on the next valuation day.
�
Right
  to Examine and
  Cancel
�
If
  the
  contract owner elects to cancel the contract, he/she may return it to
  Nationwide�s home office within a certain period of time known as the �free
  look� period.��Depending on the state in which the contract was
  purchased (and, in some states, if the contract is purchased as a replacement
  for another annuity contract), the free look period may be 10 days or
  longer.��For ease of administration, Nationwide will honor any free
  look cancellation that is received at Nationwide�s home office or postmarked
  within 30 days after the contract issue date.��The contract issue date
  is the next business day after the initial purchase payment is applied to the
  contract.
�
If
  the
  contract owner elects to cancel the contract pursuant to the free look
  provision, where required by law, Nationwide will return the greater of the
  contract value or the amount of purchase payment(s) applied during the free
  look
  period, less any applicable federal and state income tax
  withholding.��Otherwise, Nationwide will return the contract value,
  less any applicable federal and state income tax withholding.
�
In
  some
  states, Nationwide will allocate initial purchase payments to the money market
  sub-account during the free look period.��After the free look period,
  Nationwide will reallocate the contract value among the sub-accounts based
  on
  the instructions contained on the application.
�
Liability
  of the variable account under this provision is limited to the contract value
  in
  each sub-account on the date of revocation.��Any additional amounts
  refunded to the contract owner will be paid by Nationwide.
�
Please
  see �Extra Value Options� for a description of the recapture of the amount
  credited under an Extra Value Option in the event the right to free look the
  contract is exercised.
�
Surrender
  (Redemption)
�
Contract
  owners may surrender some or all of their contract value before the earlier
  of
  the annuitization date or the annuitant�s death.��Surrenders from the
  contract may be subject to federal income tax and/or a penalty
  tax.��See �Federal Income Taxes� in Appendix C: Contract Types and Tax
  Information.
�
Surrender
  requests must be in writing and Nationwide may require additional
  information.��When taking a full surrender, the contract must
  accompany the written request.��Nationwide may require a signature
  guarantee.
�
Nationwide
  will pay any amounts surrendered from the sub-accounts within 7
  days.��Additionally, Nationwide may suspend or postpone payment when
  it is unable to price a purchase payment or transfer (see,
�Pricing�).
�
Surrender
  requests will receive the accumulation unit value next determined at the end
  of
  the current valuation period if the surrender request and all necessary
  information is received at Nationwide�s home office before the close of the New
  York Stock Exchange (generally, 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time).��If the
  surrender request and all necessary information is received after the close
  of
  the New York Stock Exchange, the surrender request will receive the accumulation
  unit value determined at the end of the next valuation day.
�
Partial
  Surrenders (Partial Redemptions)
�
For
  partial surrenders, Nationwide will surrender accumulation units from the
  sub-accounts in proportion to the value in each underlying mutual fund at the
  time of the surrender request.
�
Partial
  Surrenders to Pay Financial Advisor Fees
�
Some
  contract owners utilize an investment advisor(s) to manage their assets, for
  which the investment advisor assesses a fee.��Investment advisors are
  not endorsed by or affiliated with Nationwide and Nationwide makes no
  representation as to their qualifications.��The fees for these
  investment advisory services are specified in the respective account agreements
  and are separate from and in addition to the contract fees and expenses
  described in this prospectus.��Some contract owners authorize their
  investment advisor to take a partial surrender(s) from the contract in order
  to
  collect investment advisory fees.��Surrenders taken from this contract
  to pay advisory or investment management fees may be subject to income tax
  and/or tax penalties.
�
Full
  Surrenders (Full Redemptions)
�
The
  contract value upon full surrender may be more or less than the total of all
  purchase payments made to the contract.��The contract value will
  reflect:
�




���


variable
  account charges;




�




���


underlying
  mutual fund charges;




�




���


the
  investment performance of the underlying mutual funds;
  and




�




���


any
  recapture of any Extra Value Option
  credit.




�
Surrenders
  Under a Texas Optional Retirement Program or a Louisiana Optional Retirement
  Plan
�
Redemption
  restrictions apply to contracts issued under the Texas Optional Retirement
  Program or the Louisiana Optional Retirement Plan.


�


17





�


�
The
  Texas
  Attorney General has ruled that participants in contracts issued under the
  Texas
  Optional Retirement Program may only take withdrawals if:
�




���


the
  participant dies;




�




���


the
  participant retires;




�




���


the
  participant terminates employment due to total disability;
  or




�




���


the
  participant that works in a Texas public institution of higher education
  terminates employment.




�
A
  participant under a contract issued under the Louisiana Optional Retirement
  Plan
  may only take distributions from the contract upon retirement or termination
  of
  employment.��All retirement benefits under this type of plan must be
  paid as lifetime income; lump sum cash payments are not permitted, except for
  death benefits.
�
Due
  to
  the restrictions described above, a participant under either of these plans
  will
  not be able to withdraw cash values from the contract unless one of the
  applicable conditions is met.��Contract value may be transferred to
  other carriers.
�
Nationwide
  issues this contract to participants in the Texas Optional Retirement Program
  in
  reliance upon and in compliance with Rule 6c-7 of the Investment Company Act
  of
  1940.��Nationwide issues this contract to participants in the
  Louisiana Optional Retirement Plan in reliance upon and in compliance with
  an
  exemptive order that Nationwide received from the SEC on August 22,
  1990.
�
Surrenders
  Under a Tax Sheltered Annuity
�
Contract
  owners of a Tax Sheltered Annuity may surrender part or all of their contract
  value before the earlier of the annuitization date or the annuitant�s death,
  except as provided below:
�




(A)��


Contract
  value attributable to contributions made under a qualified cash or
  deferred arrangement (within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code
  Section
  402(g)(3)(A)), a salary reduction agreement (within the meaning of
  Internal Revenue Code Section 402(g)(3)(C)), or transfers from a
  Custodial
  Account (described in Section 403(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code),
  may
  be surrendered only:




�




(1)��


when
  the contract owner reaches age 59�, separates from service, dies or
  becomes disabled (within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section
  72(m)(7)); or




�




(2)��


in
  the case of hardship (as defined for purposes of Internal Revenue
  Code
  Section 401(k)), provided that any such hardship surrender may
  not include any income earned on salary reduction
  contributions.




�




(B)��


The
  surrender limitations described in Section A also apply
  to:




�




(1)


salary
  reduction contributions to Tax Sheltered Annuities made for plan
  years
  beginning after December 31, 1988;




�




(2)


earnings
  credited to such contracts after the last plan year beginning before
  January 1, 1989, on amounts attributable to salary reduction
  contributions; and




�




�


(3)


all
  amounts transferred from 403(b)(7) Custodial Accounts (except that
  earnings and employer contributions as of December 31, 1988 in such
  Custodial Accounts may be withdrawn in the case of
  hardship).




�
Any
  distribution other than the above, including a ten day free look cancellation
  of
  the contract (when available) may result in taxes, penalties and/or retroactive
  disqualification of a Tax Sheltered Annuity.
�
In
  order
  to prevent disqualification of a Tax Sheltered Annuity after a ten day free
  look
  cancellation, Nationwide will transfer the proceeds to another Tax Sheltered
  Annuity upon proper direction by the contract owner.
�
These
  provisions explain Nationwide's understanding of current withdrawal
  restrictions.��These restrictions may change.
�
Distributions
  pursuant to Qualified Domestic Relations Orders will not violate the
  restrictions stated above.
�
Assignment
�
Contract
  rights are personal to the contract owner and may not be assigned without
  Nationwide�s written consent.
�
A
  Non-Qualified Contract owner may assign some or all rights under the
  contract.��An assignment must occur before annuitization while the
  annuitant is alive.��Once proper notice of assignment is recorded by
  Nationwide�s home office, the assignment will become effective as of the date
  the written request was signed.
�
Investment-only
  Contracts, IRAs, SEP IRAs, Simple IRAs, Roth IRAs, and Tax Sheltered Annuities
  may not be assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred except where allowed
  by
  law.
�
Nationwide
  is not responsible for the validity or tax consequences of any
  assignment.��Nationwide is not liable for any payment or settlement
  made before the assignment is recorded.��Assignments will not be
  recorded until Nationwide receives sufficient direction from the contract owner
  and the assignee regarding the proper allocation of contract
  rights.
�
Amounts
  pledged or assigned will be treated as distributions and will be included in
  gross income to the extent that the cash value exceeds the investment in the
  contract for the taxable year in which it was pledged or
  assigned.��Amounts assigned may be subject to a tax penalty equal to
  10% of the amount included in gross income.
�
Assignment
  of the entire contract value may cause the portion of the contract value
  exceeding the total investment in the contract and previously taxed amounts
  to
  be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes each year that
  the
  assignment is in effect.

  $100) on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis.��Requests
  for systematic withdrawals and requests to discontinue systematic withdrawals
  must be in writing.
�
The
  withdrawals will be taken from the sub-accounts proportionately unless
  Nationwide is instructed otherwise.
�
Nationwide
  will withhold federal income taxes from systematic withdrawals unless otherwise
  instructed by the contract owner.��The Internal Revenue Service may
  impose a 10% penalty tax if the contract owner is under age 59� unless the
  contract owner has made an irrevocable election of distributions of
  substantially equal payments.
�
Nationwide
  reserves the right to stop establishing new systematic withdrawal
  programs.��Systematic withdrawals are not available before the end of
  the ten day free look period (see �Right to Examine and Cancel�).
�
Dynamic
  Advantage Program
�
Contract
  owners may elect the Dynamic Advantage Program (�DAP�), an asset allocation
  service that enables contract owners to have their contract value allocated
  and
  reallocated, on a continuous basis, according to one of a variety of actively
  managed asset allocation models.��Contract owners may elect to
  participate or terminate the DAP at any time prior to
  annuitization.��While the DAP is in effect, Nationwide will assess an
  additional charge equal to an annualized rate not to exceed 0.35% of the daily
  net assets of the variable account as compensation for implementing
  administrative systems that are not needed in the absence of the
  DAP.
�
Participation
  in the DAP does not guarantee profit or protect against
  loss.��Additionally, Nationwide bears no responsibility in connection
  with the use of the DAP by plans that are subject to ERISA.��Contract
  owners are advised to consult qualified tax professionals before electing the
  DAP.
�
The
  Models Available in the DAP
�
The
  models available through the DAP are actively managed by Rydex Advisory
  Services, LLC (�Rydex�) according to that model�s specific investment
  goals.��Some models are managed based on information received from an
  independent third-party firm; some models are managed based on proprietary
  tools
  and methodologies of Rydex.��The currently available models
  are:

Each
  model is comprised of sub-accounts that correspond to underlying mutual funds
  of
  the Rydex Variable Trust and occasionally, the NVIT � Nationwide NVIT Money
  Market Fund II.��More information about the DAP and the individual
  models is available in the brochure for the program.��More information
  about the underlying mutual funds utilized in the models is available in the
  underlying mutual funds� prospectuses.
�
It
  is the
  contract owner's responsibility to elect a model.��Nationwide
  encourages the contract owner to consult a qualified financial adviser who
  will
  assist in determining the most appropriate model based on the contract owner's
  particular financial needs, time horizon, and willingness to accept investment
  risk.��The investment adviser may use tools to make this determination
  that are either independently acquired or provided by
  Rydex.��Nationwide bears no responsibility for the investment
  decision.
�
Nationwide
  neither endorses nor guarantees any investment model or
  strategy.��Nationwide is not affiliated with Rydex or any of the
  independent third parties employed by Rydex in connection with the management
  of
  DAP models.
�
Rydex
  as Investment Adviser
�
For
  those
  contracts that elect to use the DAP, the contract owner will enter into a client
  agreement with Rydex appointing Rydex as their investment adviser for the sole
  purpose of developing and maintaining the models.��Contract owners
  will receive a copy of Rydex's DAP brochure/Form ADV at the time of application,
  which contains more information about Rydex's role as investment
  adviser.
�
Election
  of the DAP
�
When
  the
  DAP is available, a contract owner may elect to begin participating by
  submitting a written model election form and Rydex client agreement to
  Nationwide's service center.��As part of the election form, every
  contract owner who wishes to participate in the DAP must agree to receive
  advance notice of model changes electronically through a password-protected
  Internet website.��Specific website and online account information is
  contained in the DAP brochure.


�


19





�


�
The
  DAP
  will not be effective on a particular contract until the contract owner
  successfully logs into his Nationwide online account via the
  Internet.��Until such time, the contract value will be allocated as
  instructed by the contract owner (if no instructions are provided, the contract
  value will be allocated to the NVIT � Nationwide NVIT Money Market Fund II) and
  the DAP charge will not be assessed. If the contract owner is transferring
  to a
  DAP model from an underlying mutual fund that assesses a redemption fee,
  redemption fees will apply.
�
Once
  the
  contract owner successfully logs into his Nationwide online account, Nationwide
  will begin the process to reallocate the contract value according to the elected
  model�s current allocations and Nationwide will begin assessing the DAP
  charge.��Participation in the DAP will continue until Nationwide
  records a valid DAP termination request submitted by the contract
  owner.
�
Only
  one
  model may be elected at any given time and while the DAP is in effect, the
  contract owner will not be permitted to transfer contract value among the
  sub-accounts without first terminating their participation in the
  DAP.��Any subsequent payments submitted to the contract will be
  allocated according to the currently elected model.��Any surrenders
  taken from the contract while the DAP is in effect will be taken proportionally
  from the sub-accounts.��Any charges assessed to the contract will be
  taken proportionally from the sub-accounts.
�
Evaluating
  and Updating the Models
�
Rydex
  will constantly evaluate the models to assess whether the combination and
  allocation of the sub-accounts within each model optimizes the return potential
  for that model.��When deemed necessary by Rydex, Rydex will update the
  models, with such updates occurring as often as several times per
  week.��Updating the models could entail adding or removing one or more
  sub-accounts from a model, or changing the allocation percentages among existing
  sub-accounts.��Rydex bears sole responsibility for monitoring and
  updating the models.
�
On
  any
  date that model changes are implemented, Nationwide will reallocate the contract
  value of contracts participating in the affected model pursuant to the
  discretionary authority granted to Nationwide as a requirement to participate
  in
  the DAP.��These changes will cause a reallocation of the contract
  value in accordance with the new model allocations.
�
Electronic
  Notification of Model Updates
�
Because
  all of the models available in the DAP are actively managed, it is likely that
  Rydex will update the models frequently.��When Rydex determines that a
  model update is warranted, Nationwide will, on behalf of Rydex, post a notice
  to
  each model participant�s message center (within their Nationwide online
  account).��The notice will be posted at least 48 hours before any
  model changes are implemented and will direct the contract owner to online
  information about the intended model changes.��After the model changes
  have been made, Nationwide will e-deliver a confirmation to each participant's
  message center.��Contract owners should check their Nationwide
  online account�s message center frequently and review these notices
  carefully.
�
If
  the
  contract owner is comfortable with the impending model changes, the contract
  owner need not take any action.��If the contract owner is not
  comfortable with the impending model changes, the contract owner may either
  select a different model or terminate their participation in the
  DAP.
�
Changing
  Models
�
Contract
  owners participating in the DAP may elect to change models at any
  time.��An election to change models must be communicated to
  Nationwide�s home office in writing.��If a request to change models is
  received by Nationwide�s home office prior to 25 minutes before the close of the
  New York Stock Exchange (generally, 3:35 p.m. Eastern Time) on any valuation
  day, the change will be effective as of that day; if received later than 25
  minutes before the close of the New York Stock Exchange, or on a non-valuation
  day, the change will be effective as of the next valuation day.
�
Currently,
  Nationwide does not impose any restrictions on changing
  models.��However, Nationwide reserves the right to limit the number,
  frequency, and mode of communication of model change requests upon written
  notice to contract owners.
�
Terminating
  Participation in the DAP
�
Contract
  owners participating in the DAP may elect to terminate participation in the
  program at any time.��An election to terminate a contract�s DAP must
  be communicated to Nationwide�s home office in writing or electronically through
  the contract owner�s Nationwide online account.��If a DAP termination
  request is received by Nationwide�s home office prior to 25 minutes before the
  close of the New York Stock Exchange (generally, 3:35 p.m. Eastern Time)on
  any
  valuation day, the termination will be effective as of that day; if received
  later than 25 minutes before the close of the New York Stock Exchange, or on
  a
  non-valuation day, the termination will be effective as of the next valuation
  day.��When a contract owner's participation in the DAP is terminated,
  the contract value will remain invested as it was on the last day of
  participation in the DAP and the DAP charge will no longer be
  assessed.��Additionally, please be aware that the terms of the
�Transfer Restrictions� provision apply.
�
Upon
  a
  contract owner�s death, Nationwide will terminate the DAP within a reasonable
  time after such notification, unless Nationwide is instructed
  otherwise.��Nationwide reserves the right to terminate the
  availability of the DAP at any time upon written notice to contract
  owners.
�
Risks
  Associated with the DAP
�
Neither
  Nationwide nor Rydex guarantees that participation in the DAP will result in
  a
  profit or protect against a loss.
�
Rydex
  may
  be subject to competing interests that may affect its decisions as to which
  sub-accounts are utilized in the models.��Specifically, the models are
  comprised of sub-accounts that correspond to underlying mutual funds owned
  by a
  Rydex affiliate, with such affiliate�s investment advisory fees varying from
  fund to fund.��However, Rydex believes that its responsibilities and
  obligations to the contract owners outweigh any conflict that may exist relating
  to the underlying


�


20





�


�
mutual
  funds, enabling it to make substantially unbiased choices as to the sub-accounts
  within the models.
�
Annuity
  Commencement Date
�
The
  annuity commencement date is the date on which annuity payments are scheduled
  to
  begin. The contract owner may change the annuity commencement date before
  annuitization.��This change must be in writing and approved by
  Nationwide.
�
Annuitizing
  the Contract
�
Annuitization
  Date
�
The
  annuitization date is the date that annuity payments begin.��The
  annuitization date will be the first day of a calendar month unless otherwise
  agreed.��The annuitization date must be at least 2 years after the
  contract is issued, but may not be later than:
�




���


the
  age (or date) specified in the contract (the annuity commencement
  date as
  specified by the contract owner and reflected on the contract�s data
  page); or




�




���


the
  age (or date) specified by state law, where
  applicable.




�
If
  the
  contract is issued to fund a Tax Sheltered Annuity, annuitization may occur
  during the first 2 years subject to Nationwide�s approval.
�
For
  any
  contract that is issued as a Non-Qualified Contract or as a Roth-IRA contract,
  the annuity commencement date is the contract owner�s 90th birthday
  unless
  the contract owner specifies otherwise.
�
For
  all
  other types of contracts, the annuity commencement date is the date when the
  contract owner reaches age 70� unless the contract owner specifies
  otherwise.��The contract owner may not, however, extend the annuity
  commencement date to a date after the contract owner�s 90th
  birthday.��For contracts which have joint owners the older contract
  owner�s age will be used.
�
The
  Internal Revenue Code may require that distributions be made prior to the
  annuitization dates specified above (see �Required Distributions� in Appendix C:
  Contract Types and Tax Information).
�
Annuitization
�
Annuitization
  is the period during which annuity payments are received.��It is
  irrevocable once payments have begun.��Upon arrival of the
  annuitization date, the annuitant must choose:
�




(1)


an
  annuity payment option; and




�




(2)


either
  a fixed payment annuity, variable payment annuity, or an available
  combination.




�
Nationwide
  guarantees that each payment under a fixed payment annuity will be the same
  throughout annuitization.��Under a variable payment annuity, the
  amount of each payment will vary with the performance of the underlying mutual
  funds chosen by the contract owner.
�
If
  the
  contract owner does not elect an annuity payment option, a variable payment
  life
  annuity with a guarantee period of 240 months will be the automatic form of
  payment upon annuitization.
�
DAP
  models are not available as investment options during
  annuitization.
�
Fixed
  Payment Annuity
�
A
  fixed
  payment annuity is an annuity where the amount of the annuity payment remains
  level.
�
The
  first
  payment under a fixed payment annuity is determined on the annuitization date
  based on the annuitant�s age (in accordance with the contract) by:
�




(1)��


deducting
  applicable premium taxes from the total contract value;
  then




�




(2)��


applying
  the contract value amount specified by the contract owner to the
  fixed
  payment annuity table for the annuity payment option
  elected.




�
Subsequent
  payments will remain level unless the annuity payment option elected provides
  otherwise. Nationwide does not credit discretionary interest during
  annuitization.
�
VariablePayment
  Annuity
�
A
  variable payment annuity is an annuity where the amount of the annuity payments
  will vary depending on the performance of the underlying mutual funds
  selected.
�
The
  first
  payment under a variable payment annuity is determined on the annuitization
  date
  based on the annuitant�s age (in accordance with the contract) by:
�




(1)��


deducting
  applicable premium taxes from the total contract value;
  then




�




(2)��


applying
  the contract value amount specified by the contract owner to the
  variable
  payment annuity table for the annuity payment option
  elected.




�
The
  dollar amount of the first payment is converted into a set number of annuity
  units that will represent each monthly payment.��This is done by
  dividing the dollar amount of the first payment by the value of an annuity
  unit
  as of the annuitization date.��This number of annuity units remains
  fixed during annuitization.
�
The
  second and subsequent payments are determined by multiplying the fixed number
  of
  annuity units by the annuity unit value for the valuation period in which the
  payment is due.��The amount of the second and subsequent payments will
  vary with the performance of the selected underlying mutual
  funds.��Nationwide guarantees that variations in mortality experience
  from assumptions used to calculate the first payment will not affect the dollar
  amount of the second and subsequent payments.
�
Value
  of an Annuity Unit
�
Annuity
  unit values for sub-accounts are determined by:
�




(1)��


multiplying
  the annuity unit value for the immediately preceding valuation period
  by
  the net investment factor for the subsequent valuation period (see
  �Determining the Contract Value�); and
  then






�


21





�






(2)��


multiplying
  the result from (1) by the assumed investment rate of 3.5% adjusted
  for
  the number of days in the valuation
  period.




�
Assumed
  Investment Rate
�
An
  assumed investment rate is the percentage rate of return assumed to determine
  the amount of the first payment under a variable payment
  annuity.��Nationwide uses the assumed investment rate of 3.5% to
  calculate the first annuity payment and to calculate the investment performance
  of an underlying mutual fund in order to determine subsequent payments under
  a
  variable payment annuity.��An assumed investment rate is the
  percentage rate of return required to maintain level variable annuity
  payments.��Subsequent variable annuity payments may be more or less
  than the first payment based on whether actual investment performance of the
  underlying mutual funds is higher or lower than the assumed investment rate
  of
  3.5%.
�
Exchanges
  Among Underlying Mutual Funds
�
Exchanges
  among underlying mutual funds during annuitization must be requested in
  writing.��Exchanges will occur on each anniversary of the
  annuitization date.
�
Frequency
  and Amount of Annuity Payments
�
Payments
  are made based on the annuity payment option selected, unless:
�




���


the
  amount to be distributed is less than $5,000, in which case Nationwide
  may
  make one lump sum payment of the contract value;
  or




�




���


an
  annuity payment would be less than $20, in which case Nationwide
  can
  change the frequency of payments to intervals that will result in
  payments
  of at least $20.��Payments will be made at least
  annually.




�
Annuity
  payments will generally be received within 7 to 10 days after each annuity
  payment date.
�
Annuity
  Payment Options
�
Contract
  owners must elect an annuity payment option before the annuitization
  date.
�




(1)��


Life
  Annuity - An annuity payable periodically,
  but at least annually, for the lifetime of the
  annuitant.��Payments will end upon the annuitant�s
  death.��For example, if the annuitant dies before the second
  annuity payment date, the annuitant will receive only one annuity
  payment.��The annuitant will only receive two annuity payments
  if he or she dies before the third annuity payment date, and so
  on.




�




(2)��


Joint
  and Last Survivor Annuity - An annuity
  payable periodically, but at least annually, during the joint lifetimes
  of
  the annuitant and a designated second individual.��If one of
  these parties dies, payments will continue for the lifetime of the
  survivor.��As is the case under option 1, there is no guaranteed
  number of payments. Therefore, it is possible that if the annuitant
  dies
  before the second annuity payment date, the annuitant will receive
  only
  one annuity payment. Payments end upon the death of the last surviving
  party, regardless of the number of payments
  received.




�




(3)��


Life
  Annuity with 120 or 240 Monthly Payments Guaranteed
  - An annuity payable monthly during
  the
  lifetime of the annuitant.��If the annuitant dies before all of
  the guaranteed payments have been made, payments will continue to
  the end
  of the guaranteed period and will be paid to a designee chosen by
  the
  annuitant at the time the annuity payment option was
  elected.




�
The
  designee may elect to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed
  payments in a lump sum.��The present value will be computed as of the
  date Nationwide receives the notice of the annuitant�s death.
�
If
  the
  contract owner does not elect an annuity payment option, a variable payment
  life
  annuity with a guarantee period of 240 months will be the automatic form of
  payment upon annuitization.��Once elected or assumed, the annuity
  payment option may not be changed.
�
Not
  all
  of the annuity payment options may be available in all
  states.��Contract owners may request other options before the
  annuitization date.��These options are subject to Nationwide�s
  approval.
�
Individual
  Retirement Annuities and Tax Sheltered Annuities are subject to minimum
  distribution requirements set forth in the plan, contract, and the Internal
  Revenue Code.��See �Required Distributions� in Appendix C: Contract
  Types and Tax Information.
�
Death
  Benefits
�
Death
  of Contract Owner - Non-Qualified Contracts
�
If
  the
  contract owner (including a joint owner) who is not the annuitant dies before
  the annuitization date, no death benefit is payable and the surviving joint
  owner becomes the contract owner.��If no joint owner is named, the
  contingent owner becomes the contract owner.��If no contingent owner
  is named, the beneficiary becomes the contract owner.��If no
  beneficiary survives the contract owner, the last surviving contract owner�s
  estate becomes the contract owner.
�
If
  the
  contract owner and annuitant are the same, and the contract owner/annuitant
  dies
  before the annuitization date, the contingent owner will not have any rights
  in
  the contract unless the contingent owner is also the beneficiary.
�
Distributions
  under Non-Qualified Contracts will be made pursuant to the �Required
  Distributions for Non-Qualified Contracts� in Appendix C: Contract Types and Tax
  Information.
�
Death
  of Annuitant - Non-Qualified Contracts
�
If
  the
  annuitant who is not a contract owner dies before the annuitization date, the
  contingent annuitant becomes the annuitant and no death benefit is
  payable.��If no contingent annuitant is named, a death benefit is
  payable to the beneficiary��Multiple beneficiaries will share the
  death benefit equally unless otherwise specified.
�
If
  no
  beneficiaries survive the annuitant, the contingent beneficiary(ies) receives
  the death benefit.��Multiple contingent beneficiaries will share the
  death benefit equally, unless otherwise specified.


�


22





�


�
If
  no
  beneficiaries or contingent beneficiaries survive the annuitant, the contract
  owner or the last surviving contract owner�s estate will receive the death
  benefit.
�
If
  the
  contract owner is a Charitable Remainder Trust and the annuitant dies before
  the
  annuitization date, the death benefit will accrue to the Charitable Remainder
  Trust.��Any designation in conflict with the Charitable Remainder
  Trust�s right to the death benefit will be void.
�
If
  the
  annuitant dies after the annuitization date, any benefit that may be payable
  will be paid according to the selected annuity payment option.
�
Death
  of Contract Owner/Annuitant
�
If
  a
  contract owner (including a joint owner) who is also the annuitant dies before
  the annuitization date, a death benefit is payable to the surviving joint
  owner.
�
If
  there
  is no surviving joint owner, the death benefit is payable to the
  beneficiary.��Multiple beneficiaries will share the death benefit
  equally unless otherwise specified.
�
If
  no
  beneficiaries survive the contract owner/annuitant, the contingent beneficiary
  receives the death benefit.��Multiple contingent beneficiaries will
  share the death benefit equally, unless otherwise specified.
�
If
  no
  beneficiaries or contingent beneficiaries survive the contract owner/annuitant,
  the last surviving contract owner�s estate will receive the death
  benefit.
�
If
  the
  contract owner/annuitant dies after the annuitization date, any benefit that
  may
  be payable will be paid according to the selected annuity payment
  option.
�
Death
  Benefit Payment
�
The
  recipient of the death benefit may elect to receive the death
  benefit:
�




(1)��


in
  a lump sum;




�




(2)��


as
  an annuity; or




�




(3)��


in
  any other manner permitted by law and approved by
  Nationwide.




�
Nationwide
  will pay (or will begin to pay) the death benefit upon receiving proof of death
  and the instructions as to the payment of the death benefit.��If the
  recipient of the death benefit does not elect the form in which to receive
  the
  death benefit payment, Nationwide will pay the death benefit in a lump
  sum.��Contract value will continue to be allocated according to the
  most recent allocation instructions until the death benefit is
  paid.
�
If
  the
  contract has multiple beneficiaries entitled to receive a portion of the death
  benefit, the contract value will continue to be allocated according to the
  most
  recent allocation instructions until the first beneficiary is
  paid.��After the first beneficiary is paid, remaining contract value
  will be allocated to the available money market sub-account until instructions
  are received from the remaining beneficiary(ies).
�
Death
  Benefit Calculations
�
An
  applicant may elect either the standard death benefit or an available death
  benefit option that is offered under the contract for an additional
  charge.��If no election is made at the time of application, the death
  benefit will be the standard death benefit.
�
The
  value
  of each component of the applicable death benefit calculation will be determined
  as of the date of the annuitant�s death, except for the contract value
  component, which will be determined as of the date Nationwide
  receives:
�




(1)��


proper
  proof of the annuitant�s death;




�




(2)��


an
  election specifying the distribution method;
  and




�




(3)��


any
  state required form(s).




�
Standard
  Death Benefit
�
If
  the
  annuitant dies prior to the annuitization date and the Return of Premium
  Enhanced Death Benefit Option is not elected at the time of application, the
  death benefit will equal the contract value.
�
Return
  of Premium Enhanced Death Benefit Option
�
For
  an
  additional charge at an annualized rate of 0.20% of the daily net assets of
  the
  variable account, contracts with annuitants who are age 75 or younger at the
  time of application may elect the Return of Premium Enhanced Death Benefit
  Option.��If the annuitant dies before the annuitization date, and the
  total of all purchase payments is less than or equal to $3,000,000, the death
  benefit will be the greater of:
�




(1)��


the
  contract value; or




�




(2)��


the
  total of all purchase payments made to the contract, less an adjustment
  for amount surrendered.




�
The
  adjustment for amounts surrendered will reduce item (2) above in the same
  proportion that the contract value was reduced on the date(s) of the partial
  surrender(s).
�
If
  the
  annuitant dies prior to the annuitization date and the total of all purchase
  payments made to the contract is greater than $3,000,000, the death benefit
  will
  be determined using the following formula:
�
A
  x F + B
  x (1 - F)
�
Where:
�




A
  =


The
  greater of:




�




(1)��


the
  contract value; or




�




(2)��


the
  total of all purchase payments made to the contract, less an adjustment
  for amount surrendered.;




�
The
  adjustment for amounts surrendered will reduce item (2) above in the same
  proportion that the contract value was reduced on the date(s) of the partial
  surrender(s);
�




B
  =


the
  contract value;




�




F
  =


the
  ratio of $3,000,000 to the total of all purchase payments made to
  the
  contract.






�


23





�


�
The
  practical effect of this formula is that the beneficiary recovers a lesser
  percentage of the purchase payments in excess of $3,000,000 than for purchase
  payments up to $3,000,000. In no event will the beneficiary receive less than
  the contract value.
�
The
  Return of Premium Enhanced Death Benefit Option also includes the Spousal
  Protection Feature.��Please see �Spousal Protection
  Feature.�
�
Spousal
  Protection Feature
�
The
  Return of Premium Enhanced Death Benefit Option has a Spousal Protection
  Feature.��The Spousal Protection Feature allows a surviving spouse to
  continue the contract while receiving the economic benefit of the death benefit
  upon the death of the other spouse.��The Spousal Protection Feature is
  available for all contract types except Charitable Remainder Trusts, provided
  the conditions described below are satisfied.��There is no additional
  charge for this feature.
�




(1)��


one
  or both spouses (or a revocable trust of which either or both of
  the
  spouses is/are grantor(s)) must be named as the contract
  owner.��For contracts issued as Individual Retirement Annuities
  and Roth IRAs, only the person for whom the Individual Retirement
  Annuities or Roth IRA was established may be named as the contract
  owner;




�




(2)��


the
  spouses must be co-annuitants;




�




(3)��


both
  co-annuitants must be age 75 or younger at the time the contract
  is
  issued;




�




(4)��


the
  spouses must each be named as
  beneficiaries;




�




(5)��


no
  person other than the spouse may be named as contract owner, annuitant
  or
  primary beneficiary;




�

�
Legal
  Proceedings
�
Nationwide
  is a party to litigation and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course
  of
  its business.��It is often not possible to determine the ultimate
  outcome of the pending investigations and legal proceedings or to provide
  reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of
  certainty.��Some matters, including certain of those referred to
  below, are in very preliminary stages, and Nationwide does not have sufficient
  information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs� claims for liability or
  damages.��In some of the cases seeking to be certified as class
  actions, the court has not yet decided whether a class will be certified or
  (in
  the event of certification) the size of the class and class
  period.��In many of the cases, the plaintiffs are seeking undefined
  amounts of damages or other relief, including punitive damages and equitable
  remedies, which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the
  information currently available.��Nationwide does not believe, based
  on information currently


�


24





�


known
  by
  management, that the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal
  proceedings are likely to have a material adverse effect on Nationwide�s
  consolidated financial position.��However, given the large and/or
  indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and inherent
  unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in
  certain matters could have a material adverse effect on Nationwide�s
  consolidated financial results in a particular quarterly or annual
  period.
�
In
  recent
  years, life insurance companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits,
  including class action lawsuits relating to life insurance and annuity pricing
  and sales practices.��A number of these lawsuits have resulted in
  substantial jury awards or settlements against life insurers other than
  Nationwide.
�
The
  financial services industry, including mutual fund, variable annuity, retirement
  plan, life insurance and distribution companies, has also been the subject
  of
  increasing scrutiny by regulators, legislators and the media over the past
  few
  years.��Numerous regulatory agencies, including the SEC, the National
  Association of Securities Dealers and the New York State Attorney General,
  have
  commenced industry-wide investigations regarding late trading and market timing
  in connection with mutual funds and variable insurance contracts, and have
  commenced enforcement actions against some mutual fund and life insurance
  companies on those issues.��Nationwide has been contacted by or
  received subpoenas from the SEC and the New York State Attorney General, who
  are
  investigating market timing in certain mutual funds offered in insurance
  products sponsored by Nationwide.��Nationwide has cooperated with
  these investigations.��Information requests from the New York State
  Attorney General and the SEC with respect to investigations into late trading
  and market timing were last responded to by Nationwide and its affiliates in
  December 2003 and June 2005, respectively, and no further information requests
  have been received with respect to these matters.
�
In
  addition, state and federal regulators and other governmental bodies have
  commenced investigations, proceedings or inquiries relating to compensation
  and
  bidding arrangements and possible anti-competitive activities between insurance
  producers and brokers and issuers of insurance products, and unsuitable sales
  and replacements by producers on behalf of the issuer.��Also under
  investigation are compensation and revenue sharing arrangements between the
  issuers of variable insurance contracts and mutual funds or their affiliates,
  fee arrangements in retirement plans, the use of side agreements and finite
  reinsurance agreements, funding agreements issued to back medium-term note
  (MTN)
  programs, recordkeeping and retention compliance by broker/dealers, and
  supervision of former registered representatives.��Related
  investigations, proceedings or inquiries may be commenced in the
  future.��Nationwide and/or its affiliates have been contacted by or
  received subpoenas from state and federal regulatory agencies and other
  governmental bodies, state securities law regulators and state attorneys general
  for information relating to certain of these investigations, including those
  relating to compensation, revenue sharing and bidding arrangements,
  anti-competitive activities, unsuitable sales or replacement practices, fee
  arrangements in retirement plans, the use of side agreements and finite
  reinsurance agreements, and funding agreements backing Nationwide�s MTN
  program.��Nationwide is cooperating with regulators in connection with
  these inquiries and will cooperate with Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company
  (NMIC) in responding to these inquiries to the extent that any inquiries
  encompass NMIC�s operations.
�
These
  proceedings are expected to continue in the future and could result in legal
  precedents and new industry-wide legislation, rules and regulations that could
  significantly affect the financial services industry, including mutual fund,
  retirement plan, life insurance and annuity companies.��These
  proceedings also could affect the outcome of one or more of Nationwide�s
  litigation matters.��There can be no assurance that any such
  litigation or regulatory actions will not have a material adverse effect on
  Nationwide in the future.
�
On
  July
11, 2007, Nationwide was named in a lawsuit filed in the United States District
  Court for the Western District of Washington at Tacoma entitled Jerre
  Daniels-Hall and David Hamblen, Individually and on behalf of All Others
  Similarly Situated v. National Education Association, NEA Member Benefits
  Corporation, Nationwide Life Insurance Company, Security Benefit Life Insurance
  Company, Security Benefit Group, Inc., Security Distributors, Inc., et.
  al.��The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all current or former
  National Education Association (NEA) members who participated in the NEA
  Valuebuilder 403(b) program at any time between January 1, 1991 and the present
  (and their heirs and/or beneficiaries).��The plaintiffs allege that
  the defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
  as
  amended (ERISA) by failing to prudently and loyally manage plan assets, by
  failing to provide complete and accurate information, by engaging in prohibited
  transactions, and by breaching their fiduciary duties when they failed to
  prevent other fiduciaries from breaching their fiduciary duties.��The
  complaint seeks to have the defendants restore all losses to the plan,
  restoration of plan assets and profits to participants, disgorgement of
  endorsement fees, disgorgement of service fee payments, disgorgement of
  excessive fees charged to plan participants, other unspecified relief for
  restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys�
fees.��Nationwide is currently evaluating this recently filed case but
  intends to defend this matter vigorously.
�
On
  November 15, 2006, Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (NFS), Nationwide and
  Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc. (NRS) were named in a lawsuit filed in
  the
  United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio entitled Kevin
  Beary, Sheriff of Orange County, Florida, In His Official Capacity, Individually
  and On Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Nationwide Life Insurance
  Co.,
  Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc. and Nationwide Financial Services,
  Inc.��The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all sponsors of
  457(b) deferred compensation plans in the United States that had variable
  annuity contracts with the defendants at any time during the class period,
  or in
  the alternative, all sponsors of 457(b) deferred compensation plans in Florida
  that had variable annuity contracts with the defendants during the class
  period.��The class period is from January 1, 1996 until
  the


�


25





�


class
  notice is provided.��The plaintiff alleges that the defendants
  breached their fiduciary duties by arranging for and retaining service payments
  from certain mutual funds.��The complaint seeks an accounting, a
  declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction and disgorgement or restitution
  of
  the service fee payments allegedly received by the defendants, including
  interest.��On January 25, 2007, NFS, Nationwide and NRS filed a motion
  to dismiss.��On March 3, 2007, the plaintiffs filed their memorandum
  in opposition to the motion to dismiss that was filed by NFS, Nationwide and
  NRS.��On March 23, 2007, NFS, Nationwide and NRS filed their
  response.��NFS, Nationwide and NRS intend to defend this lawsuit
  vigorously.
�
On
  February 11, 2005, Nationwide was named in a class action lawsuit filed in
  Common Pleas Court, Franklin County, Ohio entitled Michael Carr v. Nationwide
  Life Insurance Company.��The complaint seeks recovery for breach of
  contract, fraud by omission, violation of the Ohio Deceptive Trade Practices
  Act
  and unjust enrichment.��The complaint also seeks unspecified
  compensatory damages, disgorgement of all amounts in excess of the guaranteed
  maximum premium and attorneys� fees.��On February 2, 2006, the court
  granted the plaintiff�s motion for class certification on the breach of contract
  and unjust enrichment claims.��The court certified a class consisting
  of all residents of the United States and the Virgin Islands who, during the
  class period, paid premiums on a modal basis to Nationwide for term life
  insurance policies issued by Nationwide during the class period that provide
  for
  guaranteed maximum premiums, excluding certain specified
  products.��Excluded from the class are Nationwide; any parent,
  subsidiary or affiliate of Nationwide; all employees, officers and directors
  of
  Nationwide; and any justice, judge or magistrate judge of the State of Ohio
  who
  may hear the case.��The class period is from February 10, 1990 through
  February 2, 2006, the date the class was certified.��On January 26,
2007, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment.��On April 30,
2007, Nationwide filed a motion for summary judgment.��Oral argument
  on the motions for summary judgment is scheduled for August 31,
2007.��Nationwide continues to defend this lawsuit
  vigorously..
�
On
  April
13, 2004, Nationwide was named in a class action lawsuit filed in Circuit Court,
  Third Judicial Circuit, Madison County, Illinois, entitled Woodbury v.
  Nationwide Life Insurance Company.��Nationwide removed this case to
  the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois on June
1, 2004.��On December 27, 2004, the case was transferred to the United
  States District Court for the District of Maryland and included in the
  multi-district proceeding entitled In Re Mutual Funds Investment
  Litigation.��In response, on May 13, 2005, the plaintiff filed a first
  amended complaint purporting to represent, with certain exceptions, a class
  of
  all persons who held (through their ownership of a Nationwide annuity or
  insurance product) units of any Nationwide sub-account invested in mutual funds
  that included foreign securities in their portfolios and that experienced market
  timing or stale price trading activity.��The first amended complaint
  purports to disclaim, with respect to market timing or stale price trading
  in
  Nationwide�s annuities sub-accounts, any allegation based on Nationwide�s untrue
  statement, failure to disclose any material fact, or usage of any manipulative
  or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with any class member�s
  purchases or sales of Nationwide annuities or units in annuities
  sub-accounts.��The plaintiff claims, in the alternative, that if
  Nationwide is found with respect to market timing or stale price trading in
  its
  annuities sub-accounts, to have made any untrue statement, to have failed to
  disclose any material fact or to have used or employed any manipulative or
  deceptive device or contrivance, then the plaintiff purports to represent a
  class, with certain exceptions, of all persons who, prior to Nationwide�s untrue
  statement, omission of material fact, use or employment of any manipulative
  or
  deceptive device or contrivance, held (through their ownership of an Nationwide
  annuity or insurance product) units of any Nationwide sub-account invested
  in
  mutual funds that included foreign securities in their portfolios and that
  experienced market timing activity.��The first amended complaint
  alleges common law negligence and seeks to recover damages not to exceed $75,000
  per plaintiff or class member, including all compensatory damages and
  costs.��On June 1, 2006, the District Court granted Nationwide�s
  motion to dismiss the plaintiff�s complaint.��The plaintiff appealed
  the District Court�s decision, and the issues have been fully
  briefed.��Nationwide continues to defend this lawsuit
  vigorously.
�
On
  January 21, 2004, Nationwide, Nationwide Life Insurance Company of America,
  Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, NFS and Nationwide Financial
  Corporation (collectively referred to as the Companies) were named in a lawsuit
  filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
  Mississippi entitled United Investors Life Insurance Company v. Nationwide
  Life
  Insurance Company and/or Nationwide Life Insurance Company of America and/or
  Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company and/or Nationwide Life and Annuity
  Company of America and/or Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. and/or Nationwide
  Financial Corporation, and John Does A-Z.��In its complaint, the
  plaintiff alleges that the Companies and/or their affiliated life insurance
  companies caused the replacement of variable insurance policies and other
  financial products issued by United Investors with policies issued by the
  Companies.��The plaintiff raises claims for (1) violations of the
  Federal Lanham Act, and common law unfair competition and defamation; (2)
  tortious interference with the plaintiff�s contractual relationship with Waddell
& Reed, Inc. and/or its affiliates, Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc.,
  Waddell & Reed Financial Services, Inc. and W&R Insurance Agency, Inc.,
  or with the plaintiff�s contractual relationships with its variable
  policyholders; (3) civil conspiracy; and (4) breach of fiduciary
  duty.��The complaint seeks compensatory damages, punitive damages,
  pre- and post-judgment interest, a full accounting, a constructive trust and
  costs and disbursements, including attorneys� fees.��On June 15, 2006,
  the District Court dismissed the plaintiff�s entire case with
  prejudice.��On May 30, 2007, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals
  affirmed the District Court�s dismissal of the entire case.��The
  plaintiff may appeal this decision to the United States Supreme
  Court.��In the event the plaintiff elects this course of action, the
  Companies will continue to defend this lawsuit vigorously.

On
  August
15, 2001, NFS and Nationwide were named in a lawsuit filed in the United States
  District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled Lou Haddock, as trustee
  of the Flyte Tool & Die, Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, et al v.
  Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. and Nationwide Life Insurance
  Company.��Currently, the plaintiffs� fifth amended complaint, filed
  March 21, 2006, purports to represent a class of qualified retirement plans
  under ERISA that purchased variable annuities from Nationwide.��The
  plaintiffs allege that they invested ERISA plan assets in their variable annuity
  contracts and that Nationwide and NFS breached ERISA fiduciary duties by
  allegedly accepting service payments from certain mutual funds.��The
  complaint seeks disgorgement of some or all of the payments allegedly received
  by Nationwide and NFS, other unspecified relief for restitution, declaratory
  and
  injunctive relief, and attorneys� fees.��To date, the District Court
  has rejected the plaintiffs� request for certification of the alleged
  class.��NFS� and Nationwide�s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs� fifth
  amended complaint is currently pending before the court.��NFS and
  Nationwide continue to defend this lawsuit vigorously.

Appendix
  C: Contract Types and Tax Information
�
The
  contracts described in this prospectus are classified according to the tax
  treatment to which they are subject under the Internal Revenue
  Code.��Following is a general description of the various contract
  types.��Eligibility requirements, tax benefits (if any), limitations,
  and other features of the contracts will differ depending on contract
  type.
�
Charitable
  Remainder Trusts
�
Charitable
  Remainder Trusts are trusts that meet the requirements of Section 664 of the
  Internal Revenue Code.��Non-Qualified Contracts that are issued to
  Charitable Remainder Trusts will differ from other Non-Qualified Contracts
  in
  two respects:
�




(1)��


Contract
  ownership at annuitization.��On the annuitization date, if the
  contract owner is a Charitable Remainder Trust, the Charitable Remainder
  Trust will continue to be the contract owner and the annuitant will
  NOT
  become the contract owner.




�




(2)��


Recipient
  of death benefit proceeds.��With respect to the death benefit
  proceeds, if the contract owner is a Charitable Remainder Trust,
  the death
  benefit is payable to the Charitable Remainder Trust.��Any
  designation in conflict with the Charitable Remainder Trust�s right to the
  death benefit will be void.




�
While
  these provisions are intended to facilitate a Charitable Remainder Trust's
  ownership of this contract, the rules governing Charitable Remainder Trusts
  are
  numerous and complex.��A Charitable Remainder Trust that is
  considering purchasing this contract should seek the advice of a qualified
  tax
  and/or financial adviser prior to purchasing the contract.��An annuity
  that has a Charitable Remainder Trust endorsement is not a charitable remainder
  trust; the endorsement is merely to facilitate ownership of the contract by
  a
  Charitable Remainder Trust.
�
Investment
  Only (Qualified Plans)
�
Contracts
  that are owned by Qualified Plans are not intended to confer tax benefits on
  the
  beneficiaries of the plan; they are used as investment vehicles for the
  plan.��The income tax consequences to the beneficiary of a Qualified
  Plan are controlled by the operation of the plan, not by operation of the assets
  in which the plan invests.
�
Beneficiaries
  of Qualified Plans should contact their employer and/or trustee of the plan
  to
  obtain and review the plan, trust, summary plan description and other documents
  for the tax and other consequences of being a participant in a Qualified
  Plan.
�
Individual
  Retirement Annuities (IRAs)
�
IRAs
  are
  contracts that satisfy the provisions of Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue
  Code, including the following requirements:
�




���


the
  contract is not transferable by the
  owner;




�




���


the
  premiums are not fixed;




�




���


if
  the contract owner is younger than age 50, the annual premium cannot
  exceed $4,000; if the contract owner is age 50 or older, the annual
  premium cannot exceed $5,000 (although rollovers of greater amounts
  from
  qualified plans, Tax Sheltered Annuities and other IRAs can be
  received);




�




���


certain
  minimum distribution requirements must be satisfied after the owner
  attains the age of 70�;




�




���


the
  entire interest of the owner in the contract is nonforfeitable;
  and




�




���


after
  the death of the owner, additional distribution requirements may
  be
  imposed to ensure distribution of the entire balance in the contract
  within the statutory period of
  time.




�
Depending
  on the circumstance of the owner, all or a portion of the contributions made
  to
  the account may be deducted for federal income tax purposes.
�
Failure
  to make the mandatory distributions can result in an additional penalty tax
  of
  50% of the excess of the amount required to be distributed over the amount
  that
  was actually distributed.
�
IRAs
  may
  receive rollover contributions from other Individual Retirement Accounts, other
  Individual Retirement Annuities, Tax Sheltered Annuities, certain 457
  governmental plans and qualified retirement plans (including 401(k)
  plans).
�
When
  the
  owner of an IRA attains the age of 70�, the Internal Revenue Code requires that
  certain minimum distributions be made.��In addition, upon the death of
  the owner of an IRA, mandatory distribution requirements are imposed by the
  Internal Revenue Code to ensure distribution of the entire contract value within
  the required statutory period.��Due to recent changes in Treasury
  Regulations, the amount used to compute the mandatory distributions may exceed
  the contract value.
�
For
  further details regarding IRAs, please refer to the disclosure statement
  provided when the IRA was established.
�
Non-Qualified
  Contracts
�
A
  Non-Qualified Contract is a contract that does not qualify for certain tax
  benefits under the Internal Revenue Code, and which is not an IRA, a Roth IRA,
  a
  SEP IRA, a Simple IRA, or a Tax Sheltered Annuity.
�
Upon
  the
  death of the owner of a Non-Qualified Contract, mandatory distribution
  requirements are imposed to ensure distribution of the entire balance in the
  contract within a required period.
�
Non-Qualified
  contracts that are owned by natural persons allow the deferral of taxation
  on
  the income earned in the contract until it is distributed or deemed to be
  distributed.��Non-Qualified contracts that are owned by nonnatural
  persons, such as trusts, corporations and partnerships are generally subject
  to
  current income tax on the gain earned inside the contract, unless the nonnatural
  person owns the contract as an �agent� of a natural person.


�


34





�


Roth
  IRAs
�
Roth
  IRA
  contracts are contracts that satisfy the provisions of Section 408A of the
  Internal Revenue Code, including the following requirements:
�




���


the
  contract is not transferable by the
  owner;




�




���


the
  premiums are not fixed;




�




���


if
  the contract owner is younger than age 50, the annual premium cannot
  exceed $4,000; if the contract owner is age 50 or older, the annual
  premium cannot exceed $5,000 (although rollovers of greater amounts
  from
  other Roth IRAs and IRAs can be
  received);




�




���


the
  entire interest of the owner in the contract is nonforfeitable;
  and




�




���


after
  the death of the owner, certain distribution requirements may be
  imposed
  to ensure distribution of the entire balance in the contract within
  the
  statutory period of time.




�
A
  Roth
  IRA can receive a rollover from an IRA; however, the amount rolled over from
  the
  IRA to the Roth IRA is required to be included in the owner's federal gross
  income at the time of the rollover, and will be subject to federal income
  tax.
�
There
  are
  income limitations on eligibility to participate in a Roth IRA and additional
  income limitations for eligibility to roll over amounts from an IRA to a Roth
  IRA.
�
For
  further details regarding Roth IRAs, please refer to the disclosure statement
  provided when the Roth IRA was established.
�
Simplified
  Employee Pension IRAs (SEP IRA)
�
A
  SEP IRA
  is a written plan established by an employer for the benefit of employees which
  permits the employer to make contributions to an IRA established for the benefit
  of each employee.
�
An
  employee may make deductible contributions to a SEP IRA subject to the same
  restrictions and limitations as an IRA.��In addition, the employer may
  make contributions to the SEP IRA, subject to dollar and percentage limitations
  imposed by both the Internal Revenue Code and the written plan.
�
A
  SEP IRA
  plan must satisfy:
�




���


minimum
  participation rules;




�




���


top-heavy
  contribution rules;




�




���


nondiscriminatory
  allocation rules; and




�




���


requirements
  regarding a written allocation
  formula.




�
In
  addition, the plan cannot restrict withdrawals of non-elective contributions,
  and must restrict withdrawals of elective contributions before March 15th of the following
  year.
�
When
  the
  owner of SEP IRA attains the age of 70�, the Internal Revenue Code requires that
  certain minimum distributions be made.��Due to recent changes in
  Treasury Regulations, the amount used to compute the minimum distributions
  may
  exceed the contract value. In addition, upon the death of the owner of a SEP
  IRA, mandatory distribution requirements are imposed by the Internal Revenue
  Code to ensure distribution of the entire contract value within the required
  statutory period.
�
Simple
  IRAs
�
A
  Simple
  IRA is an individual retirement annuity that is funded exclusively by a
  qualified salary reduction arrangement and satisfies:
�




���


vesting
  requirements;




�




���


participation
  requirements; and




�




���


administrative
  requirements.




�
The
  funds
  contributed to a Simple IRA cannot be commingled with funds in IRAs or SEP
  IRAs.
�
A
  Simple
  IRA cannot receive rollover distributions except from another Simple
  IRA.
�
When
  the
  owner of Simple IRA attains the age of 70�, the Internal Revenue Code requires
  that certain minimum distributions be made. Due to recent changes in Treasury
  Regulations, the amount used to compute the minimum distributions may exceed
  the
  contract value.
�
In
  addition, upon the death of the owner of a Simple IRA, mandatory distribution
  requirements are imposed by the Internal Revenue Code to ensure distribution
  of
  the entire contract value within the required statutory period.
�
Tax
  Sheltered Annuities
�
Certain
  tax-exempt organizations (described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
  Code) and public school systems may establish a plan under which annuity
  contracts can be purchased for their employees.��These annuity
  contracts are often referred to as Tax Sheltered Annuities.
�
Purchase
  payments made to Tax Sheltered Annuities are excludable from the income of
  the
  employee, up to statutory maximum amounts.��These amounts should be
  set forth in the plan adopted by the employer.
�
Tax
  Sheltered Annuities may receive rollover contributions from Individual
  Retirement Accounts, Individual Retirement Annuities, other Tax Sheltered
  Annuities, certain 457 governmental plans, and qualified retirement plans
  (including 401(k) plans).
�
The
  owner's interest in the contract is nonforfeitable (except for failure to pay
  premiums) and cannot be transferred.
�
When
  the
  owner of a Tax Sheltered Annuity attains the age of 70�, the Internal Revenue
  Code requires that certain minimum distributions be made.��Due to
  recent changes in Treasury Regulations, the amount used to compute the minimum
  distributions may exceed the contract value.��In addition, upon the
  death of the owner of a Tax Sheltered Annuity, mandatory distribution
  requirements are imposed by the Internal Revenue Code to ensure distribution
  of
  the entire contract value within the required statutory period.

Federal
  Tax Considerations
�
Federal
  Income Taxes
�
The
  tax
  consequences of purchasing a contract described in this prospectus will depend
  on:
�




���


the
  type of contract purchased;




�




���


the
  purposes for which the contract is purchased;
  and




�




���


the
  personal circumstances of individual investors having interests in
  the
  contracts.




�
Existing
  tax rules are subject to change, and may affect individuals differently
  depending on their situation.��Nationwide does not guarantee the tax
  status of any contracts or any transactions involving the
  contracts.
�
Representatives
  of the Internal Revenue Service have informally suggested, from time to time,
  that the number of underlying mutual funds available or the number of transfer
  opportunities available under a variable product may be relevant in determining
  whether the product qualifies for the desired tax treatment.��In 2003,
  the Internal Revenue Service issued formal guidance, in Revenue Ruling 2003-91,
  that indicates that if the number of underlying mutual funds available in a
  variable insurance product does not exceed 20, the number of underlying mutual
  funds alone would not cause the contract to not qualify for the desired tax
  treatment.��The Internal Revenue Service has also indicated that
  exceeding 20 investment options may be considered a factor, along with other
  factors including the number of transfer opportunities available under the
  contract, when determining whether the contract qualifies for the desired tax
  treatment.��The revenue ruling did not indicate the actual number of
  underlying mutual funds that would cause the contract to not provide the desired
  tax treatment.��Should the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury issue
  additional rules or regulations limiting the number of underlying mutual funds,
  transfers between underlying mutual funds, exchanges of underlying mutual funds
  or changes in investment objectives of underlying mutual funds such that the
  contract would no longer qualify for tax deferred treatment under Section 72
  of
  the Internal Revenue Code, Nationwide will take whatever steps are available
  to
  remain in compliance.
�
If
  the
  contract is purchased as an investment of certain retirement plans (such as
  qualified retirement plans, Individual Retirement Accounts, and custodial
  accounts as described in Sections 401, 408(a), and 403(b)(7) of the Internal
  Revenue Code), tax advantages enjoyed by the contract owner and/or annuitant
  may
  relate to participation in the plan rather than ownership of the annuity
  contract.��Such plans are permitted to purchase investments other than
  annuities and retain tax-deferred status.
�
The
  following is a brief summary of some of the federal income tax considerations
  related to the contracts.��In addition to the federal income tax,
  distributions from annuity contracts may be subject to state and local income
  taxes.��The tax rules across all states and localities are not uniform
  and therefore will not be discussed in this prospectus.��Tax rules
  that may apply to contracts issued in U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico
  and
  Guam are also not discussed.��Nothing in this prospectus should be
  considered to be tax advice.��Contract owners and prospective contract
  owners should consult a financial consultant, tax adviser or legal counsel
  to
  discuss the taxation and use of the contracts.
�
IRAs,
  SEP IRAs and Simple IRAs
�
Distributions
  from IRAs, SEP IRAs and Simple IRAs are generally taxed as ordinary income
  when
  received.��If any of the amount contributed to the Individual
  Retirement Annuity was nondeductible for federal income tax purposes, then
  a
  portion of each distribution is excludable from income.
�
If
  distributions of income from an IRA are made prior to the date that the owner
  attains the age of 59� years, the income is subject to both the regular income
  tax and an additional penalty tax of 10% is generally
  applicable.��(For Simple IRAs, the 10% penalty is increased to 25% if
  the distribution is made during the 2-year period beginning on the date that
  the
  individual first participated in the Simple IRA.)��The 10% penalty tax
  can be avoided if the distribution is:
�




���


made
  to a beneficiary on or after the death of the
  owner;




�




���


attributable
  to the owner becoming disabled (as defined in the Internal Revenue
  Code);




�




���


part
  of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made not less
  frequently than annually made for the life (or life expectancy) of
  the
  owner, or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the owner
  and
  his or her designated beneficiary;




�




���


used
  for qualified higher education expenses;
  or




�




���


used
  for expenses attributable to the purchase of a home for a qualified
  first-time buyer.




�
If
  the
  contract owner dies before the contract is completely distributed, the balance
  will be included in the contract owner�s gross estate for tax
  purposes.
�
Roth
  IRAs
�
Distributions
  of earnings from Roth IRAs are taxable or nontaxable depending upon whether
  they
  are �qualified distributions� or �non-qualified distributions.���A
�qualified distribution� is one that satisfies the five-year rule and meets one
  of the following requirements:
�




���


it
  is made on or after the date on which the contract owner attains
  age
  59�;




�




���


it
  is made to a beneficiary (or the contract owner�s estate) on or after the
  death of the contract owner;




�




���


it
  is attributable to the contract owner�s disability;
  or




�




���


it
  is used for expenses attributable to the purchase of a home for a
  qualified first-time buyer.




�
The
  five-year rule generally is satisfied if the distribution is not made within
  the
  five year period beginning with the first taxable year in which a contribution
  is made to any Roth IRA established for the owner.
�
A
  qualified distribution is not included in gross income for federal income tax
  purposes.


�


36





�


A
  non-qualified distribution is not includable in gross income to the extent
  that
  the distribution, when added to all previous distributions, does not exceed
  the
  total amount of contributions made to the Roth IRA.��Any non-qualified
  distribution in excess of total contributions is includable in the contract
  owner�s gross income as ordinary income in the year that it is distributed to
  the contract owner.
�
Special
  rules apply for Roth IRAs that have proceeds received from an IRA prior to
  January 1, 1999 if the owner elected the special 4-year income averaging
  provisions that were in effect for 1998.
�
If
  non-qualified distributions of income from a Roth IRA are made prior to the
  date
  that the owner attains the age of 59� years, the income is subject to both the
  regular income tax and an additional penalty tax of 10%.��The penalty
  tax can be avoided if the distribution is:
�




���


made
  to a beneficiary on or after the death of the
  owner;




�




���


attributable
  to the owner becoming disabled (as defined in the Internal Revenue
  Code);




�




���


part
  of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made not less
  frequently than annually made for the life (or life expectancy) of
  the
  owner, or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the owner
  and
  his or her designated beneficiary;




�




���


for
  qualified higher education expenses;
  or




�




���


used
  for expenses attributable to the purchase of a home for a qualified
  first-time buyer.




�
If
  the
  contract owner dies before the contract is completely distributed, the balance
  will be included in the contract owner�s gross estate for tax
  purposes.
�
Tax
  Sheltered Annuities
�
Distributions
  from Tax Sheltered Annuities are generally taxed when received.��A
  portion of each distribution after the annuitization date��is
  excludable from income based on a formula established pursuant to the Internal
  Revenue Code.��The formula excludes from income the amount invested in
  the contract divided by the number of anticipated payments until the full
  investment in the contract is recovered.��Thereafter all distributions
  are fully taxable.
�
If
  a
  distribution of income is made from a Tax Sheltered Annuity prior to the date
  that the owner attains the age of 59� years, the income is subject to both the
  regular income tax and an additional penalty tax of 10%.��The penalty
  tax can be avoided if the distribution is:
�




���


made
  to a beneficiary on or after the death of the
  owner;




�




���


attributable
  to the owner becoming disabled (as defined in the Internal Revenue
  Code);




�




���


part
  of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made not less
  frequently than annually made for the life (or life expectancy) of
  the
  owner, or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the owner
  and
  his or her designated beneficiary;
  or




�




���


made
  to the owner after separation from service with his or her employer
  after
  age 55.




�
If
  the
  contract owner dies before the contract is completely distributed, the balance
  will be included in the contract owner�s gross estate for tax
  purposes.
�
Non-Qualified
  Contracts - Natural Persons as Contract Owners
�
Generally,
  the income earned inside a Non-Qualified Annuity Contract that is owned by
  a
  natural person is not taxable until it is distributed from the
  contract.
�
Distributions
  before the annuitization date are taxable to the contract owner to the extent
  that the cash value of the contract exceeds the contract owner�s investment in
  the contract at the time of the distribution.��In general, the
  investment in the contract is equal to the purchase payment made with after-tax
  dollars.��Distributions, for this purpose, include full and partial
  surrenders, any portion of the contract that is assigned or pledged, amounts
  borrowed from the contract, or any portion of the contract that is transferred
  by gift.��For these purposes, a transfer by gift may occur upon
  annuitization if the contract owner and the annuitant are not the same
  individual.
�
With
  respect to annuity distributions on or after the annuitization date, a portion
  of each annuity payment is excludable from taxable income.��The amount
  excludable is based on the ratio between the contract owner�s investment in the
  contract and the expected return on the contract.��Once the entire
  investment in the contract is recovered, all distributions are fully includable
  in income.��The maximum amount excludable from income is the
  investment in the contract.��If the annuitant dies before the entire
  investment in the contract has been excluded from income, and as a result of
  the
  annuitant's death no more payments are due under the contract, then the
  unrecovered investment in the contract may be deducted on his or her final
  tax
  return.
�
In
  determining the taxable amount of a distribution, all annuity contracts issued
  after October 21, 1988 by the same company to the same contract owner during
  the
  same calendar year will be treated as one annuity contract.
�
A
  special
  rule applies to distributions from contracts that have investments that were
  made prior to August 14, 1982.��For those contracts, distributions
  that are made prior to the annuitization date are treated first as a recovery
  of
  the investment in the contract as of that date.��A distribution in
  excess of the amount of the investment in the contract as of August 14, 1982,
  will be treated as taxable income.
�
The
  Internal Revenue Code imposes a penalty tax if a distribution is made before
  the
  contract owner reaches age 59�.��The amount of the penalty is 10% of
  the portion of any distribution that is includable in gross
  income.��The penalty tax does not apply if the distribution
  is:
�




���


the
  result of a contract owner�s death;




�




���


the
  result of a contract owner�s disability, (as defined in the Internal
  Revenue Code);






�


37





�






���


one
  of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made over the
  life
  (or life expectancy) of the contract owner or the joint lives (or
  joint
  life expectancies) of the contract owner and the beneficiary selected
  by
  the contract owner to receive payment under the annuity payment option
  selected by the contract owner; or




�




���


is
  allocable to an investment in the contract before August 14,
  1982.




�
If
  the
  contract owner dies before the contract is completely distributed, the balance
  will be included in the contract owner�s gross estate for tax
  purposes.
�
Non-Qualified
  Contracts - Non-Natural Persons as Contract Owners
�
The
  previous discussion related to the taxation of Non-Qualified Contracts owned
  by
  individuals.��Different rules (the so-called �non-natural persons�
rules) apply if the contract owner is not a natural person.
�
Generally,
  contracts owned by corporations, partnerships, trusts, and similar entities
  are
  not treated as annuity contracts under the Internal Revenue
  Code.��Therefore, income earned under a Non-Qualified Contract that is
  owned by a non-natural person is taxed as ordinary income during the taxable
  year that it is earned.��Taxation is not deferred, even if the income
  is not distributed out of the contract.��The income is taxable as
  ordinary income, not capital gain.
�
The
  non-natural persons rules do not apply to all entity-owned
  contracts.��For purposes of the rule that annuity contracts that are
  owned by non-natural persons are not treated as annuity contracts for tax
  purposes, a contract that is owned by a non-natural person as an agent of an
  individual is treated as owned by the individual.��This would
  cause the contract to be treated as an annuity under the Internal Revenue Code,
  allowing tax deferral.��However, this exception does not apply when
  the non-natural person is an employer that holds the contract under a
  non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement for one or more
  employees.
�
The
  non-natural persons rules also do not apply to contracts that are:
�




���


acquired
  by the estate of a decedent by reason of the death of the
  decedent;




�




���


issued
  in connection with certain qualified retirement plans and individual
  retirement plans;




�




���


purchased
  by an employer upon the termination of certain qualified retirement
  plans;
  or




�




���


immediate
  annuities within the meaning of Section 72(u) of the Internal Revenue
  Code.




�
If
  the
  annuitant dies before the contract is completely distributed, the balance may
  be
  included in the annuitant�s gross estate for tax purposes, depending on the
  obligations that the non-natural owner may have owed to the
  annuitant.

  distributions from the contracts are subject to federal income
  tax.��Nationwide will withhold the tax from the distributions unless
  the contract owner requests otherwise.��If the distribution is from a
  Tax Sheltered Annuity, it will be subject to a mandatory 20% withholding that
  cannot be waived, unless:
�




���


the
  distribution is made directly to another Tax Sheltered Annuity, qualified
  pension or profit-sharing plan described in section 401(a), an eligible
  deferred compensation plan described in section
  457(b) which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A)��or IRA;
  or




�




���


the
  distribution satisfies the minimum distribution requirements imposed
  by
  the Internal Revenue Code.




�
In
  addition, under some circumstances, the Internal Revenue Code will not permit
  contract owners to waive withholding.��Such circumstances
  include:
�




���


if
  the payee does not provide Nationwide with a taxpayer identification
  number; or




�




���


if
  Nationwide receives notice from the Internal Revenue Service that
  the
  taxpayer identification number furnished by the payee is
  incorrect.




�
If
  a
  contract owner is prohibited from waiving withholding, as described above,
  the
  distribution will be subject to mandatory back-up withholding.��The
  mandatory back-up withholding rate is established by Section 3406 of the
  Internal Revenue Code and is applied against the amount of income that is
  distributed.
�
Non-Resident
  Aliens
�
Generally,
  a pre-death distribution from a contract to a non-resident alien is subject
  to
  federal income tax at a rate of 30% of the amount of income that is
  distributed.��Nationwide is required to withhold this amount and send
  it to the Internal Revenue Service.��Some distributions to
  non-resident aliens may be subject to a lower (or no) tax if a treaty
  applies.��In order to obtain the benefits of such a treaty, the
  non-resident alien must:
�




(1)��


Provide
  Nationwide with a properly completed withholding certificate claiming
  the
  treaty benefit of a lower tax rate or exemption from tax;
  and




�




(2)��


provide
  Nationwide with an individual taxpayer identification
  number.




�
If
  the
  non-resident alien does not meet the above conditions, Nationwide will withhold
  30% of income from the distribution.


�


38





�


�
Another
  exemption from the 30% withholding is for the non-resident alien to provide
  Nationwide with sufficient evidence that:
�




(1)��


the
  distribution is connected to the non-resident alien�s conduct of business
  in the United States;




�




(2)��


the
  distribution is��includable in the non-resident alien�s gross
  income for United States federal income tax purposes;
  and




�




(3)��


provide
  Nationwide with a properly completed withholding certificate claiming
  the
  exemption.




�
Note
  that
  these distributions would be subject to the same withholding rules that are
  applicable to payments to United States persons, including back-up withholding,
  which is currently at a rate of 28%, if a correct taxpayer identification number
  is not provided.
�
Federal
  Estate, Gift and Generation Skipping Transfer Taxes
�
The
  following transfers may be considered a gift for federal gift tax
  purposes:
�




���


a
  transfer of the contract from one contract owner to another;
  or




�




���


a
  distribution to someone other than a contract
  owner.




�
Upon
  the
  contract owner�s death, the value of the contract may be subject to estate
  taxes, even if all or a portion of the value is also subject to federal income
  taxes.
�
Section
  2612 of the Internal Revenue Code may require Nationwide to determine whether
  a
  death benefit or other distribution is a �direct skip� and the amount of the
  resulting generation skipping transfer tax, if any.��A direct skip is
  when property is transferred to, or a death benefit or other distribution is
  made to:
�




(a)��


an
  individual who is two or more generations younger than the contract
  owner;
  or




�




(b)��


certain
  trusts, as described in Section 2613 of the Internal Revenue Code
  (generally, trusts that have no beneficiaries who are not 2 or more
  generations younger than the contract
  owner).




�
If
  the
  contract owner is not an individual, then for this purpose
only, �contract owner� refers to any person:
�




���


who
  would be required to include the contract, death benefit, distribution,
  or
  other payment in his or her federal gross estate at his or her death;
  or




�




���


who
  is required to report the transfer of the contract, death benefit,
  distribution, or other payment for federal gift tax
  purposes.




�
If
  a
  transfer is a direct skip, Nationwide will deduct the amount of the transfer
  tax
  from the death benefit, distribution or other payment, and remit it directly
  to
  the Internal Revenue Service.
�
Charge
  for Tax
�
Nationwide
  is not required to maintain a capital gain reserve liability on Non-Qualified
  Contracts.��If tax laws change requiring a reserve, Nationwide may
  implement and adjust a tax charge.
�
Diversification
�
Internal
  Revenue Code Section 817(h) contains rules on diversification requirements
  for
  variable annuity contracts.��A variable annuity contract that does not
  meet these diversification requirements will not be treated as an annuity,
  unless:
�




���


the
  failure to diversify was
  accidental;




�




���


the
  failure is corrected; and




�




���


a
  fine is paid to the Internal Revenue
  Service.




�
The
  amount of the fine will be the amount of tax that would have been paid by the
  contract owner if the income, for the period the contract was not diversified,
  had been received by the contract owner.
�
If
  the
  violation is not corrected, the contract owner will be considered the owner
  of
  the underlying securities and will be taxed on the earnings of his or her
  contract.��Nationwide believes that the investments underlying this
  contract meet these diversification requirements.
�
Tax
  Changes
�
The
  foregoing tax information is based on Nationwide�s understanding of federal tax
  laws.��It is NOT intended as tax advice.��All
  information is subject to change without notice.��You should
  consult with your personal tax and/or financial adviser for more
  information.
�
In
  2001,
  the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA) was
  enacted.��EGTRRA made numerous changes to the Internal Revenue Code,
  including the following:
�




���


generally
  lowering federal income tax rates;




�




���


increasing
  the amounts that may be contributed to various retirement plans,
  such as
  IRAs, Tax Sheltered Annuities and Qualified
  Plans;




�




���


increasing
  the portability of various retirement plans by permitting IRAs, Tax
  Sheltered Annuities, Qualified Plans and certain governmental 457
  plans to
  �roll� money from one plan to
  another;




�




���


eliminating
  and/or reducing the highest federal estate tax
  rates;




�




���


increasing
  the estate tax credit; and




�




���


for
  persons dying after 2009, repealing the estate
  tax.




�
In
  2006,
  the Pension Protection Act of 2006 made permanent the EGTRRA provisions noted
  above that increase the amounts that may be contributed to various retirement
  plans and that increase the portability of various retirement
  plans.


�


39





�


�
However,
  all of the other changes resulting from EGTRRA are scheduled to �sunset,� or
  become ineffective, after December 31, 2010 unless they are extended by
  additional legislation.��If changes resulting from EGTRRA are not
  extended, beginning January 1, 2011, the Internal Revenue Code will be restored
  to its pre-EGTRRA form.
�
This
  creates uncertainty as to future tax requirements and
  implications.��Please consult a qualified tax or financial adviser for
  further information relating to EGTRRA and other tax issues.
�
Required
  Distributions
�
The
  Internal Revenue Code requires that certain distributions be made from the
  contracts issued in conjunction with this prospectus.��Following is an
  overview of the required distribution rules applicable to each type of
  contract.��Please consult a qualified tax or financial adviser for
  more specific required distribution information.
�
Required
  Distributions � General Information
�
In
  general, a beneficiary is an individual or other entity that the contract owner
  designates to receive death proceeds upon the contract owner�s
  death.��The distribution rules in the Internal Revenue Code make a
  distinction between �beneficiary� and �designated beneficiary� when determining
  the life expectancy that may be used for payments that are made from IRAs,
  SEP
  IRAs, Simple IRAs, Roth IRAs and Tax Sheltered Annuities after the death of
  the
  annuitant, or that are made from Non-Qualified Contracts after the death of
  the
  contract owner.��A designated beneficiary is a natural person
who is designated by the contract owner as the beneficiary under
  the
  contract.��Non-natural beneficiaries (e.g. charities or certain
  trusts) are not designated beneficiaries for the purpose of required
  distributions and the life expectancy of such a beneficiary is
  zero.
�
Life
  expectancies and joint life expectancies will be determined in accordance with
  the relevant guidance provided by the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury
  Department, including but not limited to Treasury Regulation 1.72-9 and Treasury
  Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-9.
�
Required
  distributions paid upon the death of the contract owner are paid to the
  beneficiary or beneficiaries stipulated by the contract owner.��How
  quickly the distributions must be made may be determined with respect to the
  life expectancies of the beneficiaries.��For Non-Qualified Contracts,
  the beneficiaries used in the determination of the distribution period are
  those
  in effect on the date of the contract owner�s death.��For contracts
  other than Non-Qualified Contracts, the beneficiaries used in the determination
  of the distribution period do not have to be determined until December 31 of
  the
  year following the contract owner�s death.��If there is more than one
  beneficiary, the life expectancy of the beneficiary with the shortest life
  expectancy is used to determine the distribution period.��Any
  beneficiary that is not a designated beneficiary has a life expectancy of
  zero.
�
Required
  Distributions for Non-Qualified Contracts
�
Internal
  Revenue Code Section 72(s) requires Nationwide to make certain distributions
  when a contract owner dies.��The following distributions will be made
  in accordance with the following requirements:
�




(1)��


If
  any contract owner dies on or after the annuitization date and before
  the
  entire interest in the contract has been distributed, then the remaining
  interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as the distribution
  method in effect on the contract owner's
  death.




�




(2)��


If
  any contract owner dies before the annuitization date, then the entire
  interest in the contract (consisting of either the death benefit
  or the
  contract value reduced by charges set forth elsewhere in the contract)
  will be distributed within 5 years of the contract owner�s death, provided
  however:




�




(a)��


any
  interest payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary
  may be
  distributed over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a
  period
  not longer than the life expectancy of the designated
  beneficiary.��Payments must begin within one year of the
  contract owner's death unless otherwise permitted by federal income
  tax
  regulations; and




�




(b)��


if
  the designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the deceased
  contract owner, the spouse can choose to become the contract owner
  instead
  of receiving a death benefit.��Any distributions required under
  these distribution rules will be made upon that spouse�s
  death.




�
In
  the
  event that the contract owner is not a natural person (e.g., a trust or
  corporation), for purposes of these distribution provisions:
�




(a)��


the
  death of the annuitant will be treated as the death of a contract
  owner;




�




(b)��


any
  change of annuitant will be treated as the death of a contract owner;
  and




�




(c)��


in
  either case, the appropriate distribution will be made upon the death
  or
  change, as the case may be.




�
These
  distribution provisions do not apply to any contract exempt from Section 72(s)
  of the Internal Revenue Code by reason of Section 72(s)(5) or any other law
  or
  rule.
�
Required
  Distributions for Tax Sheltered Annuities, IRAs, SEP IRAs, Simple IRAs and
  Roth
  IRAs
�
Distributions
  from a Tax Sheltered Annuity, IRA, SEP IRA or Simple IRA must begin no later
  than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
  contract owner reaches age 70�.��Distributions may be paid in a lump
  sum or in substantially equal payments over:
�




(a)��


the
  life of the contract owner or the joint lives of the contract owner
  and
  the contract owner�s designated beneficiary;
  or




�




(b)��


a
  period not longer than the period determined under the table in Treasury
  Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-9, which is the deemed joint life expectancy
  of the
  contract owner and a person 10 years younger than the contract
  owner.��If the designated beneficiary is the spouse of the
  contract owner, the period may not exceed the longer of the period
  determined under such table or the joint life expectancy
  of






�


40





�


�
the
  contract owner and the contract owner�s spouse, determined in accordance with
  Treasury Regulation 1.72-9, or such additional guidance as may be provided
  pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-9.
�
For
  Tax
  Sheltered Annuities, required distributions do not have to be withdrawn from
  this contract if they are being withdrawn from another Tax Sheltered Annuity
  of
  the contract owner.
�
For
  IRAs,
  SEP IRAs and Simple IRAs, required distributions do not have to be withdrawn
  from this contract if they are being withdrawn from another IRA, SEP IRA or
  Simple IRA of the contract owner.
�
If
  the
  contract owner�s entire interest in a Tax Sheltered Annuity, IRA, SEP IRA or
  Simple IRA will be distributed in equal or substantially equal payments over
  a
  period described in (a) or (b) above, the payments must begin on or before
  the
  required beginning date.��The required beginning date is April 1 of
  the calendar year following the calendar year in which the contract owner
  reaches age 70�.��The rules for Roth IRAs do not require distributions
  to begin during the contract owner�s lifetime, therefore, the required beginning
  date is not applicable to Roth IRAs.
�
Due
  to
  recent changes in Treasury Regulations, the amount used to compute the minimum
  distribution requirement may exceed the contract value.
�
If
  the
  contract owner dies before the required beginning date (in the case of a Tax
  Sheltered Annuity, IRA, SEP IRA or Simple IRA) or before the entire contract
  value is distributed (in the case of Roth IRAs), any remaining interest in
  the
  contract must be distributed over a period not exceeding the applicable
  distribution period, which is determined as follows:
�




(a)��


if
  the designated beneficiary is the contract owner�s spouse, the applicable
  distribution period is the surviving spouse�s remaining life expectancy
  using the surviving spouse�s birthday for each distribution calendar year
  after the calendar year of the contract owner�s death.��For
  calendar years after the death of the contract owner�s surviving spouse,
  the applicable distribution period is the spouse�s remaining life
  expectancy using the spouse�s age in the calendar year of the spouse�s
  death, reduced by one for each calendar year that elapsed since the
  calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the spouse�s
  death;




�




(b)��


if
  the designated beneficiary is not the contract owner�s surviving spouse,
  the applicable distribution period is the designated beneficiary�s
  remaining life expectancy using the designated beneficiary�s birthday in
  the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the
  contract
  owner�s death, reduced by one for each calendar year that elapsed
  thereafter; and




�




(c)��


if
  there is no designated beneficiary, the entire balance of the contract
  must be distributed by December 31 of the fifth year following the
  contract owner�s death.




�
If
  the
  contract owner dies on or after the required beginning date, the interest in
  the
  Tax Sheltered Annuity, IRA, SEP IRA or Simple IRA must be distributed over
  a
  period not exceeding the applicable distribution period, which is determined
  as
  follows:
�




(a)��


if
  the designated beneficiary is the contract owner�s spouse, the applicable
  distribution period is the surviving spouse�s remaining life expectancy
  using the surviving spouse�s birthday for each distribution calendar year
  after the calendar year of the contract owner�s death.��For
  calendar years after the death of the contract owner�s surviving spouse,
  the applicable distribution period is the spouse�s remaining life
  expectancy using the spouse�s age in the calendar year of the spouse�s
  death, reduced by one for each calendar year that elapsed since the
  calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the spouse�s
  death;




�




(b)��


if
  the designated beneficiary is not the contract owner�s surviving spouse,
  the applicable distribution period is the designated beneficiary�s
  remaining life expectancy using the designated beneficiary�s birthday in
  the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the
  contract
  owner�s death, reduced by one for each calendar year that elapsed
  thereafter; and




�




(c)��


if
  there is no designated beneficiary, the applicable distribution period
  is
  the contract owner�s remaining life expectancy using the contract owner�s
  birthday in the calendar year of the contract owner�s death, reduced by
  one for each year thereafter.




�
If
  distribution requirements are not met, a penalty tax of 50% is levied on the
  difference between the amount that should have been distributed for that year
  and the amount that actually was distributed for that year.
�
For
  IRAs,
  SEP IRAs and Simple IRAs, all or a portion of each distribution will be included
  in the recipient�s gross income and taxed at ordinary income tax
  rates.��The portion of a distribution that is taxable is based on the
  ratio between the amount by which non-deductible purchase payments exceed prior
  non-taxable distributions and total account balances at the time of the
  distribution.��The owner of an IRA, SEP IRA or Simple IRA must
  annually report the amount of non-deductible purchase payments, the amount
  of
  any distribution, the amount by which non-deductible purchase payments for
  all
  years exceed non taxable distributions for all years, and the total balance
  of
  all IRAs, SEP IRAs or Simple IRAs.
�
Distributions
  from Roth IRAs may be either taxable or nontaxable, depending upon whether
  they
  are �qualified distributions� or �non-qualified distributions.�

Variable Annuities Offer Investment Choices

With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.
Watch this video to learn how variable annuities can offer unique benefits for unique characters like you. 










Variable immediate annuity features
With an immediate annuity, you begin receiving income payments immediately. Immediate annuities are usually purchased with a lump-sum payment.

Variable deferred annuity features
Some of the advantages of variable deferred annuities include:

Tax-deferred growth potential in the accumulation phase (Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. There may be a 10% federal tax penalty on withdrawals before age 59½. Naturally, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced if you take any early withdrawals.)
Death benefits for your beneficiaries
Tax-free/penalty-free transfers among underlying investment options
A variety of payout options, including systematic withdrawals and annuitization (You may face surrender charges if you withdraw your money early.)
 


Read this important information

Keep in mind that investing involves market risk and your investment return, principal value and periodic payments will fluctuate over time. You could end up with more or less than the amount you invested.
An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement. It will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization. It provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments. An annuity isn’t intended to replace emergency funds or to fund short-term savings goal.
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal.
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company, and it’s sold by prospectus. You should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you. Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees and the expense of the underlying investment options.
Neither Nationwide nor our representatives give legal or tax advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor for answers to specific questions.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Annuities issued by Nationwide Life Insurance Company or Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Columbus, Ohio. 

Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying funds contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional, contact Nationwide or click links to product information below.

Annuities May Be a Smart Fit for Your Investment Plan

Are you worried about outliving your income? That’s a risk that you may be able to do something about. When you invest in an annuity, you set the stage to receive income in the future, subject to the terms, conditions and or limitations of the insurance contract.
An annuity is a long-term contract you purchase from an insurance company. It is designed to help accumulate assets to provide income for retirement. Annuities do have limitations. If early withdrawals occur penalties may apply and earnings are taxable as ordinary income and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty if withdrawn prior to age 59½.
How do annuities work?
An annuity is a long term investment that is issued by an insurance company designed to help protect you from the risk of outliving your income. Through annuitization, your purchase payments (what you contribute) are converted into periodic payments that can last for life.
Nationwide's annuities are flexible so you can choose one that enables you to:

Invest a lump sum or invest over a period of time 
Start receiving payments immediately or at some later date
Select a fixed, variable or indexed rate of return

Investing involves risk and may lose value. All guarantees and protections are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuing company, but the guarantees do not apply to any variable accounts which involve investment risk and possible loss of principal.
What type of annuity could fit into your investment plan?
Whether your needs are immediate or long-term, you can choose the type of annuity whose features work for your situation:

Variable – With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.


Variable annuities are sold by prospectus. Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying investment options contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional or the insurance company.
Immediate – An immediate annuity is usually purchased with a lump-sum and guaranteed income starts almost immediately. Your investment converts into a guaranteed stream of income that is irrevocable once payments begin. In some situations, funds can be accessed, but some restrictions apply.
Fixed – With fixed annuities, the principal investment and earnings are both guaranteed and fixed payments are made for the term of the contract.
Fixed Indexed – This special class of annuities yields returns on contributions based on a specified equity-based index, such as the S&P 500.


A fixed indexed annuity offers returns based on the changes in a securities index, such as the S&P 500® Composite Stock Price Index. Indexed annuity contracts also offer a specified minimum which the contract value will not fall below, regardless of index performance. After a period of time, the insurance company will make payments to you under the terms of your contract.


A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment.

Long-term CareReview these resources for clients who want to be prepared for funding this potential expense as they age.NFW-6118AO

Annuities have limitations. They are long-term vehicles designed for retirement purposes. They are not intended to replace emergency funds, to be used as income for day-to-day expenses, or to fund short-term savings goals. Investing involves risk.A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment. It may be appropriate for individuals who want guaranteed interest rates and the potential for lifetime income. Guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.Lifetime income may be provided through the purchase of an optional rider for an additional cost or through annuitization at no additional cost. If you take withdrawals before you're age 59½, you may have to pay a 10% early withdrawal federal tax penalty in addition to ordinary income taxes. Withdrawals may trigger early surrender charges, reduce your death benefit and contract value.NFW-5010AO.1NFW-4984AO.1Home Products Annuities Fixed Indexed  New Heights 9

Variable Annuities and Variable Life Products: Questions to Ask

                            June 9, 2004
                       


Variable annuities and variable life insurance products combine features of insurance and securities investments.  They can be an important part of your retirement and investment plans, but it is important to make sure they are right for you.  Recently the SEC issued a report on how these products are sold.  Based on the problems we’ve seen, here are some important questions we recommend that you ask before purchasing a variable product.  

Might I need this money in the next few years?  Variable products are long-term investment vehicles.  They aren’t appropriate if you’ll need your money in the short term because substantial taxes and insurance company charges may apply if you withdraw your money early.


Do I have enough money right now to purchase this product?  Because variable products are long-term investments, it can be dangerous to your financial health to mortgage your home in order to purchase a variable annuity or variable life insurance product.  If a salesperson pressures you to do so, call us instead at 1-800-SEC-0330.


Am I being urged to purchase a variable annuity or variable insurance in my IRA, 401(k), or other retirement account?  One key benefit to purchasing variable products is the fact that earnings on the invested money accumulate tax-deferred.  But these tax benefits are of no value if you’re purchasing the product in your IRA, 401(k), or other retirement account because those accounts are already tax-advantaged.  Make sure that the features you’re buying are worth the money you’re paying.


Does the firm recommend this product to all its customers?  Everyone has different investment objectives.  Variable products are not “one size fits all.”  Be careful if a salesman recommends one product to all customers.  That may mean the product isn’t right for you.


What will I lose if I exchange this product?  If a salesperson is urging you to exchange your variable product for a new contract, you’ll need to compare both products carefully, because:

	
the guaranteed death benefit of the new product may be less than the old,
you may have to pay a “surrender charge” to get out of the old product,
the new product may impose higher annual fees and a new surrender charge, and 
the new product may impose a new surrender charge period.



For more information on how variable annuities work and what you should know before purchasing, please read Variable Annuities:  What You Should Know.

Nationwide Financial Introduces “New Heights” Indexed Annuity

By	
Rachel Summit, with Annuity FYI


in Annuity Riders, Death Benefits, Fixed Indexed Annuities, GLB, Indexed Annuities, Insurance Companies, Nationwide 
 

***UPDATE: Indexed annuities have become very popular in recent years. Check out the current top rates and new products, as well as latest articles and guides, here. ***
Yesterday I wrote about the benefits of fixed indexed annuities and what the Indexed Annuity Leadership Council wants Americans to know about them.  There is a new fixed indexed annuity on the market now and it has one main difference from many of the others.  Nationwide Financial is now selling an indexed annuity called New Heights.  This information comes from Annuity News’ “Nationwide Financial Launches Indexed Annuities,” by Cyril Tuohy.  With sales of indexed annuities increasing over the past couple years, Nationwide wanted to join the market for these important financial products.  Fixed indexed annuity sales increased 15.1% from the third quarter of 2012 to the third quarter of 2013.  The year to date sales at the end of the third quarter were up 4.7% from 2012.
One big difference with Nationwide Financial’s indexed annuity is that its growth is not capped.  Their senior vice president of life insurance and annuities says that this uncapped earning potential is rarely found in the indexed annuity marketplace.  New Heights offers customers a choice between a guaranteed lifetime income benefit rider or a larger death benefit payment to their heirs.  Both options come with an added cost to the consumer.  Fixed indexed annuities are designed to offer customers principal protection along with gains that are tied to a particular market index.  If the index rises in value, your indexed annuity rises in value as well.  Most indexed annuities cap the increase that you will actually receive though.  If the S&P 500 gains 30% in a year, your gain might be capped at 7-10%.  But with low interest rates, this is still a welcome increase to some other fixed rate products.  With Nationwide’s New Heights though, your gain is not even capped.  When markets lose value, indexed annuity account values are protected from declines.
Nationwide has partnered with Annexus to market and distribute their New Heights indexed annuity.  This indexed annuity designer and wholesaler gives Nationwide access to an independent distribution channel and a plethora of information that they didn’t previously have access to.  Starting in March, Nationwide’s indexed annuity will be sold through their sales agents, bank and wirehouse channels, and independent distributors.  The combination of benefits from fixed annuities and variable annuities make indexed annuities popular among planners looking for safety and guarantees with their finances.  Principal protection combined with growth potential and no cap on market gains make New Heights a great addition to the indexed annuity product line.
