Waite Rawls Begins Tenure As Executive Director of MOC




WAITE RAWLS BEGINS TENURE AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MUSEUM OF THE CONFEDERACY

January 12, 2004

Museum of the Confederacy
1201 E. Clay Street, Richmond, VA 23219
(804) 649-1861 - FAX (804) 649-1460 






S. Waite Rawls III
Executive Director
Museum of the Confederacy


 


S. Waite Rawls III has become the new Executive
Director of  The Museum and White House of the Confederacy, replacing Col.
J. A. Barton Campbell, who has retired and returned to the museum's Board of
Trustees. Rawls assumed the position Jan. 5 following a long career as an
executive in the international investment and commercial banking industry.
His parallel  career in volunteering for historical and civic organizations
includes long-term ongoing engagements as trustee of the Civil War
Preservation Trust and the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation and member of the
Virginia Military Institute Board of Visitors.


 Museum Board Chairman J.E.B. Stuart IV said of Rawls's appointment: "Waite
possesses remarkable personal and professional attributes, as demonstrated
by the sterling services he has rendered in all his demanding corporate and
public/civic positions.  We are quite confident that, with his considerable
talents and energy, he will guide The Museum of the Confederacy through
present-day challenges into an even more prosperous future."




Rawls, 55, a native of Franklin, Virginia, received a B.A. at Virginia
Military Institute and was awarded an M.B.A. and J.D. by the University of
Virginia.  Among the positions he held in the banking, investment, and money
markets fields were: Managing Director, Chemical Bank, New York; Vice
Chairman, Continental Bank, Chicago; Executive Vice President, The Chicago
Corporation; and Chief Operating Officer of Ferrell Capital Management,
Greenwich, Conn.





Most recently he led a start-up technology company in the Washington, D.C.
area. He has also been a visiting or adjunct professor at University of
Virginia's Darden Graduate School of Business Administration and Illinois
Institute of Technology.


Rawls has served on many corporate boards and is a past director of the
Public Securities Association and Chicago Risk Management Committee; he has
also served on the Borrowing Advisory Committee of the U.S. Treasury and the
Foreign Exchange Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

When asked why he switched from a career in the financial industry to a
nonprofit position with a museum, Rawls replied that he decided several
years ago to follow his passion full-time. "The older I get, the more I've
been saying it's history that makes my blood run--that's where my passion
is," he said. Few who meet Waite Rawls can doubt that. His knowledge of
Confederate history, just like his personal library of history books, is
extensive.


As someone devoted to education and the study of history, Rawls has been
active on many nonprofit boards. Prior to joining VMI's Board of Visitors,
he was director of its Alumni Association and trustee of the VMI Foundation.
Similarly, for the University of Virginia's Darden School, he served as a
director and president of its Alumni Association and trustee of its
Foundation. He has also served as director of the Landmark Preservation
Council of Illinois, trustee of the Museum of Science and Industry
 (Chicago), and trustee of The Seeing Eye. Since the mid-1980s, he has been
director of The Camp Foundation and the College Orientation Workshop, an
organization that sponsors rigorous academic summer programs for inner city
teenage boys.


Having been on the job only a few days, Rawls is not yet ready to announce
his goals for the museum, but he has expressed the desire to draw public
attention to the last remaining documents and artifacts from this critical
period that may be stored in attics and basements across the country. "In 20
years, these are going to be lost to future generations," he said. "We
urgently need to help families conserve, preserve, and display this
important material."


Rawls brings an infectious enthusiasm to his new position at The Museum of
the Confederacy. "It's got the best Confederate artifacts in the universe,"
he said. "Priceless military objects, art, books, manuscripts, flags, you
name it. It's staggering when you walk around the place to see what
treasures are preserved here."

By Dana B. Shoaf         10/12/2010 •
        Civil War Times 
Waite Rawls Revels in His Role as the Keeper of the Confederacy’s Complex Legacy
S. Waite Rawls has a name and heritage befitting a Confederate general. A Virginia Military Institute graduate, he’s got so many Rebel ancestors that he has a hard time remembering them all. For three decades he left the South behind, working as an investment banker in New York and Chicago before finally returning to his native Virginia. After lengthy service on the Civil War Preservation Trust’s board, in 2004 Rawls became the Museum of the Confederacy’s president and CEO—a job he says challenges and inspires him daily.
How long have you been interested in the Civil War?
I grew up in the small town of Franklin, Va., which had a Civil War Round Table that I desperately wanted to be a member of. In 1957—when I was 9, and you were required to be 18 to be a member—they said they’d let me in if I could pass a test: to go to the Confederate Museum in Richmond and come back, give them a report and answer their questions.
I remember walking in the front door of the MOC, and there were two old ladies with “white tight” buns and those lace-up shoes. I was scared to death, but I passed the test when I got back.
What’s it like to be president and CEO of the museum years later? 
The duty, the responsibility to carry on here is awe-inspiring. I’ve never worked as hard—both in terms of hours or degree of difficulty. When I came here in 2004, I told J.E.B. Stuart IV, the trustee who hired me, that I’d be here until someone carried me out on a stretcher.
What difficulties does the MOC face?
Three things. Number one, despite the Civil War’s continuing popularity, in political and in donor circles it’s almost like an electric third rail. Convincing people that we are a credible educational institution is a much big­ger challenge than I anticipated.
Number two, we were in worse financial shape than I anticipated. We’re in much better financial shape today and are growth oriented. All our strategic plans are kept on my computer in a file labeled “Seven Days,” because I said we should be tired of playing defense; let’s play offense for a change. We’ve been playing offense for six years and have made tremendous progress.
The third thing is it’s been an extraordinarily difficult environment in which to raise dollars. But we’ve done it. We’ve got a record this year in membership and annual fund. We’ve raised well over $6 million toward our Appomattox project.
What’s the biggest challenge for the museum in the 21st century?
There are two big challenges. One is to make the Civil War relevant to the 21st century. I get inspired by great quotes from great people like, “You don’t know your future if you don’t know your past.”
The other thing is to convince the general public that the Confederacy and racism are not synonymous terms. In the past 25 years the general public has been putting those two together. When they come here, we tend to open their eyes.
I look at the virtue, the courage, the self-sacrifice of the typical Confederate soldier as inspiring and uplifting. And trying to cram that person into a pigeonhole of racism is just completely wrong.
Explain the plan to develop three additional museum sites.
In Richmond we are “locationally challenged.” Our historic location, at the White House of the Confederacy, has become overshadowed by urban growth, making it difficult for visitors to come to us.
We had an epiphany—we should take the museum to the people. During a trip to Appomattox, they told us how many people come to visit that site. In my mind I said, “Appomattox is in the middle of nowhere.” Yet places like Appomattox are where Civil War Times readers want to go. What better place to show our artifacts than the locations where they were made famous?
When will the Appomat­tox Court House location open?
In 2012. Following that will be one in the Fredericksburg region, and then Fort Monroe. What is it—30 percent?—of all casualties happened within 20 miles of Fredericksburg. You cannot find a place, particularly from a combat point of view, more appropriate than Fredericksburg.
And there’s so much history in Fort Monroe, before, during and after the war, whether it’s Jefferson Davis’ imprisonment; or the contraband decision; or the fact that Robert E. Lee built the fort; or it was the launching place for the Seven Days’ Campaign.
Did any of your ancestors fight for the Confederacy?
Yes, I can’t count them all, either in Virginia or North Carolina. My great-great-uncle Abner Pease was a captain who ended up commanding the 23rd North Carolina at the surrender at Appomattox.
But my great-grandfather Rawls was a private all four years. He stopped going to the reunions because he said he was convinced that he was the only private in the whole Confederate Army, since during the reunions they would promote everybody—and he never got promoted even at the reunions. He was wounded twice, served through all four years and wrote his memoirs in 1910: three pages long, handwritten.
In May 1862, his unit left Norfolk with 1,015 men; they returned from Sharpsburg with 15. His description: “They got shot to pieces.” From his account of the Sharpsburg Campaign, it’s apparent they were on South Mountain, then in the Bloody Lane, but he just writes: “And then we went to Maryland and had two bloody fights and then we came home.” I just donated the tin cup that he took home from Appomattox to the museum.
What Confederate would you like to spend an hour with?
Jubal Early is a trip. A bad old man cursing a blue streak, hated women, hated the “Buttermilk Cavalry,” never shied away from a fight. What a colorful person he was!
Another one is General William “Little Billy” Mahone. Here’s this scrawny little skinny short guy with so many health problems that he’s carrying chickens and cows with him to all the battlefields—who’s kind of hidden under Lt. Gen. Richard H. Anderson’s hat for two years.
Finally after the Wilderness and into the Overland Campaign for the last year of the war, his is the best fighting unit in the Confederate Army. And the fact that he’s from Franklin, my hometown, he went to VMI and my great- grandfather fought for him doesn’t hurt. Here’s a good story: Once when he was wounded, his wife was informed about his injury but told not to worry because it was only a flesh wound. Her response was, “But Billy has no flesh!”
After the war he was a big railroad consolidator. He put together what became the Norfolk & Western, but he did an amazing job in the 30 years after the war of getting all the railroads in Virginia up. That was at the peak of competition to get coal from the West to ports in the East.
Then there was his role in the Re­adjustor Party. He became a Republican, he courted black voters, he did a lot for newly freed men—and he was very controversial, because he was no straight-line Democrat like so many of the Southern generals.
Did you think much about the war while you lived in the North?
Yes and no. I’ve always loved books, but for awhile I was reading dumb novels. Then, on a business trip to England, I finished a book in Heathrow Airport, and I said, “I’ll go get a Robert Ludlum novel.” I was on about page 100 when I realized I had read it before.
I was so disgusted that I’d wasted my time, it was like a light went on. I said: “I’m wasting my time reading all this junk. Give me my Civil War books again.” I’ve never looked back.
What item in the museum’s collection inspires you most?
On tough days I go down and watch people look at Robert E. Lee’s uniform. By their facial expressions, I can tell they know they’re in the presence of something important. It gives my life meaning to see that.
