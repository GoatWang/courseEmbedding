Experience











Tettra


Founder, CPO

2015 - Present (almost 2 years)



Nelson's one of the savviest people I know in Boston when it comes to product and design. He's thoughtful, meticulous and has an extremely well-calibrated filter for high quality work.

We've... more been friends for over a decade and worked alongside each other as cofounders to build Leadin from the ground up inside of HubSpot. After working with him at HubSpot, and now on Tettra, I give him a huge :thumbsup:
Andy Cook

HubSpot


Product Entrepreneur

2013 - 2015 (about 2 years)



Co-led a Skunkworks style "startup" within HubSpot to bring low cost marketing products to the SMB market.


Product Designer

2011 - 2013 (over 2 years)



Researched, prototyped, tested, and iterated on product designs.


I worked closely with Nelson at HubSpot and was really impressed with his product sense and customer intuition. He is a "product person" in the truest sense, always able to reframe discussion... more and design efforts around customer tasks and success metrics. Whether it was doing design sprints or refining an existing product flow, Nelson is an amazing product designer who I saw level up every chance he got.

Rentabilities


Developer

2011 (2 months)



I've been lucky enough to work with Nelson while at @HubSpot and in a startup setting (@Rentabilities). He's one of the best product designers I know. One of the many things I love about Nelson... more is his thoughtfulness. He's extraordinarily good about studying product problems, learning, and coming up with a strong thesis. He gets his hands dirty and makes awesome shit happen. He always seems to be dropping knowledge bombs. He's destined for greatness and I'm amped to follow @Tettra.

I always regret projects I spent a lot of time on but never deployed. People still use things I made in high school. Deploying is worth it.

Dealing with Edge Cases in Product Design – Nelson Joyce – MediumHomepageSign in / Sign upNelson JoyceBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingProduct Designer. Cofounder of @teamtettra, a “Slack first” company wiki.Mar 23, 2014Dealing with Edge Cases in Product DesignHave the courage to simplify.Designing simple products is hard. Software that starts simple has the tendency to become more and more complex as time goes on. Ideas come pouring in from customers for that next ‘must have’ feature. In many cases, those features are edge cases which will only be useful to a small percentage of customers. Trying to design an interface that will accommodate all of these edge cases will quickly lead to complexity. As designers, our instinct is to optimize for the fewest amount of clicks and screens. However, when adding edge case functionality, we should ignore this urge in order to keep primary use cases simple.Some may argue that the ideal situation is to keep your product in its simplest form, never supporting any of these edge cases. That approach may satisfy design purists following a sacred set of ideals, when you’re trying to grow your customer base, it is often unrealistic. At HubSpot, we have learned that adding this type of functionality is OK, as long as it stays out of the way of the main use cases.Our team has decided that our product doesn’t need to allow for edge case tasks to be completed quickly. Advanced users are willing to click a few extra times for advanced functionality. The benefit they receive from that advanced functionality is often worth the extra effort. Beginners will also benefit from not being intimidated by a myriad of features they don’t understand.An ExampleOne of the best examples of this principle in action is Google Search. There’s a ton of advanced search functionality that has been added over the years, but the home page remains just a single input box. In order to access advanced search features, you either need to know advanced query syntax, or find the advanced search link buried in a drop down menu on the results page. Google recognizes that a majority of their users don’t need that advanced functionality, and keeps it out of the way.It sounds easy, but in practice it’s much harder. Our design instincts tell us to optimize for the fewest number of clicks and screens. We are always trying to create a delightfully simple experience for all our users. But we must ignore those instincts when dealing with edge cases in order to keep our products simple.Nelson Joyce is a product designer.

The concept of “sets” within “scenes” makes a lot of sense to me.
