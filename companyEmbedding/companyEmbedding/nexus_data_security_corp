        Brilliant photos in any light.
      
Pixel’s low-light loving camera is also one of the highest-rated smartphone cameras ever. With HDR+ and image processing smarts built-in, your photos will be the envy of Instagram.

        Unlimited storage,

for free, for real.

      
Sick of those “Storage is Full” notifications and subscription fees? Keep all your photos and videos (even in 4K) with free, unlimited storage. Yes, really. *


          












Unlimited storage gives me the freedom to never ever worry about filling up my phone with pictures.

GT Nexus Member Information
3.1 If your organization chooses to apply for membership to the GT Nexus Platform, you may be asked to provide Basic Information for individuals who will act as contacts on GT Nexus and detailed financial and business information about your organization. This information may be shared with financial service providers and payment providers to enable your organization to qualify for credit risk and payment services. During this registration process, we will allow you to choose whether or not you would like us to contact your organization’s trading partners for membership and other services related to transactions.
3.2 Once your organization becomes a Member, your Basic Information and your organization’s financial information, other confidential business data, and transaction details may be shared with other Members, GT Nexus service providers, and GT Nexus corporate alliances as necessary in order to conduct your transaction(s). GT Nexus service providers and corporate alliances include, but are not limited to payment providers, payment protection providers, country managers, freight forwarders, inspection agents, logistics providers, financing providers, sales support, marketing agents, and, subject to appropriate restrictions, to third parties who provide services to us regarding our business. In certain circumstances, we may modify the format of information you provide to us to make the format compatible with the GT Nexus Platform. We will not disclose your Basic Information and your organization’s financial information, confidential business data or transaction details without your consent, except as permitted by this Privacy and Confidentiality Policy or a GT Nexus Membership Agreement, our Master Subscription Agreement or any other agreement you or your organization have accepted with GT Nexus to govern your access to the GT Nexus Platform (the “GT Nexus Agreement”). Note that settlement services are provided through a GT Nexus, Inc. subsidiary, Platform Settlement Services LLC (“PSS”) and Members are required to enter into a separate Platform Settlement Services User Agreement with PSS, which shall be the entire agreement between such parties.
In addition, we aggregate your transaction data with that of other Members for benchmarking, statistical analysis and other similar purposes (the “GT Nexus Data”). GT Nexus reserves all rights in the GT Nexus Data, including but not limited to the right to commercialize GT Nexus Data as the sole and exclusive property of GT Nexus.  GT Nexus Platform pricing is based in part on GT Nexus’ reservation of all rights in the GT Nexus Data, including the commercialization of GT Nexus Data.
3.3 Passwords and identity or security devices are private entry keys into the respective GT Nexus account. A user should never share his or her password or identity or security devices with anyone. If a user needs to walk away from his or her personal computing device (PC) for any reason, the user should log off from the GT Nexus session. Users should select passwords that are difficult to guess and change them frequently. Passwords should not be stored on the PC or on written notes near the PC. Identity or security devices should be stored in a secure place. GT Nexus is not responsible if the foregoing practices are not complied with.
3.4 When a user logs onto our transaction sites, the GT Nexus system uses session cookies, small text files placed temporarily on your system, to maintain user session records. These cookies are destroyed as soon as the user logs out and closes the browser and cannot be used to track other information about the user or his or her computer. They are required; a user cannot use the GT Nexus transaction system unless the user accepts these session cookies.
3.5 We will use the information you provide to contact you, if necessary, to service your organization’s account or for other administrative purposes. We may also access and use your organization’s information to resolve disputes, to troubleshoot problems, to enforce our GT Nexus Agreement, or for marketing purposes. In addition, the GT Nexus transaction system uses your transaction details to automate and to streamline your trade transaction by checking for electronic data compliance, providing reporting features, and transferring data from previous forms to those of the current transaction.
3.6 When this Privacy and Confidentiality Policy offers Members the opportunity to “opt in” or “opt out”, you may do so by contacting GT Nexus Member Services at privacy@gtnexus.com.
3.7 Members also have the opportunity to select certain types of emails they would like to receive from GT Nexus. This can be done easily by utilizing the Email Subscription Table located in the Admin section of the GT Nexus transaction site.

3.9 Unless your organization opts out as described above, we may post your company name in the marketing section of our website to indicate that your organization is a Member.
Disclosure of Information and GT Nexus Data
4.1 We may disclose information about you and your organization to such third parties that you authorize.
4.2 We may provide GT Nexus Data to third parties, including Members, provided that in no event will GT Nexus use non-aggregated data that is captured by the GT Nexus Platform, which represents a specific relationship and/or transaction between Members of the GT Nexus Platform.
