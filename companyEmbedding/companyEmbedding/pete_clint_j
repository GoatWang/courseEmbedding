That same year, he was Sheldon Carp in “At Home with the Family” of the NBC series Please Don't Eat the Daisies. His final appearances were on NBC's Ironside in 1967 as Alfred Dunne in “A Very Cool Hot Car”, as Richard in “The Arrangement” in 1970 of ABC’s Make Room for Granddaddy, a Danny Thomas series, and in the episode “Rookie” of Henry Fonda's 1971 series, The Smith Family. He also appeared as Sergeant Crane in the 1971 film The Andromeda Strain.[1]
In 1965, Helm starred in an unsold pilot for a television series called See Here, Private Hargrove, based on producer Marion Hargrove's experiences adjusting to military life during World War II.[4]

He also appeared as Sergeant Crane in the 1971 film The Andromeda Strain.[1]
In 1965, Helm starred in an unsold pilot for a television series called See Here, Private Hargrove, based on producer Marion Hargrove's experiences adjusting to military life during World War II.[4]
Helm thereafter worked in film production in such later pictures as Bring It On, All or Nothing, and the horror story, Drag Me to Hell.[5]
