Why Read This Report
In Forrester's 40-criteria evaluation of private cloud solution vendors, we identified the nine most significant software providers — BMC Software, Cisco Systems, Citrix, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, Red Hat, and VMware — in the category and researched, analyzed, and scored them. This report details our findings to help infrastructure and operations (I&O) professionals select the optimum private cloud solution. I&O pros can customize criteria weightings to align with their own private cloud initiative. It is a refresh to Forrester's "The Forrester Wave™: Private Cloud Solutions, Q4 2013" report.

Cloud Security: A Shared Responsibility Model

Security is Achievable in the Cloud
If you compared a current survey of “top concerns of cloud adoption” with one from five years ago, you would see the top issue as security, followed by data privacy or protection. Despite the long-standing concerns captured in a myriad of surveys, security in the cloud has progressed to a more practical and achievable level.
                      
                          For over a decade, SecureWorks has provided a comprehensive suite of IT security services to thousands of clients. Fueled by Counter Threat Unit (CTU) intelligence, we can help you anticipate your cyber attackers, detect their tradecraft, disrupt the kill chain and eradicate their presence in your environment. 
                      

                      What our clients are saying
                      

                      “The security solution from SecureWorks works perfectly for us because it’s incredibly flexible and straightforward to implement. It’s helping us drive expansion.” 
                          
                          -Head of Global IT Services, Engineering Services Company International Leader

     Advancing Endpoint Security
              

                  Endpoint Security Protection from Advanced Threat Actors
              
                  Want to learn more?
              
 Figuring out when an advanced threat actor has penetrated your security defenses, which systems have been compromised, how they got in, and how to get them out are critical components of your security program. Phishing, social engineering, and endpoint security vulnerabilities make endpoints (laptops, desktops, and servers) fertile ground for advanced threat actor "land-and-expand" penetration campaigns. Learn more about advanced threats through this free white paper.

                             White Paper 
                          
                          Penetration Testing helps organizations meet compliance requirements and uncover security risks. 
                        


                      While the adage "the best offense is a good defense" may be well worn, it is still true - especially for your network's security. A great proactive approach to managing your company's network security can be penetration testing. A penetration test can help show how an attacker would gain unauthorized access to your environment through your email systems, firewalls, VPN tunnels, web servers and other network devices.
                  
SecureWorks can help you find security risks through testing and assessment services.
For over a decade, SecureWorks has provided a comprehensive suite of IT security services to thousands of clients. Fueled by Counter Threat Unit (CTU) intelligence, we can help you anticipate your cyber attackers, detect their tradecraft, disrupt the kill chain and eradicate their presence in your environment.
What our clients are saying
“SecureWorks has strong technical security expertise, highly sophisticated testing practices and the flexibility to meet our requirements – this sets it apart from its competitors.”

BOARD MEMBER (MICHAEL R DUNN) 63
Mr. Dunn is currently serving as the Chairman and CEO of Global Future City Holding, Inc, a fully reporting public company (FTCY). Since mid- 2008 Mr. Dunn has mitigated over $6 million in debt, provided over $3 million in financing, and developed three new energy shot products with assistance of personal physician contacts as well as designed the prototype of an erectile dysfunction shot.
In the mid-1995 through 2006, Mr. Dunn started a company that generated a $60 million auto portfolio which later sold the paper to a subsidiary of General Motors. Mr. Dunn interfaced with the top CEO’s of automotive companies including Harold Poling, the former CEO and Chairman of Ford Motor Company, Bob Eaton, the former Chairman and CEO of Daimler Chrysler, Woody Morcott, Retired Chairman and CEO of Dana Corporation, Steven L Miller, former Chairman President and CEO of Shell Oil Company, as well as several other top automotive executives securing approximately $22.2 million in equity financing for the Company, plus an additional $20.8 million and $1.9 million in debt and lease financing, respectively. Mr. Dunn worked closely with Mr. Poling, who was the largest investor and shareholder, to manage strategic partnerships with large corporate partners and lenders such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Wachovia, Bank of America, Manheim, Allstate, Warrantech, as well as many other banks and strategic partners for funding loans for auto dealers. Mr. Dunn worked closely with Mr. Poling to successfully create, brand, develop and deploy a revolutionary auto-financing program for independent dealers, including signing a contract with Manheim, who is the owner of 86 auctions in the US (subsidiary Cox Enterprises), and floors over 17,000 independent dealers.
In 1992 to the end of the first quarter of 1995, Mr. Dunn, worked with investment bankers to raise the necessary funds to purchase Mountaineer Park in West Virginia. The park was one of the first racing facilities to pass gaming legislation for the expansion of video lottery and he was the major activist in receiving approval through the vote of the residents of Hancock County, West Virginia to expand gaming in a Bible Belt State. He coordinated the design and implementation of a $10 million renovation of the racetrack and put into service over 700 new video lottery machines. Mr. Dunn created large special events that drew over 10,000 people which dramatically enhanced the gaming handle for racetrack wagering, simulcast wagering and video lottery. Additionally, he negotiated with ESPN for nationally televised fights at the renovated facility. The park had over 450 employees and while Mr. Dunn was Chairman and CEO of the public company, he was instrumental in raising investor capital of approximately $17 million, plus an additional $17 million in construction loan and equipment lease financing.
Mr. Dunn has over 30 years of experience in developing, funding, and managing, of several public as well as private ventures in the retail, hotel, finance and gaming businesses.
Consultant (Safa Movassaghi) 52
Inventor of the Company’s proprietary technology, Safa Movassaghi has spent nearly 25 years in information technology and services, as well as data center management and cloud computing, beginning his career as a service engineer with Toshiba in the 1980s. Since 1993, Mr. Movassaghi has provided clients, some Fortune 1000, with comprehensive and sophisticated packages of IT architecture and configuration, thereby reducing clients’ costs and increasing their productivity.
It was through this work and years of feedback from clients, that Cloud Security was born. Prior to founding Cloud Security Corporation, Mr. Movassaghi operated Advanced Green Technologies, Inc. (“AGT”), an IT managed services provider, utilizing the latest, cost-effective technological solutions. Previous to AGT, he served as Chief Technology Officer for Capital Pacific Holdings, a $1 Billion+ real estate developer, where, in leading a team of 10 employees, he successfully managed the growth of the company to over 300 employees in 70 locations. Mr. Movassaghi received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from California State University, Fresno in 1987.

In 2011, Cloud Security Corporation turned its focus from general IT solutions to new market opportunities created by the massive explosion of remote location work environments, rapid expansion of network bandwidth, and a surge in the everyday use of smartphones, tablet PCs and netbooks that are increasingly part of remote-location – and even on-premise – business.  This Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) proliferation has given rise to a host of new security issues – the focus of CLDS.
In 2012, Cloud Security Corporation (then Cloud Star Corporation) went public under the symbol: CLDS. With security now being the major component of the Company’s business model, Cloud Security Corporation is dedicated to capitalizing on security trends in the cloud and BYOD.

									  Mobile Security (BYOD)					  

  

Mobile Security (BYOD)
The ubiquitous use of smartphones and tablets at work and at home is now part of our lifestyle. Using your mobile devices at work (Bring Your Own Device – BYOD) is a trending practice. Simply think of using your personal cell phone for work (or vice versa).   BYOD comes in many forms, from the ad hoc use of personal devices to supplement corporate endpoints, to replacing corporate-owned devices entirely.  Because of this trend, organizations are improving productivity, satisfaction, talent recruitment and employee retention.
As with other computing trends, however, comes the security issue that a device may introduce new threats or compromise the integrity of the workplace network and computing environment.  This is a major concern of IT departments today.
To address this issue, Cloud Security is developing a proprietary Mobile Security suite of products that will provide a robust mobile device management solution.

The system starts with installation of a mobile app that provides secured encryption between the remote server environment and the device; it also provides scanning of the device to inoculate the device against threats.  Soon, the suite will deliver role-based management, configuration, security and support for corporate and employee-owned devices.

Cloud Security
Many organizations today are feeling pressure to reduce IT costs and optimize IT operations. Cloud computing is rapidly emerging as a viable means to create dynamic, rapidly provisioned resources for operating platforms, applications, development environments, storage and backup capabilities, and many more IT functions. “Cloud” is a generalized term to denote a large, connected, remote technical infrastructure (usually the Internet) that can be used to store and access data.   Generally, the hardware used to power the cloud – the servers, along with the data centers and racks that house them – are not owned by users.
Because of this upfront cost savings, cloud computing allows companies to avoid upfront infrastructure costs, and focus on projects that differentiate their businesses instead of infrastructure.  From large multinational corporations to small neighborhood businesses, cloud computing in some form is becoming the standard for global business.
However, with this convenience also comes danger. A staggering number of security considerations exist that information security professionals need to consider when evaluating the risks of cloud computing.
Because data and information is just “out there”, there is easy exposure to all forms of cyber-attack –  privacy invasion, stolen information, malware propagations and data losses.
Cloud Security is dedicated to the on-going research, development and implementation of advance technology to protect organizations (Enterprise) and individuals (Personal) involved in any phase of the cloud computing environment.
II. Enterprise
The storage gateway into the cloud computing environment is typically the most guarded component of the cloud “loop”. But the entry point for external machines or devices to communicate with the cloud-based environment is usually where attacks happen.
Cloud Security Enterprise is an evolving set of services that include network security, information security, and computer security. All apply best practices to ensure compliance with important business-level security policies and processes, as well as government regulations.  First, the network security solution ensures there is no compromise in network traffic. The information security component then scans data for any compromise.  Finally, the computer security module then scans installations for any malware, viruses or other potential security hazards that may create a wormhole for hackers to tunnel into the private network.
In short, Cloud Security Enterprise is a set of services that ensures that all points of the cloud technical infrastructure are safe.
I. Personal “MyComputerKey™”
MyComputerKey is a secured means for individuals to access a remote machine, and in particular a cloud-based environment from their own desktop computer. MyComputerKey is a USB device that inserts into any computer to allow access to a remote machine or cloud-based environment. Upgrades are being made to implement a biometric authentication so even if passwords are compromised,   MyComputerKey remains uncompromised.
As security issues’ full impact is still emerging, this product is in constant improvement to remain cutting-edge.  CLDS has filed a patent application from its initial approach.
Whatever your computing needs are, you control the keys…

Former Citrix CTO says virtualization will solve security problems




10 cloud management companies to watch




7 hot cloud companies to watch






Video
What is Microsoft Azure Stack? | Tech Talk Ep 1






















Security is one of the major impediments to enterprises moving their resources into the cloud. So, it's not surprising that numerous cloud security companies are springing up, attempting to address specific cloud security issues, like protecting virtual machines or encrypting data in motion.Here are five up-and-coming companies - some still in stealth mode - that hold a great deal of promise.1. BromiumHeadquarters: Cupertino, Calif., and Cambridge, U.K. What it offers: Still in stealth mode, but founders have hinted they are building a product that uses virtualization to help secure all types of endpoints. How much it costs: No pricing available at this time.Who heads the company? Its founders are Gaurav Banga, the former CTO of Phoenix Technologies; Simon Crosby, the former CTO of the Data Center and Cloud Division of Citrix; and Ian Pratt, the current chairman of Xen.org and another Citrix veteran.Why we're watching the company: Crosby is one of the more outspoken proponents of public cloud computing. He contends the security threats to cloud computing don't grow out of inherent holes in the cloud, but rather stem from unprotected clients, like the ones enterprise users are adding to corporate networks at alarming rates. While the company - which picked up $9.2 million in venture capital money early last summer -- won't be divulging product details until later this fall, Crosby has gone on record as saying that the primary benefit of virtualization will be security. It will be a neat trick if they can pull it off. 2. CipherCloudHeadquarters: Cupertino, Calif.What it offers: Cloud data encryption and tokenization.How much it costs: $20 per user per monthWho heads the company? Pravin Kothari is founder and CEO. Prior to starting up CipherCloud, Kothari was founder, CTO and interim-CEO of Agiliance, a GRC software company and was co-founder and vice president of engineering of ArcSight, a security and compliance vendor.Why we're watching the company: CipherCloud is attempting to take on encryption and tokenization in a way that protects both data at rest and in motion, has low performance overhead for SaaS applications, and does not require enterprise customers to hand over control of encryption keys to their cloud service providers.According to Kothari, the CipherCloud gateway is a lightweight software appliance that encrypts and decrypts data and attachments as they pass through it. It does so in real-time without loss of performance, format or functionality of the application."Our gateway is designed as a stateless solution. This, along with our high-performing encryption algorithms, ensures near-zero impact on the performance," Kothari says. In fact, in certain configurations where CipherCloud has switched on static caching, Kothari says they have seen improvements in performance with its gateway in the middle.3. Cloud PassageHeadquarters: San FranciscoWhat it offers: Halo SVM and Halo Firewall SaaS products, both of which aim to lock down virtual servers.How much it costs: FreeWho heads the company? Co-founders are Carson Sweet (serving as CEO), Talli Somekh (executive chairman) and Vitaliy Geraymovych (vice president of engineering). They came to CloudPassage from GlobalNetXchange (now Agentrics), Musea Ventures, and the technology consulting field, respectively.Why we're watching the company: CEO Carson Sweet argues that virtual machines enabled the explosion in cloud computing, "but people sometimes sort of forget about the virtual network around those machines that need to be secured." CloudPassage focuses on securing the virtual server environment, which is widely viewed as one of the most unpredictably vulnerable spots in the cloud. Early this year, the company released two free services designed to protect cloud-based virtual servers by maintaining firewall policies (Halo Firewall) and checking for vulnerabilities (Halo SVM). The company plans to build a revenue stream by eventually charging for higher-level VM security services that build on the Halo framework.4. High Cloud SecurityHeadquarters: Mountain View, Calif.What it offers: Virtual Machine encryption solutions.How much it costs: Not available yetWho heads the company? Co-founders are Bill Hackenberger and Steve Pate. Hackenberger, who serves as CEO and president, has founded three other startups, one of which, AIM Technology was bought by Network General. He has also served as vice present of engineering at both Caymas Systems and Vormetric. Pate, who serves as CTO, held that same position at encryption vendor Vormetric and worked at virtualization vendor HyTrust in that company's early phases of development.Why we're watching the company: High Cloud Security recently printed an excerpt from an article published back in 2010 that outlined in three easy steps how to hijack a virtual machine and in the process steal sensitive data that might be running on the VM at that point in time. High Cloud says the way to prevent this from happening is to encrypt everything at the storage layer that may contain sensitive information. The company's yet-to-be released product is currently in beta testing.5. HyTrustHeadquarters: Mountain View, Calif.What it offers: The HyTrust Appliance (currently available version is 2.2) provides centralized access control for virtual servers, providing enforcement of security policies and compliance controls.How much it costs: $1,000 per host supportedWho heads the company? John De Santis, formerly vice president, Cloud Services at VMWare is CEO. Co-founders are Eric Chiu and Renata Budko who are president, and vice president of marketing, respectively. Hemma Prafullchandra is CTO. She was formerly CTO of FuGen Solutions, a managed provider of federated identity interoperability and compliance service.Why we're watching the company: We've been tracking HyTrust for two years now, since it was selected as a 2010 company to watch and won best of show accolades at several industry trade shows. The product held its own against well established market leader Trend Micro in our recent test of virtualization security management tools. The company has reportedly closed more business in the first two quarters of 2011 than it did in the whole of 2010.

SECURITY

The top 10 cloud-based security tools to protect your network in a hurry

Meghan Kelly January 30, 2014 10:11 AM



Image Credit: Anastasios71/Shutterstock 





It doesn’t matter what size you are when it comes to protecting your network. Big company, small company, startup: Hackers will still want your information and they’ll still stealthily poke holes in your network wherever they can.
You need to get security measures in place and fast.
That’s why “security as a service” companies have become vital for anyone looking to deploy security for everything from documents to your entire business.
Security as a service can be loosely described as a “software as a service” security tool that doesn’t require any on-premise hardware or software distribution. Unlike older security tools, like anti-virus software that needs to be installed on every single computer on your network, it’s almost plug and play — you click a button (and likely put in some credit card information) and suddenly you’ve got major security resources at your fingertips.
These security services aren’t the same as an on-premise firewall that watches the network from a physical appliance attached in your data center. But these products promise to protect you from malware, help you keep track of who signs into your network, monitor all your other cloud applications such as Salesforce and Google Docs, and more.
Small businesses can benefit from this kind of distribution model because it doesn’t require a big IT or security teams to get it up and running. Of course, you’re trusting a lot of your security to another company, but in reality these security-focused third parties have more resources (read: time and money) to focus on security than you do.
So what are the best security-as-a-service products out there? We talked to experts in the security community to compile this initial list of the top-tier providers.
Here are our top 10 in no particular order. What did we miss? Let us know in the comments below!

VentureBeat is researching cloud platforms and we’re looking for your help. We’re starting with marketing — specifically marketing automation. Help us by filling out a survey, and you’ll get the full report when it’s complete.

Qualys
Qualys secures your devices and web apps, while helping you remain compliant through its cloud-only solution — no hardware or software required. The company analyzes threat information to make sure nothing gets in your system. If some malware already happens to be there, it will give you the steps to fix the problem. Beyond that, Qualys will verify that the issue has been fixed. It scans any and all web apps you use for vulnerabilities as well, keeping your data safe while you head out in the wonderful world of SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS. In the future, Qualys plans to create a cloud-only firewall to even further protect your websites from harm.

White Hat Security
White Hat Security is focused on protecting your website from the ground up, including in the coding process. It provides its Sentinel product suite as a service to help your protect your websites with five different products.
These include a product that gives you current threat information so you can avoid coding vulnerabilities into your website from the get go. Another helps you identify issues in pre-production before the website is ever launched, and its enterprise product helps you test for major logic issues once you’re live. The overall Sentinel line will help your assess your Web apps for holes and will even act as a firewall that virtually patches found problems. White Hat further takes advantage of its research arm in order to provide you with updated information on threats found outside your network. 

Okta
One of the most important parts about securing your network is simply knowing who is inside of it. Okta focuses purely on identity management — knowing who is where and why. It knows both your employees for people accessing information on the backend, as well as your forward-facing access-ers, which include customers and partners. It will help you manage logins across all of your applications as well, including Google Apps, Salesforce, Workday, Box, SAP, Oracle, Office 365, and more. Furthermore, it can track all of these from any type of device. Features include privilege provisioning from one dashboard, the ability to implement policies across devices, single sign-on options, and more. 

Proofpoint
When we talk about attack vectors — holes in the network where bad guys can get in — email pops out as one of the weakest links. Proofpoint focuses specifically on email, with cloud-only services tailored to both enterprises and small to medium sized businesses. Not only does it make sure none of the bad stuff gets in, but it also protects any outgoing data. Proofpoint further promises that while it stores that data to prevent data loss, it does not have the keys to decrypt any of the information. 

Zscaler
Zscaler calls its product the “Direct to Cloud Network,” and like many of these products, boasts that it’s much easier to deploy and can be much more cost efficient than traditional appliance security. The company’s products protect you from advanced persistent threats by monitoring all the traffic that comes in and out of your network as a kind of “checkpost in the cloud.” But you don’t have to filter all that traffic in from one central point. You can monitor specific, local networks as well given the flexibility of the cloud. Zscaler also protects iOS and Android devices within your company, which can then be monitored through its special mobile online dashboard. 

CipherCloud
CipherCloud is here to secure all those other “as a service” products you use, such as Salesforce, Chatter, Box, Office 365, Gmail, Amazon Web Services, and more. It promises to protect that prized company data you’re just giving away to these services, as well as your communications, and more. It does this through many of the means we’ve already seen including encryption, traffic monitoring, anti-virus scans, and more. It also provides mobile security support. 

DocTrackr
DocTrackr is a security layer that sits on top of file sharing services such as Box and Microsoft Sharepoint. It is built on the idea that once you send a document out of your system, it is truly out of your hands: People can save it, change it, send it, and more, and you’ve lost control of it. DocTrackr aims to stop that from happening. It lets you set user privileges for each person you share a document with. It further tracks everyone who opens the file, so you know who’s looking at your stuff — and you can even pull documents back, effectively “unsharing” them, if you want. 

Centrify
Similar to Okta, Centrify also focuses on identity management across a number of devices and applications. The idea is to put all of your users — employees and customers alike — into one central area to be monitored and controlled through enforced company policies. Centrify will protect anywhere a person signs into your network be it through on-premise software or cloud applications. It also has a product that works specifically Samsung Knox — the smartphone manufacturer’s supposedly extra-protected mobile security software. This product provides devices running Knox with single sign-on options and helps IT departments manage these devices through Centrify. 

Vaultive
Vaultive acts as a “transparency network proxy,” that is, it sits between your network and the Internet without needing any on-premise equipment. From there, Vaultive encrypts any data leaving the network heading to apps such as Microsoft Office 365. In other words, if you want to use cloud-based services but don’t trust the companies operating them, you can encrypt everything — before it gets into their servers — while continuing to use their clouds. The company plans to help people protect more than just Office 365 and Exchange. Soon, it will extend into customer relationship management software, file-sharing applications, communication services, and more.
SilverSky
SilverSky wants to be your one-stop-shop for cloud-based security. It offers email monitoring and protection, network protection, and will help you become HIPAA and PCI compliant — the two compliance measures that regulate how companies dealing with healthcare information and companies accepting online payments must secure their systems. It also taps into a big data store of threat information to keep your systems up to date on the latest malware and attacks heading for businesses like yours.

Why Read This Report
In Forrester's 40-criteria evaluation of private cloud solution vendors, we identified the nine most significant software providers — BMC Software, Cisco Systems, Citrix, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, Red Hat, and VMware — in the category and researched, analyzed, and scored them. This report details our findings to help infrastructure and operations (I&O) professionals select the optimum private cloud solution. I&O pros can customize criteria weightings to align with their own private cloud initiative. It is a refresh to Forrester's "The Forrester Wave™: Private Cloud Solutions, Q4 2013" report.

As increasing numbers of corporations move to cloud productivity solutions like Microsoft Office 365, Box, Google Apps, and others, the legal department is tasked with the expanded challenge of managing the complex process of discovery in an environment where electronically stored information (ESI) is not only growing at an exponential rate but it is in multiple locations both physical and virtual and even the constitution and value of the data has changed.

How cloud productivity tools like Office 365, Google and Box are changing the way we should look at e-Discovery.

Corporations managing e-discovery in this changing tech environment should consider these four best practices as they navigate this new terrain:


Understand the different types of metadata produced with cloud data


Do awareness training to inform better policies


Consider all data sources


Evaluate native e-discovery capabilities in cloud systems and develop a consistent process

I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
