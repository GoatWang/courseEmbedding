					Full Description



CAI International, Inc., incorporated on January 30, 2007, is a transportation finance and logistics company. The Company purchases equipment, primarily intermodal shipping containers and railcars, which it leases to its customers, and also manages equipment for third-party investors. The Company operates through three segments: container leasing, rail leasing and logistics. In operating the Company's fleet, it leases, re-leases and disposes equipment and contracts for the repair, repositioning and storage of equipment. The Company also provides domestic and international logistics services.The Company leases its container equipment to lessees under long-term leases, short-term leases and finance leases. The Company's long-term leases have terms of one year or more and specify the number of containers to be leased, the pick-up and drop-off locations. It enters into long-term leases for a fixed term ranging from 3 to 8 years, with five-year term leases being most common. Short-term leases include both master interchange leases and customized short-term leases. Finance leases are long-term lease contracts that grant the lessee the right to purchase the leased containers for a nominal amount.The Company also operates a fleet of railcars that are used to transport industrial goods, materials and other products on railroad tracks throughout North America. The Company owns a fleet of railcars of various types, including 50 feet and 60 feet box cars for paper and forest products; covered hoppers for grain, cement, sand, plastic pellets and many other industrial products; general purpose tank cars that are used to transport food-grade and other non-hazardous commodities; gondolas for coal, and general service flat cars. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 6,459 railcars. It offers multiple lease options to its railcar customers, including full service and net operating leases and per diem leases. Its full service leases provide customers with management services, including maintenance and the payment of taxes. Net operating leases allow customers to manage and pay the cost of operating and maintaining railcars themselves. Its per diem lease product enables customers to pay through a settlement process on an hourly and mileage basis.The Company offers logistics services, including intermodal, truck brokerage, port drayage, warehousing, international ocean freight and freight forwarding, as well as the arrangement and coordination of international air freight services and customs brokerage. The Company contracts with railroads to provide transportation for the line-haul portion of the shipment and with local trucking companies, known as drayage companies, for pickup and delivery. The Company offers a range of transportation management services and technology solutions, including shipment optimization, load consolidation, mode selection, carrier management, load planning and execution and Web-based shipment visibility.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

About the Community Association Management Industry
The community association industry has seen a rapid boom over the past 40 years. In 1970, an estimated 10,000 community associations existed in the United States. By 2012, that number had climbed to over 323,000 communities, accounting for over 63.4 million residents. The Community Association’s Institute estimates that of those communities, approximately 15% to 25% are self-managed.

This percentage is higher in urban locations, where many co-operatives and condominiums were converted from apartment buildings. An estimated 10,000 community association management companies exist in America today.
Last year alone, American associations collected nearly $40 billion in the form of annual assessments. What’s more, over $35 billion was maintained in investment accounts for long-term maintenance issues. Around 2 million volunteers serve on a Board of Directors for their association. The total value of the time dedicated by community volunteers exceeds $850 million annually.

10 Tips for Better HOA Management

admin 


While many are highly efficient and operate effectively, there are other homeowners associations (HOAs) that are unable to properly manage even basic tasks such as resident conflict resolution or critical maintenance. Here is a look at 10 great tips that will ensure better HOA management services.
1 – Resolve Conflicts as they Surface
More often than not, plenty of conflicts between residents remain unresolved for quite some time. By then, HOAs have usually lost control of the situation or are unable to resolve it. As such, always resolve conflicts as they surface. This leads to efficient resource handling and higher resident satisfaction.
2 – Always have a Sizeable Reserve Fund
Most HOAs have a reserve fund in order to cater emergencies. Unfortunately, the size of the reserve fund is usually relatively low. As such, it is vital that you have a sizeable reserve fund that is almost 30% of your total maintenance fees.
3 – Hire HOA Management Service Companies when Needed
At times, there are chances that HOAs are unable to operate properly. During such times, it may be ideal to hire the services of an HOA management services company. With years of experience and a wide range of adequate resources, they can help you manage better.
4 – Find the Right Vendors
Whether it is for landscaping, supplies or cleaning, HOAs are required to have the right vendors available. Not only does this improve resident satisfaction, it helps minimize costs.
5 – Hire the Right People
Whether it is an accountant or an electrician, I is rather unfortunate that many homeowners associations hire the wrong people to manage their community. Correct hiring not only ensures cost reductions, but ensures efficiency in management.
6 – Reinforce Policies as Needed
While residents are required to read, understand and comply with the outlined policies, there are always residents that seemingly forget to follow them. As such, in case of policy violations, such as violence or nightly disturbances, HOAs are required to put their foot down and ensure that policies are being adhered to.
7 – Monitor Resource Usage
More often than not, resources are not properly allocated. In fact, it is unfortunate that they are, at times, being misused. As such, by monitoring resource usage, HOAs can ensure that resources are being properly used, taking corrective actions if they are not.
8 – Hire a 3rd Party Auditing Service
In case any discrepancies arise, or the year-end is close, hiring a 3rd party auditing service can help offload work for HOAs and ensure local compliance, thereby ensuring the elimination of fines.
9 – Place Better Signs
Whether it is a “no parking” or a “no smoking “ sign, HOAs are required to place clear, concise and effective signs around the residential community area.
10 – Be Firm with Fees
Maintenance fees are usually the lifeline for any HOA; it’s where they are funded. At times, some residents can be uncooperative with them, either in meeting deadlines or incorrect amounts. As such, HOA needs to be firm with such people rather than leverage simple warnings; always follow the rulebook on this.
