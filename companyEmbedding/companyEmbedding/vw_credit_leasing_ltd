What to do at the end of your lease









Whether you don’t want to let go of your current vehicle or you're ready for something new, we'll walk you through preparing for the lease-end process.












1. Lease-End Options





Option 1: Turn in your VW vehicle
The following steps will help you complete your current lease:

Review your vehicle condition.
 Schedule your vehicle inspection
Turn in your vehicle to your VW Dealer.

If you choose to lease or purchase a new VW, go to vw.com to find your next model and schedule a test drive with your VW Dealer. As a returning customer, if you purchase your next vehicle through Volkswagen Credit, we will waive your disposition fee. Or if you lease, we will waive your disposition fee and your security deposit1.



Option 2: Purchase your VW vehicle
Not ready to let go of your current VW? No problem.
Here’s what to do if you’d like to purchase your current vehicle:

Contact your VW Dealer or call us at (800) 521-0171 to receive payoff instructions.
Consider our financing1 and Volkswagen Drive Easy1 extended coverage options.





	        Download Lease-End Process Brochure







2. Wear & Use Review





While some wear and use is expected, our Wear & Use Guide helps make conducting your own self-inspection easy. We'll help you evaluate "normal" versus "excess" wear to determine what you can expect on turn-in day.



InteriorExteriorWheels and TiresMechanical











Normal Wear & Use











Minor staining and carpet wear
All original equipment present including the owner’s manual, all sets of keys, airbags, CD player, navigation CDs, and the convertible top cover (if applicable) 










Excess Wear & Use











Upholstery holes, tears, burns, or singes
Excessive staining of the upholstery, carpet, or interior panels
Damage to convertible top such as cuts, burns, singes, tears, or stains

















Normal Wear & Use











Scratches, dents, and gouges smaller than 2 inches on bumper or panel











Single windshield chip without spidering











Three or fewer “dings” per panel (a ding is the size of a quarter or smaller, without broken paint)










Excess Wear & Use











Scratches, dents, and gouges larger than 2 inches on bumper or panel











Multiple chips, cracks, or pits measuring more than 1/8 of an inch, or improperly tinted windows











Improperly completed body repairs (i.e., mismatched paint, sanding marks, and incomplete dent removals)
More than three “dings” per panel
Multiple chips, scratches, and dents per body panel

















Normal Wear & Use














All four tires and the spare have more than 1/8 of an inch of tread at the shallowest point

















Minor steel or alloy wheel scuffs














Tires are same size and speed rating as the original equipment 
Multiple tire types are acceptable for VW vehicles not equipped with 4MOTION® all-wheel drive as long as they are the same size and speed rating as original equipment
VW vehicles equipped with 4MOTION® all-wheel drive must have matching brand, size, and rating on all tires










Excess Wear & Use














One or more tires including the spare have less than 1/8 of an inch of tread at the shallowest point

















Heavily gouged steel or alloy wheels














Retreads, snow tires, gouged tires, or tires with cut or plugged sidewalls
Unrepairable steel wheels or alloy wheels that are broken, missing, or bent

















Normal Wear & Use











All equipment, options, and accessories are intact and working.










Excess Wear & Use











Service indicator lights are on indicating repair is needed (i.e., check engine light, airbag light, and anti-lock brake (ABS) light)










	        Download Wear + Use Guide











3. Schedule Your Vehicle Inspection







Inspection Process

Schedule a vehicle inspection2 by going online or calling SGS at (855) 622-4VCI (4824). An SGS agent will evaluate your vehicle for any excess wear and use. 
Once completed you will receive an inspection condition report itemizing any excess wear.
Excess wear will be billed on your Turn-In Settlement Invoice (unless you choose to repair the items prior to turn-in). 
If repairs are completed, email or fax the repair receipts, along with proof of payment, to RepairReceipt@vwcredit.com or fax to (800)824-8284 prior to returning the vehicle. This will help ensure the charges are adjusted prior to receiving your Turn-In Settlement Invoice.

Frequently Asked Questions









At Volkswagen Credit, we make sure you understand the ins and outs of your entire lease or retail contract. Here are a few answers to some commonly asked questions to get you started.












Q: How many miles do I get on a lease?








A: Most standard leases are calculated based on a specified number of miles you can drive, typically 15,000 or fewer per year. You can negotiate a higher mileage limit, but you will normally have an increased monthly payment since the vehicle’s depreciation will be greater during your lease term. If you exceed the mileage limit set in the lease agreement, you’ll probably have to pay additional charges when you return the vehicle.









Q: What is the Volkswagen Drive Easy Program?







A: We offer a range of service and protection plans for any VW driver. The Volkswagen Drive Easy Program includes a portfolio of coverage options for your Volkswagen vehicle:







	        Vehicle Service Contract Plan


	        Certified Pre-Owned Service Contract Plan 


	        Term Care Select Service


	        Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) Plan


	        Road Hazard Tire and Wheel Coverage


	        Ding Shield Service Plan 


	        MyVWInsurance







Q: Who should I contact for questions regarding my Volkswagen Credit account?







A: Please contact Volkswagen Credit Customer Care at (800)428-4034 Monday–Friday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. (Eastern) or log in to your Volkswagen Credit account to send a secure email.









Q: Who should I contact if I am within the last 90 days of my lease?







A: If you are within the last 90 days of your lease, please call Volkswagen Credit Lease-End Services at (800)521-0171 Monday-Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (Eastern) or log in to your Volkswagen Credit account to send a secure email.









Q: Who should I contact to schedule my lease-end inspection?







A: SGS, a third-party inspection company, will schedule an inspection at your home, office or dealership. You may contact SGS at (855) 622-4824 Monday–Friday from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. (Eastern). Or by visiting https://schedule.sgsauto.com at your convenience to schedule an inspection appointment.









Q: How can I calculate my mileage on my current lease?







A: During the last year of your lease, log in to www.vwcredit.com/myaccount to access our mileage calculator tool.





















Let's speak the same language.
From residual value to adjusted capitalized cost, automotive finance has its fair share of jargon. To make your financing experience a little smoother, we defined some of these terms for easy reference.

Compare at a Glance
Leasing
Financing
Lease-End Options
























Lease or finance: The choice is yours.









To help you make the best decision for your lifestyle, we compared the benefits of leasing and financing at a glance. Which road will you take?









Leasing Benefits

May provide lower monthly payments than financing, over a similar term, while driving the latest models
Flexible lease terms and a range of mileage options available
Ability to turn-in your vehicle for a newer VW model, or buy your vehicle at a predetermined price at lease maturity
A range of mileage options that suit your lifestyle


Financing Benefits

Ability to own for life of the vehicle and build equity
No end-of-lease obligations, such as excess wear and tear
No vehicle customization limits or mileage restrictions
Competitive rates and flexible terms from Volkswagen Credit









Freedom means flexible options.






Freedom means flexible options.
If you like to change things up every few years, or if you're looking to lower your monthly payment, leasing with Volkswagen Credit may be the option for you. Drive a new Volkswagen for a set amount of time and number of miles, and return it to your Volkswagen Dealer at the end of your term. With a variety of lease options, you can choose the term and mileage that best fits your lifestyle and payment needs.
 
OWNERSHIP: When you lease a vehicle, you do not own it. You pay to use it during the term of your lease, allowing you to drive the latest models.
 
PAYMENTS: Since you pay for the vehicle's depreciation, plus applicable taxes and fees instead of the purchase price, you can drive a premium vehicle for less than you might with financing over a similar term.
 











	        Estimate Your Payment1










MILEAGE: We offer a variety of mileage options for you to choose from to meet your driving needs. Whatever you choose as your base mileage option, you’ll retain the opportunity to purchase more miles later on.
 
WEAR AND USE: A normal amount of wear and use is covered in your lease. But, dents, gouges, or chipped glass can happen to even the most conscientious driver. We offer an optional Lease Excess Wear Protection Plan so you can avoid potential additional charges at the end of your lease for incurring excess wear.
 
LEASE-END OPTIONS: At the end of the lease, you have the flexibility to return your leased vehicle to your Dealer, purchase it for a predetermined price, or buy or lease a new Volkswagen vehicle.
 









Enjoy the pride of ownership.









If you can’t wait to make this Volkswagen your own—customize it however you wish and drive it to the ends of the earth—then financing with Volkswagen Credit is the way to go. Financing your vehicle allows you to make payments for a selected term, and at the end of that term, the car is yours. That means total ownership and maybe even equity.
 
OWNERSHIP: You own the vehicle outright after your financial obligations are met, and you can sell your vehicle or trade it in at any time.
 
PAYMENTS: Payments are based on the terms of your financing contract. You will have a set number of payments, each of which may help you build equity in your vehicle. Because you’re paying for the vehicle’s full price over the term of your contract, your monthly payment will typically be higher than if you were leasing the same vehicle over a similar term. You can opt to pay your balance off faster by paying more against the principal.











	        Estimate Your Payment1










CUSTOMIZATION: Since you are making payments toward the ownership of your vehicle, you can customize it at any time.
 
MILEAGE: You may drive as many miles as you want. However, if you decide to sell or trade in your vehicle, the mileage may impact its value.
 
WEAR AND USE: Since the vehicle will be yours once you pay off your contract, there are no charges for excessive vehicle wear and use. If you decide to sell or trade in your vehicle, the excessive wear and use may impact its value.

Top 10 Frequently Asked Questions


















Where can I find warranty information for my Volkswagen vehicle?





To locate limited warranty information for your vehicle, please refer to your Warranty and Maintenance booklet found in your Owner’s Manual.






What vehicles are included in the Takata recalls?




Safety Recall 69M9 - Takata SDI Inflators:

2009-2017 Volkswagen CC
2010-2014 Volkswagen Eos
2010-2014 Volkswagen Golf

2009-2013 Volkswagen GTI

Safety Recall 69M8 - Takata PSDI-5 Inflators:

2006-2007 Volkswagen Passat Sedan
2006-2007 Volkswagen Passat Wagon

 
To verify whether a vehicle is impacted by these recalls, enter the 17-character VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) using the VIN search tool available on vw.com/recalls or http://www.safercar.gov.
 
For additional information please contact the NHTSA at 1-888-327-4236 or reach out to us by visiting vw.com/contact.






If my vehicle requires a warranty repair, will Volkswagen provide me with a loaner vehicle?




For information about loaner availability, please reach out to an authorized Volkswagen dealership. Click here to locate your nearest VW dealer.






Is my vehicle included in the Takata recall?




To verify whether your vehicle is impacted by this recall, enter your 17-character VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) using the VIN search tool available on vw.com/contact or http://www.safercar.gov.
 
Your VIN is a 17 character (digits and capital letters) identification number that is located on the lower left corner of your vehicle’s windshield, on your vehicle’s registration card, or it may also be shown on your insurance card.
 
In addition, if your vehicle is impacted by this recall, you should have already received an initial notification in the mail advising you of the recall. 
 
For additional information, please contact the NHTSA at 1-888-327-4236 or reach out to us by visiting vw.com/contact.






Do warranty repairs have to be completed at the dealership where the car was originally purchased?




No, they do not. Repairs under your limited warranty may be completed at an authorized Volkswagen dealership. If you’d like to locate a dealer in your area, click here.






Are the warranties on my vehicle transferrable to a subsequent owner?




You bet. Volkswagen limited warranties are automatically transferred without cost if the ownership of the vehicle changes while the limited warranties are valid.






What is the minimum octane rating gasoline that I should use in my vehicle?




Good question. Fuel requirements will vary based on the vehicle you have. To identify the minimum octane rating of the gasoline recommended for your vehicle, please check the fuel sticker that is found on the inside of your fuel filler door.






How can I find out if my vehicle is affected by a campaign?




Click here to check out our Recall/Service Campaign Lookup tool on vw.com.






Why do my brakes make a squealing noise sometimes when it’s cold?




If your car has been sitting for a while, if it is wet, or even cold outside, the brakes can oxidize and rust may form. So when the brakes are used for the first time, they may make a squealing noise. After a few stops, the rust will essentially wear off and the noise will disappear as well. If brake noise continues, please visit your local VW dealer.






Can I change the size of the tires on my vehicle?




Your tires were carefully selected to match your Volkswagen, so only a tire size that is shown on the “Tire and Loading Information” label on the door of your vehicle (or listed in your Owner’s Manual) areis recommended for use.

Had early termination on dieselgate.  One payment left on lease turned in car and 120 days later credit report hit for 85 points saying i was late on a payment for a car i no longer owned. Attempts to call and rectify pointless as the left hand doesnt know what the right hand is doing...waiting weeks now for a resolution. Zero communication. Never using these ****ing idiots again.

                    ABSOLUTE WORST                

                                    Anonymous                                                    Borrower





They said they never received a payment from my husband & I two years ago, which they took from our bank. I have had Chase Bank fax them proof of payment & i've faxed over copies of bank statements. Now the lease is up they are trying to make us pay it again & charge us over $700 in late fees & they keep reporting late payments to my husbands credit report. I have called non stop to have this rectified; each time being put on long Holds & being told that someone will call me back, which never happens. Then they said they never received it & had a check no which they apparently sent us back? Which makes no sense? Why would you send someone a check if you never received payment? I said they can see that "supposed" check wasn't cashed or received & to cancel it & send another one in that case..... put on hold again. Nothing they can do to help. Poor customer service! So now my lawyer is handling it. Never ever will I, on any of my family or friends get a Volkswagen again (this was my 4th VW). They lost loyal customers & unfortunately I lost hours of time on the phone which I will never get back!

I have a loan for lease through them and recently applied to have loan taken over by a friend (with a co-signer). We only used a co-signer because they charge $100 to even CHECK YOUR CREDIT and no one can even answer me on why.  It was supposed to take 3-5 business days to find out the result. We are on week 5 and after multiple phone calls to them every week where we were told "oh it's on the fax machine" this week they told me it was DECLINED and they can not tell me why. They again said that a letter was mailed a week ago... stil no letter in the mail. I could go into much more detail but they are horrible as far as customer service. According to my VW dealership they don't even know why VW credit would lead me to believe egos was possible or take my $100 which is not refundable and wouldn't go towards us applying again.

We finished a diesel buyback on 3-29-17 which resulted in an overpayment on our VW CREDIT account of almost 1700.00 it is now 4-17-17 and they have not reimbursed the overpayment difference even though they had been taking EFTpayments from our account monthly. Now they're saying that the reimbursement may take as long as another 6 weeks. Customer service is TERRIBLE. I will never use VW credit again!

                    The worst                 

                                    Anonymous                                                    Borrower





This is my third VW lease, it was great and something went bad this go round. The department is sluggish, you are frequently billed for the previous month which is paid and assessed a late fee despite not being late. They leave automated messages to say call customer service, takes about a half an hour to get a hold of any one and the answer is often, "the account is fine, sorry you were called" but you have to take them seriously because they will screw up your payment and then threaten to send it to collection agency despite everything being in order. Why not just login online? They have something wrong, I haven't been able to access my account despite multiple calls, browsers, computers, locations ect for more than three years. I love the cars but will not be getting another because of the screwed up be credit.

I finally paid off my car after 5 long years. I have had trouble with VW Credit before, but this tops the cake. They sent me the wrong title. A title for someone elses VW car they just paid off is now sitting on my desk, while mine is God knows where. Of all the incompitent things to do, this has to be the strangest. They might as well have sent me someone elses car by mistake.

I leased a VW CC from this awful company which had a seroious airbag recall that could cause death or serious injury. When I erquested to get out of the lease they refuesed since there was no fix for the recall. They still keep reporting negativly that has caused me a lot of inconvinience. Worst company ever, stay away from them and their cars. They are liars and scam artists.

They don't give you a tax overview statement, I've had this car for 8 months, I put it on autopay with direct debit and literally EVERY OTHER MONTH I get a letter that says I'm late on my payment and something went wrong. Every time, I call, they say they fixed it, and two months later the same thing happens again... also I have never called and been on hold less than 30 minutes before talking to someone.

VW Credit refuses to work with you, customer service representatives are rude, will put you on hold for 30-40 minutes at a time, don't want to help you with anything. Website only shows 3 recent statements and 6 recent payments. Impossible to get anything further back than that. They won't waive late fees, don't care if you are in financial hardship. Worst company I've ever dealt with

They are impossible to reach by the phone. I registered online and requested paper statement. Never received one because the payment was not due. Their website shows how many payment I made and nothing how much I owe. I have Mazda financed through Chase I always get my statement which is very clear. I am not sure how these people complay with the law.	Highly not recomended.
