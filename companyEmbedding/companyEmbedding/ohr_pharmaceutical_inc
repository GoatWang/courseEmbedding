A Clear Vision for the Future
Ohr Pharmaceutical is focused on the development of novel therapeutics for serious ocular diseases with unmet medical needs. Ohr's lead clinical program, Squalamine Eye Drops, is being developed as a non-invasive solution for the treatment of the wet form of age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). Current treatment options for wet AMD patients involve multiple, frequent injections directly into the eye.   The addition of Squalamine Eye Drops may improve visual outcomes as well as potentially reduce the need for these injections. Learn more about Squalamine Eye Drops and how they may help change future treatment for wet AMD. Learn More

Overview Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc. (NasdaqCM:OHRP) is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutics and delivery technologies for the treatment of ocular diseases. The company is led by experienced, world-renowned, clinician scientists with proven ability to bring products to the market. Our lead clinical program, OHR-102 (Squalamine) eye drops, is a novel anti-angiogenic product that provides a non-invasive therapy which in Phase II studies has been shown to improve visual outcomes compared to the current gold standard treatments without requiring additional injections. We are evaluating OHR-102 eye drops, given in combination with Lucentis® (Genentech/Roche) intravitreal injections, for the treatment of retinal diseases including wet age related macular degeneration (AMD), retinal vein occlusion and diabetic retinopathy. Wet AMD is the leading cause of vision loss in the elderly, affecting over 1.75 million patients in the United States alone, and the incidence is expected to dramatically increase in the upcoming years. Data from a Phase II clinical trial in wet AMD demonstrated a positive and clinically meaningful treatment effect of OHR-102 combination therapy and the pivotal Phase III program is being initiated.
Our preclinical pipeline is robust and focused on the development of sustained release therapeutics for ocular diseases utilizing our patented microfabrication platform technology. We currently have several active programs evaluating molecules and approaches for the treatment of primary open angle glaucoma, steroid-induced glaucoma, ocular allergies, and retinal diseases. These programs have been identified by Ohr as large markets of unmet medical need or where sustained release therapeutics can greatly improve upon the way ocular disease is currently being treated, including increasing compliance rates and reducing treatment burden
The promise shown by Ohr Pharmaceutical's product pipeline offers a new ray of hope for patients suffering from numerous blinding ocular diseases, and Ohr’s world-class expertise surrounding the treatment of eye disorders is the key to advancing existing and future pipeline products.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

THE PROMISE OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE

















THE PROMISE OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

Game description







THE BLINDING LIGHT DISSIPATES; YOU ARE MANIFEST.
The people's cries have activated ancient Ohr deposits and woken you from your slumber.
They used to sing songs about you, the angels, the stars the watchers; then one day you all disappeared.
But now you are back and must help them to find their frequencies, their souls, your heaven ....

The mother of all Rail slave games, all the genres, all the esoteric-ism, all the fever dreaming
Unique and bizarre "karma cow" micro management
"Tang soo do" your way through specially cordoned off battle hot zones; utilize round house kicks, spinning 360 hook kicks, ki energy attack and it's upgrades, diamond dredge and plas-palm.
Heavily inspired by NES turtles, Simons quest, The adventure of Link and Dizzy ....all the games your mother warned you about.
Tricky to master but rewarding wind up animation based attacks, precision jumping, over world and side scrolling action, shops.
OST of Evocative Piano reflections punctuated by F.Tylers menacing, grinding noise core.

Nice
Liriko

12/03/2016





                    Another great game from railslavegames. The artstyle and story is bizarre as usual.

The game is a mix between some genres. You start flying as a cassette around a world and you have to drop five different cassettes to the right persons. If you find one you will get a message and the person disappear. 

On the way to them you have to do some platforming and fight enemies. If you got hit by an enemie you get teleported into a bullet hell minigame where you have to catch the bullets with a net to escape from there.

I can't tell much about the story because I'm not sure about what it's actually about. All I can say that it's somehow connected to the previous railslavegames.

A Clear Vision for the Future
Ohr Pharmaceutical is focused on the development of novel therapeutics for serious ocular diseases with unmet medical needs. Ohr's lead clinical program, Squalamine Eye Drops, is being developed as a non-invasive solution for the treatment of the wet form of age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). Current treatment options for wet AMD patients involve multiple, frequent injections directly into the eye.   The addition of Squalamine Eye Drops may improve visual outcomes as well as potentially reduce the need for these injections. Learn more about Squalamine Eye Drops and how they may help change future treatment for wet AMD. Learn More
