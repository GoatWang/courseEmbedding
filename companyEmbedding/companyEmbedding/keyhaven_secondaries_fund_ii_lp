Keyhaven is a specialist private equity firm investing in small cap businesses across Europe







Keyhaven Capital Partners is an independent London-based private equity investment firm 


Keyhaven invests in European businesses with enterprise values typically less than €100 million. The firm has developed a unique investment strategy, accessing private small cap companies through partnerships with best in class local sponsors from around Europe.
Our core strength lies in our ability to think independently, often as a first mover with a team or strategy.
Since our inception in 2003, we have committed or advised on investments worth in excess of €1.75 billion, representing over 50 transactions across Europe.
 


Our team is comprised of highly networked individuals with proven investment judgement who have worked across different industries around the globe. We hail from 16 different countries and we speak 17 languages; this rich heritage serves as a central building block of the firm, and informs our culture, strategy and execution capabilities.
We are passionate about what we do. We believe that the key to delivering outstanding performance to our investors is our ability to identify and access opportunities which others do not, or cannot see, and to act quickly and decisively.
