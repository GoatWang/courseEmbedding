Fiona E. Luck gives Bermuda credit for much of her success in the insurance business.The island, she said, has been "wonderful for me in terms of presenting opportunities" over the 23 years she has worked in the world's largest offshore insurance market. Over those years, Bermuda has touted its role as an insurance "incubator" of innovative products and services, and "I've been fortunate in being caught up in that wave," Ms. Luck remarked."Having said that, I've worked really hard and been open-minded about moving into new areas," she said. Ms. Luck has worked in several capacities at Marsh Inc., ACE Ltd. and XL Capital Ltd. during her tenure in Bermuda. She currently serves as executive vp of group operations at XL.In recognition of her hard work, achievements and leadership within the insurance industry, Ms. Luck has been named Insurance Woman of the Year by the Assn. of Professional Insurance Women."Fiona is an exceptional woman in the insurance industry and a role model for all of us," said Maddy Lichtman, president of APIW and a senior vp with Marsh in New York.Ms. Luck said she is "honored and completely surprised. It makes me proud." She will receive the award at a reception and ceremony in New York on June 10.Like many others, Ms. Luck said, she was unexpectedly drawn to the insurance business. She holds a bachelor's degree in economics and finance from the University of Manchester in England and received a chartered accountancy designation from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland. While working as an accountant in London, she accepted an offer to work with Marsh in Bermuda.Ms. Luck held a variety of management positions over 14 years with the brokerage and was elected one of Marsh's youngest managing directors in 1992. She ran Marsh's global brokerage office in Bermuda from 1992 until 1997, when she joined ACE as senior vp of financial lines. She was promoted to executive vp the following year and joined XL Capital in her current post in 1999.Her strong technical background has been helpful as she has applied her skills to the insurance business, Ms. Luck said, noting that she  enjoys the problem-solving teamwork at XL. "When you see problems solved by good teams of people and you can be a part of it, there's a lot of satisfaction in that," she said."It's still a business that relies on relationships," she added, whether they be dealings with customers or colleagues, and that too is a fulfilling part of her work.Her job involves participation in many of XL's activities, from overseeing a new branding campaign, working on a professional development program to a host of others, and it is "incredibly stimulating," Ms. Luck said. "It's so varied," she said, "and I've been fortunate enough to develop skills to work in all these areas."She stays busy outside XL's offices as well.Ms. Luck is a government appointee to Bermuda's National Drug Commission, which last summer drafted a drug policy for the island. She also is a trustee of the Bermuda Biological Station, a job Ms. Luck says she particularly enjoys, having grown up as the daughter of a ship's captain.As the deputy campaign chairperson of the Masterworks Foundation, Ms. Luck helps in the group's efforts to repatriate works of art by Bermudian artists or acquire works by famous artists whose paintings featured the island. "It's a great foundation," she said. "I'm a big supporter."Looking ahead, Ms. Luck acknowledges that she is not much of a life planner. But, she adds, having traveled to XL's locations around the world and considering XL Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian M. O'Hara's vision for the company, "I think I've got plenty to keep me occupied. I'm very pleased to be where I am and have never worked where there is a greater degree of mutual respect."

You make your own luck.
 
Once upon a time in Ireland, the luck of the leprechauns roamed free across the land. There was plenty of it, too. But when the big people began to soak it up, the leprechaun king took his luck and left Ireland with nothing but want.
However, one very clever girl named Fiona sought to outsmart even the powerful magic of the leprechaun king. Through a series of tests that challenged her wits, Fiona proved she had no luck at all. For her troubles, she was given a wish for the exact value of her luck—nothing. Though it wasn’t much, nothing was all she needed to restore luck to the land and put the sparkle back in the Emerald Isle.
With a playful text and enchanting illustrations, lucky readers young and old will be charmed by Fiona’s wit and tenacity.

Editorial Reviews:

Babble
After a jealous leprechaun king steals all the luck, brave Fiona plots ways to outsmart him in order to get her people back some much needed luck of their own. A great story for both girls and boys about standing up to someone who is wrong, no matter how powerful.


Children's Literature
Is it better to be lucky or clever? ‘Tis a question that is asked over and over again, and here it is, once more, in a delightful tale. Long ago luck was free and plentiful in Ireland. When the big folk arrived in that country, they soon soaked up the luck, leaving little for the leprechauns. The leprechaun king would not stand for that and so he ordered all the luck to be gathered and hidden away. The big folk in Ireland soon ran out of eggs and milk, and "the potatoes rotted in the ground." Bring on a spunky heroine who has her wits about her and cleverly challenges the leprechaun king and you have a delightful original story reminiscent of the duels between humans and leprechauns in the traditional folktales of Ireland. Murphy captures the greens, browns, and golds of the Irish countryside in her softly muddied palette, while the leprechaun king's throne room glistens in jewel tones. The mountains, sheep, cottages, and stone walls form the background for the scenes of the "big people" at work, and the little people can be seen hiding behind stumps and sheep and other objects. Fiona's body language and facial expressions are just right for this tale of a battle of wits. It is perfect for a St. Patrick's Day story hour and just plain fun for the rest of the year. Lucky the children who read this cleverly composed story.


Kirkus Reviews
Like her Leprechaun Gold (1998), Bateman's latest exudes Irish flair. In this story, the leprechaun king, distraught because the newly arrived "big folk" have begun to soak up too much luck, has the leprechauns gather up all the luck they can find and lock it away in an oak chest so that he may distribute it as he pleases. With all the luck of the land under the control of the leprechaun king, the big folk suffer many hardships-until a clever woman named Fiona tricks him into putting a hole in the oak chest so that a steady stream of luck pours forth once again into the Irish air for all to share. Children will delight in the cunning way that Fiona triumphs over the leprechaun king, as well as in the rhythmic language of this well-told tale. Using acrylic, watercolor and gel medium, Murphy creates simple, angular figures and soft, rich backgrounds, a combination that perfectly accentuates the folksy charisma of Bateman's story. (Picture book. 5-9)


Publishers Weekly
A greedy leprechaun king gets his comeuppance at the hands of a clever lass in this plucky Irish folktale. Distressed that free-roaming leprechaun luck was being soaked up by all the "big folk" who had arrived in Ireland, the king of the leprechauns ordered all his people's luck to be gathered and locked in a hidden treasure chest. Alas, they went too far and Ireland suffered its worst luck ever in the form of the potato famine. In short order, a sharp young woman named Fiona hatches a plan to retrieve Irish luck from the leprechauns, a plan that involves outsmarting the wee king with inventive reasoning and a bit of playacting. Bateman's (The Ring of Truth) original story brims with the entertaining hallmarks of folklore and fairytales (e.g., magic, a test of wits, a wish granted). But her wordy writing style often slows the proceedings and may confuse younger readers trying to puzzle out the bargain between Fiona and her leprechaun foil. Murphy's (Boll Weevil Ball) textured mixed-media compositions, in a predominantly dusky palette, keep pace with the action. Freckle-faced Fiona's changeable expressions hint at her scheming and the lively sweet-faced leprechauns flit across the pages. Ages 4-8. (Feb.)

Executive Vp and Chief of StaffXL Capital Ltd.Hamilton, BermudaAge: 49 Following a career from 1983-1997 at broker Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc.where Fiona E. Luck was appointed managing director and head of Marshs global broking operations in Bermudaand then a two-year stint at ACE Ltd., she joined XL Capital Ltd. as executive vp-group operations in 1999. When XL earlier this year realigned some of its senior management, creating an Office of the CEO, Ms. Luck was named chief of staff. In this role, she is charged with overseeing all of the companys legal, marketing, human resources, corporate communications, corporate actuarial and corporate strategy functions, among other things.Q: Who has had the greatest influence on your career and why?A: "I was fortunate to have the three Bobs at Marsh who were great influences: Bob Clements, Bob Newhouse and Bob Redmond. Then I think of the influences of the two BriansBrian O'Hara of XL and Brian Duperreault at ACE. Obviously there have been great women influences in my life as wellmy mother; my grandmother; Ellen Throwera director on XL Capital Ltd.'s board; and Myra Tobin, who was the first woman managing director at Marsh."Q: What advice would you give young women entering the industry today?A: "There's a huge opportunity in the industry still for talented women. Having a professional designation whether it be an actuarial qualification, financial qualification, legal background, or an underwriting designation is really important. It gives you the opportunity to compete with anybody on a consistent basis. I would also advise that women not turn down any opportunity to expand their experience whether it is international or going into a different area. I would also advise women to learn to network with both men and women and to be willing to ask for help. It is not a sign of weakness. People are very willing to give it."Q: If you had the ability to change one thing about the industry what would it be?A: "If i had the ability to change one thing about the insurance industry, it would be to increase the level of awareness as to the importance of consistent professional development."

Distressed that free-roaming leprechaun luck was being soaked up by all the "big folk" who had arrived in Ireland, the king of the leprechauns ordered all his people's luck to be gathered and locked in a hidden treasure chest. Alas, they went too far and Ireland suffered its worst luck ever in the form of the potato famine. In short order, a sharp young woman named Fiona hatches a plan to retrieve Irish luck from the leprechauns, a plan that involves outsmarting the wee king with inventive reasoning and a bit of playacting. Bateman's (The Ring of Truth) original story brims with the entertaining hallmarks of folklore and fairytales (e.g., magic, a test of wits, a wish granted). But her wordy writing style often slows the proceedings and may confuse younger readers trying to puzzle out the bargain between Fiona and her leprechaun foil. Murphy's (Boll Weevil Ball) textured mixed-media compositions, in a predominantly dusky palette, keep pace with the action. Freckle-faced Fiona's changeable expressions hint at her scheming and the lively sweet-faced leprechauns flit across the pages. Ages 4-8. (Feb.)Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.


Children's Literature  - Sharon Salluzzo
Is it better to be lucky or clever? ‘Tis a question that is asked over and over again, and here it is, once more, in a delightful tale. Long ago luck was free and plentiful in Ireland. When the big folk arrived in that country, they soon soaked up the luck, leaving little for the leprechauns. The leprechaun king would not stand for that and so he ordered all the luck to be gathered and hidden away. The big folk in Ireland soon ran out of eggs and milk, and "the potatoes rotted in the ground." Bring on a spunky heroine who has her wits about her and cleverly challenges the leprechaun king and you have a delightful original story reminiscent of the duels between humans and leprechauns in the traditional folktales of Ireland. Murphy captures the greens, browns, and golds of the Irish countryside in her softly muddied palette, while the leprechaun king's throne room glistens in jewel tones. The mountains, sheep, cottages, and stone walls form the background for the scenes of the "big people" at work, and the little people can be seen hiding behind stumps and sheep and other objects. Fiona's body language and facial expressions are just right for this tale of a battle of wits. It is perfect for a St. Patrick's Day story hour and just plain fun for the rest of the year. Lucky the children who read this cleverly composed story.


Kirkus Reviews
Like her Leprechaun Gold (1998), Bateman's latest exudes Irish flair. In this story, the leprechaun king, distraught because the newly arrived "big folk" have begun to soak up too much luck, has the leprechauns gather up all the luck they can find and lock it away in an oak chest so that he may distribute it as he pleases. With all the luck of the land under the control of the leprechaun king, the big folk suffer many hardships-until a clever woman named Fiona tricks him into putting a hole in the oak chest so that a steady stream of luck pours forth once again into the Irish air for all to share. Children will delight in the cunning way that Fiona triumphs over the leprechaun king, as well as in the rhythmic language of this well-told tale. Using acrylic, watercolor and gel medium, Murphy creates simple, angular figures and soft, rich backgrounds, a combination that perfectly accentuates the folksy charisma of Bateman's story.
