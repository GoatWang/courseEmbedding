For centuiries before Ghanaian independence in 1957, Europeans had competed here for slaves and gold, bringing with them a mass of heraldry, from royal arms to regimental colors. the wonderful ingenuity with which the Fante combined the interlopers' pageantry with their own traditions resulted in spectacular banners still in use today in festivals and celebrations."

Additional charges will apply for heavier shipments, but not until the customer agrees. Canadian customers, please note that applicable sales taxes will be added.
