Description


Product Details




                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.
The Memorial Candle Program has been designed to help offset the costs associated with hosting this Tribute 
Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of Dana Jack Hamilton can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month


Candle will be lit for the limited time of one year


Candle will be lit indefinitely

Candle message preserved on the memorial site for perpetuity

Hamilton wrote I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together which has been performed by Burnett and by Branford Marsalis, among others.
Personal life[edit]

He married Carol Burnett on May 4, 1963. They had three children, including Carrie Hamilton, before divorcing in 1984.
