What is an 'Issuer'
An issuer is a legal entity that develops, registers and sells securities to finance its operations. Issuers may be corporations, investment trusts, or domestic or foreign governments. Issuers are legally responsible for the obligations of the issue and for reporting financial conditions, material developments and any other operational activities as required by the regulations of their jurisdictions.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Issuer'
      The most common types of securities issued are common and preferred stocks, bonds, notes, debentures, bills and derivatives. To illustrate the role of an issuer, imagine ABC Corporation sells common shares to the general public on the market to generate capital to finance its business operations. This means ABC Corporation is an issuer and is therefore required to file with regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), disclosing relevant financial information about the company. ABC must also meet any legal obligations or regulations in the jurisdiction where it issued the security. Writers of options are occasionally referred to as issuers of options because they also sell securities on a market.Issuers Versus InvestorsWhile the entity that creates and sells a bond or another type of security is referred to as an issuer, the individual who buys the security is an investor. In some cases, the investor is also referred to as a lender. Essentially, the investor is lending the issuer funds, which are repayable when the bond matures or the stock is sold. As a result, the issuer is also considered to be a borrower, and the investor should carefully examine the borrower's risk of default before buying the security or lending funds to the issuer.Credit Ratings of IssuersRatings firms such as Standard and Poor's and Moody's create credit ratings for issuers of debt securities, just as credit bureaus create credit profiles and scores for individual consumers. Rather than being expressed as a number like consumer credit scores, issuer scores are pegged to letters. For example, if an entity has a AAA rating, it has a history of repaying its debts and boasts a very low rate of default. Conversely, it an entity has a DDD rating, it is in default. Issuers with ratings of BB or below have their bonds labeled as junk, indicating that they pose a high risk of default for investors.Countries also receive credit ratings. For example, after Greece missed billions of dollars of loan repayments, its credit rating was downgraded to CCC+. However, after the country implemented reforms, cut costs and recapitalized its banks, Standard and Poor's increased its rating to B-, indicating that the company's bonds are a bit safer.

Bonds 





A bond is any interest-bearing or discounted government or corporate security that obligates the issuer to pay the bondholder a specified sum of money, usually at specific intervals, and to repay the principle amount of the loan at maturity. Bondholders have an IOU from the issuer, but no corporate ownership privileges, as stockholders do. 
A secured bond is backed by collateral which may be sold by the bondholder to satisfy a claim if the bond's issuer fails to pay interest and principal when they are due. An unsecured bond or debenture is backed by the full faith and credit of the issuer, but not by any specific collateral.

Corporate bonds are issued by corporations and are rated according to their quality. Corporate bonds typically pay higher interest rates than municipal or government bonds.
	Municipal bonds are issued by state, city and local municipalities. Municipal bond income is free from federal income taxes and may be exempt from state taxes when issued in the bondholder's state of residence.
	Convertible bonds are issued by corporations and can be converted to the company's stock at a prestated price.

This is a new Fund and therefore has limited performance to report. Performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so shares may be worth more or less when redeemed or sold. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Visit www.paceretfs.com for the most recent month-end performance.
*Source: US Bank and Bloomberg. ETF Implied liquidity is a representation of how many shares can potentially be traded daily in an ETF as portrayed by the creation unit. This is defined as the smallest value of the IDTS (Implied Daily Tradable Shares) for each holding in the creation unit.

**Calculation of Premium/Discount of Market Closing Price (or bid/ask midpoint) vs. NAV
NAV (net asset value) is the value of one share of the Fund calculated daily. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund. It may not reflect the actual return for the investor.

Market Price is the price investors can buy and sell ETF shares for in the stock market and is used to calculate market return. It is based on the price at the BATS exchange market close. This is when NAV is determined for most ETFs. If shares trade at another time, the return may differ. Market and NAV returns assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.

Cash Cows Index Strategy

Free cash flow is the cash remaining after a company has paid expenses, interest, taxes, and long-term investments. It can be used to buy back stock, pay dividends, or participate in mergers and acquisitions.
The ability to generate a high free cash flow yield indicates a company is producing more cash than it needs to run the business and can invest in growth opportunities.
Small-cap companies offer a variety of opportunities
including exposure to companies with higher growth
that are often under-researched.
Watch to learn more about how Pacer Cash Cows Index ETFs work.




Free Cash Flow Yield Comparison (as of 6/30/17)1
1. High Quality Small-Cap Companies
Unique focus on quality small-cap companies with high free cash flow yield.
 
2. Trading at a Discount
Exposure to opportunities in the market where high quality stocks are trading at a discount.

3. Long-Term Capital Appreciation
Using free cash flow yield to measure the sustainability of a company may produce potentially higher returns and more attractive upside/downside capture over time.


 

 
Definitions
Free Cash Flow (FCF): A company’s cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures (expenses, interest, taxes, and long-term investments)
Enterprise Value (EV): A company’s market capitalization adjusted to eliminate any capital structure bias (i.e. by adding debt and subtracting cash or cash equivalents)
Free Cash Flow Yield: FCF/EV. Measures a company’s total free cash flow relative to its enterprise value. This is an internal statistic and does not constitute investor yield.
Upside/Downside capture: Upside/downside capture ratio show you whether a given fund has outperformed--gained more or lost less than--a broad market benchmark during periods of market strength and weakness

(1)The individual components of the index are weighted by their total market capitalization. Market capitalization is determined by multiplying each company’s market price by their total outstanding shares. Companies are ranked in descending order based on their market cap in dollars.
(2)All financial companies are excluded from the index universe. In addition, companies with negative free cash flow (FCF) are excluded based on FactSet analyst consensus estimates for average projected FCF and earnings over the next two years.
(3)The 3-year dividend growth is a weighted average of each company’s 3-year dividends per share growth rate. The growth rate is determined by measuring the change between each company’s most recent trailing 12 month dividends per share versus their trailing 12 month dividend per share 3 years ago.
(4)Remaining 100 companies are weighted by their trailing twelve month free cash flow. Free cash flow weighting is calculated as a company’s operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Companies are ranked in descending order based on their free cash flow in dollars

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
