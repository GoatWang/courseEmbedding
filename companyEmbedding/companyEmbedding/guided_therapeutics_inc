About Us
Early Detection, Better Outcomes
Guided Therapeutics, Inc. has developed a platform technology for the early detection of disease that leads to cancer. Based on our patented biophotonic technology, the products use light to detect disease at the cellular level and provide painless and immediate results at the time of the examination.
Testing for cancer today usually involves a taking a tissue sample, like a biopsy, and sending it out to a specialist at a laboratory for results. Patients worry while waiting on test results and in many instances are given the wrong diagnosis – in most cases a false-positive result. A false positive diagnosis means the patient will undergo more testing only to discover later that they are healthy.
Our technology non-invasively scans the suspicious tissue with cool white light providing results, that studies have shown, can detect pre-cancer up to two years earlier than the tissue-sample method and with fewer false-positive results. This means less pain, no time waiting for results and fewer unnecessary treatments.
LuViva® Advanced Cervical Scan
LuViva has distribution in 47 countries, with U.S. FDA review underway.
Our first non-invasive cancer detection product is the LuViva® Advanced Cervical Scan. LuViva is in use in Canada, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa and is under premarket application (PMA) review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
LuViva is designed to determine the true likelihood of treatable cervical disease that may lead to cancer in women aged 16 years and over who have been screened for cervical cancer and have an abnormal result. About 80% or more women with an abnormal result at this point in the testing process will eventually be diagnosed as having a false positive result – but after having an unnecessary colposcopy and biopsy. A one-minute scan with LuViva can rule out about 40% of the false-positive cases immediately without the need for colposcopy and biopsy. LuViva has also been shown in clinical trials to identify disease up to two years earlier than colposcopy and biopsy.
LuViva has also shown promise as a potential screening tool in the developing world to be used where the Pap test or HPV test are not widely available.  A clinical trial is underway to expand LuViva’s capabilities as a non-invasive cervical cancer screening product.
Cervical Cancer is a Big, Global Problem
After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women’s health. It is a leading cause of cancer deaths in the developing world for women of childbearing age.
Incidence of Cervical Cancer Worldwide:

528,000 cases of invasive cancer (2012)
266,000 deaths (2012)

In the U.S.:

500,000 cases of precancer
12,360 cases of cancer annually (2014)
4,020 women will die from cervical cancer (2014)
55-60 million Pap tests annually
5.5-6 million follow-up referrals

Screening and diagnosis are effective but costly in developed regions of the world.  Common screening methods that lead to additional testing are positive for human papillomavirus (HPV) or an abnormal Pap test (cytology).
In developing regions, where screening methods are less commonly available, there is a different story.
“In sub-Saharan Africa, 34.8 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed per 100 000 women annually, and 22.5 per 100 000 women die from the disease. These figures compare with 6.6 and 2.5 per 100 000 women, respectively, in North America. The drastic differences can be explained by lack of access to effective screening and to services that facilitate early detection and treatment,” World Health Organization report.
Improving Cervical Cancer Detection with LuViva
Testing for cervical cancer today in the developed world involves taking a tissue sample – like a Pap test (cytology) for screening or a biopsy for diagnosis and sending the samples to a laboratory where they are read by a medical specialist. Results can take several days or weeks, delaying treatment and creating a time of uncertainty for the patient and her family.
In the developing world it’s a different story. Screening programs may be limited to a portion of the population in the larger cities with almost no screening is the rural areas.
LuViva can improve care in both situations.
In the Developed World:
Up to 80% or more of colposcopies and biopsies for for women who have abnormal Pap tests are found later to be normal or not necessary.  If HPV is used for screening those rates could go up.
Unmet Clinical Need for LuViva:  A non-invasive “triage” product to determine which patients that screen positive with Pap/HPV need a biopsy (true positives) and which don’t (normal or false positive).
In the Developing World:
Cervical cancer remains a leading cause of cancer death for women of childbearing age due to the lack of laboratory infrastructure.
Unmet Clinical Need for LuViva:  A non-invasive “screening” product that provides an immediate result in countries with little Pap/HPV screening.
Other Cancers
The platform technology that is LuViva can be applied to other forms or carcinoma. We’ve conducted human testing with the technology on patients at risk for esophageal cancer with promising results.  While a great deal more testing and development work needs to be done on that product, we believe that there is a need for our technology in the esophageal market.
Other cancers, in addition to cervical and esophageal, where the technology can be applied:

Head and Neck Cancer
Anal Cancer
Colorectal Cancer
Skin Cancer

Our Business Model
Our business model is based on sales of a device, in this case the LuViva® Advanced Cervical Scan and a single-use, disposable patient interface called the Cervical Guide.  The continuing revenue from the Cervical Guides provides value for our shareholders. The Cervical Guide provides calibration of the LuViva before each test and assures the patient of a cross-contamination free examination.
Read more about our value propositions.
The Guided Therapeutics LuViva® Advanced Cervical Scan is an investigational device and is limited by federal law to investigational use.

Guided Therapeutics to Develop Esophageal Cancer Product; Acquires Intellectual Property Rights from

Guided Therapeutics to Develop Esophageal Cancer Product; Acquires Intellectual Property Rights from Konica MinoltaNORCROSS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Guided Therapeutics, Inc. (OTCBB: GTHP) (OTCQB: GTHP), today announced it has acquired world-wide rights to develop a non-invasive esophageal cancer detection product from Konica Minolta. The product will be based on Guided Therapeutics' patented biophotonic technology platform.Under terms of the agreement, Guided Therapeutics acquired both the rights it had licensed to Konica Minolta, and the rights to certain intellectual property invented by Konica Minolta. Upon FDA approval, Konica Minolta would receive a royalty for its licensed intellectual property, if used in the final product. In addition, Guided Therapeutics will now have full worldwide sales and marketing rights, as opposed to a royalty only, as was anticipated under the previous arrangement."Konica Minolta has been an excellent partner in helping us to jump start the development of this promising early cancer detection technology, by contributing significant resources directly to Guided Therapeutics in the form of non-dilutive funding," said Mark L. Faupel, Ph.D., CEO and President of Guided Therapeutics. "The potential market for this product is significant and we believe that the best way to maximize shareholder value is to complete product development independently using the two companies' combined intellectual property. At the same time, we also reserve the option to partner with a new, more healthcare-focused company."Going forward, Guided Therapeutics will be responsible for the clinical, regulatory and product development process. Devices and other resources to be used for clinical trials, which could begin later this year, are already at or near completion. In order to complete development of the product, the company has made progress toward securing additional funding, which could come either from a new potential partner or other sources."Having access to the intellectual property necessary for commercializing the product, especially at this latter stage of its development, optimizes shareholder value in our platform technology," said Dr. Faupel. "The recent good news from FDA that our esophageal cancer detection product is a non-significant risk and does not require an investigational device exemption also supports this value proposition."According to the World Health Organization esophageal cancer ranks just below cervical cancer in newly diagnosed cases. New cases of esophageal cancer are estimated at 410,000 worldwide, with more than 16,000 new cases a year and more than 14,000 deaths in the U.S. alone. Barrett's esophagus is believed to be caused by excessive acid reflux.About The Technology PlatformThe Guided Therapeutics disease detection platform, which consists of a base unit and single-patient-use calibration disposable, scans tissue with light to identify cancer and pre-cancer painlessly and non-invasively. The proprietary, patented biophotonic technology is able to distinguish between normal and diseased tissue by detecting biochemical and morphological changes at the cellular level. Unlike traditional tests, the Guided Therapeutics test does not require laboratory analysis or a tissue sample, is designed to provide results immediately and eliminate costly, unnecessary testing.The first product developed from the technology is the LuViva® Advanced Cervical Scan. Unlike Pap, HPV tests or biopsies, LuViva does not require laboratory analysis or a tissue sample, and is designed to provide results immediately, which eliminates costly, painful and unnecessary testing. LuViva is designed for use with women who have undergone initial screening and are called back for follow up with a colposcopy examination, which in many cases, involves taking a biopsy of the cervix. The device is used in conjunction with the LuViva® Cervical Guide single-use patient interface and calibration disposable.About Guided TherapeuticsGuided Therapeutics, Inc. (OTCBB: GTHP) (OTCQB: GTHP) is developing a rapid and painless testing platform for the early detection of disease based on its patented biophotonic technology that utilizes light to detect disease at the cellular level. The Company's first planned product is the LuViva®Advanced Cervical Scan, a non-invasive device used to detect cervical disease instantly and at the point of care. In a multi-center clinical trial, with women at risk for cervical disease, the technology was able to detect cervical cancer up to two years earlier than conventional modalities, according to published reports. Guided Therapeutics is also developing a non-invasive test for the early detection of esophageal cancer using the technology platform. For more information, visit: www.guidedinc.com.The Guided Therapeutics LuViva®Advanced Cervical Scan is an investigational device and is limited by federal law to investigational use.

About Us
Early Detection, Better Outcomes
Guided Therapeutics, Inc. has developed a platform technology for the early detection of disease that leads to cancer. Based on our patented biophotonic technology, the products use light to detect disease at the cellular level and provide painless and immediate results at the time of the examination.
Testing for cancer today usually involves a taking a tissue sample, like a biopsy, and sending it out to a specialist at a laboratory for results. Patients worry while waiting on test results and in many instances are given the wrong diagnosis – in most cases a false-positive result. A false positive diagnosis means the patient will undergo more testing only to discover later that they are healthy.
Our technology non-invasively scans the suspicious tissue with cool white light providing results, that studies have shown, can detect pre-cancer up to two years earlier than the tissue-sample method and with fewer false-positive results. This means less pain, no time waiting for results and fewer unnecessary treatments.
LuViva® Advanced Cervical Scan
LuViva has distribution in 47 countries, with U.S. FDA review underway.
Our first non-invasive cancer detection product is the LuViva® Advanced Cervical Scan. LuViva is in use in Canada, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa and is under premarket application (PMA) review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
LuViva is designed to determine the true likelihood of treatable cervical disease that may lead to cancer in women aged 16 years and over who have been screened for cervical cancer and have an abnormal result. About 80% or more women with an abnormal result at this point in the testing process will eventually be diagnosed as having a false positive result – but after having an unnecessary colposcopy and biopsy. A one-minute scan with LuViva can rule out about 40% of the false-positive cases immediately without the need for colposcopy and biopsy. LuViva has also been shown in clinical trials to identify disease up to two years earlier than colposcopy and biopsy.
LuViva has also shown promise as a potential screening tool in the developing world to be used where the Pap test or HPV test are not widely available.  A clinical trial is underway to expand LuViva’s capabilities as a non-invasive cervical cancer screening product.
Cervical Cancer is a Big, Global Problem
After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women’s health. It is a leading cause of cancer deaths in the developing world for women of childbearing age.
Incidence of Cervical Cancer Worldwide:

528,000 cases of invasive cancer (2012)
266,000 deaths (2012)

In the U.S.:

500,000 cases of precancer
12,360 cases of cancer annually (2014)
4,020 women will die from cervical cancer (2014)
55-60 million Pap tests annually
5.5-6 million follow-up referrals

Screening and diagnosis are effective but costly in developed regions of the world.  Common screening methods that lead to additional testing are positive for human papillomavirus (HPV) or an abnormal Pap test (cytology).
In developing regions, where screening methods are less commonly available, there is a different story.
“In sub-Saharan Africa, 34.8 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed per 100 000 women annually, and 22.5 per 100 000 women die from the disease. These figures compare with 6.6 and 2.5 per 100 000 women, respectively, in North America. The drastic differences can be explained by lack of access to effective screening and to services that facilitate early detection and treatment,” World Health Organization report.
Improving Cervical Cancer Detection with LuViva
Testing for cervical cancer today in the developed world involves taking a tissue sample – like a Pap test (cytology) for screening or a biopsy for diagnosis and sending the samples to a laboratory where they are read by a medical specialist. Results can take several days or weeks, delaying treatment and creating a time of uncertainty for the patient and her family.
In the developing world it’s a different story. Screening programs may be limited to a portion of the population in the larger cities with almost no screening is the rural areas.
LuViva can improve care in both situations.
In the Developed World:
Up to 80% or more of colposcopies and biopsies for for women who have abnormal Pap tests are found later to be normal or not necessary.  If HPV is used for screening those rates could go up.
Unmet Clinical Need for LuViva:  A non-invasive “triage” product to determine which patients that screen positive with Pap/HPV need a biopsy (true positives) and which don’t (normal or false positive).
In the Developing World:
Cervical cancer remains a leading cause of cancer death for women of childbearing age due to the lack of laboratory infrastructure.
Unmet Clinical Need for LuViva:  A non-invasive “screening” product that provides an immediate result in countries with little Pap/HPV screening.
Other Cancers
The platform technology that is LuViva can be applied to other forms or carcinoma. We’ve conducted human testing with the technology on patients at risk for esophageal cancer with promising results.  While a great deal more testing and development work needs to be done on that product, we believe that there is a need for our technology in the esophageal market.
Other cancers, in addition to cervical and esophageal, where the technology can be applied:

Head and Neck Cancer
Anal Cancer
Colorectal Cancer
Skin Cancer

					Full Description



Guided Therapeutics, Inc., incorporated on October 27, 1992, is a medical technology company. The Company is focused on developing medical devices. The Company's primary focus is the sales and marketing of its LuViva Advanced Cervical Scan non-invasive cervical cancer detection device and extension of its cancer detection technology into other cancers, including esophageal. The Company's technology of LuViva primarily relates to the use of biophotonics for the non-invasive detection of cancers. The Company focuses on two primary applications for LuViva: first, as a cancer screening tool and second, as a triage. Its product, in addition to detecting the structural changes attributed to cervical cancer, is also detects the biochemical changes that precede the development of visual lesions.LuViva consists of three components: Touch screen monitor, Hand Held Unit (HHU) and the Wheeled Base. Touch screen monitor with touch control capabilities to input data and manage test procedure, is the user interface of the device. It is attached on a swing-arm mount to allow the operator to make necessary adjustments for viewing. Hand Held Unit houses the camera and spectrometer. With a control pad and a trigger switch it also allows the operator control for test management. The Cervical Guide is the disposable component of the LuViva system, which attaches to the HHU. Wheeled Base houses the devices computer and no-ozone Xenon arc lamp. The Cervical Guide is the disposable component of the LuViva system.LuViva is a technologically advanced diagnostic device that scans the cervix with light and uses spectroscopy to measure how light interacts with the cervical tissue. Spectroscopy identifies chemical and structural indicators of precancer that may be below the surface of the cervix or misdiagnosed as benign. This technique is called biophotonics. Unlike Papanicolaou (Pap), human papillomavirus (HPV) tests or biopsies, LuViva does not require laboratory analysis or a tissue sample, and provides results immediately, which may result in eliminating unnecessary additional testing. LuViva is intended for use with women who have undergone initial screening and are called back for follow up with a colposcopy examination, which in many cases, involves taking a biopsy of the cervix. It has also been used in clinical studies in Turkey and Nigeria as a means to screen women for cervical cancer. The device is used in conjunction with the LuViva Cervical Guide single-use patient interface and calibration disposable.The Company competes with Hologic, Qiagen and GlaxoSmithKline PLC.
