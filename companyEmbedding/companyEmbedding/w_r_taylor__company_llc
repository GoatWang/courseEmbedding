Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

BrightStar Credit Union


                                            When I refinanced my car with them I had a great experience.

Direct Auto Insurance


                                            The one star is generous! I purchased car insurance and paid 450.00 for the policy and had to cancel 3 days later and only received a refund for $220! These people are theives!! What kind of insurance is 230 dollars for 3 damn days! CROOKS!

                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?
