Home / Development initiatives  















We encourage initiatives that seek to move and transform society. We support projects aimed at the public administration and business developments, generating value for the country.Pelé MuseumThe Casarão do Valongo, located in Santos (SP), was restored to house the Pele Museum, creating jobs, boosting the economy, tourism and preserving Brazil’s heritage and memory.Rumo and Comgás, Cosan’s companies, sponsor the Pelé Museum through the Rouanet and the Proac Laws in support of the historic and cultural legacy development and actions supporting the community in which we operate.Besides having a full physical and digital collection, with records, objects, stories and more than 2,300 pieces about the history of the most famous soccer player in the country, Ama Brazil, the institution that developed the project, found new ways of engaging the Brazilian public, and foreigners, in the project.http://museupele.org.br/Movimento Brasil Competitivo (Competitive Brazil Movement)The Movimento Brasil Competitivo (Competitive Brazil Movement - MBC) was created in November 2001.Recognized as a Civil Society Organization of Public Interest (Organização da Sociedade Civil de Interesse Público - Oscip), the MBC helps to improve the quality of life of the population by increasing the country's competitiveness in a sustainable way.The movement provides concepts and tools, mobilizes public and private leadership, and disseminates knowledge to help achieve results.http://www.mbc.org.br/mbc/novoJuntos pelo Desenvolvimento Sustentável (Together for Sustainable Development)In order to engage with the demands of society and contribute to the development of the country, Cosan builds strategic partnerships with different sectors.
