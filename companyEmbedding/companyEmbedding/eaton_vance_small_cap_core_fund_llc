                EISMX: Eaton Vance's Highest Performing Fund            


    By Richard Best | Updated August 19, 2016 — 5:50 PM EDT    






Share


















































At least one fund is making the case for active fund managers in the active versus passive debate. Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund (“EISMX”) has consistently outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index over the one-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year periods dating back to 2006. It has also beaten the S&P MidCap 400 index and the Russell 2000 index over the same periods. The fund, which was launched in April 2002, has attracted more than $7 billion in assets under management (AUM) and has consistently ranked among the top 1% in its category. The fund is closed to new investors, and there are no plans to reopen it. Eaton Vance Corp. (NYSE: EV) has $302 billion in AUM.
Investment Strategy
The fund’s managers utilize a fundamental approach to identifying small- to mid-cap companies with strong financials that they believe are attractively valued relative to their earnings and cash flow. The fund invests primarily in a concentrated portfolio of domestic companies, with at least $1 billion of market capitalization characteristic of companies found in the Russell 2500 index. At just 17%, the turnover rate is low, indicating a tendency to buy and hold.
Investment Managers
Eaton Vance utilizes Atlanta Capital Management Co. LLC., a majority-owned subsidiary, as a sub-advisor for the fund. Charles B. Reed, who is a managing director and principal for Eaton Vance, has been a portfolio manager for EISMX since its inception. Prior to joining Eaton Vance, Reed was a portfolio manager for the Florida State Board of Administration (FSBA). Reed earned a Bachelor of Science in Finance from Florida State University, and is also a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) charterholder.
William O. Bell, IV is a principal of Atlanta Capital Management and has been a portfolio manager for EISMX since 2004. Bell also served as a portfolio manager for FSBA. He graduated from Florida State University with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Finance and is a CFA charterholder as well.
W. Matthew Hereford is a principal of Eaton Vance and has served as a portfolio manager for EISMX since 2004. Prior to joining Eaton Vance, Hereford was a portfolio manager for Invesco Ltd. Hereford earned a BA in international business from the University of Mississippi and is also a CFA charterholder.
Investment Portfolio
As of Feb. 29, 2016, the portfolio held a total of 49 stocks, 81.74% in mid-caps and 18.26% in small-cap. The heaviest weighting in the portfolio is industrials with 28.96%, followed by technology with 19.42% and health care with 17.98%. The rest of the portfolio is evenly weighted between financial services and consumer cyclical. 
Role in the Portfolio
Although its consistent performance and low volatility are characteristic of a core holding, EISMX may be more suitable as a supplemental growth holding due to its high portfolio concentration. It has shown a remarkable ability to capture more of the upside and less of the downside than most funds in its category, which could warrant a higher weighting in the portfolio.

About Eaton Vance
Eaton Vance offers a range of equity, income and alternative strategies to institutional investors on a global basis.



 

Investment management is our only business.
At Eaton Vance, our sole purpose is to manage investment assets — so we can focus on what our clients have engaged us for at all times. We are not subject to the changing priorities of a parent company with many subsidiaries. We make strategic business decisions that are good for our clients, not simply good for a larger entity’s bottom line.
Our ownership structure means we control our firm’s destiny.
We are a publicly traded company, with our most senior managers holding all voting shares. This not only aligns our interests with our clients’, but also allows us to be nimble as we identify new managers to bring on board and new opportunities to design strategies that address client needs.
Our broad range of investment strategies serves the needs of institutional investors.
Diversification and risk management are more important than ever for institutions that need to meet their objectives. From unique strategies for managing the volatility of global markets to innovative approaches to address the prospect of a rising interest rate environment, we help institutions build portfolios designed for the outcomes they require.
Our investment managers bring their specialized expertise to bear in an environment of independence.
Our institutional strategies are managed by proprietary and affiliated teams, each following its own approach. We bring clients seasoned experience in bottom-up fundamental investing and top-down macro investing, as well as engineered portfolio solutions.
We are committed to serving institutions and meeting their mandates.
Eaton Vance has been serving institutional investors for more than 75 years, and as of June 30, 2017, we managed $395.3 billion for corporate and public pension plans, Taft-Hartley plans, and foundations and endowments. We are committed to addressing the needs and concerns of institutions with our investment strategies as well as our dedicated teams of service professionals.

Small-Cap Core Strategy

Quarterly Strategy Profile(218.62 KB) 










 



Investment Overview




 
We seek above-benchmark performance through our quality-focused, bottom-up, fundamental investment discipline.


The strategy exploits inefficiencies in the small-cap market through bottom-up, fundamental research.


We look for what we believe to be high-quality companies with strong earnings growth, selling at a discount to peers and the overall market.


Market caps range from $250 million to $4.5 billion.


We seek out high-quality management, as well as a high level of conviction that management can execute.


Our process identifies catalysts for high reward/risk portfolio candidates.


Our dedicated resources include a 6-person team that also draws on research from our other equity and high yield teams.


The strategy has a proven track record of strong performance.


Target excess return: 3%-5%.







Portfolio Construction




 
40-60 securities in the portfolio


Target a 3% weight at cost


Position size greater than 4.5% will trigger a review


Maximum of 25% in one industry


Cash typically kept to less than 5% of the portfolio

The Fund
The Fund's bottom-up stock-picking approach aims to identify companies that the manager expects to achieve growth that exceeds the average of all publicly traded companies in the United States over the long term.



The Approach
We believe small-cap markets are becoming increasingly inefficient, so we seek to exploit this inefficiency with intensive fundamental research by searching for companies with experienced and proven management teams whose interests are aligned with inves tors.



The Features
Led by two portfolio managers with more than 35 years of collective investing experience and supported by a focused team of small-cap analysts. The team holds approximately 1,000 company meetings per year to construct a high conviction diversified portfo lio of quality small cap companies.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Max Sales Charge: 5.75%.

About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Smaller companies are generally subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, higher transaction costs and higher investment risk than larger, established companies. Investments in for eign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money inv esting in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

3. Net expense ratios reflect a contractual expense reimbursement that continues through 4/30/18. Without the reimbursement, if applicable, performance would have been lower.
6. The Morningstar Small Growth Category includes funds that invest primarily in U.S. small-cap companies with growth characteristics such as high earnings growth and high price ratios.
7. Alpha measures risk-adjusted performance, showing excess return delivered at the same risk level as the benchmark. Beta measures the volatility of a fund relative to the overall market. R-Squared represents the percentage of the portfolio's movement that  can be explained by the general movement of the market. Standard deviation measures the historic volatility of a fund. Sharpe Ratio uses standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk.
8. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 599 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term capital appreciation.




Strategy



Under normal market conditions, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of small-cap companies (the "80% Policy"). The market capitalization range for the Russell 2000® Index was approximately $9 million to $10.5 billion, and the market capitalization range for the S&P SmallCap 600 Index was approximately $51 million to $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2016.


Risk



The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The Russell 2000 Index is an unmanaged market capitalization-weighted index of 2,000 small company stocks of U.S. domiciled companies.
Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 Index is a market capitalization-weighted index of 600 small-capitalization stocks.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 09/02/2008.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 01/02/1997, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 9/2/2008.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 1/2/1997, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 9/2/2008.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 1/2/1997, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
9. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
11. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 4/30/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.
