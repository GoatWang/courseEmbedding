Download this Press Release ()

 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 29, 2013--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced that the company’s Board of
Directors has elected
Robert W. Matschullat
as Visa’s non-executive,
independent chair. The appointment is effective April 1, following the
retirement of executive chair
Joseph W. Saunders
, as planned. At the
same time, John Swainson’s term as Lead Director will end, and he will
return to his position as a member of the company’s Board.


Mr. Matschullat has been a Visa director since October 2007. He has
served as both Chairman and interim Chief Executive Officer of The
Clorox Company and is currently its Lead Director. He also served on the
boards of The Seagram Company Limited, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated
and of the McKesson Corporation. Mr. Matschullat currently serves on the
board of directors of The Clorox Company and The Walt Disney Company.


“I want to thank
John Swainson
for his service as Lead Director and his
exceptional stewardship in the 5 years since the board was created. As
for
Bob Matschullat
, he knows Visa well from his years of Board
service,” said Mr. Saunders. “He possesses a wealth of experience in
global consumer products and corporate finance that has been of great
benefit to the Board and the company. I have enjoyed working with Bob
and the rest of the Visa Board, and as a shareholder I am confident he
will be an effective partner with
Charlie Scharf
, our new CEO, as the
company pursues its global growth strategy.”

This release contains forward−looking statements within the meaning of
the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their
nature, forward-looking statements: (i) speak only as of the date they
are made, (ii) are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees
of future performance and (iii) are subject to risks, uncertainties,
assumptions and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
