Provides Business Outlook and Sets Corporate MilestonesPR NewswireSeptember 27, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareMONTCLAIR, N.J., Sept. 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Nexus BioPharma, Inc., (NEXS), a company specializing in the development of a weight loss drug therapy, today provided a business overview to outline the clinical status of its flagship weight loss product candidate currently in pre-clinical development for the treatment of obesity, and an overview of near-term corporate, business, clinical and regulatory milestones expected through 2017. "We have achieved notable progress this year on corporate, clinical and regulatory fronts, and I believe we are now rapidly heading into the most exciting time for Nexus BioPharma to date," said Warren C. Lau, Chief Executive Officer of Nexus BioPharma.Recent Corporate HighlightsPresented a poster in collaboration with Charles River Laboratories BioFocus at the Royal Society of Chemistry's "Kinase 2016: Next Generation Inhibitors" conference in Nottingham, UK. The poster entitled "Discovery of FYN inhibitors using the SoftFocus® screening library" described the discovery and development of small molecules targeting FYN kinase for a new approach to the treatment of obesity.Appointed Jeffrey Pessin, Ph.D. as Chairman of the Company's Scientific & Clinical Advisory Board. Dr. Pessin is the Judy R. & Alfred A. Rosenberg Professorial Chair in Diabetes Research and Director of the Diabetes Research Center, Department of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He also serves as Professor in the Departments of Medicine (Endocrinology) and Molecular Pharmacology.Appointed Daniel Einhorn, M.D. to the Company's Scientific & Clinical Advisory Board. Dr. Einhorn is medical director of the Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute, clinical professor of medicine (voluntary) at UC San Diego, president of Diabetes and Endocrine Associates, and associate editor of the Journal of Diabetes.Appointed of Helen Stefanovic as Director of Regulatory Affairs. She was previously Manager, Science Policy, Corporate Strategic Planning and Policy at Pfizer Inc, World Headquarters.Filed a New International Patent Application (PCT/US2016/050776) entitled "Methods, Compositions, and Uses of Novel FYN Kinase Inhibitors". The application covers composition of matter and methods of use for specific compounds in a number of chemical structure families for the treatment of a variety of conditions including weight loss, symptoms of type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer's Disease, and the symptoms of ageing.Put in place a funding arrangement for up to two million dollars at the currently prevailing market price with a European institutional investor."These achievements were transformational for Nexus BioPharma. The Company is fundamentally stronger than it ever has been, and we are positioned to strategically expand our pipeline of opportunities in the future," stated Mr. Lau.Mr. Lau added, "The key appointments of our Director of Regulatory Affairs, Helen Stefanovic, as well as the highly regarded Drs. Pessin and Einhorn to our Scientific & Clinical Advisory Board, position Nexus BioPharma at the forefront in the development of a new generation of safer and orally available weight loss therapeutics. Leveraging the strength and expertise of our expanded team will prove to be an integral factor in unlocking and building shareholder value, in both the short-term and long-term."Nexus' compounds for the Treatment of Obesity – Clinical Development OverviewThe Company also provided an update to its corporate progress and clinical status for its new generation, orally available weight loss therapeutic. Our mechanism of action is fundamentally differentiated from all FDA-approved weight loss drugs, with potential to drive a paradigm shift towards new generation safer and faster-acting weight loss drugs. Nexus BioPharma's development strategy is focused on establishing it as the primary option for overweight and obese individuals with inadequate response to standard, currently available prescription drugs, displacing them in the current obesity treatment paradigm. Nexus BioPharma expects to complete its pre-IND studies by the end of 2017.Pipeline Expansion OpportunitiesNexus BioPharma aims to expand its compounds into multiple additional indications beyond treatment of obesity -- to include treating symptoms of type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer's Disease, and ageing -- each representing potential blockbuster opportunities. Nexus is also evaluating opportunities to acquire or license synergistic obesity product candidates to expand its pipeline. Near-Term Milestones Expected to Drive ValueMeet with FDA for Preliminary Investigational New Drug application (Pre-IND) regarding Phase I study of weight loss compound as treatment for obesity in Q4 2016-Q12017;Commence study of a selection of compounds as a treatment for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in Q1 2017. Published studies (FYN Inhibition Rescues Established Memory and Synapse Loss in Alzheimer Mice, Annals of Neurology 2015; Jun;77(6):953-71; Adam C. Kaufman, et al) have shown that inhibition of FYN kinase in an animal model of AD can restore memories and increase synaptic density;Plan with FDA the company's application for Fast Track Designation for weight loss drug as a treatment for Prader Willi Syndrome in Q3 2017; andMeet the requirements and apply for full NASDAQ listing in Q2-3 2017."We fully intend to build upon the significant momentum we have created this year and will continue to focus on operational excellence as we drive our compounds towards clinical development and commercialization. We believe our weight loss therapeutic has the potential to be a game-changing therapy for individuals living with obesity where there remain significant shortcomings in current treatment alternatives, and we are committed to advancing our development programs in additional indications such as Alzheimer's Disease as rapidly as possible. Our weight loss drug will have an important role in the global weight loss market," Mr. Lau concluded.About Nexus BioPharma www.nexusbiopharma.com Nexus BioPharma, Inc. is developing a revolutionary new weight loss drug that works by adjusting the body's metabolism to increase the burning of fat by activating the AMPK metabolic pathway, the same pathway activated by intense physical exercise.The underlying biochemistry was described in an article in the journal Cell Metabolism by Claire C. Bastie, and Jeffrey E. Pessin, entitled "FYN-Dependent Regulation of Energy Expenditure and Body Weight Is Mediated by Tyrosine Phosphorylation of LKB1". Cell Metab. 2010 Feb 3;11(2):113-24In completed pre-clinical trials of the pharmaceutical activation of this pathway, test subjects showed reduced fat mass with no loss of lean muscle mass, plus a higher rate of energy expenditure, increased insulin sensitivity, increased fatty acid oxidation, improved plasma and tissue triglyceride levels, with lower cholesterol. Upon translation of this pharmaceutical activation to humans, these effects are expected to have a significant impact on obesity and diabetes.Read MoreUsing the most advanced high throughput screening technology, Nexus BioPharma has identified small molecule compounds in a number of discrete chemical structure families that can efficiently activate the pathway. The Company has filed for intellectual property protection on a selection of compounds in a number of discrete chemical backbones. The Company's goal is to advance to pre-IND trials in preparation for FDA human trials of a drug that will safely mimic this effect in humans.Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking InformationThis press release may contain certain "forward-looking statements" relating to the business of Nexus BioPharma, and its subsidiary companies.  All statements, other than statements of historical fact included herein are "forward-looking statements" including statements regarding: the impact of the proceeds from the private placement on the Company's short term business and operations,; the general ability of the Company to achieve its commercial objectives, including the ability of the Company to sustain growth; the business strategy, plans and objectives of the Company and its subsidiaries; and any other statements of non-historical information.

	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements







	November 30, 2016 and 2015




	(Unaudited)







	NOTE 1  NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN






	Nexus BioPharma, Inc. (we, our, NBP, the Company) was incorporated in Delaware on April 17, 2013. During this time the Company devoted substantially all of its efforts to activities such as financial planning and raising capital. The Company did not have any transactions from incorporation date through the period ended February 28, 2014.





	NBP is a life science company focused on the development and commercialization of a pharmaceutical preparation to treat obesity and the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.





	On February 1, 2016, the Company effected a 1 for 13.5 reverse stock split of its common stock. All share information in the financial statements for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 reflect the impact of the reverse stock split.







	Reverse merger







	On May 17, 2016 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (Merger Agreement) by and among Nexus Bio Pharma, Inc. a Nevada corporation (Nexus), the Company and Nexus Acquisition Corp. (Acquisition Corp.), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Nexus. The Merger Agreement closed on June 9, 2016 and resulted in the following:





	Acquisition Corp. merged with the Company with the latter as the surviving company in the merger. The Company shall continue its corporate existence under the name Nexus Biopharma, Inc.





	Each share of common stock of the Company prior to the merger converted into 4.8552632 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Nexus. Nexus then cancelled 35,500,000 shares of its common stock that were outstanding prior to the merger.





	The Companys stockholders shall receive convertible promissory notes corresponding to their proportional ownership interest of NBP common stock which shall be convertible into newly created shares of preferred stock of Nexus. The Nexus preferred shares shall be convertible into 36,000,000 shares of Nexus common stock. The convertible notes will be issued once Nexus has the preferred shares in place.





	The transaction is accounted for as a reverse acquisition and the Company is considered the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. The historical consolidated financial statements include the operations of the accounting acquirer for all periods presented.







	Basis of Presentation







	The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial statements. Accordingly, such interim financial statements do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete annual financial statements. The information furnished reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items which are, in the opinion of management, necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading. The balance sheet as of February 29, 2016 has been derived from the Companys annual financial statements that were audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required for complete annual financial statements. The financial statements included in this Quarterly Report should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Companys Report on Form 8-K filed on June 15, 2016.







	Going Concern







	These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has incurred losses since inception and has a working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about The Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Companys ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of its common stock. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.

	Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations






	You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including, without limitation, statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions or future strategies that are signified by the words expect, anticipate, intend, believe, or similar language. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the information set forth under the heading Risk Factors in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.






	Business Overview






	We are a life science company focused on the development and commercialization of a pharmaceutical preparation to treat obesity and the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. We believe that a drug that will step up the bodys metabolism of fat will address the biggest health problem in the world, obesity. Obesity is also implicated as a causative and an additive to a host of other conditions, the most important of which are Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Type II diabetes, which now consumes roughly one sixth of every health care dollar in America, is a direct result of obesity.





	For our first product opportunity we have engaged Charles River Laboratories for the discovery of a small molecule drug that activates metabolic pathways to increase energy expenditure. In completed animal trials our proprietary approach to the pharmaceutical activation of this LKB-1 AMPK (

	Adenosine Monophosphate dependent Protein Kinase)

	pathway resulted in increased energy expenditure, decreased fat mass and resulting weight loss, lower blood glucose, improved insulin sensitivity, lower cholesterol, and lower blood triglyceride levels.





	Unlike most other FDA approved weight loss drugs, our strategy does not depend on a pharmaco-neurological manipulation of the higher-brain centers for appetite and/or satiety. Rather, our proprietary drug approach targets the master energy regulatory pathway that has been proven to exist not only in higher mammals, but also in all living cells that possess a nucleus. Because an intensive aerobic and resistance strength-training regime is the natural way to activate these pathway effects, we believe that our drug will help obese patients mimic the effect of a more healthy lifestyle and lose weight.





	On November 16, 2017 we were selected to become a resident company at the Johnson & Johnson Innovation, JLABS facility at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, (JLABS @ TMCx). The Company has therefor relocated its headquarters to Houston, Texas as of February 1, 2016. The Company will begin by occupying office space and will later expand its physical operations to take advantage of the availability of laboratory facilities and equipment and especially the access to expertise and mentoring that make this a compelling opportunity for the Company.



	 




	Financial Operations Overview






	Upon commercialization of the Companys obesity therapeutic, we will begin working with third-party payors to establish reimbursement coverage policies. Where policies are not in place, we will pursue case-by-case reimbursement. We believe that as much as 20% of our future revenues may be derived from product(s) billed to Medicare. We will begin working with many payors, including Medicare, to establish policy-level reimbursement, which, if in place, will allow us to recognize revenues upon submitting an invoice. We do not expect to recognize the majority of revenues in this manner until calendar 2022, at the earliest.





	Since our inception, we have generated significant net losses. As of November 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $3,185,259. We incurred net losses of $137,915 and $159,182 in the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $576,912 and $1,073,355 for the nine months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect our net losses to continue for at least the next several years. We anticipate that a substantial portion of our capital resources and efforts will be focused on research and development, both to develop our initial obesity therapeutic and to develop additional products for obesity and type 2 diabetes, scale up our commercial organization, and other general corporate purposes. Our financial results will be limited by a number of factors, including establishment of coverage policies by third-party insurers and government payors, our ability in the short term to collect from payors often requiring a case-by-case manual appeals process, and our ability to recognize revenues other than from cash collections on therapeutics billed until such time as reimbursement policies or contracts are in effect. Until we receive routine reimbursement and are able to record revenues as therapeutics are prescribed and delivered, we are likely to continue reporting net losses.






	11











	Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates






	This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.





	We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.






	Revenue Recognition






	We have generated no revenues since our inception. Product revenues for our first product, our therapeutic for the treatment of obesity, are expected to be generated from the projected commercial launch in 2022, and are expected to be recognized on a cash basis because we will have limited collection experience and a limited number of contracts. In accordance with our policy, revenues for tests therapeutic prescribed will be recognized on an accrual basis when the related costs are incurred, provided there is a contract or coverage policy in place and the following criteria are met:





	·


	persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;


	·


	delivery has occurred or services rendered;


	·


	the fee is fixed and determinable; and


	·


	collectability is reasonably assured.





	Determination of the last two criteria will be based on managements judgment regarding the nature of the fee charged for products or services delivered and the collectability of those fees.





	We expect to generally bill third-party payors for our obesity therapeutic upon the filling of a patient prescription. Accordingly, we take assignment of benefits and the risk of collection with the third-party payor. We usually bill the patient directly for amounts owed after multiple requests for payment have been denied or only partially paid by the insurance carrier. As a new drug, our obesity therapeutic may be considered investigational by payors and not covered under their reimbursement policies. Consequently, we expect to pursue case-by-case reimbursement where policies are not in place or payment history has not been established.





	Contract revenues are expected to be derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and will be recognized on a contract specific basis. Under certain contracts, our input, measured in terms of full-time equivalent level of effort or running a set of assays through our laboratory under a contractual protocol, will trigger payment obligations and revenues will be recognized as costs are incurred or assays are processed. Certain contracts May have payment obligations that are triggered as milestones are complete, such as completion of a successful set of experiments. In these cases, revenues are recognized when the milestones are achieved.






	Clinical Collaborator Costs






	We expect to enter into collaboration and clinical trial agreements with clinical collaborators and record these costs as research and development expenses. We plan to record accruals for estimated study costs comprised of work performed by our collaborators under contract terms. All clinical collaborators will be expected to enter into agreements with us, which specify work content and payment terms.






	Results of Operations







	Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015







	Revenues

	. There were no revenues for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015, respectively, because we have not yet commercialized our obesity therapeutic.






	12











	Cost of Product Revenues

	. No cost of product revenues were recorded in the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015, respectively, because we have not yet commercialized our obesity therapeutic.






	General and Administrative Expenses

	. General and administrative expenses totaled $121,459 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 as compared to $51,247 for the three months ended November 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses totaled $530,875 for the nine months ended November 30, 2016 as compared to $854,520 for the nine months ended November 30, 2015. This represents an increase of $70,212 for the three months and a decrease of $323,645 for the nine months ended November 30, 2016. This increase for the three-month period was due in part to increased costs for legal, accounting and other professional costs in the 2016 period. The decrease for the nine-month period was due to a significant charge due to $625,000 of stock-based compensation in the 2015 period.






	Research and Development Expenses.

	 Research and development expenses were $7,500 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 as compared to $107,935 for the three months ended November 30, 2015. Research and development expenses were $23,904 for the nine months ended November 30, 2016 as compared to $218,835 for the nine months ended November 30, 2015. This represents a decrease of $100,435 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 over the three months ended November 30, 2015 versus a decrease of 194,931 over the nine-month period. This three-month and nine month decrease was primarily as a result of decreased R&D activities.






	Interest Expense, Net.

	We recorded $3 of interest income during the three months ended November 30, 2016 and $0 during the three months ended November 30, 2015. We recorded $8,959 of interest expense during the three months ended November 30, 2016 and $0 during the nine months ended November 30, 2015. We recorded $22,150 of interest expense during the nine months ended November 30, 2016 and $0 during the nine months ended November 30, 2015.






	Net Loss.

	As a result of the fact that we remain a development stage company with no product revenues as well as the other factors described above, we had a net loss of $137,915 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 as compared to $159,182 for the three months ended November 30, 2015 and we had a net loss of $576,912 for the nine months ended November 30, 2016 as compared to $1,073,355 for the nine months ended November 30, 2015.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses and, as of November 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $3,185,259. We have not yet achieved profitability and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our research and development, general and administrative and selling and marketing expenses will continue to grow and, as a result, we will need to generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability. We may never achieve profitability.






	Sources of Liquidity






	Since our inception, our operations have been financed through the sale of our common stock and issuance of debt. Through November 30, 2016, we had received net proceeds of approximately $310,801 through the sale of our common stock to investors. In December of 2015 and January of 2016 we entered into a Convertible Note Agreement with two investors for a total of $60,000. On April 20, 2016 we entered into an unsecured promissory note with Corelli Capital A.G. for the sum of $292,500. We entered into an Equity Line of Credit Agreement with Corelli Capital A.G. on July 12, 2016. As of November 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $302.






	Cash Flows






	As of November 30, 2016, we had $302 in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $0 on November 30, 2015.





	Net cash used in operating activities was $492,184 for the nine months ended November 30, 2016, compared to $22,052 for the nine months ended November 30, 2015. The increase in cash used was primarily due to increased operating expenses.





	Net cash used in investing activities was $9,939 for the nine months ended November 30, 2016, compared to $0 for the six months ended November 30, 2015. We expect amounts used in investing activities to increase in fiscal year 2017 and beyond as we expand research and development activities and establish our proposed commercial laboratory.





	Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended November 30, 2016 was $492,500, compared to $0 for the six months ended November 30, 2015. This is mainly due to proceeds received from notes payable and the equity line of credit with Corelli Capital A.G.






	13











	Contractual Obligations






	As of November 30, 2016, we had the following contractual commitments:





	We are required to make a series of annual minimum royalty payments under the License Agreement with Albert Einstein College of Medicine beginning on the first anniversary date, or March 3, 2015. The initial payment of $30,000, due March 3, 2015 was not made and the second annual payment, due March 3, 2016 was not made. As of the date of this filing the Company has received an advice that payment is due but no formal notice of default from Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The Company plans to pay these minimum royalty payments as soon as adequate funds are available.





	For a period of seven years on each anniversary of the first payment, we are required to make additional payments in amounts that gradually increase beginning in year five. We are required to make additional payments of $30,000 in each of 2017 and 2018 and $50,000 in 2019, $75,000 in 2020, and $100,000 in 2021 and every year the License is in effect thereafter.


	 


	We currently lease administrative and office space from JLABS @ TMCx at 2450 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77021 on a twelve month lease for an annual cost of $6,000.





	We had previously reported that beginning in the second half of calendar 2017, we had intended to enter into arrangements for the acquisition of laboratory equipment, computer hardware and software, leasehold improvements and office equipment. Because of our residence with JLABS @ TMCx, we will have access at a nominal increased lease cost to laboratory facilities and equipment and accordingly will no longer enter into separate arrangements for such equipment.



	 





	Item 3  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk



	 


	The Company is a smaller reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Act of 1934 and is not required to provide the information under this item.



	 





	Item 4 - Controls and Procedures



	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	The Companys Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective was due to the presence of the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) no segregation of duties in incompatible functions; and (ii) lack of controls over the financial process, specifically, there are no multiple levels of review. Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the material weaknesses are remediated.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	We have not made a change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MONTCLAIR, N.J., Sept. 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Nexus BioPharma, Inc., (OTC-BB: NEXS), a company specializing in the development of a weight loss drug therapy, today provided a business overview to outline the clinical status of its flagship weight loss product candidate currently in pre-clinical development for the treatment of obesity, and an overview of near-term corporate, business, clinical and regulatory milestones expected through 2017.  








"We have achieved notable progress this year on corporate, clinical and regulatory fronts, and I believe we are now rapidly heading into the most exciting time for Nexus BioPharma to date," said Warren C. Lau, Chief Executive Officer of Nexus BioPharma.
Recent Corporate Highlights

Presented a poster in collaboration with Charles River Laboratories BioFocus at the Royal Society of Chemistry's "Kinase 2016: Next Generation Inhibitors" conference in Nottingham, UK. The poster entitled "Discovery of FYN inhibitors using the SoftFocus® screening library" described the discovery and development of small molecules targeting FYN kinase for a new approach to the treatment of obesity. 
Appointed Jeffrey Pessin, Ph.D. as Chairman of the Company's Scientific & Clinical Advisory Board. Dr. Pessin is the Judy R. & Alfred A. Rosenberg Professorial Chair in Diabetes Research and Director of the Diabetes Research Center, Department of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He also serves as Professor in the Departments of Medicine (Endocrinology) and Molecular Pharmacology. 
Appointed Daniel Einhorn, M.D. to the Company's Scientific & Clinical Advisory Board. Dr. Einhorn is medical director of the Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute, clinical professor of medicine (voluntary) at UC San Diego, president of Diabetes and Endocrine Associates, and associate editor of the Journal of Diabetes. 
Appointed of Helen Stefanovic as Director of Regulatory Affairs. She was previously Manager, Science Policy, Corporate Strategic Planning and Policy at Pfizer Inc, World Headquarters. 
Filed a New International Patent Application (PCT/US2016/050776) entitled "Methods, Compositions, and Uses of Novel FYN Kinase Inhibitors". The application covers composition of matter and methods of use for specific compounds in a number of chemical structure families for the treatment of a variety of conditions including weight loss, symptoms of type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer's Disease, and the symptoms of ageing. 
Put in place a funding arrangement for up to two million dollars at the currently prevailing market price with a European institutional investor.
"These achievements were transformational for Nexus BioPharma. The Company is fundamentally stronger than it ever has been, and we are positioned to strategically expand our pipeline of opportunities in the future," stated Mr. Lau.
Mr. Lau added, "The key appointments of our Director of Regulatory Affairs, Helen Stefanovic, as well as the highly regarded Drs. Pessin and Einhorn to our Scientific & Clinical Advisory Board, position Nexus BioPharma at the forefront in the development of a new generation of safer and orally available weight loss therapeutics. Leveraging the strength and expertise of our expanded team will prove to be an integral factor in unlocking and building shareholder value, in both the short-term and long-term." 
Nexus' compounds for the Treatment of Obesity – Clinical Development Overview 
The Company also provided an update to its corporate progress and clinical status for its new generation, orally available weight loss therapeutic. Our mechanism of action is fundamentally differentiated from all FDA-approved weight loss drugs, with potential to drive a paradigm shift towards new generation safer and faster-acting weight loss drugs. Nexus BioPharma's development strategy is focused on establishing it as the primary option for overweight and obese individuals with inadequate response to standard, currently available prescription drugs, displacing them in the current obesity treatment paradigm. Nexus BioPharma expects to complete its pre-IND studies by the end of 2017.
Pipeline Expansion Opportunities
Nexus BioPharma aims to expand its compounds into multiple additional indications beyond treatment of obesity -- to include treating symptoms of type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer's Disease, and ageing -- each representing potential blockbuster opportunities.  
Nexus is also evaluating opportunities to acquire or license synergistic obesity product candidates to expand its pipeline.  
Near-Term Milestones Expected to Drive Value

Meet with FDA for Preliminary Investigational New Drug application (Pre-IND) regarding Phase I study of weight loss compound as treatment for obesity in Q4 2016-Q12017; 
Commence study of a selection of compounds as a treatment for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in Q1 2017. Published studies (FYN Inhibition Rescues Established Memory and Synapse Loss in Alzheimer Mice, Annals of Neurology 2015; Jun;77(6):953-71; Adam C. Kaufman, et al) have shown that inhibition of FYN kinase in an animal model of AD can restore memories and increase synaptic density; 
Plan with FDA the company's application for Fast Track Designation for weight loss drug as a treatment for Prader Willi Syndrome in Q3 2017; and 
Meet the requirements and apply for full NASDAQ listing in Q2-3 2017.
"We fully intend to build upon the significant momentum we have created this year and will continue to focus on operational excellence as we drive our compounds towards clinical development and commercialization. We believe our weight loss therapeutic has the potential to be a game-changing therapy for individuals living with obesity where there remain significant shortcomings in current treatment alternatives, and we are committed to advancing our development programs in additional indications such as Alzheimer's Disease as rapidly as possible. Our weight loss drug will have an important role in the global weight loss market," Mr. Lau concluded.
About Nexus BioPharma www.nexusbiopharma.com 
Nexus BioPharma, Inc. is developing a revolutionary new weight loss drug that works by adjusting the body's metabolism to increase the burning of fat by activating the AMPK metabolic pathway, the same pathway activated by intense physical exercise. 
The underlying biochemistry was described in an article in the journal Cell Metabolism by Claire C. Bastie, and Jeffrey E. Pessin, entitled "FYN-Dependent Regulation of Energy Expenditure and Body Weight Is Mediated by Tyrosine Phosphorylation of LKB1". Cell Metab. 2010 Feb 3;11(2):113-24
In completed pre-clinical trials of the pharmaceutical activation of this pathway, test subjects showed reduced fat mass with no loss of lean muscle mass, plus a higher rate of energy expenditure, increased insulin sensitivity, increased fatty acid oxidation, improved plasma and tissue triglyceride levels, with lower cholesterol. Upon translation of this pharmaceutical activation to humans, these effects are expected to have a significant impact on obesity and diabetes.
Using the most advanced high throughput screening technology, Nexus BioPharma has identified small molecule compounds in a number of discrete chemical structure families that can efficiently activate the pathway. The Company has filed for intellectual property protection on a selection of compounds in a number of discrete chemical backbones. The Company's goal is to advance to pre-IND trials in preparation for FDA human trials of a drug that will safely mimic this effect in humans.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

America’s biopharmaceutical companies are driving the future of medicine through bold advances in genomics, personalized medicine and immunotherapy. The new era of genomics provides better understanding of the genes that can cause certain diseases and equips researchers with the tools they need to tailor treatments like never before. Personalized medicines are at the center of this revolution, offering patients individualized therapies unique to each patient. Immunotherapy is transforming cancer care in new ways by harnessing the patient’s immune system to eliminate the disease or slow its growth. Together, these advancements are helping patients live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

Personalized Medicine
Personalized medicine — sometimes referred to as precision or individualized medicine —is an emerging field of medicine that uses diagnostic tools to identify specific biological markers, often genetic, to help assess which medical treatments and procedures will be best for each patient.
