Available in-store and online, "Close to Home" shops feature locally-sourced and themed products many of which are hand-crafted or upcycled. Bon-Ton launched its first Online Sourcing Fair in March as part an ongoing effort to provide shoppers with a broader selection of local products by developing more relationships with area makers in communities they serve. 

The retailer vetted applications in more than a dozen product categories with jewelry, artwork, home d�cor, kitchen and bar, apparel, and accessories topping the list. From jewelry made out of guitar strings in Iowa to wall d�cor in the shape of winter skis in Minnesota, submissions came from nearly two dozen states. Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Illinois and New York fielded the most. Bon-Ton is considering about a third of those who applied and will start in late June to introduce new product selections in stores.  Many of the makers have an active social media presence and an engaged following.

�Our regional merchandising teams were overwhelmed by the level of interest and depth of creativity and quality represented in the submissions," said Chad Stauffer, Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising Officer for The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. �With a growing base of local makers, customers can look forward to an elevated hometown shopping assortment with true local flavor in our �Close to Home� shops.  We can�t wait to showcase the new products from these talented new artisans in our stores.�

Since opening in 45 stores in fall 2016, Bon-Ton has more than tripled the number of �Close to Home� shops to 148 in 14 states. �Close to Home� shops offer new items frequently and seasonally to provide shoppers with a fun, fresh and unique product selection. Including the latest round of makers selected, the �Close to Home� initiative has provided more than 340 small businesses with the opportunity to sell products in a major department store. The �Close to Home� initiative is part of Bon-Ton�s broader commitment to support the communities where its stores are located.

The retailer will once again accept product submissions from applicants with established businesses and galleries for its next Online Sourcing Fair starting July 18, 2017 through August 31, 2017 at closetohome.bonton.com. Interested applicants must reside in one of Bon-Ton's 25 states to apply for this exclusive opportunity. The retailer is especially interested in submissions from Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Utah and West Virginia.

As retailers close brick-and-mortar stores nationwide, The Bon-Ton Stores Inc. has made several leadership and store portfolio changes within the past few years.The Bon-Ton Stores, with corporate headquarters in York, Penn. and Milwaukee, Wis., operates 261 stores, which includes nine furniture galleries and four clearance centers in 25 states. Elder-Beerman, owned by Bon-Ton, has a major presence within the Dayton region.

Here’s what you need to know about the future of Elder-Beerman and Bon-Ton Stores:
1. STORE CLOSURES
Elder-Beerman hasn’t stayed immune to the retail apocalypse. In June, Bon-Ton announced it will close its Bon-Ton store at Maine Mall in South Portland, Maine at the end of August — laying off 55 employees. Bon-Ton also announced it would close a store location at the Ohio Valley Mall in St. Clairsville, Ohio in late March. That closure impacted 46 employees.“Bon-Ton evaluates its store portfolio on an ongoing basis to determine our stores long-term viability,” said Steve Byers, executive vice president of stores for Bon-Ton. “Closing a store is never an easy decision and would like to thank the customers who have shopped with Bon-Ton as well as our store associates for their dedication and friendly customer service.”
» RELATED: Elder-Beerman adds online pick-up service
Locally, Bon-Ton closed its Elder-Beerman store in Towne Mall Galleria in Middletown in January. The company did not renew its lease, which ended on Jan. 31. That closure impacted 65 employees.
2. LEADERSHIP CHANGES
In May, Bon-Ton’s president and CEO Kathryn Bufano resigned effective on Aug. 25. Once her contract expires, the company’s current chief operating officer William Tracy will take over as president and CEO. The company also named Chad Stauffer as the new chief merchandising officer.“I am very pleased to announce [Tracy]’s promotion to president and CEO. [Tracy] is a proven leader with more than 40 years of retail experience in the areas of operations, supply chain management and logistics for national department stores,” said Tim Grumbacher, board chairman.
3. SELLING LOCAL PRODUCTS
Elder-Beerman is also trying to lure customers in by selling locally made products in stores nationwide. Elder-Beerman opened new in-store “Close to Home” shops in Dayton that feature products from local makers and artists.These in-store shops deliver customers a hometown shopping experience that reflects tastes and preferences of its local communities. From September through December, shop sales more than doubled company projections.
» STORE CLOSINGS: What’s really going on?

4. FISCAL CHALLENGES
The Bon-Ton Stores Inc. reported poor sales again during the first quarter fiscal results for the year. Comparable store sales decreased by nearly 9 percent compared to the same time in 2016. Net loss in the first quarter was more than $57 million, compared with the net loss of $37.8 million in the first quarter of 2016.“Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends, unfavorable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift,” Bufano said.
5. HOLIDAY SEASON
The Bon-Ton stores will start to prepare for the major holiday retail season, which starts in late October. Last year, the company hired for approximately 13,000 seasonal positions. Bon-Ton is also looked to hire an additional 500 additional employees for its distribution centers and its e-commerce fulfillment center.

Retailer Selects 400 for Final Consideration as it Expands "Close To Home" Shops and Increases Local Product Offerings






MILWAUKEE, June 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: BONT), which operates Bon-Ton, Bergner's, Boston Store, Carson's, Elder-Beerman, Herberger's and Younkers stores, announced today that more than 1,250 artists, designers, makers, artisans and entrepreneurs submitted applications to the retailer's first Online Sourcing Fair. The number far exceeded expectations as Bon-Ton continues to cultivate local partnerships and source new and unique merchandise to sell in its expanding number of "Close to Home" shops. 



Available in-store and online, "Close to Home" shops feature locally-sourced and themed products many of which are hand-crafted or upcycled. Bon-Ton launched its first Online Sourcing Fair in March as part of an ongoing effort to provide shoppers with a broader selection of local products by developing more relationships with area makers in communities they serve.  
The retailer vetted applications in more than a dozen product categories with jewelry, artwork, home décor, kitchen and bar, apparel, and accessories topping the list. From jewelry made out of guitar strings in Iowa to wall décor in the shape of winter skis in Minnesota, submissions came from nearly two dozen states. Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Illinois and New York fielded the most. Bon-Ton is considering about a third of those who applied and will start in late June to introduce new product selections in stores.  Many of the makers have an active social media presence and an engaged following. 
"Our regional merchandising teams were overwhelmed by the level of interest and depth of creativity and quality represented in the submissions," said Chad Stauffer, Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising Officer for The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. "With a growing base of local makers, customers can look forward to an elevated hometown shopping assortment with true local flavor in our "Close to Home" shops.  We can't wait to showcase the new products from these talented new artisans in our stores." 
Since opening in 45 stores in fall 2016, Bon-Ton has more than tripled the number of "Close to Home" shops to 148 in 14 states. "Close to Home" shops offer new items frequently and seasonally to provide shoppers with a fun, fresh and unique product selection. Including the latest round of makers selected, the "Close to Home" initiative has provided more than 340 small businesses with the opportunity to sell products in a major department store. The "Close to Home" initiative is part of Bon-Ton's broader commitment to support the communities where its stores are located. 
The retailer will once again accept product submissions from applicants with established businesses and galleries for its next Online Sourcing Fair starting July 18, 2017 through August 31, 2017 at closetohome.bonton.com. Interested applicants must reside in one of Bon-Ton's 25 states to apply for this exclusive opportunity. The retailer is especially interested in submissions from Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Utah and West Virginia.

History[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
The Bon-Ton was started in 1898, when Max Grumbacher and his father, Samuel, opened S. Grumbacher & Son, a one-room millinery and dry goods store on Market Street in York, Pennsylvania. The store's name was drawn from a British term connoting the "elite" or "high society."
As automobiles replaced horses and the country became more industrialized, through World War I and the Roaring Twenties, the Grumbachers continued to meet their customers' needs. The store grew bigger and, in 1929, the company was incorporated as S. Grumbacher & Son, Inc. In 1931, Max's son, Max Samuel (M.S.), joined the company. When Max the elder died in 1933, his widow, Daisy, and their two sons, M.S. and Richard, continued the business, forming a partnership in 1936.
This was a popular store destination on the classic radio show Fibber McGee and Molly, which aired from 1935 to 1959.
Following World War II, the Grumbacher family decided to expand operations. In 1946, a second Bon-Ton was opened, in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Two years later, the company moved outside Pennsylvania, acquiring Eyerly's in Hagerstown, Maryland, and, in 1957, purchasing McMeen's in Lewistown, Pennsylvania. These early moves set The Bon-Ton's policy of growing into adjacent areas by opening new stores and acquiring existing businesses.
Expansion[edit]
During the next three decades, the Bon-Ton Stores continued to expand. In 1961, M.S.'s son, M. Thomas "Tim," entered the business, representing the fourth generation of Grumbachers. During the 1960s, the company opened new Eyerly's and Bon-Ton stores in several Pennsylvania communities and one in West Virginia. They also started a discount chain, Mailman's, and in 1969, retired the McMeen's name. During the 1970s, as the popularity of shopping centers began to grow, The Bon-Ton opened 11 new stores in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
The 1980s formed a period of rapid consolidation in the retail department store industry as major chains bought their competitors. The Bon-Ton Stores began the decade by opening more stores, establishing a new division, Maxwell's, and acquiring Fowler's department store in New York. When Tim Grumbacher was made CEO in 1985, the company operated 18 stores in four states. Two years later, the company made a major move, buying the 11-store Pomeroy's chain from Allied Department Stores. That purchase made it possible for the company to move into seven new markets in Pennsylvania. In 1991, The Bon-Ton acquired J.W. Rhodes in Ithaca, NY. The Bon-Ton entered the Lancaster, PA market in 1992 with the acquisition of two Watt & Shand locations in downtown Lancaster and Park City Center. The company continued to expand its New York presence in 1993 with a store in the Wilton Mall in Saratoga Springs in the former Addis & Dey's space.
In July 1994, The Bon-Ton purchased the 127-year-old Adam, Meldrum, and Anderson Company chain based in Buffalo, New York, for $42.6 million. Around the same time, The Bon-Ton also purchased Chappell's of Syracuse, New York and Hess's of Allentown, Pennsylvania. The Bon-Ton initially retained and operated Hess's flagship location until 1996, when it closed after nearly 100 years of continuous operation. The site was eventually demolished. Its current Allentown store, Hess's former south Allentown location, is the anchor of the South Mall. In 1995, The Bon-Ton entered the Rochester, NY market in three former McCurdy's locations, as well as in a former McCurdy's space in Elmira. In the following spring, the company opened a fourth Rochester location in a former Sibley's location. In March 1995, The Bon-Ton closed the landmark downtown Lancaster store. Later that year, they also closed the downtown AM&A's location. 1998's expansion included a new store in Westfield, Massachusetts, making it The Bon-Ton Stores' first entry into the New England area.
Operations in 2000s[edit]

In October 2003, The Bon-Ton would expand its reach into Ohio and the lower Midwest with the acquisition of the 69 store Elder-Beerman store chain. Following an attempt to convert to a privately held company, Elder-Beerman was offered more cash for its outstanding stock as part of the buyout. The chain currently continues as a separate nameplate.
On November 25, 2003, Bon-Ton reported a net loss in the third quarter of $1.7 million, or $0.11 per share, including an asset impairment charge of $0.10 per share,.[5]
The Bon-Ton Stores chain doubled in size in November 2005 with the $1.1 billion purchase of the 142 stores of Saks' Northern Department Store Group, headquartered in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Corporate headquarters remained in York, PA, but merchandising headquarters were relocated to Milwaukee. As with the Elder-Beerman acquisition, no store names were changed in the transaction. The newly acquired store group included Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's, Boston Store, Herberger's, and Younkers.[6]
In September 2006, The Bon-Ton purchased four former Parisian stores (plus one under construction) from Belk (which had just purchased the chain); the stores were located in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio (outside Belk's traditional operating territory). The three Michigan stores maintained the Parisian name as Belk rebranded the stores it retained under its own name; the Ohio and Indiana stores were rebranded under other names.
In December 2013, Mike Nemoir, senior vice-president, announced he would retire after four decades in the fashion industry at Bon-Ton and its predecessor companies on March 28, 2014.[7]

Why are you launching an online local sourcing fair?
We are always looking for new makers, artisans and designers and unique products for our customers and community.

How many new vendors will be selected?

How will vendors be selected?
Vendors will be reviewed based on geographical proximity to our stores, product category, product assortment, price point, uniqueness, quality as well as if the product is locally sourced or locally made.

History[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
The Bon-Ton was started in 1898, when Max Grumbacher and his father, Samuel, opened S. Grumbacher & Son, a one-room millinery and dry goods store on Market Street in York, Pennsylvania. The store's name was drawn from a British term connoting the "elite" or "high society."
As automobiles replaced horses and the country became more industrialized, through World War I and the Roaring Twenties, the Grumbachers continued to meet their customers' needs. The store grew bigger and, in 1929, the company was incorporated as S. Grumbacher & Son, Inc. In 1931, Max's son, Max Samuel (M.S.), joined the company. When Max the elder died in 1933, his widow, Daisy, and their two sons, M.S. and Richard, continued the business, forming a partnership in 1936.
This was a popular store destination on the classic radio show Fibber McGee and Molly, which aired from 1935 to 1959.
Following World War II, the Grumbacher family decided to expand operations. In 1946, a second Bon-Ton was opened, in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Two years later, the company moved outside Pennsylvania, acquiring Eyerly's in Hagerstown, Maryland, and, in 1957, purchasing McMeen's in Lewistown, Pennsylvania. These early moves set The Bon-Ton's policy of growing into adjacent areas by opening new stores and acquiring existing businesses.
Expansion[edit]
During the next three decades, the Bon-Ton Stores continued to expand. In 1961, M.S.'s son, M. Thomas "Tim," entered the business, representing the fourth generation of Grumbachers. During the 1960s, the company opened new Eyerly's and Bon-Ton stores in several Pennsylvania communities and one in West Virginia. They also started a discount chain, Mailman's, and in 1969, retired the McMeen's name. During the 1970s, as the popularity of shopping centers began to grow, The Bon-Ton opened 11 new stores in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
The 1980s formed a period of rapid consolidation in the retail department store industry as major chains bought their competitors. The Bon-Ton Stores began the decade by opening more stores, establishing a new division, Maxwell's, and acquiring Fowler's department store in New York. When Tim Grumbacher was made CEO in 1985, the company operated 18 stores in four states. Two years later, the company made a major move, buying the 11-store Pomeroy's chain from Allied Department Stores. That purchase made it possible for the company to move into seven new markets in Pennsylvania. In 1991, The Bon-Ton acquired J.W. Rhodes in Ithaca, NY. The Bon-Ton entered the Lancaster, PA market in 1992 with the acquisition of two Watt & Shand locations in downtown Lancaster and Park City Center. The company continued to expand its New York presence in 1993 with a store in the Wilton Mall in Saratoga Springs in the former Addis & Dey's space.
In July 1994, The Bon-Ton purchased the 127-year-old Adam, Meldrum, and Anderson Company chain based in Buffalo, New York, for $42.6 million. Around the same time, The Bon-Ton also purchased Chappell's of Syracuse, New York and Hess's of Allentown, Pennsylvania. The Bon-Ton initially retained and operated Hess's flagship location until 1996, when it closed after nearly 100 years of continuous operation. The site was eventually demolished. Its current Allentown store, Hess's former south Allentown location, is the anchor of the South Mall. In 1995, The Bon-Ton entered the Rochester, NY market in three former McCurdy's locations, as well as in a former McCurdy's space in Elmira. In the following spring, the company opened a fourth Rochester location in a former Sibley's location. In March 1995, The Bon-Ton closed the landmark downtown Lancaster store. Later that year, they also closed the downtown AM&A's location. 1998's expansion included a new store in Westfield, Massachusetts, making it The Bon-Ton Stores' first entry into the New England area.
Operations in 2000s[edit]

In October 2003, The Bon-Ton would expand its reach into Ohio and the lower Midwest with the acquisition of the 69 store Elder-Beerman store chain. Following an attempt to convert to a privately held company, Elder-Beerman was offered more cash for its outstanding stock as part of the buyout. The chain currently continues as a separate nameplate.
On November 25, 2003, Bon-Ton reported a net loss in the third quarter of $1.7 million, or $0.11 per share, including an asset impairment charge of $0.10 per share,.[5]
The Bon-Ton Stores chain doubled in size in November 2005 with the $1.1 billion purchase of the 142 stores of Saks' Northern Department Store Group, headquartered in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Corporate headquarters remained in York, PA, but merchandising headquarters were relocated to Milwaukee. As with the Elder-Beerman acquisition, no store names were changed in the transaction. The newly acquired store group included Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's, Boston Store, Herberger's, and Younkers.[6]
In September 2006, The Bon-Ton purchased four former Parisian stores (plus one under construction) from Belk (which had just purchased the chain); the stores were located in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio (outside Belk's traditional operating territory). The three Michigan stores maintained the Parisian name as Belk rebranded the stores it retained under its own name; the Ohio and Indiana stores were rebranded under other names.
In December 2013, Mike Nemoir, senior vice-president, announced he would retire after four decades in the fashion industry at Bon-Ton and its predecessor companies on March 28, 2014.[7]

History[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
The Bon-Ton was started in 1898, when Max Grumbacher and his father, Samuel, opened S. Grumbacher & Son, a one-room millinery and dry goods store on Market Street in York, Pennsylvania. The store's name was drawn from a British term connoting the "elite" or "high society."
As automobiles replaced horses and the country became more industrialized, through World War I and the Roaring Twenties, the Grumbachers continued to meet their customers' needs. The store grew bigger and, in 1929, the company was incorporated as S. Grumbacher & Son, Inc. In 1931, Max's son, Max Samuel (M.S.), joined the company. When Max the elder died in 1933, his widow, Daisy, and their two sons, M.S. and Richard, continued the business, forming a partnership in 1936.
This was a popular store destination on the classic radio show Fibber McGee and Molly, which aired from 1935 to 1959.
Following World War II, the Grumbacher family decided to expand operations. In 1946, a second Bon-Ton was opened, in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Two years later, the company moved outside Pennsylvania, acquiring Eyerly's in Hagerstown, Maryland, and, in 1957, purchasing McMeen's in Lewistown, Pennsylvania. These early moves set The Bon-Ton's policy of growing into adjacent areas by opening new stores and acquiring existing businesses.
Expansion[edit]
During the next three decades, the Bon-Ton Stores continued to expand. In 1961, M.S.'s son, M. Thomas "Tim," entered the business, representing the fourth generation of Grumbachers. During the 1960s, the company opened new Eyerly's and Bon-Ton stores in several Pennsylvania communities and one in West Virginia. They also started a discount chain, Mailman's, and in 1969, retired the McMeen's name. During the 1970s, as the popularity of shopping centers began to grow, The Bon-Ton opened 11 new stores in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
The 1980s formed a period of rapid consolidation in the retail department store industry as major chains bought their competitors. The Bon-Ton Stores began the decade by opening more stores, establishing a new division, Maxwell's, and acquiring Fowler's department store in New York. When Tim Grumbacher was made CEO in 1985, the company operated 18 stores in four states. Two years later, the company made a major move, buying the 11-store Pomeroy's chain from Allied Department Stores. That purchase made it possible for the company to move into seven new markets in Pennsylvania. In 1991, The Bon-Ton acquired J.W. Rhodes in Ithaca, NY. The Bon-Ton entered the Lancaster, PA market in 1992 with the acquisition of two Watt & Shand locations in downtown Lancaster and Park City Center. The company continued to expand its New York presence in 1993 with a store in the Wilton Mall in Saratoga Springs in the former Addis & Dey's space.
In July 1994, The Bon-Ton purchased the 127-year-old Adam, Meldrum, and Anderson Company chain based in Buffalo, New York, for $42.6 million. Around the same time, The Bon-Ton also purchased Chappell's of Syracuse, New York and Hess's of Allentown, Pennsylvania. The Bon-Ton initially retained and operated Hess's flagship location until 1996, when it closed after nearly 100 years of continuous operation. The site was eventually demolished. Its current Allentown store, Hess's former south Allentown location, is the anchor of the South Mall. In 1995, The Bon-Ton entered the Rochester, NY market in three former McCurdy's locations, as well as in a former McCurdy's space in Elmira. In the following spring, the company opened a fourth Rochester location in a former Sibley's location. In March 1995, The Bon-Ton closed the landmark downtown Lancaster store. Later that year, they also closed the downtown AM&A's location. 1998's expansion included a new store in Westfield, Massachusetts, making it The Bon-Ton Stores' first entry into the New England area.
Operations in 2000s[edit]

In October 2003, The Bon-Ton would expand its reach into Ohio and the lower Midwest with the acquisition of the 69 store Elder-Beerman store chain. Following an attempt to convert to a privately held company, Elder-Beerman was offered more cash for its outstanding stock as part of the buyout. The chain currently continues as a separate nameplate.
On November 25, 2003, Bon-Ton reported a net loss in the third quarter of $1.7 million, or $0.11 per share, including an asset impairment charge of $0.10 per share,.[5]
The Bon-Ton Stores chain doubled in size in November 2005 with the $1.1 billion purchase of the 142 stores of Saks' Northern Department Store Group, headquartered in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Corporate headquarters remained in York, PA, but merchandising headquarters were relocated to Milwaukee. As with the Elder-Beerman acquisition, no store names were changed in the transaction. The newly acquired store group included Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's, Boston Store, Herberger's, and Younkers.[6]
In September 2006, The Bon-Ton purchased four former Parisian stores (plus one under construction) from Belk (which had just purchased the chain); the stores were located in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio (outside Belk's traditional operating territory). The three Michigan stores maintained the Parisian name as Belk rebranded the stores it retained under its own name; the Ohio and Indiana stores were rebranded under other names.
In December 2013, Mike Nemoir, senior vice-president, announced he would retire after four decades in the fashion industry at Bon-Ton and its predecessor companies on March 28, 2014.[7]

History[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
The Bon-Ton was started in 1898, when Max Grumbacher and his father, Samuel, opened S. Grumbacher & Son, a one-room millinery and dry goods store on Market Street in York, Pennsylvania. The store's name was drawn from a British term connoting the "elite" or "high society."
As automobiles replaced horses and the country became more industrialized, through World War I and the Roaring Twenties, the Grumbachers continued to meet their customers' needs. The store grew bigger and, in 1929, the company was incorporated as S. Grumbacher & Son, Inc. In 1931, Max's son, Max Samuel (M.S.), joined the company. When Max the elder died in 1933, his widow, Daisy, and their two sons, M.S. and Richard, continued the business, forming a partnership in 1936.
This was a popular store destination on the classic radio show Fibber McGee and Molly, which aired from 1935 to 1959.
Following World War II, the Grumbacher family decided to expand operations. In 1946, a second Bon-Ton was opened, in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Two years later, the company moved outside Pennsylvania, acquiring Eyerly's in Hagerstown, Maryland, and, in 1957, purchasing McMeen's in Lewistown, Pennsylvania. These early moves set The Bon-Ton's policy of growing into adjacent areas by opening new stores and acquiring existing businesses.
Expansion[edit]
During the next three decades, the Bon-Ton Stores continued to expand. In 1961, M.S.'s son, M. Thomas "Tim," entered the business, representing the fourth generation of Grumbachers. During the 1960s, the company opened new Eyerly's and Bon-Ton stores in several Pennsylvania communities and one in West Virginia. They also started a discount chain, Mailman's, and in 1969, retired the McMeen's name. During the 1970s, as the popularity of shopping centers began to grow, The Bon-Ton opened 11 new stores in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
The 1980s formed a period of rapid consolidation in the retail department store industry as major chains bought their competitors. The Bon-Ton Stores began the decade by opening more stores, establishing a new division, Maxwell's, and acquiring Fowler's department store in New York. When Tim Grumbacher was made CEO in 1985, the company operated 18 stores in four states. Two years later, the company made a major move, buying the 11-store Pomeroy's chain from Allied Department Stores. That purchase made it possible for the company to move into seven new markets in Pennsylvania. In 1991, The Bon-Ton acquired J.W. Rhodes in Ithaca, NY. The Bon-Ton entered the Lancaster, PA market in 1992 with the acquisition of two Watt & Shand locations in downtown Lancaster and Park City Center. The company continued to expand its New York presence in 1993 with a store in the Wilton Mall in Saratoga Springs in the former Addis & Dey's space.
In July 1994, The Bon-Ton purchased the 127-year-old Adam, Meldrum, and Anderson Company chain based in Buffalo, New York, for $42.6 million. Around the same time, The Bon-Ton also purchased Chappell's of Syracuse, New York and Hess's of Allentown, Pennsylvania. The Bon-Ton initially retained and operated Hess's flagship location until 1996, when it closed after nearly 100 years of continuous operation. The site was eventually demolished. Its current Allentown store, Hess's former south Allentown location, is the anchor of the South Mall. In 1995, The Bon-Ton entered the Rochester, NY market in three former McCurdy's locations, as well as in a former McCurdy's space in Elmira. In the following spring, the company opened a fourth Rochester location in a former Sibley's location. In March 1995, The Bon-Ton closed the landmark downtown Lancaster store. Later that year, they also closed the downtown AM&A's location. 1998's expansion included a new store in Westfield, Massachusetts, making it The Bon-Ton Stores' first entry into the New England area.
Operations in 2000s[edit]

In October 2003, The Bon-Ton would expand its reach into Ohio and the lower Midwest with the acquisition of the 69 store Elder-Beerman store chain. Following an attempt to convert to a privately held company, Elder-Beerman was offered more cash for its outstanding stock as part of the buyout. The chain currently continues as a separate nameplate.
On November 25, 2003, Bon-Ton reported a net loss in the third quarter of $1.7 million, or $0.11 per share, including an asset impairment charge of $0.10 per share,.[5]
The Bon-Ton Stores chain doubled in size in November 2005 with the $1.1 billion purchase of the 142 stores of Saks' Northern Department Store Group, headquartered in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Corporate headquarters remained in York, PA, but merchandising headquarters were relocated to Milwaukee. As with the Elder-Beerman acquisition, no store names were changed in the transaction. The newly acquired store group included Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's, Boston Store, Herberger's, and Younkers.[6]
In September 2006, The Bon-Ton purchased four former Parisian stores (plus one under construction) from Belk (which had just purchased the chain); the stores were located in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio (outside Belk's traditional operating territory). The three Michigan stores maintained the Parisian name as Belk rebranded the stores it retained under its own name; the Ohio and Indiana stores were rebranded under other names.
In December 2013, Mike Nemoir, senior vice-president, announced he would retire after four decades in the fashion industry at Bon-Ton and its predecessor companies on March 28, 2014.[7]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
