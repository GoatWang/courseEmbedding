"I have definitely taken advantage of the discounts on CFLs at my local Home Depot and switched out all my old bulbs. I did notice a drop in my utility bill. I plan on installing some of the new LED bulbs and look forward to even more savings. I think it definitely makes sense to conserve energy rather than build new power plants."– Jerry, Batesville, AR 



Lighting & Appliances Program – For Your Home
More ways to save.  From the convenience of your home.
Save on lighting and advanced power strips while shopping our 
					online 
					marketplace. Qualifying clothes washers and pool pumps now available for rebates.
Saving energy saves you money. And with new rebates for 
					efficient clothes washers and pool pumps, there are more 
					ways to save than ever. Submit your rebate by mail (download 
					the
					
					clothes washer form /
					
					pool pump form) OR online with our new
					
					portal - so you can get on with your day. You'll get 
					instant savings at these
					participating stores. 
					And now, get cash back when you purchase an efficient heat 
					pump water heater. Start shopping and saving now while supplies 
					last.

			energy-saving pool pumps.





LED Light Bulbs+

Save up to $3 per bulb on LED Light Bulbs
Emitting very little heat and averaging 22 years in lifespan, 
highly-efficient LED bulbs use as little as six watts of energy – 
compared to 40 watts with a traditional incandescent bulb. 
LED bulbs can be expensive, but for a limited time, 
you will receive savings of up to $5 per bulb when you buy LEDs at participating retailers.



Promotional period: now - Dec. 31, 2017, or while funds last.*
Discount only applies to qualified LED bulbs.
Limit 12 bulbs per customer. 
Entergy Arkansas does not warrant or endorse any manufacturer.




CFL Bulbs+

Receive free general-purpose (spiral) CFL Bulbs
Compact fluorescent light bulbs use about 75% less energy than standard incandescent bulbs and last up to 10 times longer – saving you more than $40 in electricity costs over each CFL bulb's lifetime. Look for Entergy Arkansas representatives at community events near you.



Advanced Power Strips+

Save up to $10 on Advanced Power Strips
Did you know that many of your electronic devices still use energy and cost you money, even when turned off?  In fact, 75% of the power used by electronics is in "standby mode." Save money and energy by plugging your PC or TV into an advanced power strip (APS).  APSs offer surge protection and the ability to truly "turn off" electronics when not in use. Because the APS cuts the power draw to other devices completely when you turn off your TV or CPU, you will start to see the savings on your bill as soon as you plug it in. 


Entergy Arkansas customers will receive up to $10 off the purchase of an advanced power strip purchased at participating retail locations or through Entergy's online marketplace.
Promotional period: now - Dec. 31, 2017, or while funds last.*




Clothes Washers+

Get $25 back when you purchase an Energy Star clothes washer
Energy Star certified clothes washers use about 25% less energy and 40% less water than traditional models, so you can save as much as $40 each year during the washer's life.  Energy Star models now come in both front- and top-loading models. Plus Energy Star models have a greater tub capacity so you can wash fewer loads to clean the same amount of laundry. 
And receive $25 cash back when you complete a rebate application form and return with your proof of purchase.  Electric models only; must be paired with an electric dryer.

Promotional period: now - Dec. 31, 2017, or while funds last.*




Pool Pumps+

Get up to $300 back when you purchase an Energy Star certified pool pump for your in-ground pool.
Energy Star certified pool pumps save energy by operating at more than one speed.  
Filtration only requires half the flow rate of running a pool cleaner. 
Conventional pool pumps, with only one speed, are set to run at the higher speeds required to clean the pool, rather than simply providing filtration, at all times.  
Therefore the energy required to run the pump during filtration operation is wasted by running faster than necessary. 
An Energy Star certified pool pump can run at different speeds and be programmed to match the pool operation with its appropriate pool pump speed. 
The energy saved is considerable; reducing pump speed by one-half allows the pump to use just one-eighth as much energy.  
These units not only save over a thousand dollars over their lifetime, they also run quieter, and with a $175 rebate for 2-speed and $300 rebate for multi-speed, the payback period is less than a year. 
Application can be made online, or by returning a completed rebate application form along with proof of purchase.  Must be at least 1 horsepower in size, and be installed in an in-ground pool.



Promotional period: now - Dec. 31, 2017, or while funds last.*
Discount only applies to qualified pool pumps.
Limit 2 pool pump rebates per household.
Entergy Arkansas does not warrant or endorse any manufacturer.



We'll offer discounts on other energy-saving appliances throughout the year. So please check this site regularly, and join our email list to receive periodic updates on promotions and tips for saving energy.

Arkansas Area on Aging



"This program definitely helped out on the light bills. The aerators are very efficient." – Alma, Property Manager, Cushman Apartments, Cushman, AR
"They did a real good job; they got in and got out. I think it is a good program." – Judy, Swifton Apartments, Swifton, AR



Multifamily Program
Lower your bill with free products from Entergy. 
From light bulbs to showerheads, the Entergy Arkansas Multifamily Program will install energy-saving products at no cost to owners or tenants.
Energy efficiency upgrades will add value to your property by lowering water and sewer costs, as well as lowering energy costs for tenants. Entergy Arkansas will install these free energy-saving products in eligible multifamily properties. 

What's offered in this program? +

This program is designed to benefit both the property manager/owner and tenants.  The energy efficiency upgrades add value to the property, help lower water and sewer costs, and provide tenants with decreased energy costs. This program also offers both direct installation of cost-effective efficiency measures in tenants' units, as well as common area energy surveys to identify opportunities for future energy-efficient improvements and other Entergy Arkansas energy efficiency programs. Services include:

Direct installation of compact fluorescent bulbs in tenants' residences at no direct cost to the resident.
Direct installation of high-efficiency showerheads if there is electric water heating at no direct cost to the tenant.
Direct installation of high-efficiency kitchen and bath aerators if there is electric water heating at no direct cost to the tenant.
Air conditioning tune-up performed by a certified technician to clean your system and adjust the refrigerant charge.
Common area energy efficiency analysis report mailed to the property manager/owner.




Air Conditioning Tune-Ups +


					    

The air conditioning tune-up helps each home's system to run more efficiently and provides better comfort to residents while lowering energy costs. This is achieved by a certified technician cleaning your system and adjusting refrigerant charge.

For information on participating contractors click here.



 



Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs +

Most CFLs last 10 times longer and use 75 percent less energy than traditional bulbs. Entergy will install CFLs in fixtures or table lamps in each unit. That means less time changing light bulbs and more time saving money on your Entergy bill.



Energy-Efficient Showerheads +

The showerheads use 40 percent less water than standard showerheads. That means less energy used to heat water for showers. Additionally, these self-cleaning showerheads will not corrode and require zero maintenance. Entergy will replace all eligible showerheads with these showerheads.



Kitchen & Bathroom Faucet Aerators +

Entergy will install energy-efficient faucet aerators in kitchens and bathrooms. Made of long-lasting materials, the aerators use approximately 31 percent less water than a standard faucet. That means less energy* used for water heating. 
*Savings will vary with efficiency of water heating system, temperature of incoming and outgoing water, and the number of occupants in the home. 



Energy Survey +

An Entergy Arkansas-qualified field technician will perform an energy survey of your property's common areas at no cost. This will identify ways to improve your property's energy efficiency. At the end of the survey, the technician will provide you with a summary of recommendations. 


Don't wait to save.

"I'm very pleased with the program and happy that Entergy is helping poultry producers across the state save energy."– Len, Country Lane Farms, Bluffton, AR 



Agricultural Energy Solutions
Instant incentives. Long-term savings. 
Entergy rewards its agribusiness customers for installing energy-efficient measures.
The goal of the Entergy Arkansas Agricultural Energy Solutions Program is to produce long-term electricity cost savings for agribusinesses by installing energy efficiency measures and replacing aging, inefficient equipment. 
Eligible businesses have two options for participating in the program.
1. Prescriptive (Lighting) 
This option consists of a series of choices with predetermined incentives for a wide selection of common energy-efficient lighting measures, including:

Compact fluorescent light bulbs.
High-performance linear fluorescent replacements.
Pulse-start metal halide.
Lighting controls, including occupancy sensors.

2. Custom (Energy-efficient Technology)
This option offers incentives for more complex, site-specific and cost-effective opportunities for energy-efficient technologies. Custom projects must be able to show specific and verifiable energy savings and costs. Typical custom measures include:

Low-energy livestock waterers.
Exhaust fans.
Circulation fans.
High-volume, low-speed fans.
Milk pre-cooler.
Variable speed controllers for vacuum pumps.
Variable frequency drives.


Program Incentives & Savings+

The program provides financial incentives and technical assistance to help agribusinesses replace aging, inefficient equipment and systems with new, energy-efficient technologies.  
Prescriptive rebate offering
Provides a simple method to make efficient choices by offering predetermined incentives for a wide selection of common energy-efficient lighting measures, such as compact fluorescent bulbs.
Custom rebate offering
Incentives for more complex and site-specific opportunities for energy-efficient technologies or multi-measure projects that are not included in the prescriptive offerings. Typical custom measures include exhaust fans, variable frequency drives, new construction lighting and circulation fans.  




How does my business benefit from this program? +

An energy-efficient facility not only means a lower energy bill for your business, but also improved employee comfort and productivity. By providing incentives and assistance to agribusinesses that are replacing inefficient equipment, Entergy helps reduce up-front improvement costs, as well as long-term energy bills. Plus, Entergy allows customers to engage their own qualified contractors or in-house staff for improvements.



Who is eligible? +

The Entergy Arkansas Agricultural Energy Solutions Program is available to all non-residential electric customers on the following agriculture rate schedules:

Agricultural pumping.
General farm service.
Small general service.
Large general service.

This program extends to a variety of agribusiness, including poultry, dairy, cattle, swine, Delta/row crops and aquaculture facilities.

Please note: An applicant considered a "Free Rider" will be disqualified from program participation. A "Free Rider" is someone who would install an energy efficiency measure without any program incentives or intervention.
