Market Commentary 3/31/17

Valuation is in the Eye of the Beholder
I have noticed a dramatic increase in  commentary regarding over-extended valuation levels in the stock markets.  It is not limited to those “perma-bears” who  seem to make a living finding reasons to convert your investments to cash,  gold, or highly leveraged put option strategies that only they can execute  profitably.  The topic has been discussed  by research analysts at prominent financial institutions and well-regarded market  commentators.  The question has been  posed to me by clients, business associates, even late night at the bar with my  hockey teammates.  I haven’t been stopped  and asked on the street by strangers, but I do wonder if that is next.
There are a number of good reasons to have  this discussion, and to have this discussion now.  First, the strength and duration of the  market rally that began late last year has surprised many people.  The move has been fueled by a change in  investor expectations amid the potential for regulatory and tax reform, rather  than underlying measurable economic improvement.  The rally extended valuation metrics  stretched over the last several years as central bankers employed controversial  policy measures to influence economic activity and the markets.  Finally, valuations should always matter when  investing in shares of operating companies rather than market index proxies.

Market Commentary 3/31/17

Valuation is in the Eye of the Beholder
I have noticed a dramatic increase in  commentary regarding over-extended valuation levels in the stock markets.  It is not limited to those “perma-bears” who  seem to make a living finding reasons to convert your investments to cash,  gold, or highly leveraged put option strategies that only they can execute  profitably.  The topic has been discussed  by research analysts at prominent financial institutions and well-regarded market  commentators.  The question has been  posed to me by clients, business associates, even late night at the bar with my  hockey teammates.  I haven’t been stopped  and asked on the street by strangers, but I do wonder if that is next.
There are a number of good reasons to have  this discussion, and to have this discussion now.  First, the strength and duration of the  market rally that began late last year has surprised many people.  The move has been fueled by a change in  investor expectations amid the potential for regulatory and tax reform, rather  than underlying measurable economic improvement.  The rally extended valuation metrics  stretched over the last several years as central bankers employed controversial  policy measures to influence economic activity and the markets.  Finally, valuations should always matter when  investing in shares of operating companies rather than market index proxies.
