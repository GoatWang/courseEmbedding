Return Policy





						At Music Direct our message has always been clear: It's the music that matters! As the leading seller of audiophile products, we stand behind the quality of our goods. Our shipments are carefully inspected and packed before leaving our warehouse, but in the event you are not satisfied with your purchase, please take note of the following return policy:
						

						Music Direct offers a 60-day money back guarantee on most equipment/accessories (excluding fluids, pastes, aerosols and special order items, none of which are returnable).

						We'll require an explanation for the return (defective, damaged, etc). Don't be surprised if we ask you some pretty detailed questions about the reason for your return. Hearing first hand what our customers are experiencing will enable us to provide you with the best possible service.
						

						Returns will not be accepted without a Return Authorization #, or RMA# which must be obtained by phone or email. An RA must be obtained within 60 days of the purchase, and Music Direct must receive the package within 15 days of issuing the RA. Note that after 60 days all sales are final. Please write your RA# on the outside of the shipping box (not the product box). Failure to do this will delay the processing of your return. Your return package must include the following: a copy of your invoice, a note detailing the reason for the return, all original packing materials, including cables, power supplies, instructions, remote controls, warranty cards, etc. Your package must arrive in resalable condition. If these instructions are not followed your return will not be accepted.
						

						If your return package is deemed acceptable after inspection, Music Direct will refund the purchase price of the returned item. Shipping costs will NOT be refunded. Return shipping costs are also the responsibility of the customer. Music Direct will absorb the shipping costs only in the case of defective merchandise (this does not include shipping costs for defective music titles, which is the responsibility of the customer). Please note that if defective merchandise proves to be non-defective upon inspection, or if Music Direct otherwise determines the customer is exercising chronic abuse of the return policy, the customer will be charged a re-stocking fee at Music Direct's discretion. Music Direct also reserves the right to impose a re-stocking fee at our discretion for any returned item that is damaged, cosmetically dinged or returned missing accessories.  Also please note, if you received Free Shipping with your initial order and you returned the non-defective item, we will deduct the initial shipping fee from your refund. Any and all packages that are refused delivery and sent back to music direct without an RMA number will not be refunded the initial shipping charge and a restocking fee will be added to the return.
						

						We strongly recommend sending your return package via UPS or FedEx so it can be insured and tracked (this is especially important with heavy, fragile, and more expensive items). If a return is sent via US Mail, then the customer accepts all responsibility if the package is lost, stolen, or damaged in transit. Music Direct is not liable for any uninsured packages.
						

						A note about phono cartridges and music titles:
						Phono cartridges and music titles are non-refundable and returnable only if they are defective. If by rare occurrence you receive a defective cartridge or music title, they may only be exchanged for the same item. In the case of phono cartridges, they must be deemed defective by the manufacturer before they can be exchanged. Please make sure phono cartridge problems are not due to user error as the item will not be returnable in such cases.
						

						At Music Direct, we strive to provide the best possible customer service. If you are experiencing problems/difficulties with your merchandise we recommend consulting our highly qualified staff of audio specialists before returning any items as they may be able to help you resolve any issues.
						
A note to international customers

If you have purchased a powered hardware product please know that Music Direct sells products which are meant to be used in the USA on a 120VAC/60Hz circuit. If you are not in the USA, it is your responsibility to ensure that the unit receives the proper voltage via a step up and/or step down voltage converter. Using this device on a voltage or frequency that is not 120VAC/60Hz may cause damage to the unit and greatly increases the risk of bodily harm or even fire. Music Direct cannot be held responsible for damage to a unit that is not used on 120VAC/60Hz. Music Direct will also not be able to provide you with warranty service or a replacement unit.
Due to the extreme cost of shipping products internationally, should you receive a defective piece of hardware or music title Music Direct will not pay for the return shipping of the item back to Music Direct. All costs related to shipping an item for a return to and from Music Direct must be covered by the customer.
Customers who refuse or abandon shipments will be charged all fees that Music Direct has incurred to retrieve your package.


						We look forward to providing you with the best customer service in the future.
