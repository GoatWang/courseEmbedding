Scratch Globe
This really is a globe with a difference, well, a few differences. Scratch Globe is a map of the world which allows you to scratch off where you’ve been on your travels. When you’ve scratched off the country or continent you’ve been to, a rich and colourful map with geographical detail is revealed underneath. The globe can then sit on your desk, reminding you to visit more places so you can scratch off a bit more! Scratch Globe comes flat packed, ready to assemble so makes for an excellent gift for someone who aims to see the world or already has. Although even without any countries scratched off it still looks great on any desk or mantlepiece.


Scratch Map
Travel is important to one’s own development. It’s a form of education, a means to expanding one’s understanding of the world. This is a brilliant concept map allowing visited destinations to be scratched off revealing the beautifully styled up to date map underneath. It’s the perfect gift for the travel enthusiast allowing them to personalise the map to display their own unique travel story. Whether it’s for your jet set sister’s birthday, or a well travelled uncle, Scratch Maps look great on everyone’s wall!


Scratch Postcard
Very cute  and lovely scratch postcards! Whether it be holiday greetings, congratulations, apology, compliments, expressing your love or feelings to someone you love Scratch Postcard will do it easily for you!


Scratch Game

Variety of Scratch Games, such as «Scratch what you win», «Scratch what fruit are you», «Scratch your dare», etc are very suitable for big companies, to spend your time with fun and laugh. Whenever you are in a pub, wedding, lesson break you will definitely get a good time with Scratch Game!

             SEC reporting and compliance $  7,000     $  7,000     $  7,000  

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.03. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds in the order of priority assuming the sale of one-third, two-third and
100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is
no assurance that we will raise the full $90,000 as anticipated. The various
offering amounts presented are for illustrative purposes only and the actual
amount of proceeds rose, if any, may differ significantly.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. If substantially less than the
maximum proceeds are obtained, Piotr Sibov, our president and director, has
verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the registration process.
Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not
be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks
become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. However, Mr.
Sibov has no obligation to loan such funds to us and that there is a verbal
guarantee that he will loan such funds to us. Mr. Sibov will not be paid any
compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due
date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Sibov. Mr. Sibov will be
repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate significant revenues
to pay the obligation. If we raise $30,000 or more, we will spend funds to lease
an office for our production. We believe it will cost between $2,600 and $3,000.
As of the day of this prospectus, we have entered into an Office Lease
Agreement, dated May 11, 2016.

If we are unsuccessful with this offering, we will need additional financing. We
do not currently have any written arrangements for additional financing. There
is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available,
on terms that will be acceptable to us. We may also utilize funds from Piotr
Sibov, our president and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the Company
funds. However, Mr. Sibov has no obligation to loan such funds to us and that
there is a verbal guarantee that he will loan such funds to us. Mr. Sibov will
not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering.


There are some barriers of entry in the scratch products market. These barriers
include need for the capital to start up such as equipment, building, and raw
materials; customer loyalty when large incumbent firms may have existing
customers loyal to established products or exclusive agreements with key links
in the supply chain could make it difficult for other manufacturers to enter an
industry. We need proceeds from this offering to enter this business. We will be
in a market where we compete with other companies offering similar products.
There are several companies Dedrax Ltd (1), Passat Press (2) and Classic Design
(3). We will be in direct competition with them. Many of these companies may
have a greater, more established customer base than us. We will likely lose
business to such companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford
to offer better price for scratch products than us, which may also cause us to
lose business. We foresee to continue to face challenges from new market
entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these
existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

Kaskad Corp. has not yet entered the market and has no market penetration to
date. Once we have entered the market, we will be one of many participants in
the scratch products business. Many established, yet well financed entities are
currently active in the market. Nearly all Kaskad Corp.'s competitors have
significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial
capabilities than Kaskad Corp. We are, consequently, at a competitive
disadvantage in being able to provide such products and become a successful
company in the scratch products industry. Therefore, Kaskad Corp. may not be
able to establish itself within the industry at all.

Company Description
We plan to produce scratch products. We had plans to produce only Scratch Maps
on the beginning stage of our operations. The idea brought by a desire to chart
travels in a new way. This was followed by a period of design finessing and
material testing to arrive at a unique new product that looked


 amazing on any
wall, was informative and a joy to scratch. Furthermore, it is a cognitive
product. With the help of Scratch Map children could learn the names of the
countries and their capitals. The raw materials for our production are plastic
sheets, laminate, and color inks and hot stamping foil. There are different
variations on the scratch products. The Company decided to produce also: Scratch
Globe, Scratch Postcard and Scratch Games.

Scratch Globe is a map with a difference. Scratch Globe is a gold foil coated
map of the world that allows traveller to scratch off where they have been on
their travels. When they have scratched off the country or continent they have
been to, a rich and colorful map with geographical detail is revealed
underneath. Scratch Globe is an excellent gift to post to someone recently back
from his or her holidays.

Scratch Postcard is a nice present for holiday greetings, congratulations,
apology, compliments, expressing feelings of those, who makes a present. Scratch
Games is a simple way to have interesting and fun time.

We plan to market and distribute our product in European market. We plan to sell
our product to tourists, travellers, and private clients. We have not yet
entered the market and have no market penetration to date. Once we have entered
the market, we will be one of many participants in the scratch products
business. Many established, yet well financed entities are currently active in
the market. Nearly all Kaskad Corp.'s competitors have significantly greater
financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities than
Kaskad Corp. We are, consequently, at a competitive disadvantage in being able
to provide such products and become a successful company in the scratch products
industry.

	Frequently Asked Questions:





	 





	Q:



	         



	What Proposals are shareholders being asked to consider at the upcoming shareholder meeting?





	 





	A:



	          

	Shareholders are being asked to consider six separate matters. Proposal 1 seeks the election by shareholders of the series (each a Fund and collectively, the Funds) of The Hartford Mutual Funds, Inc. (HMF) and The Hartford Mutual Funds II, Inc. (HMF II) (each a Company and together, the Companies) of nine individuals to each Companys Board of Directors (each a Board and together, the Boards). Proposal 2 seeks approval of a new Investment Management Agreement between Hartford Funds Management Company, LLC (HFMC) and the Companies, on behalf of the Funds. Proposals 3, 4 and 5 seek approval of certain changes to each Funds fundamental investment restrictions with respect to: (i) the purchase or sale of commodities, (ii) the purchase or sale of real estate and (iii) concentration of investments in a particular industry or group of industries, respectively. Finally, Proposal 6 seeks the approval, prospectively, of a modification to the current manager of managers policy previously approved by shareholders to permit HFMC, subject to prior approval by the relevant Board and under certain circumstances, to enter into and materially amend agreements with affiliated sub-advisers without the necessity of obtaining shareholder approval. Under the current SEC order, HFMC may, for certain Funds enter into and amend agreements with sub-advisors that are not affiliates of HFMC, subject to prior Board approval and under certain circumstances.



	 





	Q:



	         



	Who is being nominated to serve as Directors?





	 





	A:



	          

	Shareholders are being asked to consider the election of Hilary E. Ackermann, Lynn S. Birdsong, James E. Davey, Christine Detrick, Duane E. Hill, Sandra S. Jaffee, William P. Johnston, Phillip O. Peterson and Lemma W. Senbet (each a Nominee and together, the Nominees) as Directors. With the exception of Ms. Detrick, the Nominees are current members of each Board. If each of the Nominees is elected to each Board, the Boards will be composed of the same nine directors.



	 












	 





	Q:



	         



	How were the Nominees chosen?





	 





	A:



	          

	Each Companys Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for screening and recommending candidates to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committees are comprised of all of the Directors who are not interested persons of the Companies, as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act). The Nominating and Governance Committees recommended each Nominee and, at a meeting on November 4-5, 2015, the Nominees were unanimously nominated by the Boards to stand for election.



	 





	Q:



	         



	Why am I being asked to approve a new Investment Management Agreement?





	 





	A:



	          

	Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act provides that no person may serve as an investment adviser to a fund except pursuant to a written contract that, among other things, has been approved by a vote of a majority of the funds outstanding voting securities, as defined in the 1940 Act. Material changes to existing advisory contracts are deemed to effectively create new advisory contracts that require shareholder approval. The proposed new Investment Management Agreement between HFMC and the Companies (the New Agreement) would enhance and clarify the description of services currently provided by HFMC under the Investment Management Agreements between HMF and HFMC and HMF II and HFMC (the Current Agreements). While the Boards do not view the differences between the Current Agreements and the New Agreement to be material, the Boards are asking shareholders to approve the New Agreement. If approved by shareholders, the New Agreement would not result in an increase in overall fees paid by the Funds.



	 












	 





	Q:



	         



	Why am I being asked to approve changes to each Funds fundamental investment restriction on the purchase or sale of commodities?





	 





	A:



	          

	The 1940 Act requires mutual funds to have certain fundamental investment policies that can only be changed by shareholder vote, including a policy on investments in commodities. The current fundamental policy on commodities for many of the Funds has been in place for a long time, and the Funds are proposing to modernize it to provide for flexibility and the ability to adapt to a changing regulatory environment.  This Proposal also would result in all of the Funds having the same fundamental policy on commodities.  We expect that these changes would have no effect on the investment strategies described in each Funds prospectus, and the Boards and HFMC have no current intention to change the way in which any Fund is managed as a result of the changes to the fundamental investment policy.



	 





	For many of the Funds, the current policy states that the Funds will not purchase or sell commodities or commodities contracts, except that the Funds may purchase or sell financial futures contracts, options on financial futures contracts and futures contracts, forward contracts, and options with respect to foreign currencies, and may enter into swap transactions or other financial transactions of any kind. Certain Funds have adopted a more flexible policy, which allows these Funds to purchase or sell commodities or commodities contracts to the extent permitted by applicable law and as set forth in each Funds registration statement (which includes the prospectus). Proposal 3 would give all of the Funds the ability to invest in commodities-related instruments to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act and consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations, interpretations, and the Funds registration statements.

	HFMC is not proposing to allow the Funds to purchase or sell physical commodities. Again, we expect that these changes would have no effect on the investment strategies of any Fund, and the Boards and HFMC have no current intention to change the way in which any Fund is managed as a result of the changes to the fundamental investment restriction.




	 





	Q:



	         



	Why am I being asked to approve changes to each Funds fundamental investment restriction on the purchase or sale of real estate?





	 





	A:



	          

	The 1940 Act requires mutual funds to have a fundamental policy on investments in real estate. The proposed changes in Proposal 4 are intended to modernize each Funds existing fundamental investment policy on the purchase or sale of real estate and provide flexibility in the event of future changes to the regulatory environment.  All of the Funds are part of this Proposal to retain consistency across the Funds.   We expect that these changes would have no effect on the investment strategies described in each Funds prospectus, and the Boards and HFMC have no current intention to change the way in which any Fund is managed as a result of the changes to the fundamental investment policy.



	 





	The current policy states that the Funds will not purchase or sell real estate unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments, although each Fund may purchase securities secured by real estate or interests therein, or securities issued by companies which invest in real estate or interests therein.

	Proposal 4 would clarify the Funds existing fundamental policy on the purchase or sale of real estate and provide flexibility in the event of future changes to the regulatory environment. Again, we expect that these changes would have no effect on the investment strategies of any Fund, and the Boards and HFMC have no current intention to change the way in which any Fund is managed as a result of the changes to the fundamental investment policy.




	 





	Q:



	         



	Why am I being asked to approve changes to each Funds fundamental investment restriction on concentration?





	 





	A:



	          

	The 1940 Act requires mutual funds to establish and disclose in their registration statements a fundamental policy that restricts a funds ability to concentrate its investments in a particular industry or group of industries. The current policy for the Funds refers to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) interpretation of the meaning of the term concentrate, which generally involves investments of more than 25% of a funds assets. It is proposed that the term concentrate be described with a reference to the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, as they may be interpreted or modified from time to time by regulatory authorities having appropriate jurisdiction. Proposal 5 would allow the Funds to take advantage of any future changes in the law or interpretations of what it means for a Fund to concentrate its investments in an industry or group of industries. In addition, approval of Proposal 5 would clarify that a Funds conversion to a fund of funds or master-feeder structure would be permissible in the future if HFMC and the Board believe such a change would be appropriate.



	 





	Q:



	         



	Why are shareholders being asked to approve a proposal to permit HFMC to select and contract with sub-advisers without shareholder approval?





	 





	A:



	          

	Under Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act, an investment manager to a mutual fund cannot enter into or materially amend a sub- advisory agreement without obtaining shareholder approval. With the exception of The Hartford Growth Allocation Fund and The Hartford Checks and Balances Fund, shareholders have previously approved the Funds reliance on a manager of managers exemptive order (the Existing Order) from that requirement and certain other requirements under the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder. Therefore, many Hartford Funds historically have operated under a manager of managers structure, utilizing both affiliated and unaffiliated sub-advisers as part of both single and multiple sub-adviser arrangements. HFMC has significant experience in overseeing sub-advisers under such arrangements. The Existing Order, among other things, allows HFMC, with the relevant Boards approval and without shareholder approval, to enter into and materially amend sub-advisory agreements with sub-advisers that are not affiliated with the investment manager or those funds. Other than The Hartford Growth Allocation Fund and The Hartford Checks and Balances Fund, shareholders of the Funds have previously approved the Funds operation under this structure.



	 












	 




	HFMC and the Companies have requested exemptive relief from the SEC that would extend the Existing Order to also cover sub-advisers that are indirect or direct wholly-owned subsidiaries of HFMC, as defined in the 1940 Act, or sister companies of HFMC that are wholly-owned subsidiaries of a company that, indirectly or directly, wholly owns HFMC (the New Order). Although HFMC does not currently utilize a sub-adviser in its management of all of the Funds, and does not utilize a wholly-owned subsidiary sub-adviser for any Fund, the Boards believe that it is in the Funds best interests for HFMC to have the flexibility to do so in the future, with the relevant Boards approval. The Boards believe that permitting HFMC to select and contract with sub-advisers, without incurring the delay and expense involved with obtaining shareholder approval of new sub-advisory agreements or material amendments to existing sub-advisory agreements, is appropriate and in the best interest of each Funds shareholders and will allow each Fund to operate more efficiently. There is no guarantee that the SEC will grant the New Order. By prospectively approving this Proposal, shareholders are approving the operation of the Funds in a manager of managers structure under any such terms or conditions necessary to satisfy the conditions of any relief provided by the SEC, including potential future relief that may apply to any affiliated sub-adviser.




	 




	In summary, most Funds operate under the Existing Order which permits the Funds to select and enter into sub-advisory agreements with unaffiliated sub-advisers without shareholder approval.  If approved by shareholders, Proposal 6 would extend this policy so that all of the Funds could select and enter into sub-advisory agreements with both affiliated and non-affiliated sub-advisers without shareholder approval, subject to the conditions of the New Order.




	 





	Q:



	         



	Will the Proposals result in higher total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver and/or expense limitation for any Fund?





	 





	A:



	          

	No. The Proposals are not expected to result in an increase in total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement for any Fund, as shown in the respective Funds prospectus.



	 





	Q:



	         



	Who will pay the costs incurred in connection with the Meeting?





	 





	A:



	          

	Each Fund will pay its proportionate share of the expenses relating to the enclosed Notice and Joint Proxy Statement and the Meeting, including printing, mailing, solicitation, vote tabulation, legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses. These costs are considered extraordinary expenses and are therefore expected to be excluded from any expense limitations currently in effect for any of the Funds.



	 





	Q:



	         



	Do the Boards recommend that shareholders approve the Proposals?







	 







	A:



	          

	Yes. The Boards recommend that you vote FOR the Proposals.
