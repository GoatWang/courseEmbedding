Seeing potential | delivering value

 


 








Who we are Antin Infrastructure Partners is a leading independent private equity firm focused on infrastructure investments.
Based in Paris and London with ten partners and a total of over 50 professionals, we manage three funds that invest in infrastructure in Europe and target investments in the energy and environment, telecommunications, transportation and social sectors with the objective of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors through a combination of capital appreciation and cash yield.
Differentiated and long term approach to sourcing
We take a differentiated and long-term approach to sourcing and the majority of our investments are sourced through exclusive discussions. 
 Our team’s extensive and international experience provides access to a well-developed network across our target sectors and geographies which has enabled us to build a reputation as a reliable and trusted investor throughout the deployment of our first two funds.
Driving value creation
We are convinced that an active value creation approach offers the best way to manage infrastructure companies. We seek to create value through an active approach to asset management whereby we work closely with management to improve our portfolio companies’ financial performance, service quality and health and safety conditions.

Founding principles | Antin

Seeing potential | delivering value

 


 








Founding principles In founding Antin, the Managing Partners wanted to build an independent investment firm based on four pillars: partnership, accountability, discipline and entrepreneurship.
With four principles underpinning one culture, Antin has an industry-recognised reputation as a value-added manager and reliable partner. These principles guide our entire business, from our Investment and Portfolio Review Committee meetings to our relationships with the management teams of our portfolio companies.
 We believe our firm’s culture underpins our success.

Alain Rauscher 
Managing Partner and CEO









Partnership 

Accountability 

Discipline 

Entrepreneurship 



 

 






Partnership
Antin’s investment process is built on collective decision-making. The Investment Committee only approves decisions after review by all Managing Partners and Partners.







Accountability
The same team remains responsible for each investment from acquisition through to realisation. This breeds accountability from entry to exit.
Management teams are accountable for running the day-to-day operations and ESG items are included in management appraisals.







Discipline
Risk management and prudence are at the core of Antin’s investment decision-making process.
Prudent asset selection is a key component of our investment strategy and we invest in less than ten percent of all reviewed opportunities.
All capital expenditure must be reviewed and approved by our Investment Committee.







Entrepreneurship
Professionals join Antin to become part of a collective effort to grow a successful firm.
Team members invest personal wealth alongside investors, which aligns interests and creates an environment of teamwork and joint responsibility.
We expect management teams to invest significant amounts alongside Antin.

Strategy With each investment, we expect our ownership to produce tangible, measurable improvements for all stakeholders. 
We look for companies with potential for operational improvements and active capital management. In considering an investment, we undertake rigorous due diligence, focusing on business fundamentals, industry and market dynamics, and then prioritising business planning and transaction management.
 We are responsible investors and have a track record of improving financial performance, service quality and ESG aspects of our portfolio companies.

Sourcing A reliable partner with a differentiated and long-term approach to sourcing.
Antin’s team includes 22 nationalities. These multicultural and diverse backgrounds, together with the team’s extensive and international experience, create a pan-European deal sourcing base. The result is local-level access to a deep and well-developed network of relationships across the firm’s target geographies and sectors.
Throughout the deployment of our first two funds, we have developed a reputation as a reliable and trusted investor. This reputation has led to proactive approaches for Antin engagement by both sellers and strategic partners.
 
Our track record of proprietary and bilateral transactions demonstrates our capacity for both fast execution and navigation of complex situations. An investment from Antin brings active, experienced directors who can add value at board meetings.

Stéphane Ifker
Partner
A reliable partner We focus on transactions with industrial players. The majority of our investments are sourced through exclusive discussions.
 Extensive experience
We have the experience and the resources to execute quickly and meet the needs of strategic partners and sellers in complex situations.

Driving value creation A disciplined investment and asset management approach to drive value creation.
Throughout our period of ownership of a company, we show strong support for growth via additional capital expenditure. Whilst setting benchmarks for financial improvements, we also improve health and safety conditions and service quality, all for the purpose of driving positive change within our portfolio.
We encourage existing management to share our value creation approach. Antin designs financial incentive plans to ensure the management team is fully aligned with the objectives of the firm.
We are convinced that a value creation approach offers the best way to manage infrastructure companies whilst growing those companies and delivering superior risk-adjusted returns to investors.

Outgoings

Business Rates/Property Tax
                        No properties were found where ANTIN INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS III LP is liable for the business rates / property tax. This could be for a number of reasons. The council hasnt published the data We havent found or been able to process the councils data The company is part of a group of companies and another company in the group is liable for business rates The registered office may be a residential address which does not have a commercial designation. If the business is run from home then it won't be a commercial property and hence won't be liable for business rates. Serviced offices are increasingly popular and therefore a business may not be paying business rates directly - the building owner is and this is incorporated in the office rental charge.
