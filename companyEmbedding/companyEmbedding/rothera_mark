Stuart W. Peltz, Ph.D. | Chief Executive Officer



Stuart W. Peltz, Ph.D. founded PTC Therapeutics, Inc. in 1998 and has served as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors since the company's inception. Under his leadership, PTC has grown from a research organization based in the expertise of RNA processes and control to a publicly traded company on NASDAQ focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of orally-administered, small-molecule treatments for rare disorders and oncology.Dr. Peltz is a recognized scientific leader in RNA biology in the area of post-transcriptional control processes involving mRNA turnover and translation, with more than 30 years of research and over 100 publications in this area. He and his team have shown the important interplay between the different RNA biology events that ultimately control protein production in the cell. He was involved in developing the first biochemical and genetic assays investigating the regulation of mRNA turnover subsequently demonstrating the strong connection between the processes of protein production and mRNA turnover. His work was instrumental in identifying and characterizing components of multiple mRNA decay and translation pathways.

Mark Rothera, chief commercial officer, PTC Therapeutics



David Vaczek speaks with PTC's Mark Rothera about the global launch of its lead product and how the biotech is gearing up to commercialize Duchenne drug Translarna in the US. The following is edited from a longer discussion and is part of an occasional series of interviews with biotech marketers.
DV: Translarna (ataluren) is in Phase III in this country but is currently launching overseas. With the drug now available to some patients in Europe, what are the next steps for commercialization?
MR: The launch in Germany is an important step because not only is it the first time we are launching Translarna around the world, but also the first-ever drug to be specifically launched for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We are pursuing two parallel tracks. The gating event for commercialization is the pricing and reimbursement negotiations with the EU states which can take anywhere from three to 18 months. Going into 2015, we are pursuing access to the drug in Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and in the second half of Q2, the UK, followed by France, Italy and Spain.
We feel equally passionate about early access programs, where countries allow reimbursed drug before formal commercial launch for rare diseases for which there are no therapeutic alternatives. Boys with this severe muscle-wasting disease have a life expectancy in the 20s, so every day counts. We are already providing reimbursed drug into France, Spain and Italy, and now Turkey and Israel.
DV: How is Translarna being marketed to HCPs and patient groups?
Rothera: To have a first drug that has made it over the line with regulatory approval is a huge moment for the DMD community and has given them a lot of hope for the future. One of the challenges is helping them to understand the realities of the market-access process. We are focusing on patient genotyping to make sure the right patients--the 13% of DMD patients with a nonsense mutation--are accurately identified as right for the drug. As no therapy has been available, not all patients have been genotyped. Patient groups are playing an active role here. They are helping with compliance education, an important aspect for a new oral therapy taken three times a day by children of school age.
We are putting on master classes at support centers where physicians can hear from experts on best practices and what holistic management of the patients is like. The number of centers of excellence can be quite limited for rare diseases, and you find physician competence varies. You can help improve standards along with the community.
DV: What will Translarna cost?
MR: Ultra orphan therapies are typically priced in the $200,000 to $400,000 a year range. This type of therapy is 100% reimbursed in the EU through agreements reached at the country level based on price and how many patients will benefit.
DV:  What is the efficacy bar for the ACT DMD confirmatory Phase-III trial, for supporting full EU approval, and the year-end NDA rolling submission filing for Translarna with FDA?
MR: We learned in our Phase-2b study which patients we will need to select for the confirmatory trial to be able to show the effect of the drug most clearly in a 48-week period. We showed an average 30-meter difference in walking ability in Phase 2b between active and placebo arms. We expect to show at least that because of the improved selection. The trial will read out [this] year in the third quarter when we would expect to then use it as the basis for completing our submission to FDA.
DV: Prosensa and Sarepta target a different kind of DMD genetic mutation. How will they impact the landscape should they come to market?
MR: There is no overlap between their drugs and ours as they treat different subpopulations with DMD. All the drugs have benefitted from learning on the progression of the disease with these mutations.
DV:  PTC is pursuing indications for cystic fibrosis and MPS1. How big is Translarna's potential?
MR: Translarna is a kind of proof of principle for treating diseases caused by a nonsense mutation, which is present in up to 2,000 monogenic diseases, with about 11% occurance on average. So DMD could be just the beginning in changing the courses of these diseases. It's been a 16-year journey to this point. We have had to pioneer getting a first-in-class drug with a novel mechanism of action to market. We were the first to pioneer a clinical development end point for regulatory purposes, and the first to go through the regulatory process to a conclusion. Along the way, we have had to learn and share that learning with a lot of people and communities.

                                                    CORRECTED: PTC Therapeutics' DMD drug Emflaza to cost $35,000 a year and launch within the coming weeks
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    2:07 PM ET 05/08/2017
                                                


PTC Therapeutics Inc. (PTCT) said early Monday that it plans to launch the Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug Emflaza at a price of $35,000 a year and within the coming weeks. The price tag comes in below the controversial $89,000- a-year price set by Emflaza's previous owner, privately-held Marathon Pharmaceuticals, which faced on the drug's price tag that it delayed Emflaza's launch. The price tag was especially controversial because the drug is part of a class of corticosteroids...

















                                                    This rare disease drug was just given a $35,000-a-year price tag. But it's unclear whether that's an improvement
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    2:07 PM ET 05/08/2017
                                                


The drug, now sold by PTC Therapeutics (PTCT), is available elsewhere for just $1,000 a year. When PTC Therapeutics Inc. (PTCT) bought a rare-disease drug earlier this year, the company said it would reconsider the price. Many said the company would have to bring the price down-- an unusual position for a pharmaceutical company to be in these days.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
