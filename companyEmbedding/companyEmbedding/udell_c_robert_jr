Open Letter to Consolidated CEO C. Robert Udell, Jr.
Amy Masciola01.2017UpdateLeave a Comment 

January 17, 2017
C. Robert Udell, Jr.
President and CEO
Consolidated Communications, Inc.
121 South 17th Street
Mattoon, IL 61938
Dear Mr. Udell:
As employees of Fairpoint Communications, we look forward to a constructive and cooperative relationship with the Consolidated Communications management team. We believe we all share the goal of providing the best quality service to our customers across Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. To achieve that objective, we believe Consolidated should take three crucial steps: 1) reinstate recently laid-off workers in order to maintain high standards of customer service; 2) analyze FairPoint’s history of poor management and abusive actions toward employees in order to avoid repeating them; and 3) halt reorganization of the company until after the sale is finalized in order to make sure all changes are serving the long-term good of customers, workers, and the company as a whole.
FairPoint’s decision to lay off more than 10 percent of the workforce in less than 18 months has compromised our ability to provide the service customers need and has deeply affected employee morale. The company’s 2014 effort to slash labor costs and replace skilled, experienced workers with inexperienced temporary workers led to a historic four-month strike, which ended in a union victory in February 2015. However, FairPoint turned around and laid off more than 10 percent of the workforce—all in all cutting more than 36 percent of employees since 2008.
Inevitably, fewer workers have meant cuts in the quality of service and increases in customer complaints. The only way to restore quality service and workers’ loyalty to the company is to bring back those critical lost jobs.
We believe the long, strained, often abusive relationship between FairPoint management and employees will improve if Consolidated takes seriously some lessons from FairPoint’s history. In 2008, when tiny, North Carolina-based FairPoint bought Verizon’s Northern New England assets, executives promised to add 675 new jobs. Members of the IBEW and CWA strongly opposed the acquisition, fearing the company was taking on too much debt and that it had no experience managing a transaction of that magnitude or the complex operations required in the Northern New England landscape. The acquisition went through, and FairPoint went bankrupt in 2009.
Poor management decisions multiplied for the next seven years as FairPoint cut approximately 1,500 jobs across all of its operations, refused to invest in its network, and watched customer service and profits lag behind its industry peers. Today, investigations and fines are on the horizon for the company in Maine and Vermont, where regulators oversee telecommunications services.
Finally, the latest company reorganization will only compound and accelerate the degradation of service initiated by employee layoffs. We are being asked to do more for our customers with dramatically fewer resources. You simply cannot eliminate more than one third of the workforce and expect to provide quality service.
As workers on the front lines, we are incredulous that the company’s priority from day one has not been improving and expanding telecommunications service in our communities, but instead, lining the pockets of vulture capitalists, who will see a massive windfall in the sale to Consolidated. Layoffs, bad faith, mismanagement, and disregard for customers and employees must end if the Consolidated Communications purchase of FairPoint is to succeed.
We hope you will take this opportunity to turn the page on eight disastrous years and begin a new era of cooperation with workers in order to put customers first. We also urge you to use your considerable influence with FairPoint CEO Paul Sunu to immediately recall all workers who’ve been laid off since the spring of 2015 and to postpone corporate re-organization until after a sale is finalized.
Sincerely,
Employees of FairPoint Communications, Members of The Communications Workers of America Local 1400 and The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Locals 2320, 2326, and 2327
