Product Overview

    The Virtus Equity Trend Series strives to participate in rising markets while placing an emphasis on preserving capital during major market declines. The Series has an investment objective of long-term capital appreciation. It aims to deliver attractive returns with lower volatility, beta, and correlation over full market cycles. The Virtus Equity Trend Series employs relative strength analysis provided by Dorsey, Wright & Associates (DWA) to construct a risk-managed portfolio of U.S. equities, prioritizing market segments with the strongest price momentum. Cash equivalents are used for defensive purposes as the model indicates. Effective May 14, 2015 this series changed its strategy and its name. This document reflects the new investment process.There is no relationship between Dorsey Wright and Virtus other than a license by Dorsey Wright to Virtus of certain Dorsey Wright trademarks and trade names, and the Dorsey Wright technical analysis ('Technical Analysis'). The Technical Analysis has been created and developed by Dorsey Wright without regard to and independently of Virtus, its business, its development of this product, and/or any prospective investor. The licensing of any Technical Analysis to Virtus is not an offer to purchase or sell, or a solicitation or an offer to buy any securities. A determination that any portion of an investor's portfolio should be devoted to any product developed by Virtus is a determination made solely by the investment advisor serving the investor or the investor himself, not Dorsey Wright or Virtus.

Risk Considerations

Equity Securities: The market price of equity securities may be adversely affected by financial market, industry, or issuer-specific events. Focus on a particular style or on small or medium-sized companies may enhance that risk.
Industry/Sector Concentration: A fund that focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector will be more sensitive to conditions that affect that industry or sector than a non-concentrated fund.
Allocation: The fund's exposure to different asset classes may not be optimal for market conditions at a given time. Asset allocation does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in declining markets.
Prospectus: For additional information on risks, please see the fund's prospectus.

The investments for the Series are managed by the same portfolio manager(s) who manage one or more other funds that have similar names, investment objectives and investment styles as the Series. You should be aware that the Series is likely to differ from the other mutual funds in size, cash flow pattern and tax matters. Accordingly, the holdings and performance of the Series can be expected to vary from those of the other mutual funds.
Shares of the separate Series of Virtus Variable Insurance Trust are sold only through the currently effective prospectuses and are not available to the general public. Shares of the VIT Series may be purchased only by life insurance companies to be used with their separate accounts which fund variable annuity and variable life insurance policies or qualified retirement plans and are also available as an underlying investment fund for certain qualified retirement plans. The performance information for the Series does not reflect fees and expenses of the insurance companies. If such fees and expenses were deducted, performance would be lower.
Please carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Series before investing. For this and other information about any Virtus Variable Insurance Trust Series, call 1-800-367-5877 or visit Virtus.com for a prospectus and/or summary prospectus. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.  Morningstar Disclosures: 
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

The information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete, or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
1 Yields/Distributions: Distribution Yield (at NAV) is calculated by annualizing the latest month's distribution and dividing by the NAV on the last business day of the period. SEC Yield represents the net investment income earned by a fund over a 30-day period (7-day period for Money Market Funds), expressed as an annual percentage rate based on the fund's public offering share price at the end of the 30-day period (7-day period for Money Market Funds).
2 Distribution History: Distributions are represented on a cash basis and may be reclassified at year end for tax purposes. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. STCG: Short Term Capital Gain, LTCG: Long Term Capital Gain
3 Risk Statistics: R2 is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund or security's movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. Beta is a quantitative measure of the volatility of a given portfolio to the overall market. Alpha is a risk adjusted measure of an investment's excess return relative to a benchmark. A positive Alpha indicates that the investment produced a return greater than expected for the risk (as measured by Beta) taken. Standard Deviation measures variability of returns around the average return for an investment fund. Higher standard deviation suggests greater risk. Risk Statistics are calculated using 36 monthly returns.
4 Characteristics: For Equity Funds: Trailing P/E: Per-share stock price divided by the latest12-months Earnings per Share; Price/Cash Flow: Per-share stock price divided by the per-share operating cash flow; Price/Book: Per-share stock price divided by the latest 12-month per-share Book Value; 3-Year EPS Growth Rate: Average of earnings per share growth for latest 3-year period. The 3-Year EPS Growth Rate is not a forecast of the fund's performance. Not insured by FDIC/NCUSIF or any federal government agency. No bank guarantee. Not a deposit. May lose value.
