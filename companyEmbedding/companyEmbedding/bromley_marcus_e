Personal Loans from Marcus by Goldman Sachs






































































































147 years new.

        Backed by over a century of financial expertise, loans from Marcus are designed with you in mind. 
        












Pay less interest with a lower fixed-rate loan from Marcus. 

Marcus offers personal loans with rates as low as 6.99% APR—that's lower than most high interest rate credit cards. Also, your rate never changes during the life of your loan. 
Rates range from 6.99% to 23.99% APR, and loan terms range from 36 to 72 months. Only the most creditworthy applicants qualify for the lowest rates and longest loan terms. Rates will generally be higher for longer-term loans.









No fees. Ever.

        Truly, we make money on interest, not fees.
        




No sign-up fees

          Since that's not a very warm welcome.
          




No prepayment fees

          You can always pay off your loan earlier.






No late fees

          You could pay additional interest, but never a fee.

How Personal Loans Work - Marcus by Goldman Sachs


























































































How it works.
With Marcus by Goldman Sachs, you select a loan amount and a desired monthly payment. We'll give you options for a fixed-rate, no-fee loan. 










Tell us about yourself.

                We’ll check your creditworthiness to create your loan options. But don’t worry, this step won’t affect your credit score.
                

















Choose your loan option.

                Explore your loan options and choose one that suits your budget and timeframe.
                

















Submit your application.

                Add a few details to verify your identity and finalize your loan application. This step may impact your credit score.
                













Take the next step toward a brighter financial future.
If you’re approved, provide a bank account and e-sign your loan documents to receive your funds. Then you can customize your payment schedule by changing your due date to one that's right for you.
