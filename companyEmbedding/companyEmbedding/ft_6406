Customer Questions & Answers








            My townhouse lacks storage. I am considering having someone build me a shed. Can this shed be used to store home items not lawn items and tools.
        


Asked by: Anonymous

            Shed stays dry, however, humidity, rodents and other outdoor pests... shed does not protect against these. You should consider climate control for upholstered and any valuable furnishings or paperwork. Great for lawn furniture!

            I would like to place this shed on grass. Does a foundation have to be built for it?

        Strike Plate on Left Door
I assembled the shed this past weekend with minimal help.  The instructions were good and the materials seem sturdy.  My only issue is that the strike plate (DZG) on the left door jamb comes out too far and the latching mechanism on the right door doesn't clear the strike plate and therefore can't be closed without closing both doors at the same time...which in turn makes the deadbolts obsolete.  Anyone else have this issue or am I just missing something?  Thanks.

We purchased this shed to replace an old wood frame shed. Had a friend help with assembly. It serves our needs well for storage of garden tools, plant food, etc. Recommended

I bought the 8x5 shed ten years ago. It still looks as good as the day I took it out of the box. Putting it together was easy. One problem,I had to replace the thumb lever.

You'll want to put this together exactly where you want it to be on a level surface. It will pop out of connections on the flooring, it's really flexible.

Lifetime sheds provide you an excellent yard storage solution that will last for years to come. This shed uses a panelling design to assemble the shed; adjacent panels interlock and fasten together. The shed is then reinforced on the inside of the shed with powder-coated steel. The shed doors have a built-in padlock (actual lock not included). These sheds come with a 10-year factory warranty from Lifetime Products. This lifetime outdoor storage shed is durable, sturdy and is designed to meet a broad range of storage needs. Great shed for Lawn and Garden Organization & Storage! Lifetime Outdoor Storage Shed 8 x 5 Features Sturdy, Steel-Reinforced Construction  Garden Storage Sheds Feature Steel-Reinforced Dent-Resistant Double-Wall Polyethylene Panels Lifetime Outdoor Shed Steel Trusses Provide Roof Strength  Lifetime storage Sheds Secure-Fastened Assembly Ensures Stability and Durability   Outdoor Plastic Storage Sheds Feature Attractive Appearance and Design  Lifetime Sentinel 8 X 5 Shed With 1 Window has Blow Molded Wood-Grain Wall Panels  Simulated Shingled Roof on this Lifetime 8 Ft.

Shed With Window  Plastic Sheds Natural Colors Complement Surroundings   6406 Lifetime Outdoor Storage Sheds are Low Maintenance  UV-Protected to Prevent Fading and Cracking  Weather-Resistant Seams Keep Interior Dry  Stain Resistant and Easy to Clean  Never Needs Painting   Lifetime Sentinel Shed Features a High-Pitched Roof  Measures 96" at the Peak and 70" at the Bottom Edge of the Roof Panel Head-Room and Spacious Walk-Around Interior  Steep Roof Allows for Quick Drainage of Rain and Snow   High-Arched, Steel-Reinforced Doors  Lockable Doors with Internal Latching Mechanism Full-Length Steel Hinge System  Door located on 8 wall   High-Impact Polyethylene Floor  Resistant to Oil, Solvents and Stains Slip Resistant Surface Measures about 1.5" Thick  Lifetime Storage Buildings Special Features  Shatter Proof Window Opens for Increased Ventilation Skylights Screened Vents Provide Airflow and Help Keep Pests Out Built-In Shelving System Pegboard with Tool Hooks  Not All Sheds Are Created Equal! Some Things to Look for When Comparing Sheds:  Height - Many sheds have low ceilings and entrances and are very cramped.   Structure - Is the Shed High Quality Steel Reinforced and Double Walled?   Features - Does it Have Vents, Windows, Lights, True Door Handle, Steel Support Shelving, etc? Floor - Lifetime Floors are More Sturdy and Made of Better Material.  Bottom Line: Lifetime sheds are much nicer looking, more functional, and much stronger than cheaper competitor sheds. The Garden Sheds are putty colored with darker brown trims. Lifetime sheds fill many different needs for outdoor storage needs. The 6406 is a smaller floor plan ideal for storing pushing/self-propelled lawn mowers, gardening supplies, and yard tools. *Assembly Required on Lifetime Outdoor Storage Products. A wooden framework or cement slab is recommended for support under the shed. The shed floor is not a weight-bearing floor and will need some sort of solid support to keep from breaking or damaging the floor. * Lifetime Plastic Shed extensions sold separately.

 Asked by: Marilyn


 
			  - 3/18/2016

 Q: Do I need to pull the boxes off the truck?
 Asked by: Admin


 
			  - 8/12/2015 12:43:23 AM

 A: Most of the delivery trucking companies we use for this shed will have machines on the back of their trucks, called lift gates, which will lower the boxes to the ground for you. However, in rare instances, the freight truck will not have that machine handy. In those cases, the boxes will need to be pulled off one at a time. Please make sure you plan your appointment accordingly so you sufficient help.

 Q: What is the 6406 Lifetime storage shed typically used for?
 Asked by: Admin


 
			  - 8/12/2015 12:43:21 AM

 A: This shed is one of the more compact sizes from Lifetime. It does have enough depth in the floor plan to store most pushing lawnmowers or other similarly sized pieces of yard equipment. The included shelves provide space to store smaller yard products.

 Q: Do you ship to Canada?
 Asked by: Admin


 
			  - 8/12/2015 12:43:18 AM

 A: Yes, we can ship this item to Canada. However, as our cost to do so is very high, Canadian customers are frequently able to get the product across the border cheaper than we can. If you have a United States address we can ship to, you will typically save money bringing it across the border, paying the required fees, then for us to ship directly to you. Shipping costs on the shed is noted in the "Check Ship Rates" link at the top of the listing.

    See all 12 reviews5.0 out of 5 starsGreat shed!Byrubyslippers46on February 6, 2015Size: 8' x 5'|Color: Brown|Verified PurchaseWe love this storage shed! It arrived quickly, was fairly simple to set up, and is the perfect size for our needs and the space we had to put it. I have a large collection of Christmas trees/tree decorations/lights/etc. They are now all stacked neatly in the shed, clearing out room in our double car garage, which can now actually accommodate two cars! In addition to 12 large totes, we also stored our outdoor chair/bench cushions that are used only in the summertime. Very happy with this purchase!0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsTerrific shedByAmazon Customeron September 20, 2011Size: 8' x 5'|Color: Brown|Verified PurchaseI replace my 4' x 4' shed with this one hoping I could just push my mower into it without folding the handle.  No such luck.  Walls are much thicker than steel shed and 8' x 5' includes the roof overhang so interior dimensions are somewhat less. Harder to put together than video of man and wife team assembling it would indicate.  That said, it was much easier than other sheds I have assembled.  Withstood hurricane Irene without being blown over and more importantly, kept everything inside dry, despite the horizontal rain.  Very pleased with this purchase.0Comment|

Smithon October 31, 2013Size: 8' x 5'|Color: Brown|Verified PurchaseThis arrived in two boxes. My husband and I watched a couple of video's on how to put together which were quite useful. Some instructions really lacking on detail - specifically the door mechanisms. but in just a little over 4 hours we completed the project and it's quite nice. all the shelving is great, plenty of space for us. We are very happy with our purchase. It was great deal too especially with free shipping, better than we could find around home.0Comment|

Lifetime storage buildings come in many different sizes to accommodate your needs. Our 8 x 5 ft Lifetime storage buildings are designed to play a big role in a small space. We make organization easy by including shelving units and peg strips for your tools and supplies. With our Lifetime storage buildings, you can keep your tools and lawn equipment right at your fingertips, right where you need them—in the yard! Designed for style and durability, you’ll appreciate the no paint, no rust, low maintenance of this shed’s polyethylene plastic construction and steel reinforcements. With an attractive design and built to weather the storms, the 8 x 5 ft outdoor storage shed provides a place for everything so you can keep everything in its place. Made in the USA. Covered by a 10 yr. limited factory warranty in US and Canada. Compatible with 8 ft shed expansion kitsConsult local building codes before assembly. This shed must be built on a flat level foundation of wood or concrete (not included). It is designed with a slight indentation in each corner of the floor so that you can drill through the flooring to secure it to the foundation. Anchoring hardware depends on the type of foundation you have and is therefore not included in the shed kit. Not including the installation of the foundation, you can expect assembly of the shed itself to take 2 adults up to 6 hours. For more information about assembly, read the Owner's Manual Sample.Model Number6406Warranty10 yr Limited Warranty in US and CanadaColorDesert Tan with Dark Brown Roof and DoorsMaterial of ConstructionPowder-coated steel and double-walled polyethylene plasticWallsMolded wood grain 1 inch double-walled polyethylene plastic with steel reinforcements will support items up to 50 lbs (22.6 kg) weight capacity if items are attached to the wall correctlyDoorsOne double door with internal spring latch, interior deadbolts, and exterior pad lock loopWindowsOne latch and lock shatter proof window panel that slides up for ventilationRoofSimulated shingled roof with steep pitch for quick drainage of rain and snow, heavy-duty steel truss for additional strengthFloor0.75 in.
