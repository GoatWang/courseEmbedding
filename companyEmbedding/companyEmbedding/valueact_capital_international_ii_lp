“I was expecting their focus to be on financial engineering and short term opportunities. Instead, throughout the engagement, I found them to be methodical and analytically oriented much like a good product manager or CEO.  Overall, I found we had much in common in terms of business perspective and the keys to driving value.”

Our core values shape who we are.




Scroll Down






Relationships & trust.

We place great value on our relationships with current and former portfolio companies, as well as the institutional investor community. We always consider what is in the best interest of the company and all shareholders. 










Responsibility & long-term thinking.

We believe in investing for the long term and managing companies for the long term. This requires the highest standards of integrity, a deep understanding of industry structure and business strategy, and a consideration of relevant social, ethical and environmental issues.










Transparency & respect.

Our team culture promotes openness, shared learning and shared rewards. We succeed or fail together. We apply this same approach to working with our portfolio companies.











“Since ValueAct Capital joined our Board at the end of 2012, they have developed a deep understanding of our business and we have forged an open, two-way communication with them. As our largest shareholder, they have provided valuable input and perspective to our Directors and senior management. Their well-studied insights have been particularly helpful with our strategy development and with our investor relations practices. At a time when many investors are focusing primarily on short term or cyclical issues, ValueAct Capital’s long-term strategic approach has supported sustained investment in and growth of our business.”
