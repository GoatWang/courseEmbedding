Fifth Street Finance Corp. And Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. Announce Promotion Of Steven M. Noreika To Chief Financial Officer






GlobeNewswire



Jul 10, 2015 9:51 AM EDT













 




























































 GREENWICH, CT, July 10, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ:FSC) ("FSC") and Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. (NASDAQ:FSFR) ("FSFR") today announced that the Boards of Directors for both FSC and FSFR have promoted Steven M. Noreika to Chief Financial Officer, replacing Richard A. Petrocelli, who will be leaving Fifth Street to pursue other opportunities effective July 10, 2015. We would like to thank Rich for his contributions during his tenure and wish him success in his future endeavors. Alexander C. Frank remains Chief Financial Officer of Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. (NASDAQ:FSAM) ("FSAM"), the parent company of FSC and FSFR's investment adviser.  Prior to his promotion, Mr. Noreika has been serving as the Chief Accounting Officer of FSAM. Mr. Noreika joined Fifth Street in September 2008 and during his tenure, he has held various finance and accounting positions, including Chief Financial Officer of FSFR from November 2013 to July 2014. Prior to joining Fifth Street, Mr. Noreika spent six years at Time Warner Inc., where he was a manager of internal reporting, and prior to that he managed audit and tax engagements at Marcum & Kliegman, LLP (now Marcum LLP). Mr. Noreika is a Certified Public Accountant and holds a B.B.A in Accounting from Pace University. He is also a holder of the Chartered Financial Analyst designation.  "Steve has been a valuable member of Fifth Street's finance and accounting team since joining in 2008, holding various important roles within the organization. I am excited to work closely with Steve in his new role and believe that FSC and FSFR will benefit from the depth of his knowledge, financial acumen and experience across the Fifth Street platform," stated Todd G. Owens, Chief Executive Officer of FSC.  "Having worked with Steve for seven years I am extremely confident that he will serve effectively as the new CFO for both FSC and FSFR, helping strengthen our infrastructure to support both entities," commented Ivelin M. Dimitrov, Chief Executive Officer of FSFR, adding, "Steve's deep financial, accounting and operational experience, combined with his knowledge of both the Fifth Street platform and comfort with financial reporting make him a natural fit for this position."

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
