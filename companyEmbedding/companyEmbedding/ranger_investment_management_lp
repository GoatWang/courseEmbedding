TRADITIONAL INVESTMENTS






  






RANGER INVESTMENTS
Ranger Investment Management’s quality growth oriented equities portfolios are managed with the objective of capturing and compounding returns in the small and mid-capitalization U.S. equity markets. The investment team’s high-conviction investment strategy is predicated on a thorough understanding of factors that influence an investment’s long-term value.  This approach reflects the team’s belief that focused portfolios not only present a greater likelihood of delivering returns differing significantly from the market average, but also of outperforming that average over the long term. Ranger believes quality stocks offer less risk and better odds of superior returns through full market cycles.




LEARN MORE











RANGER INTERNATIONAL
Ranger International Management specializes in global equity-income and growth, international equity and global equity strategies. In managing its income and growth strategy the investment team invests in multiple equity asset classes as it seeks to deliver meaningful income and capital gains.  Ranger International seeks stable, high quality international companies which can be purchased at attractive valuations. In each approach the investment team implements a bottom-up, fundamental research process to identify companies meeting its criteria for quality, financial strength and valuation. As a result of this disciplined approach, opportunity rather than benchmarks determines industry and country allocations.

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS






  






RANGER DIRECT LENDING
The Ranger Specialty Income strategy and Ranger Direct Lending strategy seek to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns, short duration and strong monthly cash flow relative to traditional fixed-income investment strategies. Ranger believes that debt instruments originated or issued by direct lending platforms are an attractive and growing asset class that have the potential to provide higher returns for investors than traditional credit markets.   Disintermediation of banks from traditional lending channels has contributed to the growth of the direct lending marketplace and presents an opportunity to participate in multiple sectors and variations of direct lending.




LEARN MORE












RANGER EQUITY BEAR
Ranger Alternative Management, L.P. is the investment manager responsible for managing the Ranger Equity Bear ETF (NYSE Ticker: HDGE). HDGE is the first actively managed ETF which invests on a short basis only in U.S. equities. HDGE invests with the objective of generating positive relative risk-adjusted returns. The investment team implements a bottom-up, fundamental, research driven security selection process seeking to identify securities with low earnings quality or aggressive accounting practices; practices which may be intended on the part of company management to mask operational deterioration and bolster reported financial performance over a short time period. In addition, Ranger seeks to identify earnings driven events that may act as a catalyst to the price decline of a security, such as downward earnings revisions or reduced forward guidance.

About Ranger Capital

Ranger Capital Group is an employee-owned investment company founded in 2001.  We provide full, back-office support for our investment teams, including operations, compliance, technology, marketing and distribution.
At Ranger, we are vigilant stewards of investors’ capital by maintaining the highest ethical standards. We build clients’ trust by favoring long-term returns over short-term gains.












  








  













Ranger’s founding values – outstanding client service, an innovative approach to investing, operating cost effectively, and acting with integrity – still guide us today






  








  











At Ranger, we’re all client service professionals.  From our leadership team to our newest hires, we share an unwavering focus on creating a better investment experience for our clients.  At the core of the decisions we make, no matter how small, we ask ourselves: “Is this the right choice for our clients?”
We encourage innovation and creative thinking, and believe that a mentality of “this is how we’ve always done it” is the enemy of success.  All Rangers have the authority to bring new ideas forward and see where they lead. Because we understand that every great idea began as a new idea.












  








  











Ranger Client Services
Ranger’s client service group keeps our current and prospective clients informed and well represented.  Merely meeting your expectations is not enough; we’re here to exceed them.
Contact Us Today












  













  








  











We operate efficiently and effectively, so that our firm can withstand and thrive in constantly changing markets.  This means constantly improving how we do business, understanding the difference between practices that make sense and those that need replacing.
We etched integrity into our company’s DNA at our founding.  It’s been a critical part of how we do business ever since.  All of our employees, regardless of their title, understand that making the ethical decision is what it means to be a Ranger.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Dorman Products (NASDAQ:DORM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: $78.00 (1.38% upside)
