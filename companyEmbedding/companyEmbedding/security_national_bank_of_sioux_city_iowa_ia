I love this bank. It is the only place I know that you talk to a live person. No button pushing to speak to this person or that department. If I have a question or problem they all know what to do and how to address it.
Robin F.






Received a call yesterday from the Security National Bank Fraud Dept. They had detected a suspicious internet purchase a couple weeks ago to Victoria Secret, that we had not done. Thank you so much for watching our accounts.
Reginald M.






Recently moved back and switched to Security because our old bank was closing. Everything was very quick and easy upon signing up. I really like the people and they have lots of locations around town. They have an app which is nice and easy to navigate. I would definitely recommend Security.
Shelby C.






Switched to Security National Bank from Wells Fargo, very satisfied with the switching process. Always have convenient hours and locations, and very friendly employees to assist me. Variety of banking options to suit all my banking needs, would definitely recommend Security to all my friends and family!
Bev B.

I love this bank. It is the only place I know that you talk to a live person. No button pushing to speak to this person or that department. If I have a question or problem they all know what to do and how to address it.
Robin F.






Received a call yesterday from the Security National Bank Fraud Dept. They had detected a suspicious internet purchase a couple weeks ago to Victoria Secret, that we had not done. Thank you so much for watching our accounts.
Reginald M.






Recently moved back and switched to Security because our old bank was closing. Everything was very quick and easy upon signing up. I really like the people and they have lots of locations around town. They have an app which is nice and easy to navigate. I would definitely recommend Security.
Shelby C.






Switched to Security National Bank from Wells Fargo, very satisfied with the switching process. Always have convenient hours and locations, and very friendly employees to assist me. Variety of banking options to suit all my banking needs, would definitely recommend Security to all my friends and family!

We'll invest in you long before there is any conversation around money.
Our first priority is to understand you. Where you are in life. Where you want to go. We look for opportunities in places other banks may see challenges. But as a bank who sees every account as a name and face, not a series of numbers, what else would we do?



Community Involvement
The only way for a bank to truly give its customers the service they deserve is to be a part of their community. And when you belong to something as special as that, well, investing time and money in places just a few sidewalks away becomes the natural thing to do.

About Security National Bank
To learn about a bank, you’ve got to know the men and women behind it. We could talk up our financial offering or rattle off some corporate values- but at the end of the day, a bank without people is just a glorified safe. For more than a century, Security National Bank has helped local families, businesses and communities achieve financial success with more confidence and ease. Our heritage is firmly rooted in values of service, integrity and local community commitment.
