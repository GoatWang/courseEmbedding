Investment Strategy | Delphi Management




























Home//Team//Scott M. Black//Evan Campbell, CFA//James Garrett, CFA//Colin Mansfield//Investment Strategy//Media & Contact us








             Over Thirty Years of Solid Performance          
We pursue a proven value investing strategy that emphasizes the fundamental performance of underlying companies.  We only invest in companies that meet our internally developed set of rigorous quantitative criteria and that are under good management.  As disciples of the Graham-Dodd school of value investing, this means we believe that an investment candidate should only be purchased at a low absolute valuation.  Additionally, it means that we personally contact management at every company in which we invest.
Delphi Management invests only in equity securities of US-listed companies, and takes only long positions.
Delphi offers two products:
1) The All-Capitalization portfolio, which invests in businesses that meet Delphi’s strict quantitative and qualitative criteria regardless of market capitalization.
2) The Small/Mid-Capitalization portfolio, which applies the same criteria as above, but with an emphasis on companies with market capitalizations below the high end of the Russell 2500 Value Index.
 
Delphi Management is a Registered Investment Adviser (RIA).

             Strong In-House Research   Solid Results          
“There’s an old adage, supposedly attributed to Warren Buffett, which says anyone who could pick the market, you’d love to be his broker, but not his partner…
My point is that when you try to pick the market based upon rational assumptions, it seems like you are always wrong. It is better to stay fully invested by buying good businesses that are statistically cheap and forgetting about the market overall.”
Scott Black
Barron’s Rountable ‘98
January 19, 1998
We don’t try to guess which way the market is going –  we are only concerned with whether an investment i) is a good business and ii) can be purchased at a cheap price in the marketplace. To do this we rely on our in-house research staff, dedicated to understanding the ins and outs of every investment we make.

“I highly recommend Delphi Construction for any work you have related to construction adjacent to occupied residences. Delphi showed not only precision in the construction process, but also managed the process in a way that residents and staff were able to continue to live and work in the midst of it all.” Rev. Herbert Taylor, President and CEO Deaconess Abundant Life Communities “Delphi consistently performs all their work in a safe, sensitive, clean and expeditious manner without disruption to our ongoing activities. I highly recommend Delphi Construction to anyone pursuing a large scale residential project, particularly one involving continuing occupancy.” George Senerth, Jr., VP of Project Management, Masonic Health System “Delphi has always endeavored to minimize any added expense to us, and has been generous with their efforts beyond what is called for in their contract, taking a genuine interest in the needs and concerns of St. Christopher’s Church.” Bruce Wood, Chair, Building Committee St. Christopher’s Episcopal Church “Delphi surprised us by consistently bringing up issues before we thought of them.”Erik Jarnryd, CEO Harvey Industries“Their Work always proceeds smoothly and with minimal disruption to our ongoing operations – even in our busiest and most demanding environments.”Colin MacLachlan, Facilities Manager Emerson Hospital“Without exception, all of the feedback from everyone involved with Delphi was 100% positive. The quality of work was superior and timeliness was excellent.”Norman H. Gopin, President Elite Management and Development Corp.
