Popular Appoints John W. Diercksen to Board of Directors






October 01, 2013 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Popular, Inc. (NASDAQ: BPOP) announced today that John W. Diercksen has 
      been appointed to the Board of Directors.
    


      Mr. Diercksen, 64, was Executive Vice President of Verizon 
      Communications, Inc., a leading provider of telecommunications and 
      broadband services, with revenues of over $100 billion, until September 
      2013. Mr. Diercksen was responsible for key strategic initiatives 
      related to the review and assessment of potential mergers, acquisitions 
      and divestitures.
    

      Mr. Diercksen serves on the boards of directors of Harman International 
      Industries, Incorporated and Intelsat, S.A.
    

      From 2003 to 2012, Mr. Diercksen was Executive Vice President, Strategy, 
      Development, and Planning for Verizon. In this capacity he was 
      instrumental in forging Verizon’s strategy of technology investment and 
      repositioning its assets through the acquisition of spectrum including 
      the cable spectrum transaction; the merger with MCI; the Alltel 
      acquisition; the restructuring of international units; the spinoff of 
      Verizon's directories unit and landline assets, and the Terremark and 
      Cloud Switch acquisitions. Earlier in his career, Mr. Diercksen held a 
      series of increasingly senior financial and leadership roles with 
      Verizon, Bell Atlantic, and Nynex, among others.
    

      “We are delighted that John has agreed to join our Board of Directors,” 
      said Richard L. Carrión, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of 
      Popular. “He brings extensive experience in mergers, acquisitions and 
      financial management. I’m confident he will be a valuable addition to 
      our Board.”
    

      Mr. Diercksen holds an MBA from Pace University and his Bachelor of 
      Business Administration in finance from Iona College.
    

      About Popular, Inc.
    

      Founded in 1893, Popular, Inc. is the leading banking institution by 
      both assets and deposits in Puerto Rico and ranks 36th by assets among 
      U.S. banks. In the United States, Popular has established a 
      community-banking franchise providing a broad range of financial 
      services and products with branches in New York, New Jersey, Illinois, 
      Florida and California.
