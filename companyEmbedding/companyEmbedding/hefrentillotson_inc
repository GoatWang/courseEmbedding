BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 02/01/1977
            

                BBB has determined that Hefren-Tillotson Inc meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

HT Announces Three New Financial Advisors in Wexford Office





Written by Corporate Communications
December 30, 2015

Hefren-Tillotson, Inc., one of Western Pennsylvanias largest investment advisory and financial planning firms, has announced the addition of three new Financial Advisors in its Wexford office.
Benjamin Burkley, Tamara Serafini and Chad Edwards will be responsible for the growth and maintenance of client portfolios with a focus on financial planning including investments, insurance, and retirement.
Burkley holds Series 7 and 66 licenses and a B.A. Degree in Economics from Grove City College. Prior to joining Hefren-Tillotson, he was an advisor and product performance analyst with Absolute Capital Management, and prior to that was employed at Federated Investors and Edward Jones.
 
Serafini holds Series 6, 63, 26, 7 and 65 licenses as well as her Life, Health, LTC and Variable Life Insurance license. A graduate of the University of Nebraska with a B.S. Degree in Psychology and Biology, Serafini was previously employed with Trilogy Financial Services in Tempe, Arizona, and SIMWEY Financial Group.
 
Edwards has spent a significant portion of his career as a mortgage and loan specialist with Dollar Bank and most recently as assistant vice president of private banking managing a portfolio of high net worth individuals. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh with a B.A. degree in Economics, Edwards received several awards during his tenure at Dollar Bank including being named a Five Star Mortgage Professional in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
“As our firm continues to expand, we are pleased to add Ben, Tamara and Chad to our team in Wexford,” said Kim Tillotson Fleming, Hefren-Tillotson Chief Executive Officer. “Their experiences will add diversity and expertise to our service offering as well as continue to meet individual client needs in Pittsburghs growing northern suburbs.”
The Hefren-Tillotson Wexford office is located in the Stonewood East Building, 4001 Stonewood Drive. The company announced plans in June to construct and occupy in 2016 a 40,000 square-foot office building on Perry Highway in Wexford.
