Summary
As a researcher, I am investigating the behaviour of metals critical for our modern economy in earth systems.  I am specifically focused on those metals concentrated by deep weathering processes in surface systems and have projects focused on looking at cobalt and rare earth metals in particular.  Other interests include investigating the links between mineral deposit formation and the earths geodynamic history and the association of mineral deposit formation and biota in the deep ocean. My work involves collaboration with industry and the results of my research provide them with new information enabling better and more sustainable mining techniques to be considered. As current Head of Department I am keen to develop our staff and collections whilst facilitating our diverse science programme in line with the Science Strategy of the NHM.

Introduction






Summary
As a researcher, I am investigating the behaviour of metals critical for our modern economy in earth systems.  I am specifically focused on those metals concentrated by deep weathering processes in surface systems and have projects focused on looking at cobalt and rare earth metals in particular.  Other interests include investigating the links between mineral deposit formation and the earths geodynamic history and the association of mineral deposit formation and biota in the deep ocean. My work involves collaboration with industry and the results of my research provide them with new information enabling better and more sustainable mining techniques to be considered. As current Head of Department I am keen to develop our staff and collections whilst facilitating our diverse science programme in line with the Science Strategy of the NHM.

Herrington’s has grown from a small wooden storefront in the late-1800s, into a premier lumber and building material supply business, with design and architectural services, at six locations in three states. What hasn’t changed? For more than 100 years, we’ve been family-owned and family-operated.



  
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

Our company opened circa 1865 in a small wooden storefront by the railroad tracks of Hillsdale, NY. Founded by Geo. M. Bullock, Edmond Herrington became his partner in the early 1900s. The company became known as Bullock and Herrington, which provided coal, lumber and feed for Hillsdale, NY and surrounding villages. Proximity to the rail station provided convenience for receiving lumber and supplies shipments during this time when horse and wagon were the mode of transportation. Deliveries may have been made in wagons like this Democrat Wagon (photo), once owned by Burt Herrington, the eldest of Edmond Herrington’s three sons.Edmond later became the sole proprietor of ED HERRINGTON, a dealer in coal, lumber, cement and building supplies. A 1937 invoice recorded a sale of six bags of cement for a total of $4.20.   Three of Edmond’s sons—Burt, Curt and Richard—worked for the family business throughout the 1930s–1950s. Visionary Richard (Dick) E. Herrington eventually became president of the company. Anticipating increasing opportunity in building products, he moved away from feed and grain sales.  As home heating preferences shifted, he phased out coal and added fuel oil for sale. By the time he incorporated the company in 1953 as ED HERRINGTON, INC., the business was a full service hardware, lumber, millwork, paint and fuel oil business. In the early 1960s, Richard’s son, Edmond (Ed) Beebe Herrington, joined the business. By the 1970s, the company added kitchen and bath cabinetry, and design, and the fuel oil business became a separate company known as Herrington Fuels. In 1976, Richard sold the business to Ed.  In the 1980s Ed modernized the company with a computer system achieving greater efficiencies in sales and inventory management. He also added bluestone to the product mix to serve the increasing demand for home landscaping improvements. The 1990s brought a boom to the home building industry, and an addition to the Hillsdale store more than doubled retail and office space. The company enhanced building materials services by adding on-staff estimators, outside salespeople, window and door specialists, and architectural representatives. We also added specialized delivery vehicles, including boom trucks, hired more kitchen and bath designers, masonry and paint specialists to meet the growing needs of customers.In 1998, Ed Herrington, Inc. purchased Community Service, a lumber, hardware and building materials business, adding several locations in CT and Dutchess County, NY. A few years later, the company opened a window and door, and kitchen and bath showplace in Lakeville, CT, where customers could experience products in built-in settings.In 2008, Herrington’s expanded again with the purchase of Dunn Builder’s Supply, adding stores in Hudson, NY and Chatham, NY to our Hillsdale, NY, Millerton, NY and Lakeville, CT locations. The company now boasts a drive thru lumberyard and a countertop fabrication “top shop” at our Hudson location.
Ed Herrington, Inc. purchased the assets of DeVries Building Supply, Inc. of Sheffield, MA in 2015. Herrington's hardware store and lumber yard on Berkshire School Road in Sheffield now offers a convenient location for the building and renovation needs of Berkshire County customers.Thanks to Herrington’s knowledgeable employees and loyal customers, we continue to thrive as a family business. Ed’s son, Richard B. Herrington, is part owner and Vice President/General Manager, and his eldest daughter, Allison Neumann, is part owner and Marketing Manager. Ed Herrington, Inc. looks forward to continuing our tradition of being a respected employer and trusted provider of quality lumber and building materials to fine home builders, home renovators, remodelers, trades people and homeowners for many years to come.

Perfect Safety Product
This is the best DOOR JAMMING product that I have found.  Small size allows you to pack it easily, but works like a giant.

On the Small Side
Let me just say I read the other reviews and found that as expected the product was on the "small side".  It's well made, as far as I can tell and setting it up was very easy. The only thing in "testing" it, is that the door still could be "opened" just slightly.  We tightened it down and then tried it again and the door opened just a little bit less.  I think personally that if someone wanted into the room this would not completely stop them from just kicking in the door. I do believe the door frame would crack before the stopper would. But by that time, enough noise would occur and you would be well awake to deal with whoever was coming through the door. I was not convinced that it had a super grip on the carpet, and did not test it further to see if it would "slide" over the carpet nap but it held the door closed and that is what I wanted.  For it's price and size, ease of use and portability, it works well for what I wanted it for.  I would recommend this for anyone with a door that doesn't lock for added security. Works best with a light weight door or a heavier one, so it's versatile.

Thank you for your feedback on the DoorJammer.  Once properly installed, the door should not "open slightly".  There may be a little wiggle room, but the door should not open at all.  Our supplier indicated that if the space between the door and the floor is greater than 1 1/4", you may experience a less sturdy result.  When properly installed, the DoorJammer won't budge!  We're pleased to hear that overall, you are happy with this product.

I purchased this for a friend who lives in the country and has one door that does't lock properly. I'm hoping this works for her. I will let you know how that works after she uses it!
