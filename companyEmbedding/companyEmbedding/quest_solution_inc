Asset Management Software Request A QuoteiTrack (Internet Tracking System) is a management tool that tracks the deployment of hardware devices and each device’s repair history in the field.When a device is damaged or found defective, iTrack provides the ability to log all aspects of the device’s repair process until it returns to the field.  In addition, the system provides tracking and documentation to ensure all needed actions are taken to complete the repair: proper shipping, manufacturer repair, and the return of the device to the field.  In conjunction with repair management, warranties on all components can be monitored and managed through the repair process.How it WorksEach device is tracked by a serial number or asset tag ID.  As the unit moves through the repair process, the system tracks the technician, repair facility, root cause, repairs completed, parts used, and additional testing as well as various other data elements.
The system also tracks units as they move through the repair process, providing lists of devices that are awaiting authorization for repair and devices that are ready for repair.  The system has the ability to track devices in the field by location.  Once the repair is complete, the system allows the shipping department to log the destination, shipper, and tracking number.  The repair tracking system links to any carrier to provide the shipment tracking information.ReportsThe iTrack system includes a series of reports that provide a view of the service history for electronic devices, including mobile and wireless products.  The reports are provided to give visibility of common failures in the field as well as a complete service history of units by location.  This allows visibility to specific locations that may be experiencing unusually high repairs. Reports are provided in a standard format available over the web.

RFID Solutions Request A QuoteQuest Solution provides customers with industry-leading RFID software options in order to ensure success for their operations.A complete RFID platform includes tags, readers, printers, antennas, and software.  The ideal RFID software is essential to the performance and peak efficiency of your overall RFID solution.  RFID software yields the ability to read RFID tags without establishing a line of sight or a specific orientation that barcode readers require.  This makes it possible to automatically scan items as they pass through a portal or on a conveyor, eliminating the need for extra labor to do the job.The Benefits of RFID Software
Less handling of items and no need to set a line of sight increases productivity.
Tracking items with end-to-end visibility from the beginning of processes through to completion.
Providing real-time data to allow you to respond quickly to issues and to make informed business decisions.
Automating data collection so it is more reliable and accurate than manual data entry or bar code scanning.
Partner with Quest SolutionQuest Solution will help you determine the feasibility of RFID for your operation. If you are ready to deploy, our experts can help you find the right RFID hardware and software for your application, and, if necessary, customize a solution to address your unique needs. We leverage our partnerships with the top RFID hardware and software technology providers to assist customers in the design, integration, deployment, management and support of a turn-key solution.

Quest offers mobile computers including handhelds, vehicle mounts, wearables, and RFID devices.Handheld ComputersThe variety of handheld computer models allows you to choose the best features and options for your operations.

Vehicle mount mobile computers can be configured with full screens or half-screens, and can include integrated GPS and image capture. Their thin design facilitates mounting and use in a vehicle, and several mounting options are also available.Wearable ComputersWearable computers can help move materials through your warehouse or other operations more quickly, by keeping your employees’ hands free to handle materials and their eyes on the job. These rugged wearable computers deliver the reliable performance you need in these fast-paced environments. Many models feature voice and data compatibility to help you maximize efficiency and accuracy. Wearable computer accessories include headsets and cordless scanners, and you can choose from hip- or wrist-mounted configurations.RFID ReadersRFID readers provide accurate, medium- to long-range radio frequency identification reads in just about any environment. Available in models designed for both business and industrial class, these RFID readers provide comfortable ergonomic use, whether on the retail show floor, back of house, or the warehouse. Many models feature a non-glare screen for use as your workers move from sunlight to indoor lighting, and some models have integrated barcode readers.
