Keap Co. | Made in NYC




























































Keap Co.

























Born out of a passion for good design and a frustration with being overcharged and underserved by existing candle brands, we’re on a mission to make candles better. 
We’re re-thinking from the ground up how the scented candle buying experience should work today. By cutting out the middlemen and shipping directly to you, we can provide the highest quality scented candles, with thoughtful design and craftsmanship, at a wallet-friendly price. And by buying our candles, you allow us to fulfill our social mission: to bring affordable and sustainable light to families without access to the electrical grid (via our charitable partnership with SolarAid).
Keap. Candles made better!

Keap1: ProductsKeap1 is a member of the Kelch family of proteins. Keap1 contains an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain that mediates homodimerization. When dimerized, six Kelch repeats on the extended C-terminus interact with and inactivate Nrf2, a potent transcriptional activator of detoxifying enzymes, providing a homeostatic brake on oxidative stress activity.

Keap: Athletic Shorts Reimagined




Eugene, OR

Product Design






$20,075


pledged of $5,000 goal




506


backers
















(Coral and Grey shorts are renderings, colors may differ slightly)Thanks everyone for your support, we are well on our way to a successful campaign! We are happy to announce that we have a new $10,000 stretch goal! If our project gets over $10,000 worth of funding, we will be able to release two new colors of shorts. Once the project has ended, you will be able to choose from all three colors, no matter when you pledged.New colors:1. Crisp Coral with Diamond White stitching 2. Summit Grey with Midnight Black stitchingThanks again to everyone who has supported us! #KeapItUp





Keap Athletics was born out of necessity. Our team was tired of our favorite companies designing our shorts with pockets that did not do the job.
Every pair of shorts we wore had pockets that were cut with a vertical opening. The problem? You sit down and all your stuff falls to the floor, into the couch or down the crack of your car seat.
We set out to create a remarkably simple solution. We experimented with zippers, velcro and double layered pockets, but none had the ease of access we were looking for. Our solution was simple, change the angle of the pocket. This simple change yields profoundly better results. 

























The heart and soul of the Keap athletic short is its custom designed, horizontally cut pocket. Measuring 11" deep, our pockets do a remarkable job of keeping your belongs safe. No other athletic shorts do a better job of combining security with functionality.The Keap athletic short is the ultimate modern short for the modern athlete. These shorts are a phenomenally lightweight 100% polyester fabric that is both comfortable and durable. These shorts have a 10.5" inseam cut that is perfectly tailored for a modern look and feel.Features a 2" waistband with an extra wide interior drawstring for comfort and have reinforced stitching at the pocket stress points.Shorts are exclusively available on Kickstarter in Midnight Black, with Diamond White stitching.




This is the problem:Everyone loves athletic shorts. They are comfortable, stylish and functional. BUT we also love our phones. Unfortunately our shorts do not seem to care about our phones quite as much as we do. Athletic shorts currently on the market do a miserable job of keeping your stuff securely in your pockets. The reason for this is actually quite simple, the vertically cut pockets open in the exact spot your stuff naturally sits.We set out to create a solution to this problem and are extremely proud of what we've designed for you. 




This is our solution:After identifying the root of the problem, we knew the first step was simple, eliminate the vertical opening from the pocket. We then began experimenting with different styles of pockets that opened horizontally.We eventually ended with a horizontal pocket that sits just under your hip, has a curved design and features an industry leading depth of 11 inches.As you can see in the GIF below, your phone is now remarkably secure.









Keap shorts are great everywhere, but they are REALLY great at the gym. Whether you're laying down on the bench press, running on the treadmill or in cycling class, the Keap shorts will keep your phone in your pocket instead of on the ground. You no longer need to keep your phone, keys and wallet on the dirty floor under your sweatshirt and pray that nobody starts snooping around your stuff. Now you can keep your stuff right by your side, safe and secure.





and of course they are scientifically proven to help you GET BUCKETS ;)

























Born in Nike's backyard, our team grew up wearing all things Nike. Collectively, we own over 50 pairs of their athletic shorts. Now as adults, we still wanted to wear our nike shorts, but couldn't trust our stuff to stay in our pockets. Unable to find a solution, we bought a sewing machine, and got to work.




Our goal was simple; create a better pocket. We started experimenting with zippers on our shorts but it was too annoying to constantly zip and unzip when pulling out our phone 1000x times per day. We moved to velcro... but decided to leave that for grandpa's shoes.Next was double layering the pockets. Unfortunately this ended up being even more inconvenient than the zipper and barely more secure than our other shorts.Several prototypes later, we solved it, and the answer is so simple. A horizontally cut, 11" deep pocket provides the perfect combination of convenience and security. 









This is our team. They are awesome.




JustusFor all of you who don't know me, My name is Justus and I'm the ORIGINAL founder for Keap. I'm now in charge of product design, product development and overseeing the manufacturing process. As a web developer by trade, I also make sure our website doesn't explode. Working at a start up allows for me to wear multiple hats, something I love.Keap all started for me after about the 1000th time of my phone falling out of my Nike dri-fit shorts. I said to myself, there has to be a better option out there. After tirelessly searching stores for shorts that would keep my stuff in, I eventually gave up looking and decided to make my own. I bought a sewing machine and began teaching myself to sew. Countless prototypes later, I had something that actually resembled a real pair of shorts and a functional pocket. I continued to refine the shorts and eventually began the process of manufacturing them. I have come a long way from where I started and am extremely proud of the product we have today. JordanMy name is Jordan and I love pizza... also I'm the head of business development here at Keap. I handle PR, advertising, sales and planning ice cream parties. My journey with Keap began after Justus secured the first sample of professionally manufactured shorts. They were not pretty, but I could finally grasp the idea and believed in what the product could become. Now after countless samples and changes, I am extremely stoked about the product we have today.The last 6 months have been an incredible experience and I couldn't be more excited for where this company is headed. Our Kickstarter launch on March 10th will just be the beginning of what I hope is a long and rewarding journey. Thank you for all your love and continued support!Nicole 
My name is Nicole and I'm Justus' wife. I'm the the real brains, and of course all the beauty. I play a more behind the scenes role here at Keap Athletics while we begin this part of the journey. I "Keap" the peace while we brainstorm new and inventive ideas for the company.


I am also in charge of accounting and customer relations, so if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask, my goal is to make sure you love our product! I am extremely proud of this product and I want you all to be too. 

Jess My name is Jess Lee. I'm another part of the amazing team at Keap! I'm a do it all kind of guy, giving help wherever it's needed and never complaining. I have been a part of Keap since the very beginning, working alongside Justus since the very first prototypes. We set out to create a remarkably simple solution to a common and annoying problem. It has been a long road to get where we are today, but I'm extremely proud of the work we've done and the product we have created. 




We wanted to offer our shorts at a price anybody could afford. In order to reach our $25 price point, the minimum order has to be ~400 pairs of shorts.We've spent a year, and over $5000 developing these shorts for you, and we're super excited to finally launch our athletic shorts.This Kickstarter campaign is huge for us. If our campaign is successful, it will validate the problem our product solves, and allow us to gain feedback to create a better product.
