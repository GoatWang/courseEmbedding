GANZ Corporate Profile




We deliver some of the best gifts in the world - giftware, fashion accessories, top-trending décor, baby fashion and huggable plush, garden, holiday and finishing touches for the home. Kissing Krystals and Crystal Expressions are some of the lines that make up our extensive family of products.
Established by Samuel Ganz and sons Jack and Sam in 1950,  this privately-held family company is now headed by the founder's grandson,  Howard Ganz. Corporate headquarters are located in Woodbridge, ON, Canada.
In the year 2000, we celebrated our 50th anniversary. GANZ  began selling plush products, and built on this success to include a wide range  of gift offerings, collectibles, seasonal gifts and home decor products.  Webkinz World and Webkinz Jr. have bridged the virtual world by combining plush  pets with interactive play.
GANZ has established a large dedicated sales force  throughout the United States and Canada and owes its prosperity not only to  effective distribution but also to product of the highest quality.




Distribution
The primary distribution channels are gift, specialty, and  department stores throughout the United States and Canada. We currently service  approximately 30,000 retail customers, and our list is growing!
A sophisticated ordering/fulfillment system is supplemented  by a fully computerized Customer Service Department. Products are sourced from  around the world and shipped to Toronto for North American distribution.
Quality Control
The company's quality control is considered to be among the best.
Here's why: as part of the development process, we have a  staff of product managers who monitor product development directly from the  GANZ Far East Operations Headquarters in Hong Kong, with support offices in  China. The highest standards of safety, material selection, design consistency,  and packaging are met before a GANZ product is shipped from the factory.
Sales
GANZ ensures the sales staff participates in a thorough  training program and learning continues to be supported by the field management  team. On a daily basis, the sales staff is notified of available inventory,  customer activity, new business initiatives, and promotions.
We run a fully staffed Sales Liaison Department to support  the sales staff in the field. Our state-of-the-art Marketing Department  provides complete production support.

(1) Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this offering.
    The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity.


There are many well-established manufacturing, distribution, wholesale, retail
and online sales companies in our industry. We expect to face medium to high
level of resistance, and it will be up to our marketing efforts and negotiation
skills to acquire customers. Most of our competitors have greater financial
resources than we do and will be able to withstand sales or price decreases
better than we are. We also expect to continue to face competition from new
market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these
existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.


Company Description
Plush Corporation was incorporated on October 20, 2015 under the laws of the
State of Nevada. Our business consists of designing, marketing and selling
luxury accessories for men online on our website at "www.myplushonline.com". The
first product we will launch after the completion of this offering


 will be
pocket squares, with further items being launched in the future as our business
becomes profitable and grows. We anticipate as the business grows to launch
ties, belts, watches, wallets, sunglasses, gloves, bow ties, tie bars, socks,
cufflinks, suspenders and scarves. Our goal is to secure a position as the
pinnacle one stop shop for men's luxury accessories.
