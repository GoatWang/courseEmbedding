Galena Biopharma (originally RXi Pharmaceuticals) is a publicly traded pharmaceutical company based in San Ramon, California. The company was founded in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 2011, it moved to Oregon,[1][2] and in 2015 moved to San Ramon, California.[3] Mark Schwartz is the company's president and chief executive officer.[4][5][6][7]

History[edit]
In November 2006, Argonaut Pharmaceuticals, Inc. changed the name to RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation.[2] RXi was a subsidiary of CytRx Corp., which provided $15 million in financing in April 2007.[8][9] RXi was founded in part by Nobel Prize winner Craig Mello.[8] In September 2007, RXi signed a licensing deal with TriLink Biotechnologies, a competitor in the RNA interference (RNAi) field, in which RXi would pay TriLink to use three of TriLink's technologies.[9]
In March 2011, the company announced the planned acquisition of Arizona-based Apthera, Inc. for $7 million. The acquisition included the breast cancer drug NeuVax.[10] In June 2011, NeuVax was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to start a stage three clinical trial.[11]
In September 2011, the company separated its cancer therapies division. It was renamed Galena Biopharma Inc and moved to Lake Oswego, Oregon.[1][10][12] RXi became a subsidiary of Galena and retained RNAi technologies.[12] RXi Pharmaceuticals remained in Massachusetts as a publicly traded company.[1] In January 2014, Galena bought Mills Pharmaceuticals.[13] In April 2014, the company headquarters moved to Portland.[14]
In November 2011, the company partnered with Genentech to combine drugs from each company for a cancer treatment.[15][16] Galena is currently studying the combination of NeuVax and Herceptin in phase II trials.[17]
Leadership[edit]
In March 2011, president and CEO Noah Beerman was replaced by Mark Ahn, and in August 2014, Ahn resigned and was replaced by Mark Schwartz.[6][7] On January 31, 2017, Galena announced the resignation of Mark Schwartz effective that day, and reported in the same press release that it would be exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value going forward.[18]
Stock[edit]
RXi went public in March 2008. CytRx retained 49% ownership of RXi's stock and gave shares of RXi to existing shareholders. Trading began on the NASDAQ market on March 12, 2008, under the ticker symbol of RXII.[19][20] Fidelity Investments invested $8.5 million in the company in May 2008,[21] followed by a $25 million private-equity investment by Yorkville in February 2009.[22] In 2010, RXi received a National Institutes of Health grant of $600,000.[23] By August 2010, the company had 30 employees.[23] In April 2011, RXi raised about $12 million from a stock offering[24] and received $580,000 in grants from the National Institutes of Health.[25] The company reported a loss of $11.5 million loss for 2011.[26][27]
In November 2012, an anonymous internet report caused Galena stock to decline. The company filed a lawsuit claiming the report was false and attempted to manipulate the stock.[28] In 2014, Galena was involved in a stock promotion scheme. Galena paid The DreamTeam Group $50,000 to write at least five promotional articles that appeared on Seeking Alpha. The articles carried no conflict of interest disclosure and were written by several pseudonyms. The stock price increased and insiders sold hundred of thousands of shares.[29] Galena disclosed the relationship with The DreamTeam Group to the SEC.[30][31][32] By March 2014, five lawsuits were filed against Galena and several of its officers alleging that the company used misleading articles to boost stock prices.[29][30] Motley Fool, discussing the 23% stock price drop during March 2015, noted there was stock dilution from the offering and also that Abstral's sales were below Galena's estimates from late 2013.[33] Discussing the Motley Fool article, Portland Business Journal also noted the ongoing insider-trading lawsuits as a factor in the stock price.[34] A few days later, Zacks Investment Research said Galena could be a "great candidate" to beat its earnings.[35] In response, Galena's CEO said there were many positive aspects to the company, and that the lawsuits weren't a worry as they should get covered under Directors and officers liability insurance.[36] The company moved to San Ramon, California, in the Bay Area in 2015.[3]
Products[edit]
Galena acquired the experimental breast cancer drug NeuVax in 2011 and are currently in phase II trials to combine the drug with Genentech's Herceptin.[37]
In 2013, Galena began selling its first developed drug, an analgesic for cancer pain named Abstral Sublingual.[4][38]
Anagrelide controlled-released (GALE-401) was approved by the FDA for phase III clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocytosis in December 2016.[39]
GALE-301 and GALE-302 are immunotherapies in phase I and II trials for ovarian and breast cancers.[40]

Galena Biopharma (originally RXi Pharmaceuticals) is a publicly traded pharmaceutical company based in San Ramon, California. The company was founded in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 2011, it moved to Oregon,[1][2] and in 2015 moved to San Ramon, California.[3] Mark Schwartz is the company's president and chief executive officer.[4][5][6][7]

History[edit]
In November 2006, Argonaut Pharmaceuticals, Inc. changed the name to RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation.[2] RXi was a subsidiary of CytRx Corp., which provided $15 million in financing in April 2007.[8][9] RXi was founded in part by Nobel Prize winner Craig Mello.[8] In September 2007, RXi signed a licensing deal with TriLink Biotechnologies, a competitor in the RNA interference (RNAi) field, in which RXi would pay TriLink to use three of TriLink's technologies.[9]
In March 2011, the company announced the planned acquisition of Arizona-based Apthera, Inc. for $7 million. The acquisition included the breast cancer drug NeuVax.[10] In June 2011, NeuVax was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to start a stage three clinical trial.[11]
In September 2011, the company separated its cancer therapies division. It was renamed Galena Biopharma Inc and moved to Lake Oswego, Oregon.[1][10][12] RXi became a subsidiary of Galena and retained RNAi technologies.[12] RXi Pharmaceuticals remained in Massachusetts as a publicly traded company.[1] In January 2014, Galena bought Mills Pharmaceuticals.[13] In April 2014, the company headquarters moved to Portland.[14]
In November 2011, the company partnered with Genentech to combine drugs from each company for a cancer treatment.[15][16] Galena is currently studying the combination of NeuVax and Herceptin in phase II trials.[17]
Leadership[edit]
In March 2011, president and CEO Noah Beerman was replaced by Mark Ahn, and in August 2014, Ahn resigned and was replaced by Mark Schwartz.[6][7] On January 31, 2017, Galena announced the resignation of Mark Schwartz effective that day, and reported in the same press release that it would be exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value going forward.[18]
Stock[edit]
RXi went public in March 2008. CytRx retained 49% ownership of RXi's stock and gave shares of RXi to existing shareholders. Trading began on the NASDAQ market on March 12, 2008, under the ticker symbol of RXII.[19][20] Fidelity Investments invested $8.5 million in the company in May 2008,[21] followed by a $25 million private-equity investment by Yorkville in February 2009.[22] In 2010, RXi received a National Institutes of Health grant of $600,000.[23] By August 2010, the company had 30 employees.[23] In April 2011, RXi raised about $12 million from a stock offering[24] and received $580,000 in grants from the National Institutes of Health.[25] The company reported a loss of $11.5 million loss for 2011.[26][27]
In November 2012, an anonymous internet report caused Galena stock to decline. The company filed a lawsuit claiming the report was false and attempted to manipulate the stock.[28] In 2014, Galena was involved in a stock promotion scheme. Galena paid The DreamTeam Group $50,000 to write at least five promotional articles that appeared on Seeking Alpha. The articles carried no conflict of interest disclosure and were written by several pseudonyms. The stock price increased and insiders sold hundred of thousands of shares.[29] Galena disclosed the relationship with The DreamTeam Group to the SEC.[30][31][32] By March 2014, five lawsuits were filed against Galena and several of its officers alleging that the company used misleading articles to boost stock prices.[29][30] Motley Fool, discussing the 23% stock price drop during March 2015, noted there was stock dilution from the offering and also that Abstral's sales were below Galena's estimates from late 2013.[33] Discussing the Motley Fool article, Portland Business Journal also noted the ongoing insider-trading lawsuits as a factor in the stock price.[34] A few days later, Zacks Investment Research said Galena could be a "great candidate" to beat its earnings.[35] In response, Galena's CEO said there were many positive aspects to the company, and that the lawsuits weren't a worry as they should get covered under Directors and officers liability insurance.[36] The company moved to San Ramon, California, in the Bay Area in 2015.[3]
Products[edit]
Galena acquired the experimental breast cancer drug NeuVax in 2011 and are currently in phase II trials to combine the drug with Genentech's Herceptin.[37]
In 2013, Galena began selling its first developed drug, an analgesic for cancer pain named Abstral Sublingual.[4][38]
Anagrelide controlled-released (GALE-401) was approved by the FDA for phase III clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocytosis in December 2016.[39]
GALE-301 and GALE-302 are immunotherapies in phase I and II trials for ovarian and breast cancers.[40]

Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
The information set forth in Item 8.01 herein is incorporated by reference into
this Item 3.02.
Galena Biopharma, Inc. (the "Company") anticipates that the Settlement Stock
(defined below) will be issued, pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation of
Settlement to be negotiated by the parties, in a transaction that is exempt from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act. The terms
and conditions of the issuance of the Settlement Stock are subject to approval
by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, pursuant to a hearing
concerning the fairness of such terms and conditions at which all persons to
whom the Settlement Stock would be issued, following the receipt of adequate
notice, are permitted to attend.


Item 8.01 Other Events.



On July 24, 2017, the Company entered into a binding settlement term sheet,
which the parties will use to enter into a Stipulation of Settlement that is
intended to settle the litigation currently pending in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (the "Court"), captioned In re Galena Biopharma, Inc., C.
A. No. 2017-0423-JTL. The settlement resolves the putative stockholder class
action claims against the Company and/or certain of its current and former
officers and directors (the "Defendants"), as well as the Company's petition to
validate certain corporate actions. The settlement will not become effective
until approved by the Court.
Under the terms of the settlement, the class will receive a settlement payment
of $1.3 million, in addition to attorney fees in an amount to be approved. The
settlement payment of $1.3 million consists of $50,000 in cash to be paid by the
Defendants or their insurers and $1,250,000 in unrestricted shares of the
Company's common stock ("Settlement Stock"), which valuation will be based on
the volume-weighted average closing price for the 20 trading days immediately
preceding the day before the transfer of the Settlement Stock to the settlement
fund pursuant to the terms and conditions of the settlement. Any amounts awarded
by the Court for attorneys' fees will be paid in part by the settlement fund and
in part by the Company's insurance carriers.
Upon the effectiveness of the proposed settlement, the Defendants will be
released from the claims that were asserted or could have been asserted in the
class action by class members participating in the settlement.

Galena Biopharma (originally RXi Pharmaceuticals) is a publicly traded pharmaceutical company based in San Ramon, California. The company was founded in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 2011, it moved to Oregon,[1][2] and in 2015 moved to San Ramon, California.[3] Mark Schwartz is the company's president and chief executive officer.[4][5][6][7]

History[edit]
In November 2006, Argonaut Pharmaceuticals, Inc. changed the name to RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation.[2] RXi was a subsidiary of CytRx Corp., which provided $15 million in financing in April 2007.[8][9] RXi was founded in part by Nobel Prize winner Craig Mello.[8] In September 2007, RXi signed a licensing deal with TriLink Biotechnologies, a competitor in the RNA interference (RNAi) field, in which RXi would pay TriLink to use three of TriLink's technologies.[9]
In March 2011, the company announced the planned acquisition of Arizona-based Apthera, Inc. for $7 million. The acquisition included the breast cancer drug NeuVax.[10] In June 2011, NeuVax was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to start a stage three clinical trial.[11]
In September 2011, the company separated its cancer therapies division. It was renamed Galena Biopharma Inc and moved to Lake Oswego, Oregon.[1][10][12] RXi became a subsidiary of Galena and retained RNAi technologies.[12] RXi Pharmaceuticals remained in Massachusetts as a publicly traded company.[1] In January 2014, Galena bought Mills Pharmaceuticals.[13] In April 2014, the company headquarters moved to Portland.[14]
In November 2011, the company partnered with Genentech to combine drugs from each company for a cancer treatment.[15][16] Galena is currently studying the combination of NeuVax and Herceptin in phase II trials.[17]
Leadership[edit]
In March 2011, president and CEO Noah Beerman was replaced by Mark Ahn, and in August 2014, Ahn resigned and was replaced by Mark Schwartz.[6][7] On January 31, 2017, Galena announced the resignation of Mark Schwartz effective that day, and reported in the same press release that it would be exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value going forward.[18]
Stock[edit]
RXi went public in March 2008. CytRx retained 49% ownership of RXi's stock and gave shares of RXi to existing shareholders. Trading began on the NASDAQ market on March 12, 2008, under the ticker symbol of RXII.[19][20] Fidelity Investments invested $8.5 million in the company in May 2008,[21] followed by a $25 million private-equity investment by Yorkville in February 2009.[22] In 2010, RXi received a National Institutes of Health grant of $600,000.[23] By August 2010, the company had 30 employees.[23] In April 2011, RXi raised about $12 million from a stock offering[24] and received $580,000 in grants from the National Institutes of Health.[25] The company reported a loss of $11.5 million loss for 2011.[26][27]
In November 2012, an anonymous internet report caused Galena stock to decline. The company filed a lawsuit claiming the report was false and attempted to manipulate the stock.[28] In 2014, Galena was involved in a stock promotion scheme. Galena paid The DreamTeam Group $50,000 to write at least five promotional articles that appeared on Seeking Alpha. The articles carried no conflict of interest disclosure and were written by several pseudonyms. The stock price increased and insiders sold hundred of thousands of shares.[29] Galena disclosed the relationship with The DreamTeam Group to the SEC.[30][31][32] By March 2014, five lawsuits were filed against Galena and several of its officers alleging that the company used misleading articles to boost stock prices.[29][30] Motley Fool, discussing the 23% stock price drop during March 2015, noted there was stock dilution from the offering and also that Abstral's sales were below Galena's estimates from late 2013.[33] Discussing the Motley Fool article, Portland Business Journal also noted the ongoing insider-trading lawsuits as a factor in the stock price.[34] A few days later, Zacks Investment Research said Galena could be a "great candidate" to beat its earnings.[35] In response, Galena's CEO said there were many positive aspects to the company, and that the lawsuits weren't a worry as they should get covered under Directors and officers liability insurance.[36] The company moved to San Ramon, California, in the Bay Area in 2015.[3]
Products[edit]
Galena acquired the experimental breast cancer drug NeuVax in 2011 and are currently in phase II trials to combine the drug with Genentech's Herceptin.[37]
In 2013, Galena began selling its first developed drug, an analgesic for cancer pain named Abstral Sublingual.[4][38]
Anagrelide controlled-released (GALE-401) was approved by the FDA for phase III clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocytosis in December 2016.[39]
GALE-301 and GALE-302 are immunotherapies in phase I and II trials for ovarian and breast cancers.[40]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Galena Biopharma Provides Corporate Update




















July 12, 2017 06:30 ET

 | Source: Galena Biopharma, Inc.






SAN RAMON, Calif., July  12, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Galena Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:GALE), a biopharmaceutical company developing hematology and oncology therapeutics that address unmet medical needs, today announced an update on the status of the Company and its most advanced clinical development program.  Galena’s primary focus is the evaluation of strategic alternatives initiated in the first quarter of this year.  With the support of Canaccord Genuity, Galena has had extensive interactions with numerous companies to explore options for monetizing some or all of its clinical development programs through a license or sale of the assets, and/or transforming the Company via a sale, merger, reverse merger, or business combination with another company. While Galena is working through its strategic alternatives process, management has significantly reduced the staffing levels and certain operational expenses to preserve cash, although work remains ongoing to advance its two core clinical programs, GALE-401 and NeuVax™ (nelipepimut-S), and maintain their value. For NeuVax, Galena continues to support the ongoing investigator sponsored studies, and today provided an update on the Phase 2b trial in node positive and triple negative HER2 IHC 1+/2+ patients in combination with trastuzumab. According to the latest report from the clinical research organization (CRO) conducting the trial, the study is nearly fully enrolled with 293 of the 300 patients enrolled to date.  At the current pace, the CRO expects enrollment of the final 7 patients over the next few weeks with the interim analysis performed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board to occur six months after the final patient is enrolled.   Separately, Galena filed an S-1 registration statement  (post effective amendment to S-3 on Form S-1) today to address our current S-3 ineligibility.  The purpose of the S-1 registration statement, as filed, is to register currently outstanding warrants as we had notified warrant holders that we would update the ineffective S-3 through such a filing.  All of the warrants are out of the money. “While I am relatively new to Galena, I understand the road many of our shareholders have traveled in their investment with the Company, and I am very focused on seeking the best possible outcome from our strategic process that will maximize the opportunity for a financial return,” stated Stephen F. Ghiglieri, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. “Given the challenges that Galena has faced, we are diligently addressing all aspects of our business and proactively removing potential impediments to executing a transaction. Reducing our expenses and simplifying our capital structure is paramount for us as we work to successfully complete the strategic alternative process.  To that end, I want to thank our shareholders for the ratification vote we received on July 6, 2017, as it helps to clarify the capital structure of the Company and should enable us to complete our strategic alternatives process.” Mr. Ghiglieri continued, “Thus far, we have had initial interest in potential transactions from a number of companies.  Though this process is still evolving, we are committed to updating the market as key events unfold. My goal is to find the best available option, or options, for the Company and our assets to bring value to our shareholders. We appreciate the patience and continued support from our shareholders during this period.”  About NeuVax™ (nelipepimut-S) NeuVax™ (nelipepimut-S) is a first-in-class, HER2-directed cancer immunotherapy under evaluation to prevent breast cancer recurrence after standard of care treatment in the adjuvant setting.  It is the immunodominant peptide derived from the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein, a well-established target for therapeutic intervention in breast carcinoma. The nelipepimut-S sequence stimulates specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) following binding to specific HLA molecules on antigen presenting cells (APC). These activated specific CTLs recognize, neutralize and destroy, through cell lysis, HER2 expressing cancer cells, including occult cancer cells and micrometastatic foci. The nelipepimut-S immune response can also generate CTLs to other immunogenic peptides through inter- and intra-antigenic epitope spreading.   In clinical studies, NeuVax is combined with recombinant granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). NeuVax is currently in two breast cancer studies in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin®; Genentech/Roche): a Phase 2b trial in node positive and triple negative HER2 IHC 1+/2+ (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01570036); and, a Phase 2 trial in high risk, node positive or negative HER2 IHC 3+ patients (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02297698).  A Phase 2 clinical trial is also screening patients with NeuVax in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02636582), and a Phase 2 trial is planned in patients with gastric cancer. About Breast Cancer1 New cases of breast cancer occur at an annual rate of 125 per 100,000 women in the U.S., with an estimated 246,660 new cases and 40,450 deaths in 2016. Approximately 89.7% of breast cancer patients are expected to survive five years after diagnosis. Approximately 12.4% of women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point during their lifetime (2011 – 2013 data).  The prevalence data from 2013 showed an estimated 3,053,450 women living with breast cancer in the United States.  Of these women, only about 25% are HER2 positive (IHC 3+). NeuVax targets approximately 50%-60% of these women who are HER2 low to intermediate (IHC 1+/2+ or FISH < 2.0) and achieve remission with current standard of care, but have no available HER2-targeted adjuvant treatment options to maintain their disease-free status. 1National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program About Galena Biopharma Galena Biopharma, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company developing hematology and oncology therapeutics that address unmet medical needs. Galena’s pipeline consists of multiple mid-to-late-stage clinical assets led by its hematology asset, GALE-401, and its novel cancer immunotherapy programs including NeuVax™ (nelipepimut-S) and GALE-301/GALE-302.

  Department of Health and Human ServicesPublic Health ServiceFood and Drug Administration Seattle DistrictPacific Region22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210Bothell, WA 98021 Telephone:      425-302-0340FAX:      425-302-0402  April 3, 2015  OVERNIGHT DELIVERYSIGNATURE REQUIRED In reply refer to Warning Letter SEA 15-12 Mark W. Schwartz, Ph.D.President and Chief Executive OfficerGalena Biopharma, Inc.291 Discovery Bay BoulevardDiscovery Bay, California 94505 WARNING LETTER Dear Dr. Schwartz: The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your firm, Galena Biopharma, Inc., located at 4640 SW Macadam Avenue, Suite 270, Portland, Oregon, between November 17 and 21, 2014. The inspection focused on your firm’s compliance with Postmarketing Adverse Drug Experience (PADE) reporting requirements and Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) for Finished Pharmaceuticals relating to Abstral (fentanyl) sublingual tablets, NDA-022510, approved by FDA on January 7, 2011, and acquired by your firm on May 1, 2013; and Zuplenz (ondansetron) oral soluble film, NDA-022524, approved by FDA on July 2, 2010, and acquired by your firm on August 13, 2014.  Our inspection revealed serious violations of FDA’s PADE reporting requirements under section 505(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 355(k)] and Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Part 314.80. At the conclusion of the inspection, your firm was issued a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, which listed instances where your firm failed to comply with PADE requirements under section 505(k)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 355(k)(1)] and 21 CFR 314.80. Failure to comply with section 505(k) and its corresponding regulations under 21 CFR 314.80 is a prohibited act under section 301(e) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(e)].  We acknowledge your firm’s December 11, 2014, written response to the Form FDA 483. From our review of the FDA establishment inspection report, the documents submitted with that report, and your firm’s written response, we conclude that your firm did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and FDA regulations governing PADE reporting. Specific violations include, but are not limited to, the following: 1.    Failure to develop adequate written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experiences from all sources as required by 21 CFR 314.80(b).  Your firm does not have adequate written procedures to ensure that adverse drug experiences (ADEs) are detected, correctly identified, assessed, and reported to FDA in accordance with postmarketing regulations. Specifically, the draft Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provided during the inspection, “Product Complaints” and “Post Marketing Reporting of Serious Adverse Events,” failed to adequately address regulatory requirements to ensure that (1) ADE information obtained from any source is promptly conveyed to the appropriate Galena Biopharma, Inc. personnel for evaluation; (2) ADEs that are evaluated as 15-day Alert reports are promptly investigated and all attempts to obtain follow-up information about the ADEs are recorded, as required by 21 CFR 314.80(c)(1)(ii);and (3) an FDA Form 3500A for each ADE not reported as a 15-day Alert reportunder 21 CFR 314.80(c)(1)(i) is submitted in the correct format and on time. During the inspection, your staff indicated that the initial receipt of postmarketing ADEs for Abstral is contracted out to a call center, and the call center forwards ADE reports to a centralized (b)(4). Draft SOPs reviewed during the inspection require product complaints to be logged in by Quality Assurance staff for an investigation and cases to be created in the safety database or logged on (b)(4) for special interest reports and adverse events by the pharmacovigilance staff. However, the SOPs do not include: who at your firm is responsible for retrieving reports forwarded to the (b)(4) from the call center; how the responsible person retrieves the reports; how your staff ensures that all ADE information obtained by the call center was forwarded to and received by Galena Biopharma, Inc.; or how your staff ensure any ADE obtained by the Quality Assurance staff during a complaint investigation is forwarded to pharmacovigilance staff.  The draft “Post Marketing Reporting of Serious Adverse Events” SOP generally references obtaining follow-up data from a reporter and documenting follow-up attempts. The SOP does provide vague guidelines for which reports require follow-up (i.e., the report requires additional information, the outcome of the event is unknown). However, the SOP fails to adequately describe the requirement to follow-up on 15-day Alert reports, methods used to obtain follow-up information, the timetable for submitting follow-up information, or how the follow-up information is to be reported to FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 314.80(c)(1)(ii). In addition, the draft “Post Marketing Reporting of Serious Adverse Events” SOP states that periodic reports will be submitted “as required.” This is inadequate because there is no indication of what “required” means to ensure timely, periodic reporting. We believe the inadequacy of these SOPs have contributed to your firm failing to submit any Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Reports (PADERs) and associated Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) since acquiring the product, Abstral. In your December 11, 2014, written response to the Form FDA 483, you included revised procedures, QA-03-1 “Product Complaints” and PV 01-1 “Post Marketing Reporting of Adverse Events,” and training records. You noted that the revised procedures include the initial assessment and event disposition of ADEs, the procedure for the Chief Medical Officer evaluation of the events, and the expedited reporting of 15-day Alert reports. In addition, your response notes that the revised procedures include a process for submitting PADERs.Your response is inadequate. The revised SOP QA-03-1 “Product Complaints,” does not include procedures to follow if an ADE is identified in a product complaint.  Therefore, this written procedure fails to ensure your firm obtains ADE reports from any source, which includes product complaints, as required by 21 CFR 314.80(b).   The revised SOP PV 01-1 “Post Marketing Reporting of Adverse Events” received with your December 11, 2014, written response includes a case creation requirement similar to what was included in the draft SOP collected during the inspection. However, the revised SOP does not specify who at your firm is responsible for obtaining reports from the call center, or how the reports are retrieved by the pharmacovigilance staff for case creation.  In addition, the revised procedures do not provide any processes for your staff to ensure that all ADE information obtained by the call center was forwarded to and received by Galena Biopharma, Inc. The revised SOP PV 01-1 “Post Marketing Reporting of Adverse Events” lacks the steps required for the follow-up of 15-day Alert reports. Specifically, it fails to describe what procedures are to be used by your staff to attempt the required follow-up. Also, you do not describe your procedure for submitting Postmarketing 15-day Alert Follow-up reports to FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 314.80(c)(1)(ii). The revised SOPPV 01-1 “Post Marketing Reporting of Adverse Events” states that periodic reports will be submitted “as required.” This is inadequate as noted previously because there is no indication of what “required” means to ensure timely, periodic reporting. Although you committed to, and submitted, a Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) on February 9, 2015, in lieu of a PADER with an approved waiver, the lack of adequate procedures for how to submit the PSUR/PADER and associated ICSRs does not prevent the possible failure to submit these reports in the future. 2.    Failure to report each adverse drug experience not reported under 21 CFR 314.80(c)(1)(i) at quarterly intervals as required by 21 CFR 314.80(c)(2)(i). As the NDA holder of Abstral, you are required to submit PADERs with ICSRs to FDA at quarterly intervals for three years from the NDA approval date, and then at annual intervals. NDA-022510 for Abstral was originally approved on January 7, 2011, and subsequently transferred to your firm on May 1, 2013. You failed to submit ADE reports in a PADER, or otherwise, for the following periods: May 1, 2013, through July 6, 2013; July 7, 2013, through October 6, 2013; and October 7, 2013, through January 6, 2014. There were at least nineteen ADEs reported to your firm for Abstral from May 1, 2013, through January 6, 2014. In your December 11, 2014, written response you committed to submitting the ADE reports identified as missing, on or before February 9, 2015. However, the written response is inadequate because you failed to identify why you did not submit PADERs with ICSRs within the quarterly intervals required by regulation. We also note that neither the draft SOPs reviewed during the inspection, nor the revised SOP PV 01-1 “Postmarketing Reporting of Adverse Events” submitted in your response, includes any procedures for how the ICSRs are to be submitted to FDA. The revised SOP only states what will be in a PSUR and at what intervals the PSUR will be submitted. Therefore, you have not provided adequate preventative actions to address the timely submission of periodic ICSRs. Failure to report ADEs to FDA at the required intervals raises concerns about your firm’s ability to monitor the safety of drug products, as well as the reliability and integrity of the information submitted to FDA.  On February 9, 2015, you submitted a PSUR covering the period of May 1, 2013, to January 6, 2014. We acknowledge receipt of your PSUR, however the ICSRs included in the PSUR were not submitted in an acceptable format. Please refer to the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System website for instructions on how to submit ICSRs electronically, available online at: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm115894.htm. We emphasize our concern about the adequacy of your written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experiences. Without adequate written procedures, we cannot be assured that you will accurately capture and report important safety information about your drug products to the Agency. The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist at your facility. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including without limitation, seizure and injunction. Other federal agencies may take this Warning Letter into account when awarding contracts. FDA may re-inspect to verify corrective actions have been completed.  Also, we are concerned about your firm’s fundamental understanding of the overall regulatory expectations for a firm that enters into agreements with contract manufacturers to manufacture its drug products, including CGMP operations under 21 CFR 211. Although you have agreements with other firms that delineate specific responsibilities to each party, you are ultimately responsible for the quality of your products. FDA is aware that many manufacturers of pharmaceutical products utilize extramural independent contract facilities and regard extramural facilities as an extension of the manufacturer's own facility, 21 CFR 200.10(b). Regardless of who performs your operations, or the agreements in place, you are required to ensure your products are made in accordance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act. Within fifteen working days of your receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific actions that you are taking to correct violations. Your response should explain how each action being taken will prevent the recurrence of similar violations, as well as copies of supporting documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which corrective actions will be completed. Your written response should be sent to Maria P. Kelly-Doggett, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington 98021. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact Compliance Officer Maria Kelly-Doggett by telephone at 425-302-0427.   Sincerely,/S/ Miriam R.
