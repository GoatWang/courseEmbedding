Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

North Carolina Farm Bureau Insurance Group


                                            I highly recommend Farm Bureau Insurance. Nathan Ray cares about his clients. As my agent, Nathan meets me with intelligence, patience, humor, warmth, knowledge and empathy.

Electro Savings Credit Union


                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

                                            After getting fed-up with SEFCU’s “nickel-and-dime” fee structure and lack of branches/ATMs in my area, I decided to close my account in April 2017. Fast forward to July 25, 2017 when I receive a collection notice for fees due ($175). Access to my online...show more

                                            Applied for a credit card and was denied based on what they said was a loss from a personal loan in 1978. I have never had an account with PenFed, so I questioned the accuracy of this denial. Considering, as a business owner, my scores are well north of 700, I thought this...show more

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
