SEI Investments: Development Investment Set To Pay Off - SEI Investments Company (NASDAQ:SEIC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»SEI Investments: Development Investment Set To Pay OffJul.28.17 | About: SEI Investments (SEIC) Michael Boyd Long/short equity, contrarian, medium-term horizon, mid-capMarketplaceIndustrial InsightsSummaryFinancial technology is a great space to be in, and SEI is one of the stronger picks for those who are risk-averse.The balance sheet is rock solid, and thus far, the company has avoided seeing drops in assets under management during a tough operating environment.SEI is rolling out a new product platform to Regions Financial by the end of this year, and to Wells Fargo by the end of next. Could be big.Financial technology is a favored space of mine currently. Many companies here have seen stock prices remain restrained due to lingering association with beleaguered financials, continued stringent regulation, and other more nuanced sector headwinds (active to passive investing shift, etc.). Unfortunately, many of these companies do not get the coverage they deserve, as it can be tough to understand both the products themselves and how they are being received by customers. SEI Investments (SEIC) fits that mold perfectly, given it has a great product suite that most outside the industry are not aware of. Is the value there for investors to build a stake in this company? Business Overview SEI provides investment processing, management, and operations solutions to larger clients like institutional investors, financial advisors, and ultra-high net worth individuals. Broadly, investors can view the company’s solutions as falling into three buckets: investment processing, investment management programs, and investment operations. Most core is investment processing solutions, which is made up of business process outsourcing (“BPO”) services, as well as application and professional services directed towards commercial customers. Primary method of delivery is through the company’s two proprietary application suites: TRUST 3000 and the SEI Wealth Platform. The TRUST 3000 platform is a comprehensive trust and investment accounting system that provides securities processing and accounting for trust accounts. The SEI Wealth Program is a scaleable platform designed to support wealth advisory and asset management functions, revolving around encouraging a strong client-centric relationship.
 Throughout this year, SEI has been converting two large bank clients (Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Regions (NYSE:RF)) to newer versions. These installations are key, as other potential core customers will be watching to make sure that the company’s products can handle these types of large customers. Regions Financial is scheduled to be done within the next six months, while Wells Fargo won’t be fully converted until the end of 2018. Once those projects roll off, expenses will moderate, which should provide a nice little tailwind to margins. See management’s commentary from the most recent conference call: We believe that from the develop standpoint, that's generally peaked and it's now plateauing and our goal would be as things like -- as clients like Regions settle in, that some of that would start to come down post the installation of Regions and then certainly, an even bigger step down post the installation of Wells Fargo. Within investment management, SEI offers a multitude of fixed income, equity, and money market products, primarily more niche ETFs like SEI Multi-Asset Accumulation (SIMT) or state-specific municipal bond funds, like SEI Pennsylvania Municipal Bonds (STET). At the end of the last reported quarter, SEI had $297.1B in assets under management (“AUM”) and another $478.1B in assets under administration (“AUA”). AUM relate to assets that SEI directly manages investment direction in through its equity and fixed income investment programs, while AUA assets are those that the firm provides administrative services for. Unlike most other asset management firms, trends in AUM and AUA have been positive for several years, which is indicative of the healthy underlying strength in the firm’s investment strategies. Historical Results, Valuation Recent historical results have been extremely positive. Revenue growth has averaged 5% annually over the past two years, driven by growth in both AUM and AUA. Sales to investment advisors and managers have seen the strongest growth in near-term results, while sales to private banks continue to lose their influence (no growth, despite being SEI’s highest grossing end market). Overall growth has been stronger in AUA, which has put some minor pressure on margin; 26.8% GAAP operating margin in 2016 versus 27.9% in 2014.
 Macro headwinds on margin (AUM fee contraction, product mix, pressure from large clients to cut costs) likely has disguised some very strong incremental margin at SEI. There is likely very little cost to supporting new revenue, so new contract wins are important to driving earnings. Q2 2017 was an excellent quarter in all these respects, with revenue up 8.5% compared to the prior year period. This was big, and was one of the largest y/y jumps in revenue in several quarters. Margins moved back in a positive direction, and given the active buyback program, second quarter diluted earnings per share increased 16%. Like most businesses in the financials space, this is asset light and cash generation is quite high. Operational cash flow has expanded annually, both from trends in net income and positive moves in working capital. Capital expenditures have been on the rise ($56M in 2013 to $82M in 2016), but free cash flow has been solid. Assuming $50M in capital expenditures as a maintenance level, free cash flow peaked at $375M last year, or 4.2% free cash flow yield. A large portion of this free cash flow has been dedicated to share buybacks, and SEI is on track to buy back another $240M worth of stock this year. Given the healthy net cash position ($683M in cash, no debt) and resilient end markets, there isn’t much to fear here. It is a quality company with a rock solid balance sheet, and that is going to attract a lot of risk-averse investors, particularly institutions (80% of the float excluding insider shares is controlled by institutional investors). At 26x trailing earnings, the company isn’t particularly cheap, but earnings are expected to grow measurably over the next two years as development expenses roll off and the company begins to build a little more scale. With the company trading at 20x 2018 earnings estimates, there is a little bit of leeway here for price expansion given historical trading multiple norms, but it is light: 15% or so. This one looks like a solid hold to me at current prices.

SEI headquarters in Oaks, PA.


SEI Investments Company, formerly Simulated Environments Inc, is a financial services company headquartered in Oaks, Pennsylvania, United States. The company describes itself as "a global provider of investment processing, investment management, and investment operations solutions".[1] SEI provides products and services to institutions, private banks, investment advisors, investment managers, and private clients.[2] SEI manages, advises or administers $779 billion in hedge funds, private equity, mutual funds and other managed assets. This includes $297 billion in assets under management and $478 billion in client assets under administration.[1]
SEI has corporate headquarters in Oaks, Pennsylvania with offices in Toronto, London, Dublin, The Netherlands, Hong Kong, South Africa, and Dubai.[3]
History[edit]
SEI was founded as Simulated Environments Inc in 1968 by its current Chairman and CEO, Alfred P. West, Jr. (also known as Al West). West had created the first computer-simulated training technology for loan officers.[citation needed] In the 1970s SEI developed an automated trust and investment accounting system for bank trust departments. In the 1990s SEI launched a wealth management operating platform for independent, fee-based investment advisors.[citation needed]
In 2012 SEI was sued by investors in connection with the financial crimes committed by Allen Stanford. Stanford had sold investors bogus Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and the investors alleged that SEI, as well as other companies, had promoted and misrepresented the CDs as safe investments without performing appropriate due diligence.[4][5] SEI responded that it merely provided a Stanford affiliate with back office services.[6] As of September 2015 the case was still ongoing.[5]

See your investments through a new lens


Goals first, financials second. On the
    surface, that seems obvious. But if
    you're like other wealthy individuals,
    you might be surprised at the gap
    between your goals and the wealth
    you've set aside to attain them. Having
    clearly defined goals is what anchors
    your investment decisions. Combine
    that with advice focused on achieving
    your desired outcomes, and you have
    the most complete picture of
    your wealth possible - and all the
    confidence that goes with it.




Manage your life not a benchmark
Align investment strategies to goals
Learn from a network of your peers




Answer the essential questions
This isn't about risk/return objectives - that's math. This is about identifying and articulating what you want, and how that matches (or doesn't) the wants of your family members. What's keeping you up at night may be what's keeping you from making decisions. When you're able get to the heart of what matters, you begin to understand how your answers impact your family, your community, and you.


Initiate a plan to get it done.


Your personal success is not defined
        by a portfolio or its benchmarks —
        it is defined by your ability to
        align your interests to your goals.
        We help you consider your wealth in the
        context of your life, then tether it to
        quantitative data — things like cash flow,
        assets, and liabilities. This approach brings
        organization, clarity and confidence
        to your decision-making. You know
        what success looks like because you've
        created a goals-based framework that
        structures your assets around your life.
        






Measure what's important
What you don't measure never gets done. Concise, customized, contextual reporting for each of your goals is critical to keep you on track and making the right decisions. It's the only way to make effective, impactful decisions around your wealth. Our tailored reporting aggregates your financials, and business and non-liquid assets, and aligns them to your goals — giving you the most informed view of progress towards your goals available anywhere.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
