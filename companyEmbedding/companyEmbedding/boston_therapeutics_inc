Ipoxyn™








Ipoxyn™
IPOXYN™, a universal oxygen carrier, is an injectable Rx for prevention of necrosis and treatment of ischemic conditions which may lead to necrosis. IPOXYN™ oxygen carriers are in pre-clinical stage of drug development.
Necrosis and Ischemia
Cell death can occur through two main mechanisms, apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis is a tightly regulated process in the body and many of the intracellular proteins and enzymes involved are well characterized. Necrosis has been viewed in the past as an accidental pathological mode of cell death. Recently, evidence has indicated that some forms of necrotic cell death could be related to intrinsic cellular mechanisms.
Necrosis is always the outcome of severe and acute injury. It is involved in many pathological conditions such as, heart attack, brain injuries and stroke, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease, dementia and Lou Gherig’s Disease, septic shock, liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, pancreatitis, muscle necrosis, diabetes mellitus, acute or critical limb ischemia, gangrene, chronic pressure ulcers and many others.
Necrosis occurs following ischemia (shortage of oxygen supply to the tissue due to restriction in blood supply). The only treatment available at present for necrosis is providing oxygen by a high pressure facility. Thus, there is a crucial need to develop drugs for prevention and treatment of this pathology.
Limb ischemia is a chronic condition of severe obstruction of the peripheral circulation that results in severe pain in the extremities. Due to the constriction of blood vessels, especially capillaries, red blood cells are unable to flow through them and this disruption in the microcirculation leads to the deprivation of oxygen, or ischemia. Complications include gangrenous sores and wounds that won’t heal, typically in the legs and feet. If left untreated, these lesions can result in amputation of the affected limb. Lower limb ischemia is a life-threatening complication for patients with poorly-controlled diabetes and affects 10% of the diabetic population. Brem Harold, Tomic-Canic Marjana (2007). "Cellular and Molecular basis of wound healing in diabetes". JCI 117 (5): 1219–1222. doi:10.1172/JCI32169. PMC 1857239. PMID 17476353. http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=1857239
For decades, oxygen carriers have been developed for perfusion and oxygenation of ischemic tissue None have yet succeeded. These products were either blood-derived elements, synthetic perfluorocarbons or red blood cell modifiers. Several of the Hemoglobin-Based Oxygen Carriers (HBOC), contained nonfunctional methemoglobin impurities. These products failed to secure FDA approval based upon either poor outcomes in clinical trials or poorly formulated product.
New Approach
Our approach to treatment of ischemic tissue and prevention of necrosis is fundamentally different. Boston Therapeutics’ injectable drug, IPOXYN™ is a New Chemical Entity (NCE) and not a biologic blood substitute. IPOXYN™ is a modified Heme chemical structure. A significant improvement over HBOCs, IPOXYN™ prevents methemoglobin formation associated with the adverse effects of vasoconstriction and myocardial infarction. Furthermore, because of IPOXYN™’s extremely small molecular size, roughly 1/5,000th the size of a red blood cell, IPOXYN™ is able to perfuse constricted, ischemic capillaries which are inaccessible to red blood cells. This small molecular size has particular significance in treating vascular complications of diabetes since red blood cells may already be enlarged and lower limb vasculature may be compromised.

Key Reasons to Look at Boston Therapeutics, Inc. (BTHE-OTC)


Boston Therapeutics, Inc. is focused on developing products that address the diabetes and inflammatory disease markets, employing novel complex carbohydrate chemistry (CCC) technology.The Company’s portfolio includes two development-stage candidates—BTI-320 and Ipoxyn (and veterinary analog OxyFex)—and a marketed over-the-counter (OTC) dietary supplement called SugarDown®. The Company is positioned to benefit from two simultaneous paths to market—OTC and pharmaceutical drug development.


BTI-320 is a non-systemic tablet for the post-meal reduction of the elevation of blood glucose. The compound is designed to be taken before meals to inhibit the carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes that release glucose from carbohydrates during digestion. BTI-320 has demonstrated a favorable safety profile with minimal side effects, in large part because it is a non-systemic method for treating diabetes. The Company is preparing documents for an IND submission with the FDA for a Phase III study. BTI-320 addresses an unmet medical need for people to manage their blood sugar, especially in those who are pre-diabetic and for people with Type 2 diabetes. Lower blood glucose is believed to slow the onset and progression of diabetes and its complications.


The compound’s API holds Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) classification. The Company’s strategy of combining proven compounds with novel delivery methods and pharmaceutical compositions seeks to reduce development time and costs and lower regulatory risks, while delivering valuable products in areas of unmet need to the marketplace.


A Phase IIa trial conducted at Dartmouth Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, showed that BTI-320 was well tolerated in patients taking various anti-diabetic agents, including metformin. Phase IIb is ongoing and has completed patient enrollment. Trial results are expected in late 2014.


Boston Therapeutics’ marketed product, SugarDown®, is an OTC, non-systemic, chewable dietary supplement taken prior to meals in order to reduce post-meal elevation in glucose. The product works in the gastrointestinal tract to reduce the spikes in blood sugar associated with eating high carbohydrate foods.


Also in development is Ipoxyn, a glycoprotein-based injectable therapeutic agent that may prove successful in reversing an inadequate supply of oxygen and support various metabolic functions in the body in a manner and with effects similar to those resulting from the infusion of RBCs—without the limitations of compatibility, availability, short shelf life, volume, and logistical challenges commonly associated with whole blood transfusions. The initial indication for Ipoxyn could be lower-limb ischemia associated with diabetes.


Ipoxyn is being targeted to both the human and animal market—where tissues and organ systems are deprived of oxygen and are in need of metabolic support.


Boston Therapeutics’ management is highly experienced, with its CEO, David Platt, Ph.D., a pioneer in designing therapeutic drugs made from carbohydrates for the past two decades. He is also the inventor or co-inventor on a number of patents and been significantly involved in the approval process for several drugs.


The Company is the third start-up founded by Dr. Platt—the first two were International Gene Group, whose core technology GCS-100 was acquired by Prospect Therapeutics, and is now known as LaJolla Pharmaceuticals, and Pro-Pharmaceuticals, which is now Galectin Therapeutics. Core technologies of both of these companies were either developed or co-developed by Dr. Platt.


Boston Therapeutics’ product candidates are well-differentiated formulations that address significant unmet medical needs. The Company is working to secure a robust intellectual property portfolio composed of patents, patent applications, and trademarks. 


The technology and products are currently protected by two patent applications filed under the international Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and their related national-stage applications, one provisional patent application in the U.S., and several trademarks.


Boston Therapeutics’ patent portfolio covers three main areas: (1) mannans; (2) hemoglobin composition and methods of use; and (3) taste masking in chewable tablets.


At June 30, 2014, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of over $1.5 million. In August 2014, Boston Therapeutics filed a preliminary Form S-1 with the SEC for the raise of up to $10 million.

The hallmark of pre-diabetes -- chronically impaired blood glucose response -- is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as well as the manifestation of metabolic syndromes including obesity, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, hypertriglyceridemia, cardiovascular diseases and stroke. A growing body of evidence suggests that postprandial hyperglycemia and glycemic variability are independent risk factors for increasing the mortality and accelerating the development of T2DM. Dietary control to restore normal postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) is emerging to be critically important in the prevention of T2MD and related metabolic syndromes. To date, no effective dietary method can readily or accurately predict PPGR associated with food type. Where the current gold standard estimates PPGR through carbohydrate content or glycemic index as guided reference, glycemic variability often limits the applicability of the two methods in a real-life patient management situation. As such, personalized diets with glycemic variability taken into consideration require special focus for intervention to control PPGR and modify its subsequent metabolic consequences. New portable, wearable continuous glucose monitoring devices (Dexcom Inc., US, Medtronics, Ireland, etc.) open a new, important self-management technique for better healthcare management and for the accurate and clinically relevant effect that a compound can have on postprandial blood sugar spikes. Boston Therapeutics is working with these advanced technologies, sensors, and wearable devices to employ mobile apps that have the potential to offer patient access to clinically significant data monitoring for real-time development of the BTI320 investigative drug materials. This complements existing data and will provide a more complete view of safety and significant efficacy for the management and even delay and risk reduction of these metabolic disease related illnesses. This effect will be supported by the hallmark reductions of HbA1c.Recent Clinical Confirmation The investigative material from Boston Therapeutics, BTI320, has been in development for the past several years and, with operational licensing partners in Asia, we have progressed what is believed to be a new and patented, effective investigative material for the benefit of safe blood glucose management. In a proof of concept trial (Protocol Code: SG01) conducted at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), positive effect of BTI320 on postprandial hyperglycemia in a high-risk pre-diabetic Chinese population was demonstrated. An abbreviated description of this clinical trial innovation was presented at the seminar for "Frontier Technologies with Impact in Public Health" in the Chinese University of Hong Kong sponsored by the Hong Kong Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care in September 2016. This group continues to be a key collaborator in this and future trials. Announcement of basic data sets was reported on clinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02358668) in January 2017. Data analyses and manuscripts are currently under embargo pending potential presentation at the America Diabetes Association meeting in June 2017.Read MoreKey points of DiscussionPositive Phase II Data Supports the Effect and Safety of BTI320 in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial (NCT02358668, Clinicaltrials.gov). With > 95% overall compliance across study groups, the phase II proof of concept trial (Protocol Code: SG01) demonstrated that both low dose (4g) and high dose (8g) BTI320 are safe and effective in significantly reducing various continuous glucose monitor (CGMS) parameters when compared against placebo. The relevant glycemic variability, presented in preliminary analyses, as a positive confirmation of reducing blood sugar spikes, demonstrated no change in fructosamine (a measure of short half-life glycated plasma proteins) from the baseline to week 4 of the observation period. No anticipated change is expected due to sufficient glycemic control in this pre-diabetic population. Further confirmation of control, BTI320 can be reported to be effective in inhibiting and lowering postprandial glucose excursions and reflects greater reduction in many of the CGMS parameters when compared to placebo from baseline to week 16 of the study period: MBG (mean blood glucose); AUC (area under the curve) at 1, 2 and 3 hours; AUC 180 at 24 and 72 hours; MPMG (mean post meal glucose); MAGE (maximum amplitude glucose excursions) and HbA1c.  Planned key supplementary analyses revealed a better understanding of diabetes management and care in the prevention of IGT and other pre-diabetic conditions. To account for the glycemic variability among individual subjects on a day-to-day basis, supplementary CGMS analyses (with variability adjusted) were performed to appropriately reflect the drug effects of BTI320 on an individual level with no group data pooled. The validated supplementary analyses were carefully designed to explore the sugar spike reduction effect of low dose (4g) and high dose (8g) of BTI320 against placebo via CGMS parameters in a controlled setting. Since BTI320 was previously demonstrated to significantly reduce postprandial glucose and insulin response in a controlled glycemic loading study at the Sydney University Glycemic Index Research Services (SUGiRS) among a normal volunteer population (overweight but otherwise healthy subjects), it was hypothesized that both low and high dose of BTI320 were also effective in reducing some CGMS parameters among the high risk pre-diabetic Asian population. Full data to be presented in June 2017, manuscript in process. Planned MilestonesIn October 2016, the Company and Advance Pharmaceutical Company Limited (APCL) announced collaborative advancement in the clinical development of BTI320 and APCL will be receiving up to US$400,000 from the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) for advance screening by proprietary Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA). The device is an non-invasive screening tool that will be used in a randomized, controlled, cross over, dose study to compare the effect of BTI320 in subjects (n=120) at high risks for diabetes and stroke. The objective of the study will be evaluation on the effect of BTI320 at dose with control on (i) calculated 5-year probability of stroke, and (ii) glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fructosamine in pre-diabetic subjects. The goal will be to obtain a proof of concept for inclusion of BTI320 as adjunctive therapy in the consideration of an at-risk aging population where the identification and early life style change can have a significant effect on the quality of life.Below is the summary of our 2017 operating plan.(1) IND Amendment processed and global expansion opportunities planned. BTI will initiate the accepted FDA IND clinical trial with the Joslin Diabetes Centre (Boston MA) and will increment new sites for a multicenter expansion that is supported by our Asian collaborator. BTI's new study specific Steering Committee and its contract research partners, have investigated and evaluated the completed clinical trials. All past and present clinical studies have been brought current with FDA with supportive comment. We are supplementing and will be completing new developments in the area of GRAS (generally regarded as safe), toxicology, as well as the mechanisms of action with our licensed alliance/partner: (Sugardown Company Limited (SCL), subsidiary of APCL) and others. These will support and update the opportunity to address a worldwide population as we advance the registrations and territories.(2) Manufacturing operations have been re-qualified to establish vendor agreements, to extend the stability of the product, and to prepare for new formulations. The company and SCL have initiated and will continue stability confirmation and formulation planning to extend inventory life and to allow for use in clinical development as well as to qualify and secure the contract operations for the formulation of drug product. The company is also exploring off shore product options. For manufacturing and registrations opportunities, China as well as other regions we are preparing to service the specific healthcare needs of the various global healthcare systems. (A formulation of the material is now registered in Korea as Sugar Balance and Singapore as Sugar Block). Establishing efficacy and customer traction in these and other regions are important steps in confirming reliability and reproducibility to ensure product integrity and to cross various populations with a specific benefit concerning local dietary intake.(3) Regulatory documentation for domestic and worldwide integration plus the extension and implementation of intellectual property and patents. Collaboration opportunities with several Contract Research Organizations (CRO) in China is ongoing and currently progressing to exploit the best of our collaboration opportunity for cost sharing and resource planning for all registrations for Asia and the US/EU. New patents have issued and new positions and formulations are unfolding as we supplement patent filings with clinical and developmental discoveries form the recently completed as well as planned new trials.SugarDown®  The Company also developed and markets SugarDown®, a sugar blocker dietary food supplement designed to support glycemic health. More information is available at www.bostonti.com . SugarDown® in its present formulation is a natural sugar blocker dietary supplement product made entirely from a non-digestible sugar molecule that can help people maintain healthier weight levels and is the first chewable tablet of its kind. In a previous study, SugarDown® demonstrated significant reduction of glucose and insulin Area Under the Curve (AUC) when taken with Jasmine rice, a food with a glycemic index of about 90 compared to glucose, which is 100. Sugary soft drinks that also have high glycemic index, include sucrose and maltose which is also found in beer.
