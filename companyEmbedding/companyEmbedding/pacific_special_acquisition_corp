NEW YORK and SHANGHAI, Oct. 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Pacific Special Acquisition Corp. ("Pacific" or the "Company"), a company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, today announced the pricing of its initial public offering of five million units at a price to the public of $10.00 per unit.  The units are expected to begin trading on Thursday, October 15, 2015, on The NASDAQ Capital Market ("Nasdaq") under the symbol "PAACU." The closing of the Company's initial public offering is expected to be consummated on or about October 20, 2015.  Each unit to be issued in the initial public offering will consist of one ordinary share, one right to receive one-tenth of an ordinary share on the consummation of an initial business combination, and one warrant to acquire one-half of one ordinary share at a price of $12.00 per full share. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the ordinary shares, warrants and rights are expected to be traded on Nasdaq under the symbols "PAAC," "PAACR" and "PAACW," respectively.
EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. is acting as sole book-running manager for the offering. Pacific has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 750,000 additional units to cover over-allotments, if any. This offering is being made only by means of a prospectus. Copies of the prospectus relating to this offering may be obtained by contacting EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., 366 Madison Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10017. Copies of the registration statement can be accessed through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
A registration statement relating to these securities was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 14, 2015. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

NEW YORK and SHANGHAI, Oct. 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Pacific Special Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq:   PAACU) ("Pacific" or the "Company"), a company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, today announced the closing of its initial public offering of five million units at a price to the public of $10.00 per unit, with the offering raising gross proceeds of $50,000,000.  The units commenced trading on Thursday, October 15, 2015, on The NASDAQ Capital Market ("Nasdaq") under the symbol "PAACU." Each unit issued in the initial public offering consists of one ordinary share, one right to receive one-tenth of an ordinary share on the consummation of an initial business combination, and one warrant to acquire one-half of one ordinary share at a price of $12.00 per full share. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the ordinary shares, warrants and rights are expected to be traded on Nasdaq under the symbols "PAAC," "PAACW" and "PAACR," respectively.
EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. acted as sole book-running manager for the offering and I-Bankers Securities, Inc. acted as co-manager for the offering. Pacific has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 750,000 additional units to cover over-allotments, if any. 
Of the proceeds received from the consummation of the initial public offering and a simultaneous private placement of units, $52,000,000 (or $10.40 per unit sold in the public offering) was placed in trust. An audited balance sheet of the Company as of October 20, 2015 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the initial public offering and the private placement will be included as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP acted as U.S. counsel to the Company, Ogier acted as British Virgin Islands counsel to the Company and Graubard Miller acted as counsel to the underwriters.
A registration statement relating to these securities was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 14, 2015. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
This offering was made only by means of a prospectus. Copies of the prospectus relating to this offering may be obtained by contacting EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., 366 Madison Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10017. Copies of the registration statement can be accessed through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    borrowed from the sponsor. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of
    this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) Upon closing of the initial business combination, the funds held in the 
    trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our expenses relating to 
    acquiring a target business, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital in an
    amount equal to $1,750,000.

(4) Does not include any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
    that may be available to us as described in this prospectus.

(5) We will pay each of our independent directors an annual retainer of $30,000
    (to be prorated for a partial term), payable in arrears commencing on the
    first anniversary of the closing of this offering and ending on the earlier
    of the consummation of our initial business combination and our liquidation.

A total of $52,000,000 (or $59,800,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale
of the private units described in this prospectus will be placed in a trust
account in the United States at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity
of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and which invest solely in U.S.
Treasuries. Except for all interest income that may be released to us (net of
taxes payable) to fund our working capital requirements, as discussed below,
none of the funds held in the trust account will be released from the trust
account until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering and (ii) a
redemption to public shareholders prior to any voluntary winding-up in the event
we do not consummate our initial business combination within the applicable
period.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that
is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income that
may be released to fund our working capital requirements will be sufficient to
pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is
based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target
business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake
in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant
prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of
intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial
business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking
in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less
than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available
to use from the trust account is minimal as a result of the current interest
rate environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not
under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the Nasdaq
Capital Market, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of our Chairman a total of
$10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative
services. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our
liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced to us a total of
$90,917 and loaned to us a total of $300,000 to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. The advance is non-interest bearing and is payable on
demand. The loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due on the earlier of
December 31, 2015 or the closing of this offering.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $500,000 of such
loans may be convertible into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per
unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 55,000
ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted since the 50,000 rights
included in the private units would result in the issuance of 5,000 ordinary
shares upon the closing of our business combination, as well as 50,000 warrants
to purchase 25,000 shares).

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial
business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of
our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an
alternate business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate our initial business combination within 18 months following the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances
will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account.

Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination. Our initial shareholders have
also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any public shares
purchased during or after the offering in connection with the consummation of
our initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have
agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions with respect to its
founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within
18 months from the closing of this offering. However, if our initial
shareholders acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares
if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required
time period.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial
business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities
having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check
companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating
businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well
established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business
combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors
possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our
ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available
financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in
pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that
we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to
at least 80% of the value of the trust account at the time of the agreement to
enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection
with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number
of our outstanding rights and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors
may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our
initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin
Islands as a business company with limited liability (meaning that our public
shareholders have no liability, as members of our company, for the liabilities
of our company over and above the amount paid for their


 shares) and formed for
the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and
amalgamation with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of,
entering into contractual arrangements with, or engaging in any other similar
business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to
throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. Although we are
not limited to a particular industry or geographic region, we intend to focus on
businesses that have their primary operations located in Asia (with an emphasis
on China). We have not identified any acquisition target and we have not, nor
has anyone on our behalf, initiated any discussions, research or other measures,
directly or indirectly, with respect to identifying any acquisition target. From
the date of our incorporation through the date of this prospectus, there have
been no communications, evaluations or discussions between any of our officers,
directors or our sponsor and any of their contacts or relationships regarding a
potential initial business combination with our company. Additionally, we have
not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate
any suitable acquisition candidate, to conduct any research or take any
measures, directly or indirectly, to locate or contact a target business.

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire 100% of
the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses. We may,
however, structure our initial business combination to acquire less than 100% of
such interests or assets of the target business, but we will only consummate
such business combination if we will become the majority shareholder of the
target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited
circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes) or are otherwise not required
to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended, or the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction
that does not meet this criterion. Even though we will own a majority interest
in the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may
collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company,
depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business
combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we
issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding
capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling
interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial
number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business
combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent
to our initial business combination.

Our sponsor, Zhengqi International Holding Limited, is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Pacific Securities Investment Management Co., Ltd., a company incorporated in
the People’s Republic of China and a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific
Securities Capital Management Co. Ltd., a company incorporated in the People’s
Republic of China which, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific
Securities Co. Ltd (601099.SH), or Pacific Securities, a company incorporated in
the People’s Republic of China. Pacific Securities is a provider of financial,
advisory, investment, and funds management services, primarily in China. Pacific
Securities’ main business focus is generating returns to investors and
stockholders by providing a diversified range of services to clients. Pacific

(as of August 11, 2015).

and financial sponsors and government clients involved in mergers and
acquisitions, debt and equity fund raising, corporate restructuring, project

Pacific Special Acquisition Corp. And Borqs International Holding Corp Announce Certain Preliminary Borqs Operating Results For The Quarter Ended March 31, 2017









PR Newswire




Jul 19, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































  NEW YORK and SHANGHAI, July 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Pacific Special Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: PAAC) ("Pacific"), which has agreed to acquire Borqs International Holding Corp ("BORQS"), today jointly announced with BORQS certain preliminary financial results of BORQS for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  BORQS is a global leader in software and products providing customizable, differentiated and scalable Android-based smart connected devices and cloud service solutions.   First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, BORQS unaudited consolidated net revenue was $31.6 million, compared to $23.3 million (unaudited) for the comparable quarter of 2016.  The increase reflects growth in the connected solutions business unit ("Connected Solutions BU"), where revenues rose to $24.8 million (unaudited) from $14.6 million (unaudited) for the comparable quarter of 2016.  Revenue from the BORQS mobile virtual network operator business unit ("MVNO BU") declined to $6.3 million (unaudited) from $8.0 million (unaudited) in the comparable quarter of 2016, primarily due to stricter regulatory requirements of customer identification for each SIM card sold.  Gross profit of the Connected Solutions BU for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $3.9 million (unaudited), representing a 15.6% gross margin, compared to $3.2 million (unaudited) and 21.8% gross margin for the comparable quarter of 2016.  The reduction in Connected Solutions BU gross margin reflected the impact of a large order from an overseas mobile operator, which carried more competitive pricing.  MVNO BU gross profit for the quarter was $1.1 million (unaudited), representing a 17.7% gross margin, compared to $0.9 million (unaudited) and 10.6% gross margin for the comparable quarter of 2016.  The increase in MVNO BU gross margin reflected increased efficiency of the unit. BORQS net income before taxes was $0.5 million (unaudited) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to a loss of ( $1.16 million) (unaudited) for the comparable quarter of 2016.  Income taxes were $0.4 million (unaudited) and $0.7 million (unaudited) in the 2017 and 2016 quarters, respectively.  Net income after taxes was $0.02 million (unaudited) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to a loss of ( $1.87 million) (unaudited) for the comparable quarter of 2016.  The BORQS' effective tax rate was higher than statutory rate because the MVNO BU net operating loss could not be used to offset taxable income of the Connected Solutions BU.  BORQS net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 included a non-cash interest charge of $0.3 million (unaudited) due to outstanding warrants held by our commercial lenders and a non-cash charge $0.2 million (unaudited) as a result in a change in the fair value of such warrants.   Pat Chan, Chairman and CEO of BORQS, explained, "We are pleased by the significant growth in Connected Solutions BU revenues that we encountered in the first quarter of 2017 and believe that we will continue to execute well for the rest of the year."     About Pacific Pacific is a blank check company, also commonly referred to as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC, formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, entering into contractual arrangements, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.

A number of factors could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events and results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
