History of Suburban Propane Partners, L.P.








Suburban Propane Partners, L.P., a publicly traded limited partnership, is the third largest marketer of propane fuel in the United States serving more than 700,000 retail and wholesale customers in over 40 states. Found in the extraction of both crude oil and natural gas, propane is a gas liquefied under pressure and distributed in tanks and cylinders for reconversion to a gas under normal air pressure. Suburban Propane also sells propane-related appliances and services.

Independent Company: 1928--82

The company was founded in 1928 as Suburban Propane Gas Co. by Mark Anton because the New Jersey home where he lived was beyond the range of gas lines. Anton found that he could obtain propane from a nearby Phillips Petroleum Co. plant that considered the gas a useless byproduct of the oil-refining process. He marketed propane to other New Jersey homeowners who wanted gas for cooking and heating. Anton established an office in Belleville, a gas well in Boonton, and plants in Belvidere, Farmingdale, and Livingston. At the end of 1945 the company went public as Suburban Propane Gas Co., the first publicly owned company whose sole purpose was to distribute propane. It purchased Phillips' 13 liquefied petroleum gas properties in the United States. The following year it had revenues of $5.5 million and earnings of $600,000 on sales of 14 million gallons of propane.
But Anton had more ambitious plans. He wanted to organize vertically, producing the propane Suburban sold and manufacturing the tanks that held the liquid plus an array of gas-burning appliances. Accordingly, Suburban Propane Gas acquired a manufacturing plant in Tennessee that produced gas heaters, another in Pennsylvania that made gas ranges, and a third in Charlotte, North Carolina, that manufactured propane tanks. During the 1950s the company purchased a small gas field near Pearsall, Texas, and established a plant there to produce butane, propane, and natural gasoline. Revenues reached $47.1 million in 1960.
Anton retired in 1963 and was succeeded as chief executive officer of Suburban Propane Gas by his son, Mark J. Anton. The company had 129 sales, service, and distribution stations in 19 states, all but one of them east of the Mississippi. Its subsidiaries now included Frio-Tex Oil & Gas Corp., controlling about 67 natural gas wells in Texas and selling LP gases (including butane and a mixture of butane and propane), and Plateau, Inc., producing and distributing petroleum products in New Mexico. That year, however, the company sold its unprofitable manufacturer of gas ranges. Suburban Propane Gas was, in 1965, the world's largest independent retail distributor of liquid petroleum gases, marketing more than ten percent of this product in the United States. It was supplying bottled gas to more than 500,000 homes in 26 states and thousands of industrial plants and commercial and institutional enterprises.
By 1968 Suburban Propane Gas's non-propane activities were accounting for about one-quarter of the company's revenues and earnings. The purchase in 1967 of additional properties in Crockett County, Texas, brought the number of its Frio-Tex natural-gas wells to 175. A pipeline was delivering propane and butane to two plants--one wholly owned, the other partly owned, by Suburban--for conversion to liquids. Suburban's manufacturing subsidiaries were producing gas-fuel appliances as well as propane tanks. The company was also producing miniaturized "Dyna-Trail" central heating systems for the recreational vehicle industry. Plateau was operating an oil refinery in New Mexico and marketing some of the production to more than 70 gasoline stations under the Plateau brand.
Suburban's anchor gas distribution business was now operating in 28 states. Service to industries and farms was growing more rapidly than home use. For farmers, LP gases were fueling grain dryers, cotton gins, tobacco curers, weed burners, tractor engines, and poultry brooders. Industries were using propane to power forklift trucks, for heating at construction sites, for plaster drying, and to thaw coal and iron shipments. Suburban was meeting most of its gas needs from more than a dozen suppliers, including many of the major oil companies. Its revenues reached a record $96.6 million, and net income a record $5.5 million, in fiscal 1970 (the year ended September 30, 1970).
Suburban Propane Gas's revenues grew every year in the 1970s and its operating income every year except fiscal 1975. With the purchase in 1971 of Vangas, Inc., a California-based propane marketer active in seven western states, the company was providing propane to 600,000 customers in 32 states. It also had 268 gas wells in operation, held about 40 percent of the market for recreational vehicle heaters, and owned nine cable television (CATV) franchises serving 12,000 customers: a business it entered in 1970 and then divested at a profit by late 1974. The company, which disposed of the propane tank plant about the beginning of the decade, also again began producing gas cooking ranges, but only for recreational vehicles, in 1971. It also had begun making combination heater-air conditioners for space use in buildings. But propane distribution still accounted for 72 percent of revenues in fiscal 1972.
Suburban Propane Gas acquired a second oil refinery in Utah in 1975. The Iranian revolution of 1978 created a world oil shortage and a consequent run-up in oil prices that enabled the profits from Suburban's petroleum refining and marketing division to surge from the 171 retail service stations it now owned or controlled in five western states. Conversely, high gasoline prices depressed the recreational vehicle industry, and in 1979 Suburban wrote off its inventory of RV propane heaters. The manufacturing division turned its attention to a line of solid-fuel furnaces and heaters for the home and a fireplace insert with thermostatic controls. The exploration and production division purchased a Colorado oil and gas drilling and well service firm in 1980 and entered the onshore deep drilling business in 1981 with the purchase of a Texas company. In fiscal 1981 sales reached a record $850.9 million.









Downsized Division: 1982--95

A Canadian businessman named Samuel Belzberg and two of his brothers attempted to take over Suburban Propane Gas in late 1982, raising their holdings in the company to about 12 percent of the stock. Anton and six other top corporate executives, in collaboration with the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, then offered $45 a share, or $238.5 million, for the company, which would be 80 percent owned by the Basses and 20 percent by the executives. In January 1983, however, Suburban was purchased by National Distillers and Chemical Corporation for about $275 million.
Now simply called Suburban Propane, the division stopped making heaters and also left the gasoline service station business. The largest U.S. retail marketer of LP gases, Suburban Propane was distributing the product in 44 states in 1986 through company-owned service centers and offices. Sales of 744 million gallons that year were partly through about 500 bulk storage stations. The company also owned a refrigerated storage facility in California and underground storage facilities in Mississippi and Texas. Through its exploration subsidiary, Suburban had partial ownership of about 600 oil and natural gas wells. It was also still engaged in contract drilling in Texas and well servicing in Colorado, owned and operated a gas processing plant in Texas, and operated and held partial ownership in other gas processing plants in Texas and Oklahoma.
National Distillers and Chemical Corporation changed its name to Quantum Chemical Corporation in 1987. Between 1984 and 1989 the Suburban Propane unit purchased smaller companies distributing a total of 400 million gallons of propane a year. Propane marketing sales rose from $571.6 million in fiscal 1985 to $677.7 million in fiscal 1988, when $113 million was registered in operating profit. The following years were less lucrative, however. In 1988 Suburban sold all its interests in oil and gas wells, gas processing plants, and contract drilling. That year it lost its position as the nation's top-ranking retail LP gas distributor and no longer was selling any LP gas but propane. In fiscal 1992 Suburban Propane had $641.6 million in revenues and operating profit of $51.2 million.

Public Partnership: 1996--99

Hanson PLC, a British-based conglomerate, acquired Quantum Chemical in 1993. Hanson concentrated on mending Quantum's finances and its troubled petrochemical sector, the chief source of its business. By the end of 1995 Suburban had fallen to third place among retail propane distributors. It had sales of $633.6 million in fiscal 1995 (compared to $677.8 million in fiscal 1994) and net income of $30.2 million.
In December 1995 Hanson announced it would sell a 62 percent interest in Suburban Propane through an initial public offering, retaining the other 38 percent. The Hanson subsidiary was first restructured as Suburban Propane Partners, L.P., a master limited partnership. A total of 18.75 million units were then sold at the end of February 1996 at $20.50 per unit, with proceedings to the partnership of $359.6 million. This sum was earmarked for intercompany payables of Quantum Chemical. The partnership's long-term debt at the end of 1995 (adjusted to reflect the initial public offering) was $425 million.
A January 1996 Wall Street Journal column by Linda Sandler questioned whether the new partnership would be a wise investment. One securities analyst called the propane market a "cutthroat business" in which big companies such as Suburban were unable to raise prices for fear of being undercut by countless small "mop-and-pop" firms. With the total propane market stagnant, any gain in market share apparently would have to come from acquisitions. Suburban Propane had a $300 million bank line for this purpose, according to Mark Alexander, a Hanson executive who was appointed chief executive of the partnership. It was serving more than 700,000 customers in 41 states at this time but held less than seven percent of the U.S. market for propane.
During fiscal 1996 Suburban Propane Partners acquired 17 propane distributors at a total cost of $31.7 million, with the emphasis on operations active on the East and West Coasts and around the Great Lakes. "We're in every auction process," Alexander told Ellen Simon of the Newark Star-Ledger in December 1996. "Whenever there is one, we will bid. We'll only bid rational prices. So we don't win many. If the competition wants to overpay, so be it. We'll be there to pick up the pieces." Alexander went on to say, "This company should double in size in five years. In ten years, it should be a full-service organization." Suburban purchased ten more propane distributors in fiscal 1997 and 1998 at a total cost of $5.7 million.
Hanson sold its stake in Suburban Propane Partners in October 1996 to Suburban Propane GP, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium Petrochemicals Inc., which had formerly been Quantum Chemical Corporation. Millennium sold its share in the partnership--now 26.4 percent--for $75 million in May 1999 to Suburban Energy Services Group LLC, a new entity owned by senior management of the partnership. This firm replaced Millennium as general partner of Suburban Propane Partners.
Suburban Propane Partners sold 71 percent of its propane to retail customers and 29 percent to wholesale customers or for hedging activities in fiscal 1998. Retail customers consisted of residential customers (27 percent), commercial customers (18 percent), industrial customers (ten percent), agricultural customers (five percent), and other retail users (11 percent).
Suburban generally was making retail deliveries of propane to customers' storage tanks by means of bobtail and rack trucks. The partnership also was delivering propane to retail customers in portable cylinders. Propane also was being delivered to certain other bulk end users, such as industrial, agricultural, and utility customers, in larger trucks called transports. Among Suburban's suppliers of propane were its own storage facilities in Elk Grove, California, and Hattiesburg, Mississippi. In its wholesale operations, Suburban Propane Partners principally was selling propane to large bulk end-users, such as industrial, agricultural, and utility customers.

HORSHAM, Pa., Oct. 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Workspace Property Trust ("WPT") www.workspaceproperty.com, a real estate investment firm led by longtime successful industry veterans Thomas Rizk and Roger Thomas, announced on Monday, October 3rd the purchase of 108 office and flex buildings, plus 26.7 acres of land, in five markets from Liberty Property Trust (NYSE:    LPT) for approximately $969 million.  The acquisition was made in partnership with Safanad, a global principal investment firm, and affiliates of Square Mile Capital Management LLC ("Square Mile"), a diversified real estate investment firm. 








This acquisition is the second significant real estate transaction by WPT and has expanded its portfolio to 149 properties totaling approximately 10 million square feet.  In less than one year, WPT has acquired over $1.2 billion dollars of assets, consistent with its strategic plan to build a portfolio of superior, well-positioned suburban real estate assets.
Thomas Rizk, Chief Executive Officer and a founding principal of WPT, commented, "This exciting acquisition is a key step in establishing our platform for investment in high quality suburban office properties in select markets.  The addition of Safanad, with its management in world wide investments and Square Mile, which along with its affiliates has approximately $15 Billion of assets under management, provides the financial strength to continue building our portfolio."
Along with the acquisition of these properties, Workspace has hired approximately 50 new employees to expand its franchise.  Roger Thomas, President, Chief Operating Officer and a founding principal of WPT, stated, "Everyone at WPT is ecstatic to have acquired these well-maintained, well-located assets from Liberty.  This exceptional acquisition adds tremendous growth and potential to our platform.  We have built an outstanding organization with fantastic talent in all aspects of owning, managing, and leasing quality suburban properties.  We look forward to a successful future as a leader in suburban office markets."
This portfolio acquired by Workspace Property Trust includes suburban submarkets in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Tampa, Phoenix, and South Florida.  The portfolio boasts strong, consistent overall occupancy and financial performance.  Workspace Property Trust closed on its first transaction last year when it purchased 41 office and flex buildings in Horsham, PA from Liberty Property Trust for approximately $245.3 million.  WPT's first acquisition was in partnership with Forum Partners, JMP Group, and EverWatch Capital.
Kamal Bahamdan, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Safanad commented, "Safanad's approach to investing aligns very well with Workspace Property Trust's vision and strategic plan of building a strong overall portfolio in vibrant submarkets.  We have great confidence that our partnership with Tom and Roger, together with their original investing partners and Square Mile, will create tremendous value in these suburban office markets."
Elliot Rattner, Principal for Square Mile commented, "We are pleased to join WPT, its existing capital partners and Safanad in this high quality and diversified portfolio acquisition. Square Mile invests utilizing a value-oriented approach to commercial real estate assets through alignment with likeminded and institutional sponsors. Tom, Roger, and the WPT portfolio fit squarely with these objectives and we are excited to be a part of this important step towards their firm's growth and future success."

Fees & Charges FAQ

Safety Practices & Training Fee (Sometimes called by other vendors a HazMat Fee)

The Safety Practices & Training Fee (which we formerly called the REG Fee) is charged to recover some of Suburban's safety related costs including, but not limited to, in connection with our own vehicle and facility inspections as well as our employee training and testing.  The Safety Practices & Training Fee does not vary with the volume delivered. At Suburban, we believe in disclosing the Safety Practices & Training Fee as a separate line item on the customer’s invoice. The Safety Practices & Training Fee helps us to maintain our safety standards, which already meet or exceed Federal, State and Local regulations. The Safety Practices & Training Fee (and the other fees described on this page) are not specifically authorized or imposed by any local, state or federal law, and the Safety Practices & Training Fee (and other fees) are not collected on behalf of, or remitted to, any governmental entity.

Tank Rent

Suburban Propane provides a storage tank for our customers’ use. We maintain ownership and responsibility for the tank(s) at our customer’s property. As owner of the tank(s), we are responsible for any needed maintenance and compliance with all applicable safety regulations. If the tank ever needs repair or replacement, we do that with no additional charge to the customer. The rental fee helps defray our costs associated with tank acquisition, maintenance and insurance — including a testing process that must be performed periodically to ensure that the tank is within original manufacturer’s specifications.

Transportation Fuel Surcharge

Increases in the price of crude oil, diesel fuel and gasoline have affected us all, and in particular, companies like Suburban that deliver their product by truck. These increases have greatly impacted our transportation costs when making fuel deliveries. The Transportation Fuel Surcharge helps us to recover a portion of these transportation costs. The Transportation Fuel Surcharge is based on the current price of crude oil, and so it may go up or down over time as such price fluctuates. The Transportation Fuel Surcharge is reviewed each month and is clearly itemized on your bill.

Restocking (Pump Out) Fee

A Restocking Fee covers the labor cost required to disconnect and pump out any remaining propane from a Suburban Propane owned tank. Labor costs can vary by region and location.

Closeout (Tank Pickup) Fee

The Closeout Fee covers administrative activities and labor costs associated with closing a customer account, such as issuing the customer a refund, processing a final statement and picking up the tank upon termination of service. This fee varies depending on tank size and region. 

Minimum Monthly Purchase Requirement (MMR/Minimum Bill)

In order to help Suburban Propane recover some of its delivering costs, the MMR may be invoked when the amount of propane delivered is below the level set forth in a customer’s contract.

System Leak Test Fee

This fee may be charged to partially defray the cost of labor incurred to conduct a leak test.  Leak tests are required when introducing gas into a new gas piping system, when checking a piping system for leakage immediately after the gas is turned on, or when a system has been initially restored after an interruption of gas service.

Reconnect Fee

This fee is for reconnecting the customer’s gas service following a tank lock-off. Reconnect fees will vary depending on whether or not the reconnect is scheduled during normal business hours.

Will Call Fee

This fee may be charged to a non auto-routed customer to help defray the added costs of scheduling and completing a special delivery at the customer's request.

Forklift Minimum Delivery

This fee may be charged to offset the time and labor involved in the onsite filling of forklift propane gas cylinders.

Diagnostic Fee

This fee applies to the process of diagnosing service related repairs to be made on customer owned appliances and equipment.

Installation Fee

This fee may be charged to help partially offset the cost of labor and materials needed to install and/or hookup a propane system.

Early Termination Fee

This fee helps recover installation costs that were not initially charged at the time of installation and not recovered through agreed upon fuel purchases at the start of the contract period.

Emergency/Special Delivery Fee

This charge is incurred by customers who request deliveries outside of normal business hours.

Late Charge

This charge is assessed when a customer does not pay a bill within the agreed upon credit terms.

Returned Check Fee

Checks returned for non-sufficient funds will initiate a charge to the customer’s account to offset the banks fees the company incurs and the time to reprocess the check.

Meter Account Maintenance Fee

This fee is charged for the activities that are necessary for proper administration, operation and billing of a customer account with a propane system including a meter.



These are the most frequently asked about fees. There are other charges such as hourly labor rates that may apply for services offered. If you have any questions, please contact your local office.
