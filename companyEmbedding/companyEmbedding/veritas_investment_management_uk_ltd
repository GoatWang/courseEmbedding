Our investment services



Investment Services
Our investment approach
Client services and reporting




Investment Services
We manage investments on a discretionary basis for UK and international private investors, trusts and charities with a minimum of £3m or currency equivalent.  Typically, we invest directly in individual global securities. 
Each client has an investment manager responsible for their portfolio.  We do not employ relationship managers because we think it is important that clients speak directly to the person who is making the investment decisions.  The investment managers are supported by a portfolio assistant.  They are a key point of contact for any administrative matters and are in constant communication with the custodian.


Our investment approach

We have a long-term, real return investment focus which aligns our investment process and selection with our clients’ objectives and goals.  The result of this philosophy is that in individual years we do, and will, have significant differences against indices and “passive” managers.  However, our investment record demonstrates that we have delivered consistent, risk-adjusted, long-term real returns for our clients.
We invest globally on a best ideas, unindexed basis. We believe that as investors we should seek global opportunities for real returns rather than focusing on any specific country or region given businesses increasingly operate in global context.  The location of a stock market listing is less relevant today given that borders are blurring.
We aim to find companies where structural shifts are creating demand for their products or services. While economic cycles are almost impossible to predict, structural growth can be both long-term in nature and relatively insulated from the economic cycle. Indeed companies that benefit from structural shifts should be able to consistently grow their earnings and cash flow per share over a multi-year period, irrespective of the economic environment. Provided you buy that company’s equity at a sensible valuation, you are likely to have a successful long-term investment that delivers a real return.  Should we not be able to find equities which we believe will provide real returns, or worse are overvalued and might expose the client to meaningful loss in the medium to long term, we would be prepared to remain heavily in cash and/or investment grade bonds.



Client services and reporting
Our service and reporting to our clients takes two forms, written and personal.  We recommend meeting clients at least once a year to discuss the portfolio; however we are delighted to meet more frequently if required.
Performance statistics, valuations with bank statements and transaction details, prepared by the custodian, are generally sent out quarterly.  Our Market Musings published each quarter sets out our current investment views and strategy.

About Veritas



Our Company
Our history
Our philosophy
Awards
Our news




Our Company
We are an independently owned investment management boutique with a strong partnership culture. We offer our clients the benefits of independence, stability and a long-term perspective.   
We focus on generating real returns.  This means protecting and growing the purchasing power of our clients’ capital. Founded on a global thematic approach and using proprietary research, we have a track record of superior investment performance with below average volatility.
Our investment team has on average over 20 years' investment experience and we take pride in offering our clients a personal service.  We have offices in London and Zurich and we currently manage over £2 billion.


Our history
The business was originally founded in Zurich in 1993 by Anthony Rosenfelder and a London office was opened in 1996.  In 2004, Stewart Newton, the founder of Newton Investment Management, joined the group.  We have always understood and valued the importance of stability within investment management companies and in January 2013 the group restructured to ensure that the management of the business was aligned and focused on its clients.  The current group structure emerged at that time


Our philosophy
Our philosophy and culture stand out amongst our peers, guided by two founding principles.
Real ReturnsOur investment philosophy is aligned with our clients' objectives – to protect and grow the power of their capital over the long term.  We focus on real returns and consider risk as the potential for permanent capital loss.  Our sole aim is to deliver long-term real returns, ahead of inflation, to our clients. Over 20 years, we have consistently achieved this aim by adhering to our common sense investment philosophy and process.
PartnershipWe have a deep-rooted culture of partnership.  The investment team comprises fourteen experienced investment professionals who are committed to providing a personal service to all our clients.  We are independently owned by the partners and employees, which creates stability and focuses us on achieving client objectives. 
 


Awards
For many years we have been recognised by our peers through a number of industry awards.  However, the stability of our client base tells us everything we need to know – people entrust us with their money and they stay with us.

Living Wage Foundation
We are pleased to announce that from 17th October 2014 we have been accredited as a Living Wage employer by the Living Wage Foundation.
The Living Wage commitment will see everyone working at Veritas Investment Management LLP, regardless of whether they are permanent employees or third-party contractors and suppliers, receive a minimum hourly wage of £9.15 - significantly higher than the national minimum wage of £6.50.
The Living Wage is an hourly rate set independently and updated annually. The Living Wage is calculated according to the basic cost of living using the ‘Minimum Income Standard’ for the UK. Decisions about what to include in this standard are set by the public; it is a social consensus about what people need to make ends meet.
Employers choose to pay the Living Wage on a voluntary basis. The Living Wage enjoys cross party support, with public backing from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.
