Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)[edit]
Packet Digital is designing circuitry for solar-powered UAS to more efficiently use electrical output from solar panels on the aircraft wings and fuselage to power avionics and charge on-board batteries. By reducing wasteful power dissipation, the company aims to increases flight times.
Packet Digital is designing power electronics to be used conjointly with advanced photovoltaics being developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. Ultimately, the two organizations want to help the Navy achieve unlimited flight times for its solar-powered UAS. The circuitry will implement high-frequency power tracking algorithms to accommodate dynamic movements of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or clouds that could change how much sunlight is absorbed and converted by the solar cells.[4]
Packet Digital announced in June 2015 that it would create Botlink LLC as a joint venture with drone app developer Aerobotic Innovations LLC. Botlink will develop and market a hardware-software platform combining Packet Digital's power management circuits for improved drone endurance and Aerobotic Innovation's cloud-based operations platform for safety, communications, data processing and control of a drone from a drag-and-drop app on a tablet or smartphone—a feature known as "Drag. Drop. Drone."[5]
Leadership[edit]
In February 2015, it was announced Peter Lindgren, president and CEO of Otter Products, and Linda Pancratz, retired chairman of the board and CEO of TDL Infomedia Limited in the United Kingdom, joined the Packet Digital board of directors.[6]
Accolades[edit]
Packet Digital was named the Electronics and Overall Innovation Challenge Winner at Aviation Week 2012 in Washington, D.C.[7] Gartner named Packet Digital in its 2014 Cool Vendors in Semiconductors report.[8] Inc. listed the company number 468 among its 500 Fastest Growing Companies in 2008.[1]

Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)[edit]
Packet Digital is designing circuitry for solar-powered UAS to more efficiently use electrical output from solar panels on the aircraft wings and fuselage to power avionics and charge on-board batteries. By reducing wasteful power dissipation, the company aims to increases flight times.
Packet Digital is designing power electronics to be used conjointly with advanced photovoltaics being developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. Ultimately, the two organizations want to help the Navy achieve unlimited flight times for its solar-powered UAS. The circuitry will implement high-frequency power tracking algorithms to accommodate dynamic movements of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or clouds that could change how much sunlight is absorbed and converted by the solar cells.[4]
Packet Digital announced in June 2015 that it would create Botlink LLC as a joint venture with drone app developer Aerobotic Innovations LLC. Botlink will develop and market a hardware-software platform combining Packet Digital's power management circuits for improved drone endurance and Aerobotic Innovation's cloud-based operations platform for safety, communications, data processing and control of a drone from a drag-and-drop app on a tablet or smartphone—a feature known as "Drag. Drop. Drone."[5]
Leadership[edit]
In February 2015, it was announced Peter Lindgren, president and CEO of Otter Products, and Linda Pancratz, retired chairman of the board and CEO of TDL Infomedia Limited in the United Kingdom, joined the Packet Digital board of directors.[6]
Accolades[edit]
Packet Digital was named the Electronics and Overall Innovation Challenge Winner at Aviation Week 2012 in Washington, D.C.[7] Gartner named Packet Digital in its 2014 Cool Vendors in Semiconductors report.[8] Inc. listed the company number 468 among its 500 Fastest Growing Companies in 2008.[1]
