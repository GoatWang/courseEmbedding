MBP Capital Acquires 346-Unit Honey Hill Apartment Community in San Antonio Medical DistrictDecember 26, 2016



SAN ANTONIO, TX - MBP Capital, Inc., a multifamily investment firm, headquartered in Denver, Colorado with offices in Dallas, Texas, recently announced the acquisition of Honey Hill Apartments, a 346-unit multifamily asset in the highly sought after “Medical District” in San Antonio, Texas. 
MBP has hired Catalyst Multifamily of Dallas, Texas, to handle the day to day property management responsibilities.  Chris Ross, Mike Miller, Will Carouth, and Cody Courtney of Berkadia San Antonio, represented the Seller of Honey Hill.
The Honey Hill property is a true “value add” opportunity which will involve $3M worth of capital improvements in the first 12-18 months, and will include full interior renovations, full exterior paint, new patio and balcony fencing, outdoor amenities, clubhouse remodel, and extensive landscaping upgrades among other things. The new ownership group will look to raise rents by nearly 30% from the current averages. Honey Hill had never been previously sold and will be rebranded upon completion of the capital projects.
MBP Capital finished 2016 with over $55M worth of transactions in Q4, which consisted of three acquisitions and one disposition.  In addition to Honey Hill, MBP Capital, in an off market transaction, purchased Bradfield Place, a 96-unit property, located in Garland, Texas. They also purchased Riverbend Village, a 201-unit, located in Arlington, Texas. Dirk Goris and Danny Baker of CBRE Dallas, represented the Seller of Riverbend.
The sole disposition in 2016 was The Monterey Apartments (FKA Kirkwood Park) a 160-unit property located in Irving, Texas.  MBP nearly doubled the value of the asset within the 24 months of ownership.  
MBP Capital is national multifamily investment firm that focuses on the Texas and Colorado multifamily markets. Mike Phillips, President; Cathy Finn, Vice-president; and, Ryan Heddleston, Director of Brokerage & Acquisitions.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
