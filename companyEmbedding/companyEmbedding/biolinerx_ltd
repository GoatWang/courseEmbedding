FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Operations[edit]
BioLineRx is a drug development company that seeks to discover compounds with potential to treat a variety of diseases, including cancer, schizophrenia and cardiac deterioration. When promising compounds are discovered, BioLine leads them through preclinical trials and engages other companies to advance the compounds' development into commercializable drugs.[3] The company entered into its first major commercialization agreement in 2009 when it partnered with Ikaria Holdings Inc. to develop its BL-1040 compound.[4] In 2010 BioLine entered into a commercialization agreement with Cypress Bioscience Inc. for development of its BL-1020 compound. The agreement with Cypress was canceled in 2011 when the company was taken over by Ramius LLC.[5]
Pipeline[edit]
Below is a partial list of drug compounds in various stages of development by BioLineRx. Unless indicated otherwise, they have not obtained regulatory approval in relation to the diseases cited.

BL-1010 – orally available neuropathic pain[6]
BL-1020 – orally available GABA-enhanced antipsychotic for treatment of schizophrenia[7]
BL-1021 – orally available small molecule for treatment of neuropathic pain[8]
BL-1040 – liquid polymer injected into patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction, invented by Smadar Cohen of Ben-Gurion University[9][10]
BL-1230 - a potent and selective cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2R) agonist intended as a novel treatment for Dry Eye Syndrome (DES) [11]
BL-5010 – cream treatment for seborrheic keratosis skin lesions[12]
BL-7040 – orally available anti-inflammatory drug invented by Hermona Soreq of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem[13]
BL-8020 – orally administered treatment for Hepatitis C, developed by Professor Philippe Halfon, Co-Founder and President of Genoscience.
BL-8030 – second-generation NS3 protease inhibitor for oral treatment of Hepatitis C, invented by Philippe Halfon[14]

Business model[edit]
See also: Bench to bedside and Proof of concept
BioLine's business model consists of three stages. In the first stage, called the bench stage, the potential drug candidate is evaluated "from both scientific and marketing perspectives." In the second stage, called the bedside stage, BioLine accompanies the drug through early clinical trials. In the third stage, the partner stage, BioLine enters into strategic partnership with a pharmaceutical company to see the drug through its advanced clinical trials and bring it to the market.[15]
Corporate history[edit]
BioLineRx was established in 2003 as a joint venture of Teva, Hadasit Bio-Holdings, the Jerusalem Development Authority, Yehuda Zisapel, and other investors.[16] It executed an initial public offering on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in February 2007, raising 211 million NIS ($50 million) – the TASE's largest biotech IPO until that time.[17][18] In August 2011 BioLine's ADRs began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market.[19][20] In January 2012, BioLineRx announced a deal with Genoscience, a French pharmaceutical company to jointly develop and market the BL-8020 compound, as a treatment for Hepatitis C.[21] At the end of 2014, Novartis acquired a 12.8% stake in the company as a strategic move to gain access to Israeli-sourced drug candidates.[2]
Management[edit]
Morris Laster, Downstate Medical Center (M.D.) and SUNY Albany (B.Sc.) alumnus, was CEO of BioLineRx until 2009. He was replaced by Kinneret Savitsky, alumnus of Tel Aviv University (Master's and Ph.D.) and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (B.Sc.), early in 2010.[22] Savitsky was replaced as CEO by BioLine COO Philip Serlin on October 10, 2016.[23]

In the third stage, the partner stage, BioLine enters into strategic partnership with a pharmaceutical company to see the drug through its advanced clinical trials and bring it to the market.[15]
Corporate history[edit]
BioLineRx was established in 2003 as a joint venture of Teva, Hadasit Bio-Holdings, the Jerusalem Development Authority, Yehuda Zisapel, and other investors.[16] It executed an initial public offering on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in February 2007, raising 211 million NIS ($50 million) – the TASE's largest biotech IPO until that time.[17][18] In August 2011 BioLine's ADRs began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market.[19][20] In January 2012, BioLineRx announced a deal with Genoscience, a French pharmaceutical company to jointly develop and market the BL-8020 compound, as a treatment for Hepatitis C.[21] At the end of 2014, Novartis acquired a 12.8% stake in the company as a strategic move to gain access to Israeli-sourced drug candidates.[2]
Management[edit]
Morris Laster, Downstate Medical Center (M.D.) and SUNY Albany (B.Sc.) alumnus, was CEO of BioLineRx until 2009. He was replaced by Kinneret Savitsky, alumnus of Tel Aviv University (Master's and Ph.D.) and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (B.Sc.), early in 2010.[22] Savitsky was replaced as CEO by BioLine COO Philip Serlin on October 10, 2016.[23]

Operations[edit]
BioLineRx is a drug development company that seeks to discover compounds with potential to treat a variety of diseases, including cancer, schizophrenia and cardiac deterioration. When promising compounds are discovered, BioLine leads them through preclinical trials and engages other companies to advance the compounds' development into commercializable drugs.[3] The company entered into its first major commercialization agreement in 2009 when it partnered with Ikaria Holdings Inc. to develop its BL-1040 compound.[4] In 2010 BioLine entered into a commercialization agreement with Cypress Bioscience Inc. for development of its BL-1020 compound. The agreement with Cypress was canceled in 2011 when the company was taken over by Ramius LLC.[5]
Pipeline[edit]
Below is a partial list of drug compounds in various stages of development by BioLineRx. Unless indicated otherwise, they have not obtained regulatory approval in relation to the diseases cited.

BL-1010 – orally available neuropathic pain[6]
BL-1020 – orally available GABA-enhanced antipsychotic for treatment of schizophrenia[7]
BL-1021 – orally available small molecule for treatment of neuropathic pain[8]

Business model[edit]
See also: Bench to bedside and Proof of concept
BioLine's business model consists of three stages. In the first stage, called the bench stage, the potential drug candidate is evaluated "from both scientific and marketing perspectives." In the second stage, called the bedside stage, BioLine accompanies the drug through early clinical trials. In the third stage, the partner stage, BioLine enters into strategic partnership with a pharmaceutical company to see the drug through its advanced clinical trials and bring it to the market.[15]
Corporate history[edit]
BioLineRx was established in 2003 as a joint venture of Teva, Hadasit Bio-Holdings, the Jerusalem Development Authority, Yehuda Zisapel, and other investors.[16] It executed an initial public offering on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in February 2007, raising 211 million NIS ($50 million) – the TASE's largest biotech IPO until that time.[17][18] In August 2011 BioLine's ADRs began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market.[19][20] In January 2012, BioLineRx announced a deal with Genoscience, a French pharmaceutical company to jointly develop and market the BL-8020 compound, as a treatment for Hepatitis C.[21] At the end of 2014, Novartis acquired a 12.8% stake in the company as a strategic move to gain access to Israeli-sourced drug candidates.[2]
Management[edit]
Morris Laster, Downstate Medical Center (M.D.) and SUNY Albany (B.Sc.) alumnus, was CEO of BioLineRx until 2009. He was replaced by Kinneret Savitsky, alumnus of Tel Aviv University (Master's and Ph.D.) and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (B.Sc.), early in 2010.[22] Savitsky was replaced as CEO by BioLine COO Philip Serlin on October 10, 2016.[23]
