InnovationWe look outside the box to develop the most innovative solutions.
PerformanceOur ICs feature high power density and incredible performance.
EfficiencyIntegrate our technology to create highly efficient LED lighting products.
CollaborationWe work with you to develop the right solution for your business.

 
About Indice Semiconductor
Indice Semiconductor’s innovative power control technology drives leading energy efficient LED lighting and has applications in audio amplifiers, power supplies, renewable energy inverters, electric motor control and much, much more.
Key benefits of our technology include:

High power density – our ICs enable our customers to pack a lot into significantly smaller mechanicals, reducing not only size, but also weight.
More efficient – reduced heat loss and higher performance means more powerful end products.
Reduced costs – these efficiency gains mean lower production costs in our customers’ manufacturing process

At Indice, innovation runs deeply through everything we do. Rather than trying to merely improve upon old and outdated power control techniques, we have developed our own methodologies from scratch. An example of this is our revolutionary Continuous SigmaTM encoding method, a digital semiconductor architecture that replaces many high performance analog circuits for power control and conversion.
Continuous SigmaTM has been described by industry leader Mark Telefus as the single most significant breakthrough in semiconductor power control and conversion in 40 years.

Offline LED Driver IC
Product Number: INDICE0101
Indice’s mains voltage (120VAC or 240VAC systems) incandescent lamp replacement technology is available to OEM’s and lighting companies as a Offline LED Driver IC and reference design for integration into your light bulb, lighting fixture or LED driver product range. Indice’s proven reference designs, application notes and support get you to market quickly. Indice’s Offline LED Driver IC’s are ideal for light bulb, LED driver and lighting fixture manufacturers who want high performance products with exceptional dimming and additional features.

Dimming with TRIAC  leading edge and trailing edge phase cut dimmers: Our control chip provides dimming with most existing dimmers globally (refer to dimmer and transformer compatibility list).
High Efficiency: >85% including all system losses such as the rectifier and EMC filter.
Input voltage range: 204VAC – 264VAC for 240V systems and 90VAC – 130VAC for 120V systems.
High power factor: >0.9 meeting US Energy Star requirements for commercial and residential installations.
Active Temperature Management and power management: Our controller continuously monitors the operating temperature of the lamp adjusting power accordingly which maximises LED life and brightness lumen maintenance. In the event the ambient temperature reaches extremes, the controller will safely shut down the lamp. The lamp will turn back on when the ambient temperature drops below the set threshold.
Turn key reference designs that are ready to be implemented by your development team.
Extensive testing: Indice has carried out extensive testing of its control technology on dimmers from across the globe (refer to dimmer compatibility list). Indice has its control technology certified to meet international EMC requirements and validates its lumen and efficacy within NATA reputable accredited western laboratories.
Full PCB design services available on request and iterative chargers to support production improvements.
Full support available on request for alternative sourcing of components to reduce cost and lead times (this involves a detailed engineering process of thoroughly testing and validating parts).

EXPAND THE HORIZON OF POSSIBILITY.
Indice Semiconductor is changing the world, one IC at a time.
 
While others might talk about innovation, Indice lives and breathes it. We take changing the world very seriously: we don’t accept that things should stay the same, just because that’s how they’ve been done for decades.
 
Key benefits of Indice technology:

High power density – our ICs enable our customers to pack a lot into significantly smaller mechanicals, reducing not only size, but also weight.
More efficient – reduced heat loss and higher performance means more powerful end products.
Reduced costs – these efficiency gains mean lower production costs in our customers’ manufacturing process

 
About Indice Semiconductor
Indice was founded when we recognized a potential application for our power control algorithm within the then emerging energy efficient lighting space. We began development of an MR16 LED Driver IC and later a Offline LED Driver IC; enhanced iterations of both remain in our product suite until this day.
We recognized that our breakthroughs in LED lighting were able to be applied elsewhere, and soon developed audio proof of concepts that have been proclaimed by audiophile equipment manufacturers as the best digital amplifiers they’d ever heard.
These successes were driven by our revolutionary Continuous SigmaTM encoding method, a digital semiconductor architecture that replaces many high performance analog circuits for power control and conversion.
 
Continuous Sigma: It’s not evolution – it’s revolution.
Continuous SigmaTM has been described by industry leader Mark Telefus as the single most significant breakthrough in semiconductor power control and conversion in 40 years.
 

 
While our competitors are limited by their use of traditional, more complex delta sigma encoding methods which have barely changed since they were developed in the 1970s, our radical method has enabled us to develop the most efficient, high performance and high power density ICs available in the LED lighting and audio markets.
 
“Continuous SigmaTM is simple and conservative yet it is also radical & revolutionary because it can be applied to applications as wide as lighting control and high fidelity audio.”
– Mark Telefus, power industry leader, iWatt CTO and co-founder
 
Our technology is changing the world.
We’re not stopping with LED lighting and audio amplifiers; Continuous SigmaTM has so many applications, including renewable energy inverters, power supplies for data centres, signal control, electric motor control and so much more.

Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk acknowledges that the real competitors of his company are't the few other EV models on the market currently, but rather the "enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world's factories every day." Like any other technology developer, Tesla created patents in order to avoid the theft of their ideas by competitors. However Musk believes that the opportunity to reduce emissions and move the world towards a more sustainable and efficient transport system is crucial, pointing out that currently EV accounts for less than 1% of total vehicle sales. While removing patents is a bold move, and one that perhaps can be afforded only by the fact that Tesla is currently secure in its position as market leader, the decision will surely be inspiring for the global engineering community. "We believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform", writes Musk. "Technology leadership is not defined by patents, [...] but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world's most talented engineers." Clearly dedicated to an EV future rather than dominated by its own bottom line, Tesla recently announced that a competitive pricing strategy in Europe and China, rather than taking advantage of markets traditionally open to the cost of luxury vehicles. Ensuring affordability and encouraging innovation may well be a strategy that maintains Tesla Motors's position as global electric vehicle leader.   Read Elon Musk's patent article here.By admin|

The firm predicts sales to reach US$3.4 billion in 2017 as consumer demand continues to grow. The LED chip market will continue to see an upward trajectory, despite waning sales in chips for LED back-lighting applications, such as display screens. "LED market observers have been expecting huge growth in the LED lighting market for a long time, and it's finally here," said Steven Sher of DisplaySearch. LED lighting technology's popularity is increasing partially because it contains no mercury, is more efficient than other existing lights and generally has a longer life span. Read the full Digitimes article here. Increasing demand for LED lighting products is good news for Indice, a designer and manufacturer of another crucial lighting component, LED Driver ICs. Both its Mains IC (INDICE0101) and MR16 IC (INDICE0002) have become a popular choice for lighting manufacturers due to its unique features. One of those features is Active Temperature Management, which allows the chip to regulate the operating temperature of the light, protecting the LED and electronics from overheating. This extends product life and means lights featuring the Indice Driver IC can also be installed inside sealed fixtures. Deep Dimming is also a feature of Indice's products. The Driver IC allows for smooth, flicker-free dimming and is compatible with most dimmers on the market globally. Indice's production-ready Mains and MR16 reference designs enable manufacturers to get their products on the market quickly and include supporting data such as application notes and white papers.  By admin|

Reports show lowered prices in European markets also, with a close to 7,000 Euro drop in the price of a Tesla Model S in Germany. The reason for this isn't clear: it could signify low demand, or perhaps it is part of Elon Musk's strategy to sell more cars in the region. Musk declared last month that "towards the end of the year, we expect sales in those regions combined to be almost twice that of North America." Tesla also isn't planning on price hikes in China to take advantage of a premium-car loving market. The price will reflect increased shipping costs, duties and taxes, however Tesla won't be increasing its margin on Chinese sales. Yesterday CleanTechnica also published the results of a reader poll on what will be the "Top-Selling Electric Car in US & Europe in 2014", with the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S topping both lists. In the US the Toyota Prius Plug-in and Chevy Volt are also likely to be popular, while Germany, France, the Netherlands and Norway favoured the BMW i3, the Mitsubishi Outlander Plug-in and the Renault Zoe. CleanTechnica boasts to be the world's number one most trafficked cleantech-focused website, with around 186,000 unique visitors per month.   Read the full article about Tesla's European and Chinese pricing here.

Active Temperature Management means long product life and enables lights to be installed even inside sealed fixtures. Driver IC's by Indice also benefit from ultra high power density, deep dimming (right down to 0%) and true compatibility with existing infrastructure. Few other LED driver IC's can boast such broad compatibility with leading and trailing edge dimmers and in the case of Indice's MR16 driver IC's, electronic and magnetic halogen transformers. Lighting manufacturers can also take advantage of Indice's Mains and MR16  reference design series. Reference designs decrease time to market for manufacturers seeking to use the Indice driver IC in their LED product. Including PCB designs, whitepapers, application notes and datasheets, these reference designs are production ready or can be customized to suit the manufacturer's own mechanicals. The Indice team will be at Strategies in Light from 25 - 27 February, located at booth 919. Strategies in Light has run for 15 years as the flagship companion event to the major industry publication, LEDs Magazine. With 200 exhibiting companies and nearly 5,000 attendees  last year, Strategies in Light has cemented its place as one of the world's largest and longest-running LED and lighting trade shows and conferences.

Indice Audio and mObridge showed off the now commercially available Rare Audio Amplifier earlier this month at International CES, where it got a lot of attention for its regenerative PSU and highly efficient amplifier module. Audio Car Stereo Team also note its light weight and incredibly low profile. Total amplifier thickness is under one inch (25mm) making it the most technically advanced and compact amplifier available on the market. Using the powerful GUI via a PC, tablet or smartphone, users can tune their system to their preference and environment. Currently models with three different inputs are available for purchase - MOST, Digital and Analog. Each model features Bluetooth, is smartphone compatible and has 4 x 125W RMS audio channels.
