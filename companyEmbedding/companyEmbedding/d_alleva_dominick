Industry Insiders: Dominick D’Alleva, Legal Eagle

			Posted on October 20, 2008 by BlackBook 



Dominick D’Alleva, owner of Home and the still-hot Sway, on trading in the Law for the industry, not getting a table at his own joint, and plotting power moves in this economy. 
 Favorite Hangs: One of my old friends from Yale Law School and I still meet weekly at Da Silvano. We also like other, more quaint restaurants. When we go out, we go to Cipriani, Giorgione, but, since Little Italy has been eaten by Chinatown, you have to look for places [further away].  
 Point of Origin: I was born in Italy — in Abruzzi on the Adriatic; that had a tremendous influence as I grew up. At four, I stole eggs from my grandmother and traded them for pastries. I started early. I grew up in my uncle’s restaurant in Orsogna; now my cousin has it.
Occupations: I knew I wanted to go to law school and went to Yale Law School before I worked for a big Wall Street Firm: Simpson, Thatcher, Barber — which then represented Lehman Brothers. I always leaned towards business, and wanted to do more than law, which I always thought was a little boring. I finally got into the hospitality, club, and restaurant business in the early 1990s … so my partner and I opened Conscience Point, which lasted for four years. There, I met David Page, the chef, and we opened up Home restaurant a year later here in Greenwich Village. We went from a country club to the Village, with organic food and wines principally from the East Coast. Then, we did Nemo together in South Beach, which was about 1994. There was no Portofino, no nothing — only Joe’s Stone Crab. 
 I was still in the real estate business, and in 1995, I had a foreclosure at 305 Spring Street, which housed — among other things — McGovern’s Bar, which had been there for 50 years on the corner that met Greenwich. When it ran into some difficulties, I took over the space and we put in a club — Sway. It took a while, but at the time it was tough in real estate and restaurants, so we didn’t open until late 1998. I did open up a new restaurant that had an Italian flavor … Risotteria on Bleecker and Morton. It’s still there, and now I can’t get a table! It started out as salads and risotto and reasonably priced Italian comfort food. Then, we got into gluten-free food, and certain people allergic to wheat loved our pizzas and cookies. 
 Any non-industry projects in the works? In philanthropy, we have two organizations we work with: ARTrageous, the foster children’s organization, which raises money through auctioning off art. I like to collect, so it was a win/win. I bought a Jeff Koons, who has contributed a lot of his work for the program. I also collaborate with the Association of Community Employment Programs for the Homeless. Henry Buhl’s Sunflower Festival auctions off pieces of art to raise money for the organization. This year, we’ve made $450,000 so far. Those are our two favorite charities, and the next art auction is in May. For those who contribute, the money for the art goes to the foster children. Robin and I are also great supporters of yoga charities and, of course, we subscribe to ABT [American Ballet Theatre] and support the ballet. 
 Industry Icons: I would say Donald Trump, for a lot of reasons. For stock investments: Warren Buffett. And for restaurants, I would say Steve Hanson, because he not only did the chain restaurant, but also ventured into three-star Fiamma. 
 Projections: We’re going to have another Risotteria. We were going to do a Pleasure Club on Second Avenue and 46th Street, but have decided on a location closer to the river, in either Midtown or the West side. Also, because of the real estate situation, opportunities should be appearing soon. 
 What are you doing tonight? After our dinner at Home, we’re stopping off at Sway for mac and cheese, and then going back to our penthouse to enjoy the view from the Trump Tower.

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

This firm’s lawyers do not have peer reviews.


*Attorneys who only have peer reviews prior to April 15, 2008 are not displayed.









Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Trump World Tower
Why are so many lawyers interested in making the jump to business? One obvious reason: money. 
Look at the list of lawyers who made this year’s Forbes 400. Of the almost 40 lawyers / holders of law degrees who made the cut, only one, Joe Jamail, is a practicing attorney. And he’s all the way down at #269, with a net worth of just $1.5 billion. Poor Joe!
If you’re a partner at a major law firm in a big city, you might someday own a $3 million apartment. But if you want a $30 million apartment, you need to move into business.  


A $30 million-plus apartment, in the Trump World Tower. That’s what lawyer turned businessman Dominick D’Alleva, a 1977 graduate of Yale Law School and a former Simpson Thacher associate, has placed on the market. 




It’s the weekend, when people like to attend open houses for fun real-estate voyeurism. So let’s take a take a look at D’Alleva’s digs….

D’Alleva has already received an offer on his apartment, as reported in the New York Times:
[A Saudi] prince made an offer recently on [D’Alleva’s] sprawling penthouse on the top floor, listed as the 90th, and with an asking price of $34.5 million. The broker on the listing, Dolly Lenz of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that the prince — whose name she declined to disclose — could not fathom the idea that anyone might live above him.
Ms. Lenz also declined to discuss the specifics of the offer.
So we don’t know how close the princely offer came to the $34.5 million asking price — but we do know the apartment is fit for a king. It boasts 5,500 square feet of living space, four bedrooms, and five and a half marble baths.
Check out the floor plan:

Thanks to the penthouse’s high elevation — at one point, the Trump World Tower was the world’s tallest residential building — and the floor-to-ceiling windows, the apartment enjoys panoramic, 360-degree views. You can see Central Park, the GW Bridge, the Statue of Liberty, and even the Atlantic Ocean.
Dominick D'Alleva
How did Dominick D’Alleva come to own such an amazing apartment? With all due respect to Simpson Thacher — one of the nation’s most profitable firms, with profits per partner of $2.415 million in 2009 — it wasn’t from practicing law. As D’Alleva told BlackBook:
I knew I wanted to go to law school and went to Yale Law School before I worked for a big Wall Street Firm: Simpson, Thacher [& Bartlett] — which then represented Lehman Brothers.
I always leaned towards business, and wanted to do more than law, which I always thought was a little boring.
Boring — and insufficiently lucrative. So D’Alleva left STB for the world of business. After spending a few years as an in-house lawyer, he moved into the world of real estate acquisition and financing, where he did very well for himself. He also encountered success in the restaurant and nightlife business, launching a series of successful establishments (including Conscience Point, Home, and Sway). 
Now, some 30 years after he left Simpson as an associate, Dominick D’Alleva owns an apartment more fabulous, or at least more valuable, than any Simpson partner’s home (with the possible exception of the $30 million uptown mansion inhabited by Robert Smit and his family). 
Let’s look at some pretty pictures, shall we?

At Which Firms Are Women Thriving? Findings From The ATL Law Firm Gender Diversity Index

Law firms blow a lot of rhetorical hot air affirming their commitment to achieving gender diversity in the workplace. Yet, despite some isolated efforts to hire and retain more female attorneys and promote more women into partnership, little tangible progress has been made to improve the position of women in the profession…
