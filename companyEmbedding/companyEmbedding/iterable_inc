Learn how the Iterable platform gives you the tools to accomplish this. Welcome Your CustomersA strong welcome series is a must. Familiarize your new (or potential) customers with your products, let them know what to expect and point them to your social media channels.When you’re ready for the next step, use profile and behavioral cues to offer first-purchase discounts, birthday or anniversary messages, or other targeted campaigns. Use The Right ChannelsMessage customers based on where they’ll be most receptive, not on what your tools allow. Use SMS and in-app messages for time-sensitive offers, email for ongoing campaigns.A good next step: build a comprehensive message preference center that empowers your customers to specify how they should be contacted. Increase Customer Lifetime ValueYou’ve attracted someone to your store, now take advantage of it. People are busy and get distracted—use shopping cart abandonment campaigns to maximize their chance of converting.Once they’ve made a purchase, keep them coming back by showing them related products, asking them for feedback or sending targeted offers. Bring Old Customers BackRe-activation or win-back campaigns are a key part of successful e-commerce marketing. But you don’t want to overwhelm lapsed customers with irrelevant messages.Send campaigns based on past purchases and set up automated workflows that adjust frequency based on message engagement to maximize your chances of success. Incorporate Your Catalog DataE-commerce campaigns perform much better when they include actual product pictures, prices and other relevant info.Iterable’s “metadata store” gives you the ability to include any of your catalog data across your multi-channel campaigns.Learn More  User Engagement Top 100 Report   Shopping Cart Abandonment   User Engagement Teardowns TRUSTED BY       Have Questions?Chat liveORSchedule demo

product-iterable
Requirements

Node >= 6.0.0

Features

Create a Cartesian power of an iterable


Usage
Import
var ProductIterable = require('product-iterable');
Constructor

Cartesian product of iterables

Form

Where:


...iterables are finite iterable objects

Function: ::pow a.k.a ::times

Cartesian power of an iterable

Form
var power = ProductIterable.pow(iterable, exponent);
Where:


iterable is a finite iterable object, let's suppose its length equal to L

power is an iterable object which iterates LE number of arrays of iterable's elements
