Our Story









History
Vision & Mission
Core Values
Community





History
Florida’s Oldest Investment Firm
Allen & Company’s longstanding heritage of personalized customer service spans more than 80 years. From our humble beginnings in J. Everett Allen’s windowless office in downtown Lakeland in 1932 to opening multiple locations, generations of family’s have trusted Florida’s oldest investment firm to grow their wealth and help secure their financial future.
If We’re Not Growing, We’re Moving Backwards
When Ralph Allen joined his father’s firm in 1963, Allen & Company had four financial advisors. Today we have grown to nearly 70 associates in three offices across Central Florida, and we are on pace to have doubled in size over the past 15 years.
Allen & Company expanded to eastern Polk County in 1968 with the establishment of our Winter Haven office. In 1987, our flagship office in Lakeland moved after 50 years in the same downtown location to its current residence, the Allen Building, on South Florida Avenue. With a growing need for advisors across Central Florida, we opened an office in Viera in 2012.
Our growth has been both strategic and intentional, and our continued expansion is a result of making relationships our priority. While our client-focused personal service sets us apart, the firm consistently invests in our associates. In fact, Allen & Company created an ESOP in 2012 to give our employees an ownership interest in the firm. We know that when we invest in our associates, everyone benefits.
A Corporate Family
Decades later, our values remain the same. The firm’s hallmark has always been the client’s interest above all else, and the sound principals established by J. Everett Allen is the stability that ensures years of continued service.

 


Vision & Mission
At Allen & Company, it is our vision to be the primary Financial Advisor to individuals and businesses within the communities we serve.
It is our mission to be the premier provider of superior financial management services to our clients, guiding them to grow and protect their wealth and plan for its prudent transfer. We always place our clients’ interests first. We strive to be the best place to work, and we enhance the quality of life in our communities.

 


Core Values
Our core values serve as behavioral anchors, informing and guiding our actions and decisions. As an Allen & Company employee, client, supplier, or competitor, when you interact with us, you will see, hear, and experience clean and pervasive evidence that we:
Treat One Another with Dignity and Respect in concert with our belief that mutual trust and confidence will drive pride and performance.
Strive to Find a Better Way regardless of how proud we are of what we do and how we do it. We never settle for status quo and we hold one another accountable for continuous improvement in performance.
Maintain the Highest Levels of Integrity, understanding that our decisions and actions are driven, first and foremost, by our uncompromising commitment to do the right thing.
Make a Profound and Positive Difference in the lives of our employees, clients, and communities that we serve.

What are analysts saying about Pentair PLC. stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Pentair PLC. stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Pentair has outperformed the Zacks sub-industry year to date. Pentair expects full-year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to be in the range of $3.45–$3.55 and revenues to approximately $4.8 billion. The company will gain from continued dealer wins, strong product innovations and the sale of Valves & Controls. It also remains focused on making progress in building order channel. Further, Pentair's focus on price increases will help mitigate cost inflation. The company also has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters." (7/12/2017)
2. Credit Suisse Group analysts commented, "Given signs of a bottoming in the latter, and PNR's late-cycle sales mix, we think this out-growth is unlikely to accelerate. While its markets are strong now, we note that PNR's cyclicality was no lower than the sector average during the 2009 downturn," analyst Julian Mitchell wrote in a note. That said, Mitchell noted that the company should continue to record strong margin growth, while its operating margins have increased by about 300bps over the past three years.Related Link: Cowen & Company Downgrades Pentair To Underperform"We view five business units (-30 percent of sales) as 'under-earning' today, in that they offer 300bps+ of margin expansion opportunity; we assume that two-thirds of this opportunity (equating to $0.18–0.20 of EPS) is indeed realized in the next few years," Mitchell continued. Meanwhile, investors would focus on how the company deploys its V&C proceeds, while the company is keen to put the remaining balance sheet capacity of $1.4 billion to work.Mitchell said although the move would add $0.45 to EPS, it would increase the leverage "at the very top of the large-cap EE/MI leverage spectrum (implying ~3X ND /EBITDA), and back to a level which management apparently found too high."Notably, the main aim behind the sale of V&C was to reduce the leverage."There is a risk that PNR uses the proceeds from selling assets that may be close to a cyclical trough (V&C), to buy businesses that may be close to a cyclical peak (in Water, TS), and the company seems willing to return to a similar balance sheet leverage level (3X) as before the V&C sale took place," (9/26/2016)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Pentair PLC. (NYSE:PNR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 10 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.25)Consensus Price Target: $66.17 (2.16% upside)
