The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

(1) Offering expenses have been rounded to $10,000.

(2) Admin/Professional Fees may include, but are not limited to, postage,
    telephone services, overnight delivery services, legal fees, accounting 
    fees, costs to become a publicly reporting company and other general 
    operating expenses. Any line item amounts not expended completely shall be 
    held in reserve as working capital and subject to reallocation to other 
    line item expenditures as required for ongoing operations.

If 100% of the offered shares are sold we will receive the maximum proceeds of
$40,000, after offering expenses have been paid.  We intend to allocate $1,000
to the hosting and servers needed to develop our platform and website. We will
also budget $4,000 to hire a website/software developers for the development and
continued maintenance of our proposed marketplace platform through the first
twelve months. We intend to employ a full-time marking and sales representatives
at $22,000 and $3,000 for our office rental fees. For our marketing campaign, we
will budget $7,000 for marketing materials to properly launch our Company.
Further, we will use $1,000 of our net proceeds for working capital, including
administrative and professional fees.

If 75% of the offered shares are sold we will receive $27,500, after offering
expenses have been paid. We still intend to allocate $1,000 to the hosting and
servers, and $2,500 to hire a website/software developers for the development
and continued maintenance of our proposed marketplace platform through the first
twelve months. In this case we still intend to employ a part-time marketing and
sales representatives at $15,000 and $2,000 for our office rental fees. However,
we will cut our budget to $5,000 for marketing materials in order to launch our
Company.

If 50% of the offered shares are sold we will receive $15,000, after offering
expenses have been paid.  We still intend to allocate $1,000 to the hosting and
servers, and $1,000 to hire a website/software developers for the development
and continued maintenance of our proposed marketplace platform through the first
twelve months. In this case we only intend to employ one part-time marketing and
sales representative at $7,000 and $2,000 for our office rental fees. We will
also cut our marketing materials budget significantly to $2,000 in order to
launch our Company. Further, we will have only $1,000 allocated for working
capital, including administrative and professional fees.

If 20% of the offered shares are sold we will receive $0, after offering
expenses have been paid. We will not have sufficient funds to continue
operations.

If 0% of the offered shares are sold we will not receive any money to commence
operations. We may need the director to finance or secure additional funding. If
we do not sell any shares or gain additional funding we will be forced to delay
our business.

The funds from this Offering will not be used to pay Mr. Ram for his services to
the Company, whether provided prior to, during, or subsequent to the Offering.
There can be no assurance that the Company will raise any funds through this
Offering and if a limited amount of funds are raised, the Company will use such
funds according to their best judgment in accordance with the “Use of Proceeds”
chart. This discretion is not unlimited and any such change in the use of
proceeds as discussed above would be restricted to a proportionate reduction in
funds allocated to each specific item listed, and would not differ materially
from the “Use of Proceeds” chart above. To the extent our offering proceeds do
not cover any professional fees incurred by the Company, we anticipate paying
for any such expenses out of any additional funding or revenues we receive.

If we require additional funding, we will seek such funds from management,
friends, family, and business acquaintances in order to continue our operations.
Or we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit
facility. As with any form of financing, there are uncertainties concerning the
availability of such funds on terms acceptable to us, as we have not received
any firm commitments or indications of interest from our friends, family
members, or business acquaintances regarding potential investments in our
Company.


The market for selling over stock items online is a relatively new, yet growing 
industry. We expect to compete with these other service providers principally 
on the bases of the quality of services we intend to offer customers and in our
Company's ability to acquire and retain personnel to market and sell our 
proposed services. Our Company will also compete on the bases of service price. 
Our principal competitors include BIDZ.com, Overstock.com, Amazon and Bluefly 
(all of which offer services similar to our proposed services). Numerous other 
second tier resellers are entering into the marketplace, consisting of 
independent marketing consultants who are reselling and not operating their own 
web and mobile platform.

We anticipate that most, if not all, of our competitors will initially have 
greater name and brand recognition and access to greater amounts of capital and 
established relationships with a larger base of current and potential customers.
Because of their size and bargaining power, our competitors may be able to 
purchase equipment, supplies and services at lower prices than us in the 
initial stages of our development. As a result, our operations may be 
significantly and negatively impacted by our larger, more established 
competitors. Once we commence Phase 2 of our operations, if we are not able to 
generate enough revenue by attracting new and existing businesses and/or by 
enticing users to opt into our services, we may be forced to cease operations.

Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on the quality of our 
services, size of our database of opt-in end-users, customer service, as well 
as our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various 
competitive factors affecting the industry. These factors include the 
introduction of new services and technologies, changes in consumer preferences, 
demographic trends, economic conditions, and pricing strategies of competitors. 
As a result of competition, we may be required to:

. increase overall spending to ensure we are offering the best quality products 
  and services to our customers;

. continually assess and evaluate our service plans and other offers to ensure 
  that we are offering the most compelling and affordable products and services;
  and,

. increase our advertising, promotional spending, commissions and other 
  subscriber acquisition costs.

The industry has minimal and low cost barriers to entry and therefore it is a 
very competitive market. We will face many large and small competitors in the 
e-commerce retail business, including eBay, Amazon, Buy.com, Shop.com, and 
other similar websites.

Easy entry does not necessarily mean that a new entrant can build a web 
presence, traffic, and customer base. The Cosmo Ventures business model consists
of selling the overstock of other wholesale retailers from India in North 
America. Merchandise we intend to offer on our site will be competitively 
priced to benefit our potential customers. We believe an online business model 
is better positioned to succeed if it employs: brand/traffic, heaviest 
discounter reputation, low cost operations, and customer satisfaction.

We anticipate Overstock.com and Amazon (‘Competitors’) to be our biggest 
competition. Although we will be a smaller independent online retailer one of 
our goals will be to attract our Competitor’s clients to our business. These 
two highly branded companies are well established with a worldwide presence. 
Our effort to compete with them shows the need for such companies, and higher 
online consumer purchases. Our point of difference from our competition is our 
Indian manufactured merchandise, which we believe will be enough to turn over 
some loyal customers who seek a bargain over brand.

to commence operations as an online retailer offering discounted overstocked
inventory items. We will procure merchandise purchased from the surplus

intended to offer the public access to a variety of retailers and manufacturer
