E. Philip Wenger, Fulton Financial Corporation, And Evelyn F. Smalls, United Bancshares, Inc. (Photo: Business Wire)






Business Wire




Mar 22, 2017 4:39 PM EDT













 


















































  Fulton Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: FULT) today announced that it has made an investment in a new class of noncumulative, nonvoting perpetual preferred stock authorized and issued by United Bancshares, Inc. (United), following receipt of approval to make the investment from the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170322006283/en/   E. Philip Wenger, Fulton Financial Corporation, and Evelyn F. Smalls, United Bancshares, Inc. (Photo: Business Wire)   Fulton purchased 1,350 shares of the class, making an investment of $675,000 in United, which represents an investment equal to approximately 19.86% of United's total capital on a pro forma basis. Fulton is making this investment in United Bancshares, Inc., and, indirectly, in its subsidiary, United Bank of Philadelphia, because of United's deep involvement in the advancement of minority neighborhoods and minority owned businesses in Philadelphia.  "Fulton Financial is pleased to support United Bank's outreach efforts through our company's Fulton Forward™  initiative, which focuses on delivering programs and forming partnerships that help build vibrant communities through programs, products and services designed to foster affordable housing, drive economic development, and promote education and financial literacy," said E. Philip Wenger, chairman, president and CEO of Fulton Financial Corporation. "Our capital investment will enhance United Bank's ability to serve Philadelphia's communities and neighborhoods through its commercial banking business, which has a particular focus on, and sensitivity to, groups that have traditionally been underserved, including African-Americans, Hispanics and women."  "United Bancshares, Inc., the holding company of United Bank of Philadelphia, is delighted to receive this investment from Fulton Financial as it represents an exemplary collaborative relationship which will assist in driving economic development and inclusion in its urban markets by supporting United Bank's lending strategy to small businesses," said Evelyn F. Smalls, President and Chief Executive Officer of United Bank of Philadelphia. "As we celebrate 25 years as an "outstanding community reinvestment" bank in the region, we will continue to leverage our community banking expertise and experience through multi-sector partnerships like this one with Fulton to ensure that together we create economic stability by fostering job creation/retention and positive social change," said Smalls.
