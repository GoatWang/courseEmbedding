Mirae Asset Global Investments Hires New US CEO




Senior Portfolio Manager Takes the Helm






November 16, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mirae Asset Global Investments (USA) LLC ("Mirae Asset USA"), one of the 
      world's largest investment managers in emerging markets, today announced 
      that Peter Lee CFA, Ph.D. is stepping into the role of CEO and Chief 
      Investment Officer. Previously, Lee had been the Executive Managing 
      Director of the Global Investment Unit for Mirae Asset Global 
      Investments (“Mirae Asset”) in Seoul, South Korea, leading the equity 
      investment teams from the group's global headquarters.
    


      In his new role, Lee will be responsible for leading Mirae Asset USA 
      through its next stage of expansion in the US market. In addition, Lee 
      has set a number of ambitious objectives for Mirae Asset USA, focusing 
      on increasing flows into existing products as well as new product 
      development.
    

      “Mirae Asset has established itself as a true competitor in the US 
      market on the strength and heritage of our actively managed, emerging 
      markets focused investment capabilities,” says Lee. “Our objective is to 
      continue building on the global strength of the Mirae Asset brand by 
      introducing attractive products and solutions.”
    

      Mirae Asset USA is the US-based asset management entity that delivers 
      the investment capability of Mirae Asset, a diversified financial 
      services entity with over $100 billion in client assets under 
      management. Mirae Asset USA brings to US investors the client focus and 
      investment resources available to investors in other global markets for 
      over two decades.
    

      A veteran of Mirae Asset, Lee has held senior investment strategy and 
      executive management roles at several global entities within the group 
      since 2004. Lee has a Doctoral degree in Economics from the University 
      of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He also holds a Master of Arts degree 
      in economics and a Bachelor degree in economics from the Seoul National 
      University.
    

      Lee steps into the CEO role that had been vacated by the departure of 
      Peter Graham.

      Risk: There can be no guarantee that any strategy (risk management or 
      otherwise) will be successful. All investing involves risk, including 
      potential loss of principal.
    

      Emerging Markets Risk — The risks of foreign investments are typically 
      greater in less developed countries, which are sometimes referred to as 
      emerging markets. For example, political, legal, and economic structures 
      in these countries may be changing rapidly, which can cause instability 
      and greater risk of loss. These countries are also more likely to 
      experience higher levels of inflation, deflation or currency 
      devaluation, which could hurt their economies and securities markets. 
      For these and other reasons, investments in emerging markets are often 
      considered speculative. Similarly, investors are also subject to foreign 
      securities risks including, but not limited to, the fact that foreign 
      investments may be subject to different and in some circumstances less 
      stringent regulatory and disclosure standards than U.S. investments.
    

      Equity Risk - equity investments are more volatile and carry more risk 
      than other forms of investment including investments in high grade fixed 
      income securities.
    

      Geographic Concentration Risk - A small number of companies and 
      industries may represent a large portion of the market in a particular 
      country or region, and these companies and industries can be sensitive 
      to adverse social, political, economic or regulatory developments in 
      that country or region.
