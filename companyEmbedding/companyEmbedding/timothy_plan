Perseverance of the faith-based community pushes investment pioneer, Timothy Plan, over USD 1B

ORLANDO, Fla., July 21, 2017 : Timothy Partners, LTD, manager and adviser of Timothy Plan, announced on Thursday, July 20th that the family of funds has eclipsed USD 1 billion in assets under management (AUM).




This is a milestone moment for any packaged investment product, but for the family of mutual funds that started an entire movement, it is particularly special."I didn't allow myself to dream about reaching milestones like this when we launched in 1994. The purpose of Timothy Plan is to provide Christian and principled investors the opportunity to earn competitive returns, while aligning their investments with the Biblical principles in which they believe," said Arthur Ally, President of Timothy Partners, LTD and founder of Timothy Plan. The first of its kind, Timothy Plan was started in 1994 when Art Ally, then a financial advisor, was tasked with starting a retirement plan for non-denominational pastors. What he experienced, when undertaking that task, shocked the financial veteran."I couldn't find any funds or investment products that employed Biblical screens of the companies in which they invest. We had pastors preaching on Sundays about how we need to stand against the increasing number of abortions, or the infiltration of pornographic material into our society, but then were funding their retirement plans with the stocks of companies that were directly supporting these two industries. When I showed this to them, they were shocked."Timothy Plan screens all their investments to make certain that the companies in which they invest do not have ties to anything contrary to a traditional, conservative interpretation of Biblical principles. At the time of launch, there were no other funds or investment vehicles that comprehensively screened their investments for religious principles. Now, there are other faith funds, green funds and socially responsible funds. There are even "sin" funds that stand in direct contrast to the purpose of Timothy Plan. While other funds have been quicker to reach the $1 billion watermark, Timothy Plan has weathered the storm of the recession and was built upon its own success, without the backing of a mainline church denomination. "There may be other funds that screen, and I am glad that we started a movement to align investments with belief. But, none of that matters if a person's heart isn't right with God. What I can promise is that Timothy Plan will never compromise on its original mission, and I believe that is what God asks of us. Today is not about Timothy Plan, nor is any other day. Today is about realizing the amazing things that can happen when individuals are willing to change an aspect of their lives to further the Kingdom of God." - Arthur Ally, President & Founder, Timothy Partners, LTD, Timothy Plan

 Investing Strategies




 Climate Change








By William Donovan



    	Updated July 17, 2017 
		




Since 1994, the Timothy Plan has attempted to avoid investing in companies that are involved in practices they consider contrary to Judeo-Christian principles, performing what they call "Biblically Responsible Investing."The fund at its website lists defunding Planned Parenthood as a clear targeted outcome, linking the organization with more recent efforts in the Republican led US Congress.  They have previously found 77 companies "directly funding Planned Parenthood" through their "eValueator" tool making them a clear, modern day example of a fund with religious values performing a form of negative screening.









HistoryGoing back to 2008, the Timothy Plan family of funds promoted itself as “America’s first pro-life, pro-family, biblically-based mutual fund group.” It avoided investing in companies it saw as contributing to the country’s “moral decline,” meaning those involved in abortion, pornography, anti-family entertainment, non-married lifestyles, alcohol, tobacco, and gambling.The funds were founded in 1994 by Arthur Ally, a former Lehman Brothers vice president, who wanted to address an investment need for the retirement plans of pastors of independent churches. While there were funds available that screened for social or environmental issues, there weren’t any that screened according to the moral or culturally conservative principles of the pastors.“They would preach on the evils of abortion or pornography and Art didn’t have a choice but to put them in a retirement plan that invested in companies that were in direct opposition to what they believed,” says Steven Ally, marketing director for the Timothy Funds.



Arthur Ally started the first fund in 1994 and the Timothy Plan today includes 10 funds. The firm has created a “Hall of Shame” of companies (now called "Know Your Investing") that operate contrary to the firm’s investing principles and are excluded from investments. Steven Ally says that aside from the moral screens, the funds aim to preserve capital and the match or beat their respective benchmarks.









For all of society's ills listed in Timothy Plan's Know Your Investing analysis climate change and inequality does not feature.  This makes their approach divergent from that of Pope Francis' call to action on climate change, and so different strands of religious investing are now starting to emerge.Separate again would be Sharia Investing with its roots in shared value and shared ownership, shunning interest as a taboo practice.Religiously mandated funds, therefore, need to be understood not only for the branch of the religion you are trying to match up to but also as to the specific goals and issues that each fund attempts to avoid or solve for specifically.Timothy Plan's "Hall of Shame"Altria GroupAstraZeneca PlcAT&T IncAviChina Industry & Tech CoBJ's Restaurants IncBristol Myers Squibb CoCablevision Systems CorpCaesars Acquisition CoCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC)CBS CorpComcastDiageoDynasty Fine WinesElectronic ArtsGameloftGEJohnson & JohnsonMarriottPfizerPrivate Media GroupProcter & GambleSABMillerScores HoldingsSiemensTakara HoldingsThermo Fisher ScientificTianjin DevelopmentTime WarnerToyotaViacomThe full list can be found here including the criteria they use for screening purposes.

                    Note: All products and features are subject to state availability.

Charitable Gift Annuity

A Charitable Gift Annuity with the added benefit of  Timothy Plan's screened funds. For more information, you may contact:

WATERSTONE
This Charitable Gift Annuity enables your client to make a gift of cash, mutual funds, or securities to WaterStone, formerly known as Christian Community Foundation, and receive fixed payments for life. At their death, the remainder will be given to the charity or charities they have recommended. In most cases, income payments from Charitable Gift Annuities are higher than certificates of deposit, passbook savings, and stock dividends. They also receive an immediate income tax deduction for the gift portion of the annuity. Another important benefit is that a part of their income is a tax free partial return of the principal.

                  Their gift annuity can also help them provide for others while making a charitable gift. Your client may request a joint life annuity and provide lifetime income for a surviving spouse. Or, they may wish to establish the annuity for a parent or for the long-term financial needs of a child. 

                  The Timothy Plan Funds provides WaterStone an opportunity to invest these assets in alignment with the spirit of the gift. The Timothy Plan employs specific moral screening criteria designed to avoid investing shareholders’ money in any company that has a pattern of contributing to the cultural pollution of our society.
A Charitable Gift Annuity Program from WaterStone offers the following advantages:
                  
                  • WaterStone is the issuer of the Charitable Gift Annuity and assumes all liability for the payments.
                  
                  • Funds to cover all annuity payment liabilities will be invested in a special gift annuity account monitored by the WaterStone Investment Committee and in compliance with state regulations.
                  
                  • WaterStone provides the staff and resources to assure timely payments to the annuitants, annual audits to monitor proper reserve levels, and compliance with state and federal regulations.
                  
                  • The charitable residuum will flow to a Donor Advised Fund or to a Charity Advised Fund at WaterStone for the benefit of the mission of the charities recommended by the Donor(s).
                  
                  • Fees to WaterStone will not affect the annuity payments to the annuitants.
                  
                  • There may be a current charitable gift of 3% distributed directly to the charity recommended by the Donor(s), (see example) and upon the death of the annuitants, 100% of the residuum will be distributed to a Donor Advised Fund or to a Charity Advised Fund at WaterStone for recommended charities.

About us
In 1994, Timothy Plan was started to be a beacon for Godly stewardship in the financial community. The first of its kind, Timothy Plan is a family of mutual investments that screens funds to ensure that no money is invested in companies that are supportive of ideals that are contrary to our Biblical moral imperative. Pro-family, Pro-life, Pro-Community: Timothy Plan aligns your financial stewardship with the Godly principles you strive to exhibit everyday. 
Timothy Plan is more than just not investing in things. It’s about Kingdom Impact Investing—the impact money has by being placed with companies that don’t participate in activities contrary to scripture.
Impact Investing


What we offer

Ability to fully diversify your investments across thirteen funds and five asset classes.
The expertise of over forty individual money managers.
Anyone can invest, $0 minimums on all qualifying plans.
All funds are morally screened, helping you align your investments with your Christian values.

Our Story
What does it take to pioneer a new kind of investing? Faith in a God who directs our paths. In 1992, Arthur Ally, then president and owner of Covenant Financial Management, was challenged to design a retirement plan for pastors of independent churches and offer it on a national scale. Mr. Ally searched the entire investment industry for any professionally managed program that would complement the Christian world-view of evangelical pastors. 
The search unveiled several socially screened funds, which only screened for a few social issues such as alcohol and tobacco, but none that screened for more central issues such as abortion and pornography. The Lord used this challenge to burden Mr. Ally and cause him to rethink the current investment culture and ask the Lord if there was a better way—a way that would honor the Lord and allow others to invest with a clean conscience.

Proxy Voting


PREFACE



														Timothy Partners, Ltd. ("Advisor") is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended ("Advisers Act"). Pursuant to an advisory agreement between Advisor and The Timothy Plan (the "Trust"), Advisor manages the assets of the Timothy Plan Funds (the "Funds"). As the investment adviser to the Funds, Advisor is responsible for voting all proxies related to securities held in the Funds' investment portfolios. Because the Fund sub-advisors, under the close scrutiny of the Advisor, perform economic and management analyses of the companies in which the Funds are invested, Advisor looks to the Fund sub-advisors to vote proxies, and each sub-advisors' proxy policies and procedures are incorporated herein by specific reference.
														 Advisor, consistent with its fiduciary duties and pursuant to Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act, has designed this proxy voting policy (the "Policy") to reflect its commitment to vote all proxies, when called upon to vote by a sub-advisor who perceives a potential conflict or for any other reason, in a manner consistent with the best interests of the Funds' shareholders. Sub-advisors, and Advisor, consistent with their duty of care, will monitor corporate actions for those issuers whose securities are called upon to vote. Consistent with its duty of loyalty, Advisor will, in all cases, vote, or cause sub-advisors to vote, to promote the Funds' shareholders' best interests. In determining how to vote proxies, Advisor and sub-advisors shall initially review each Proxy subject to an analysis of the impact each issue may have pursuant to the moral considerations set forth in the Prospectus, and shall vote in a manner not inconsistent with those moral considerations. Further, Advisor and sub-advisors will not subordinate the economic interest of the Funds' shareholders to their own interests or to that of any other entity or interested party.

													


KEY PROXY VOTING ISSUES



														All votes shall initially be reviewed subject to an analysis of the impact each issue may have pursuant to the moral considerations set forth in the Prospectus. Subsequent to the moral analysis, all votes shall be on a company-by-company basis, and each issue shall be considered in the context of the company under review, and the various economic impacts such issues may have on the Funds' stated investment objectives. Advisor will give great weight to the views of management if and only if the issues involved will not have a negative impact on Funds' shareholder values. In all other cases, Advisor will engage in an independent analysis of the impact that the proposed action will have on shareholder values.

														
1. Board of Directors  Electing directors is one of the most important rights of stock ownership that company shareholders can exercise. Advisor believes that company directors should act in the long-term interests of the company's shareholders and the company as a whole. Generally, subsequent to the moral considerations addressed above, when called upon by a sub-advisor to vote, Advisor will vote in favor of director nominees that have expressed and/or demonstrated a commitment to the interest of the company's shareholders. Advisor will consider the following factors in deciding how to vote proxies relating to director elections:
														 In re-electing incumbent directors, the long-term performance of the company relative to its peers – Advisor will not vote to re-elect a board if the company has had consistent poor performance relative to its peers in the industry, unless the board has taken or is attempting to take steps to improve the company's performance. Whether the slate of director nominees promotes a majority of independent directors on the full board – Advisor believes that it is in the best interest of all company shareholders to have, as a majority, directors that are independent of management. A director nominee's attendance at less than 75% of required meetings – frequent non-attendance at board meetings will be grounds for voting against re-election. Existence of any prior SEC violations and/or other criminal offenses – Advisor will not vote in favor of a director nominee who, to Advisor's actual knowledge, is the subject of SEC or other criminal enforcement actions.
														 Advisor believes that it is in the shareholders' best interests to have bright and experienced directors serving on a company's board. To this end, Advisor believes that companies should be allowed to establish director compensation packages that attract and retain desirable directors. Advisor will consider whether proposals relating to director compensation are reasonable in relation to the company's performance and resources. Advisor will vote in favor of proposals that seek to impose reasonable limits on director compensation.
														 In all other issues that may arise relating to the board of directors, Advisor will vote against all proposals that benefit directors at the expense of shareholders, and in favor of all proposals that do not unreasonably abrogate the rights of shareholders. As previously stated, each issue will be analyzed on an issue-by-issue basis.
														
2. Corporate Governance 
 Corporate governance issues may include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) corporate defenses, (ii) corporate restructuring proposals, (iii) proposals affecting the capital structure of a company, (iv) proposals regarding executive compensation, or (v) proposals regarding the independent auditors of the company. When called upon by a sub-advisor to vote:
														

															i. Corporate Defenses. Although Advisor will review each proposal on a case-by-case basis, Advisor will generally vote against management proposals that (a) seek to insulate management from all threats of change in control, (b) provide the board with veto power against all takeover bids, (c) allow management or the board of the company to buy shares from particular shareholders at a premium at the expense of the majority of shareholders, or (d) allow management to increase or decrease the size of the board at its own discretion. Advisor will only vote in favor of those proposals that do not unreasonably discriminate against a majority of shareholders, or greatly alter the balance of power between shareholders, on one side, and management and the board, on the other.
															 ii. Corporate Restructuring. These may include mergers and acquisitions, spin-offs, asset sales, leveraged buy-outs and/or liquidations. In determining the vote on these types of proposals, Advisor will consider the following factors: (a) whether the proposed action represents the best means of enhancing shareholder values, (b) whether the company's long-term prospects will be positively affected by the proposal, (c) how the proposed action will impact corporate governance and/or shareholder rights, (d) how the proposed deal was negotiated, (e) whether all shareholders receive equal/fair treatment under the terms of the proposed action, and/or (f) whether shareholders could realize greater value through alternative means.
															 iii. Capital Structure. Proposals affecting the capital structure of a company may have significant impact on shareholder value, particularly when they involve the issuance of additional stock. As such, Advisor will vote in favor of proposals to increase the authorized or outstanding stock of the company only when management provides persuasive business justification for the increase, such as to fund acquisitions, recapitalization or debt restructuring. Advisor will vote against proposals that unreasonably dilute shareholder value or create classes of stock with unequal voting rights if, over time, such action may lead to a concentration of voting power in the hands of few insiders.
															 iv. Executive Compensation. Advisor believes executives should be compensated at a reasonable rate and that companies should be free to offer attractive compensation packages that encourage high performance in executives because, over time, it will increase shareholder values. Advisor also believes however, that executive compensation should, to some extent, be tied to the performance of the company. Therefore, Advisor will vote in favor of proposals that provide challenging performance objectives to company executives, and which serve to motivate executives to better performance. Advisor will vote against all proposals that offer unreasonable benefits to executives whose past performance has been less than satisfactory.
															 Advisor will vote against shareholder proposals that summarily restrict executive compensation without regard to the company's performance, and in favor of shareholder proposals that seek additional disclosures on executive compensation.
															 v. Independent Auditors. The engagement, retention and termination of a company's independent auditors must be approved by the company's audit committee, which typically includes only those independent directors who are not affiliated with or compensated by the company, except for directors' fees. In reliance on the audit committee's recommendation, Advisor generally will vote to ratify the employment or retention of a company's independent auditors unless Advisor is aware that the auditor is not independent or that the auditor has, in the past, rendered an opinion that was neither accurate nor indicative of the company's financial position.

3. Shareholder Rights 
 State law provides shareholders of a company with various rights, including, but not limited to, cumulative voting, appraisal rights, the ability to call special meetings, the ability to vote by written consent and the ability to amend the charter or bylaws of the company. When called upon by a sub-advisor to vote, Advisor will carefully analyze all proposals relating to shareholder rights and will vote against proposals that seek to eliminate existing shareholder rights or restrict the ability of shareholders to act in a reasonable manner to protect their interest in the company. In all cases, Advisor will vote in favor of proposals that best represent the long-term financial interest of Fund shareholders.
														
4. Social and Environmental Issues 
 When called upon by a sub-advisor to vote, in determining how to vote proxies in this category, Advisor will consider the following factors:
														 Whether the proposal creates a stated position that could affect the company's reputation and/or operations, or leave it vulnerable to boycotts and other negative consumer responses;
														 The percentage of assets of the company that will be devoted to implementing the proposal;
														 Whether the issue is more properly dealt with through other means, such as through governmental action;
														 Whether the company has already dealt with the issue in some other appropriate way; and
														 What other companies have done in response to the issue.
														 While Advisor generally supports shareholder proposals that seek to create good corporate citizenship, Advisor will vote against proposals that would tie up a large percentage of the assets of the company. Advisor believes that such proposals are inconsistent with its duty to seek long-term value for Fund shareholders. Advisor will also evaluate all proposals seeking to bring to an end certain corporate actions to determine whether the proposals adversely affect the ability of the company to remain profitable. Advisor will vote in favor of proposals that enhance or do not negatively impact long-term shareholder values.

VI.	PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS



Blackout Periods  Subject to any additional limiting requirements that may be set forth below, an Advisory Person may not effect a personal securities transaction in a "security held or to be acquired" by the Trust unless such person: executes such transaction at a price equal to or less advantageous than the price obtained for such security by the Trust; and reports to the Trust the information described in Paragraph VI of this Code of Ethics. Any profits realized on personal securities transactions in violation of this Section V shall be disgorged.
														
Initial Public Offerings 
 An Advisory Person may not acquire any security in an initial public offering, unless such Advisory Person (1) obtains advance written clearance of such transaction by two Clearing Officers and (2) reports to the Trust the information described in Paragraph VI of this Code of Ethics.
														
Private Placements
 An Advisory Person may not acquire any security in a private placement, unless such Advisory Person (1) obtains advance written clearance of such transaction by two Clearing Officers and (2) reports to the Trust the information described in Paragraph VI of this Code of Ethics. When considering whether to grant approval to the Advisory Person to engage in these transactions, the Clearing Officers shall consider, among other factors, whether the investment opportunity should be reserved for the Trust, and whether the opportunity is being offered to the Advisory Person by virtue of his or her position with the Trust. If the Clearing Officers find that the investment opportunity should be reserved to the Trust or that the opportunity is being offered to the Advisory Person by virtue of his or her position with the Trust, the Clearing Officers shall refuse permission for the Advisory Person to enter into the transaction. An Advisory Person who has been authorized to acquire securities in a private placement or an initial public offering shall be required to disclose that investment to the Trust and the appropriate Adviser whenever such Advisory Person participates, either directly or indirectly, in subsequent consideration of an investment in the issuer by any portfolio in the Trust complex. In the event that an Advisory Person has been given approval to acquire securities in a private placement or an initial public offering, any decision of the Trust to purchase securities of the issuer of such private placement or initial public offering shall be subject to prior review by the Trust's independent Trustees who have no personal interest in the issuer.
														
Ban On Short-Term Trading Profits 
 An Advisory Person may not profit from the purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of the same (or equivalent) securities within 60 calendar days, unless such transactions fully comply with the restrictions of Section V(A) of this Code of Ethics. Any profits realized on non-complying short-term trades shall be disgorged.
														
Gifts
 Advisory Persons may not accept any gift or other thing of more than de minimis value from any person or entity that does business with or on behalf of the Trust.
														
Service as a Trustee to Other Public Companies 
 Advisory Persons may not serve on the board of directors of any publicly traded company, without prior authorization of a majority of the Trust's Board of Trustees, which authorization shall be specifically based upon a determination that the board service would be consistent with the interests of the Trust and its shareholders. If and when such board service is authorized, the Advisory Person serving as a director will be isolated from other Advisory Persons who make investment decisions involving that company through "Chinese Wall" or other procedures.
													


VII. ADVANCED CLEARANCE REQUIREMENT



Procedures  FROM WHOM OBTAINED: Persons who desire to enter into personal securities transactions in transactions requiring prior approval under paragraph V above, must obtain the written approval of any two Clearing Officers prior to entering into such transactions.

														 Whether the amount or nature of the transaction, or person entering into the transaction, is likely to affect the price or market for the Security;
														 Whether the individual making the proposed purchase or sale is likely to benefit from purchases or sales in the same or similar security being made or being considered by the Trust; and
														 Whether the security proposed to be purchased or sold is one that would qualify for purchase or sale by the Trust.
													


VIII. EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS 



														Purchases, sales or other acquisitions or dispositions of Securities for an account over which the person has no direct influence or control and does not exercise indirect influence or control;
														 Purchases, sales or other acquisitions or dispositions of securities which are not eligible for purchase or sale by any portfolio of the Trust;

Exemptions from Reporting 
 A person need not make an Initial Holdings Report with respect to transactions effected for, and Covered Securities held in, any account over which the person has no direct or indirect influence or control. A Trustee of the Trust who is not an "interested person" of the Trust, as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Act, and who would otherwise be required to make a report solely by reason of being a Trustee of the Trust, need not make:
														 An Initial Holdings Report or an Annual Holdings Report; and A Quarterly Transaction Report, unless the Trustee knew, or in the ordinary course of fulfilling his or her official duties as a Trustee should have known, that during the fifteen (15) day period immediately before or after the Trustee's transaction in a Covered Security, the Trust purchased or sold the Covered Security, or the Trust or an Adviser considered purchasing or selling the Covered Security. An Access Person of the Trust's Underwriter need not make a report to the Underwriter, if such person makes a report to the Trust and:
														 The Underwriter is not an affiliated person of the Trust or any Adviser to the Trust; and
														 The Underwriter has no officer, Trustee or general partner who serves as an officer, Trustee or general partner of the Trust or an Adviser to the Trust.
														 An Access Person of an Adviser need not make a report to the Adviser, if such person makes a report to the Trust and all of the information contained in such report would duplicate information required to be recorded under §§ 275.204-2(a)(12) or 275.204(a)(13) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.
														 An Access Person need not make a Quarterly Transaction Report if the Report would duplicate information contained in broker trade confirmations or account statements received by the Trust with respect to the Access Person for the applicable quarterly reporting period, but only if such broker trade confirmations or account statements contain ALL of the information required to be reported in the Quarterly Transaction Reports.
