Oakland Airport Car Rental - The best companies


































































 




















California
Oakland Airport Car Rental – The best companies

by Michael Franco  |  Published July 3, 2016













There are ten car rental agencies located at Oakland International Airport’s (OAK) rental car center, and two additional agencies off-site. TravelMag.com evaluated each of them and selected those that are tops in three different categories.

Once you grab everything from baggage claim, exit your terminal and catch a shuttle to the rental car area. These shuttles run every 10 minutes, 24-hours a day, except between 1:30 a.m. and 4:30 a.m.; during this time, they operate in an on-call capacity. If you’re renting from the Payless Car Rental agency, they are located off-site, so be sure to call ahead from your terminal or the Rental Car Center to arrange an off-site transfer.
Comparison Engines: Find the best car rental deals
We have done a good deal of the homework for you regarding rental cars at Oakland International Airport. That being said, we suggest that you do your own comparison shopping to find the best deals. For that, we recommend two reliable, easy-to-use online booking services: BookingBuddy.com and CheapCarRental.net.
The results of our review
To determine which rental car companies offer you the best options across our three categories, TravelMag.com carefully evaluated the services, fleet availability, reviews and polices of the agencies at Oakland International Airport. Our findings are as follows.
 



Most affordable: Thrifty
Book at RentalCars.com




This car rental agency is always a frontrunner for affordability and selection. Specifically at OAK, Thrifty Car Rental saved us just over $10 compared to its closest competitor’s pricing for a comparable economy car. In addition to beating out any other option both on-site or off-site in Oakland, Thrifty’s Pay Now prices were between $15 and $20 less, on average, than their Pay Later numbers. If you are looking to cut costs on your trip to California, you cannot do better than Thrifty Car Rental.




Best for business travelers: Hertz
Book at RentalCars.com




Once again, we find ourselves recommending Hertz Car Rental for all of your business travel needs. You will be hard pressed to find more practical benefits for a business-level membership than what Hertz Gold Choice® offers you. Upgrade your vehicle before you arrive at the agency. Return your car when your business is done and proceed directly to your terminal without any pesky paperwork or long lines. Earn travel points with every dollar you spend on your vehicles and vehicle service options. If you travel around often for business, Hertz Rewards can certainly help to make your rental agency decision an easy one.




Best for luxury cars: Avis
Book at RentalCars.com




Overall, Avis had the largest selection of premium and luxury vehicles advertised online. Additionally, once we made our selection and researched availability over multiple trials, Avis’ on-site fleet proved to be the most abundant. While the majority of its competitors can only offer pictures of these and similar vehicles on their websites, Avis has Mercedes, BMW’s, Lincolns, and Cadillacs waiting at OAK’s Rental Car Center.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Our easy, breezy, casual tops offer limitless variety, style, and comfort.  From vibrant sun-drenched colors to flattering silhouettes and wash-and-go care, the Fresh Produce collection of ladies’ tops is the epitome of vacation wear and explicitly designed for fun in the sun. You’ll love the way you feel in our comfy, casual tops, and we hope you enjoy our wide range of colors and the versatility of the designs we offer. For example, one of our simple drape shirts can take you from dawn to dusk, from brunch with friends, to curling up with a book in the sun or shade to an evening sunset boating party.  You also have the option of layering with one of our  long sleeve tops to create a casual look that is all your own. Make sure you’re relaxing in comfort and style on your next vacation with casual tops from Fresh Produce.
