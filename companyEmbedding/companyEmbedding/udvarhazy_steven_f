The Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia is our companion facility to the Museum on the National Mall in Washington, DC. Opened in 2003, its two huge hangars — the Boeing Aviation Hangar and the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar — display thousands of aviation and space artifacts, including a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, a Concorde, and the Space Shuttle Discovery. The Center also offers the Airbus IMAX® Theater and the Donald D. Engen Observation Tower, which gives you a 360-degree bird's-eye view of Washington Dulles International Airport and the surrounding area. Udvar-Hazy Center is also home to the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar where preservation of the National Air and Space Museum's collections takes place. A glassed-in mezzanine provides a view of restoration projects in progress. Researchers will also find the majority of the Archives' collections at the Udvar-Hazy Center reading room.
There are many things to do while visiting the Udvar-Hazy Center. We offer daily tours and educational activities for both children and adults. We also have scheduled lectures and events throughout the year.

Things to Know Before You Go
We have compiled this list of tips to make your visit to the Museum easier and more enjoyable. Staff are also available to answer your questions at the John L. Plueger Family Welcome Center.
Add Time to Your Visit: Give yourself ample time to visit the Museum. Lines to enter the Museum parking lot tend to be longest during peak season (March - August), holidays, weekends, and on special event days. Please allow extra time for entry and parking.
 





Minimize Carry-Ons: All visitors must pass through security screening upon entry. The fewer carry-on items you bring inside the Museum, the faster your entry (and visitors behind you). Before you visit, please review the list of prohibited items, which include pocket knives and tripods. Visitors carrying prohibited items will not be allowed inside the Museum, so please leave them at home or in your car.
 







Stow Your Baggage: The Udvar-Hazy Center has lockers in two sizes. The smaller lockers accommodate small bags (such as backpacks) and coats; the larger lockers are 12" wide, 15" deep, and 29" tall, and accommodates most carry-on size bags. A 25 cent deposit is required and the quarter is returned after the key is replaced. If you have baggage that does not fit in the lockers provided, you will be asked to carry your bags with you.
 







Dress Comfortably: A visit to the Smithsonian usually involves a lot of walking. Wear comfortable shoes and layers of clothing.
 







Connect to our WIFI: Connecting to our WI-FI is easy. Just choose SI-VISITOR, open a web browser, and accept the terms of service.
 







Go Mobile: Learn more about the historic aircraft and space artifacts on display in the Museum with stories from our experts, first-hand accounts, and videos of these amazing objects in flight! Try out COPILOT on your mobile device by going to copilot.si.edu.
 







No Food and Drink: Food and drink are not permitted in the Museum. There is no dining area beside the Museum restaurant, so if you bring food, you must consume it outside. Only bottled water is permitted in the Museum.
 







Please Take Photos!: You are welcome to take photos for personal use (and share them on Flickr!). However, tripods, monopods, and selfie sticks are not permitted without prior approval. For professionals, please see our photography and filming policy.
 







Wheelchairs: A limited number of non-motorized wheelchairs are available on a first-come, first-served basis; please ask at the John L. Plueger Family Welcome Center. We do not provide strollers or motorized wheelchairs.
 







Strollers: Strollers are not allowed in the Donald D. Engen Observation Tower. You can leave your stroller in the stroller parking area outside the elevator on the ground floor.
 







Take Care on Ramps and Overlooks: The Udvar-Hazy Center has long ramps and high overlook walkways. Please use care and do not allow children to play on them. Never carry children on your shoulders.
 







Buy Tickets Early: IMAX tickets can sell out during busy months or when popular films are showing. We recommend you buy tickets in advance online. For evening films, parking is free after 4:00 pm.
 







Download and Print Maps & Guides: The Museum has a limited number of printed maps to provide visitors, so we recommend you print floor plans at home before coming to the Museum.
 







Ask for Help: Security officers are located throughout the building to protect the Museum, its collections, and most importantly, our visitors. Please feel free to ask them for assistance.
 







First Aid: First Aid is available. Please contact the nearest security officer or the John L. Plueger Family Welcome Center for assistance.

Early life[edit]
The Udvar-Házy family came to the US in 1958, fleeing the Soviet occupation of Hungary. Hazy attended University High School in Los Angeles,[5] and the University of California, Los Angeles.[6]
Career[edit]
Udvar-Házy was in his 20s during the later part of transition from propeller aircraft to jets during the mid to late 1960s, and realized that the higher capital investment required to purchase jet aircraft created an opportunity for a leasing business. He founded ILFC with Leslie Gonda and his son Louis Gonda in 1973, leasing a single used Douglas DC-8 to Aeroméxico. He left ILFC in February 2010 to found Air Lease Corporation.[6]
Philanthropy[edit]
Udvar-Házy gave a US$66 million grant to the Smithsonian Institution that allowed the U.S. National Air and Space Museum to build the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex at Washington Dulles International Airport.[7] The annex houses more than 120 aircraft and 140 space-exploration exhibits as of 2006, and also includes the Space Shuttle Discovery. Plans call for eventually installing over 300 aircraft.[8]
The Udvar-Házy family contributed funds to build the Christine and Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Library and Learning Center at Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University's Prescott Campus. The new library provides students with updated facilities and a great view of the surrounding campus. This donation is the largest to date made to the university.[9] The business building at Dixie State University is named after his parents.
Personal life[edit]
He is married with four children, and lives in Beverly Hills, California.[2]

The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, also called the Udvar-Hazy Center, is the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (NASM)'s annex at Washington Dulles International Airport in the Chantilly area of Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. It holds numerous exhibits, including the Space Shuttle Discovery and the Enola Gay.
The 760,000-square-foot (71,000 m2) facility was made possible by a $65 million gift in October 1999 to the Smithsonian Institution by Steven F. Udvar-Házy, an immigrant from Hungary and co-founder of the International Lease Finance Corporation, an aircraft leasing corporation.[2] The main NASM building, located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C, had always contained more artifacts than could be displayed, and most of the collection had been stored, unavailable to visitors, at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Silver Hill, Maryland. A substantial addition to the center encompassing restoration, conservation and collection-storage facilities was completed in 2010. Restoration facilities and museum archives were moved from the museum's Garber facility to the new sections of the Udvar-Hazy Center.[3]

Architecture and facilities[edit]

Designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, who also designed the National Air and Space Museum building, the Center required 15 years of preparation and was built by Hensel Phelps Construction Co.[4] The exhibition areas comprise two large hangars, the 293,707-square-foot (27,286.3 m2) Boeing Aviation Hangar and the 53,067-square-foot (4,930.1 m2) James S. McDonnell Space Hangar. The Donald D. Engen Observation Tower provides a view of landing operations at adjacent Washington Dulles International Airport. The museum also contains an IMAX theater.[1] A taxiway connects the museum to the airport.
Phase Two of the Udvar-Hazy Center will be dedicated to the behind-the-scenes care of the Smithsonian's collection of aircraft, spacecraft, related artifacts and archival materials. On December 2, 2008, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center received a gift of $6 million for phase two from Airbus Americas Inc. — the largest corporate gift to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008.
The wing includes:

The Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar — spacious enough to accommodate several aircraft at one time with a second-floor viewing area designed to give visitors a behind-the-scenes look.
Archives — the foremost collection of documentary records of the history, science and technology of aeronautics and space flight will be housed in a single location for the first time, providing researchers with ample space and equipment.
The Emil Buehler Conservation Laboratory — will provide conservators much-needed space to develop and execute specialized preservation strategies for artifacts.
Collections processing unit — a dedicated loading dock and specially designed secure area for initial inspection and analysis of artifacts.[5]

McDonnell Space Hangar on April 19, 2012, replacing the atmospheric test vehicle, Enterprise.[6] During the night of April 19, Enterprise was loaded onto a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft in preparation for its trip to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City on April 27, 2012, for final destination at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. Enterprise had been on display in the Space Hangar since the museum opened in 2003.

Media appearances[edit]
The center made its first media appearance in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The center remained open while filming took place, although certain areas were closed.[13] The SR-71 that is on display in the museum was used as Jetfire, a Decepticon who switches sides to become an Autobot, in the film. In the film, it is referred to simply as the National Air and Space Museum.

The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, also called the Udvar-Hazy Center, is the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (NASM)'s annex at Washington Dulles International Airport in the Chantilly area of Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. It holds numerous exhibits, including the Space Shuttle Discovery and the Enola Gay.
The 760,000-square-foot (71,000 m2) facility was made possible by a $65 million gift in October 1999 to the Smithsonian Institution by Steven F. Udvar-Házy, an immigrant from Hungary and co-founder of the International Lease Finance Corporation, an aircraft leasing corporation.[2] The main NASM building, located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C, had always contained more artifacts than could be displayed, and most of the collection had been stored, unavailable to visitors, at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Silver Hill, Maryland. A substantial addition to the center encompassing restoration, conservation and collection-storage facilities was completed in 2010. Restoration facilities and museum archives were moved from the museum's Garber facility to the new sections of the Udvar-Hazy Center.[3]

Architecture and facilities[edit]

Designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, who also designed the National Air and Space Museum building, the Center required 15 years of preparation and was built by Hensel Phelps Construction Co.[4] The exhibition areas comprise two large hangars, the 293,707-square-foot (27,286.3 m2) Boeing Aviation Hangar and the 53,067-square-foot (4,930.1 m2) James S. McDonnell Space Hangar. The Donald D. Engen Observation Tower provides a view of landing operations at adjacent Washington Dulles International Airport. The museum also contains an IMAX theater.[1] A taxiway connects the museum to the airport.
Phase Two of the Udvar-Hazy Center will be dedicated to the behind-the-scenes care of the Smithsonian's collection of aircraft, spacecraft, related artifacts and archival materials. On December 2, 2008, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center received a gift of $6 million for phase two from Airbus Americas Inc. — the largest corporate gift to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008.
The wing includes:

The Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar — spacious enough to accommodate several aircraft at one time with a second-floor viewing area designed to give visitors a behind-the-scenes look.
Archives — the foremost collection of documentary records of the history, science and technology of aeronautics and space flight will be housed in a single location for the first time, providing researchers with ample space and equipment.
The Emil Buehler Conservation Laboratory — will provide conservators much-needed space to develop and execute specialized preservation strategies for artifacts.
Collections processing unit — a dedicated loading dock and specially designed secure area for initial inspection and analysis of artifacts.[5]

The orbital spacecraft Space Shuttle Discovery was put on public display in the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar on April 19, 2012, replacing the atmospheric test vehicle, Enterprise.[6] During the night of April 19, Enterprise was loaded onto a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft in preparation for its trip to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City on April 27, 2012, for final destination at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. Enterprise had been on display in the Space Hangar since the museum opened in 2003.

Media appearances[edit]
The center made its first media appearance in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The center remained open while filming took place, although certain areas were closed.[13] The SR-71 that is on display in the museum was used as Jetfire, a Decepticon who switches sides to become an Autobot, in the film. In the film, it is referred to simply as the National Air and Space Museum.

The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, also called the Udvar-Hazy Center, is the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (NASM)'s annex at Washington Dulles International Airport in the Chantilly area of Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. It holds numerous exhibits, including the Space Shuttle Discovery and the Enola Gay.
The 760,000-square-foot (71,000 m2) facility was made possible by a $65 million gift in October 1999 to the Smithsonian Institution by Steven F. Udvar-Házy, an immigrant from Hungary and co-founder of the International Lease Finance Corporation, an aircraft leasing corporation.[2] The main NASM building, located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C, had always contained more artifacts than could be displayed, and most of the collection had been stored, unavailable to visitors, at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Silver Hill, Maryland. A substantial addition to the center encompassing restoration, conservation and collection-storage facilities was completed in 2010. Restoration facilities and museum archives were moved from the museum's Garber facility to the new sections of the Udvar-Hazy Center.[3]

Architecture and facilities[edit]

Designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, who also designed the National Air and Space Museum building, the Center required 15 years of preparation and was built by Hensel Phelps Construction Co.[4] The exhibition areas comprise two large hangars, the 293,707-square-foot (27,286.3 m2) Boeing Aviation Hangar and the 53,067-square-foot (4,930.1 m2) James S. McDonnell Space Hangar. The Donald D. Engen Observation Tower provides a view of landing operations at adjacent Washington Dulles International Airport. The museum also contains an IMAX theater.[1] A taxiway connects the museum to the airport.
Phase Two of the Udvar-Hazy Center will be dedicated to the behind-the-scenes care of the Smithsonian's collection of aircraft, spacecraft, related artifacts and archival materials. On December 2, 2008, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center received a gift of $6 million for phase two from Airbus Americas Inc. — the largest corporate gift to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008.
The wing includes:

The Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar — spacious enough to accommodate several aircraft at one time with a second-floor viewing area designed to give visitors a behind-the-scenes look.
Archives — the foremost collection of documentary records of the history, science and technology of aeronautics and space flight will be housed in a single location for the first time, providing researchers with ample space and equipment.
The Emil Buehler Conservation Laboratory — will provide conservators much-needed space to develop and execute specialized preservation strategies for artifacts.
Collections processing unit — a dedicated loading dock and specially designed secure area for initial inspection and analysis of artifacts.[5]

The center finished construction and opened on December 15, 2003. The Udvar-Hazy Center displays historic aviation and space artifacts, especially items too large for the National Air and Space Museum's building on the National Mall, including:[1]


The Enola Gay, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan
The orbital spacecraft Space Shuttle Discovery was put on public display in the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar on April 19, 2012, replacing the atmospheric test vehicle, Enterprise.[6] During the night of April 19, Enterprise was loaded onto a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft in preparation for its trip to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City on April 27, 2012, for final destination at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. Enterprise had been on display in the Space Hangar since the museum opened in 2003.

The museum is still in the process of installing exhibits, but 169 aircraft and 152 large space artifacts are already on display as of May 2012,[1] and plans call for the eventual installation of over 200 aircraft.[8] The current list is maintained at the Objects On Display page of the Smithsonian Institution NASM Collections site.
Events[edit]
A number of events are held at the museum throughout the year.[9] These include lectures, book signings, sleepovers, and events for children. Some of the museum's larger events include Air & Scare for Halloween,[10] an open house,[11] and Innovations in Flight: Family Day and Outdoor Aviation Display.[12]
Media appearances[edit]
The center made its first media appearance in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The center remained open while filming took place, although certain areas were closed.[13] The SR-71 that is on display in the museum was used as Jetfire, a Decepticon who switches sides to become an Autobot, in the film. In the film, it is referred to simply as the National Air and Space Museum.

Preserving Our Air and Space TreasuresNational Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy CenterChantilly, Virginia, USAPrevious1 of 4Next“Following an extremely successful opening, the new facility continues to thrive and, like its founding museum, promises to be one of the most visited museums in the world.”Harper Designs’ Great New Buildings of the WorldLocated near Dulles Airport, the center is an extension of the original National Air and Space Museum designed by HOK on the National Mall.Together, the two sites showcase the world’s largest collection of aviation and space artifacts.The design showcases the museum’s artifacts. It is configured like an airport terminal, with a “land side” and an “air side.” The land side is the realm of people, not artifacts, and can be open after hours. The air side begins with the exterior tarmac housing the large artifacts: the main hangar, the space hangar, the restoration hangar and artifact storage.The exhibition space is 10 stories high and is as long as three football fields. Planes are suspended from 21 arched steel trusses. Visitors can study suspended planes from two elevated observation areas.An active runway allows planes to fly in and taxi directly to the museum.To ensure conservation of these artifacts, the design followed careful environmental parameters related to temperature, humidity, light, air pollution, insects, pests, vibration and noise.SIZE708,000 sq. ft. / 65,800 sq. m.SERVICESArchitectureInterior DesignLandscape ArchitectureMechanical/Electrical/Plumbing   EngineeringAWARDSAIA Northern Virginia – Award of ExcellenceFairfax County Exceptional Design Awards Program – Honor AwardNAIOP Northern Virginia – Award of Excellence, Best BuildingRelated RelatedPeopleHOK CEO, President and D.C.

At a deeper level, I think the museum makes visitors feel proud to be human –

to be members of a species that has traveled from a lonely beach at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, to the dusty surface of the moon in less than seven decades..." - John H. Glenn, Jr

 The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center: National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C.
      
      

Catherine W. Allen


From:  
          Technology and CultureVolume 45, Number 2, April 2004

          pp. 358-362 | 10.1353/tech.2004.0055




In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:
   Technology and Culture 45.2 (2004) 358-362         [Access article in PDF]  The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center   National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C.   Catherine W. Allen    It's not every day that a museum opening makes the front pages of the country's best-known news publications. Such was the case, however, with the National Air and Space Museum's newest facility, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles International Airport, outside Washington, D.C. To characterize the Udvar-Hazy Center as imposing is to do it a disservice. It is immense, more than ten stories high, about three football fields long, and will ultimately enclose 260,000 square feet. Inspired by a dirigible hangar and evoking an actual airport, with its 164-foot-tall observation tower (named in honor of Donald Engen, former NASM director and a tireless advocate for this new museum), Udvar-Hazy inspires its visitors even before they walk through its doors. A two-thousand-space parking lot directly in front of the museum provides easy access. After the now-familiar security check we passed by visitor services and were immediately drawn to the entrance of the large gallery. You don't have to be an aviation or space enthusiast to appreciate the marvelous panorama of aircraft that seems to float all around you in the main display area. There were groups of seniors, moms and dads with strollers and children, a group of professional women, people of all nationalities speaking many different languages—all walking around doing their own thing and looking happy about it. There were visitors discussing the dynamics of engine power and airworthiness, while others excitedly exclaimed, "look at that yellow one!" This confirmed what I already knew, that enthusiasm for and interest in aviation and space runs the gamut of interests, knowledge, age, and experience. This is one of the reasons that the National Air and Space Museum on the Mall is the world's most-visited museum. The Udvar-Hazy Center soon will not be far behind. [End Page 358]      Click for larger view  Figure 1 Three of the largest planes at Udvar-Hazy: an Air France Concorde, with a Boeing 307 Stratoliner flown by Pan American Airways behind it, and the Boeing 367-80, the prototype for the 707, far right. (Photograph by Steve Abramowitz, Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission.)     The center was named for Steven Udvar-Hazy, founder and chief executive of the International Lease Finance Corporation, who contributed an unbelievable sixty-five million dollars to the center (whose total cost it is estimated will reach $311 million). The building was designed by the firm of Hellmuth, Obata, and Kassabaum, which also designed the flagship National Air and Space Museum building. Its arched trusses and network of walkways and bridges give visitors eye-level views of hanging aircraft at two levels as well as from the floor. Airplanes are hung as though in the middle of typical flight maneuvers, in contrast to the display positions at most aviation museums, and the effect is dynamic and exciting. The aircraft steal the show here. The Udvar-Hazy Center currently displays about eighty aircraft and over sixty-five spacecraft. As you walk around, you notice plenty of room for future additions. When all two hundred aircraft and more than 135 large space artifacts are installed, along with a huge array of smaller artifacts, visitors will likely have to make a day of it, if not two. Our legs gave out before our interest did. (Note that the floor is concrete and very hard on the feet, so wear sneakers. Wheelchairs are available.) The center is divided into ten distinct themes or timelines. Visitors can [End Page 359] go through the galleries by themselves or take one of the tours that docents lead twice daily. Directional signs are clear and concise, making it easy to locate planes of interest. Display areas are titled—Korean and Vietnam Wars, Pre-1920s Aviation, Business and Commercial Aviation, and the like—and large, easy-to-read labels accompanying...

The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, also called the Udvar-Hazy Center, is the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (NASM)'s annex at Washington Dulles International Airport in the Chantilly area of Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. It holds numerous exhibits, including the Space Shuttle Discovery and the Enola Gay.
The 760,000-square-foot (71,000 m2) facility was made possible by a $65 million gift in October 1999 to the Smithsonian Institution by Steven F. Udvar-Házy, an immigrant from Hungary and co-founder of the International Lease Finance Corporation, an aircraft leasing corporation.[2] The main NASM building, located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C, had always contained more artifacts than could be displayed, and most of the collection had been stored, unavailable to visitors, at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Silver Hill, Maryland. A substantial addition to the center encompassing restoration, conservation and collection-storage facilities was completed in 2010. Restoration facilities and museum archives were moved from the museum's Garber facility to the new sections of the Udvar-Hazy Center.[3]

Architecture and facilities[edit]




Entrance view with observation tower






The Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar in January 2013. The Space Shuttle Discovery is in the background.


Designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, who also designed the National Air and Space Museum building, the Center required 15 years of preparation and was built by Hensel Phelps Construction Co.[4] The exhibition areas comprise two large hangars, the 293,707-square-foot (27,286.3 m2) Boeing Aviation Hangar and the 53,067-square-foot (4,930.1 m2) James S. McDonnell Space Hangar. The Donald D. Engen Observation Tower provides a view of landing operations at adjacent Washington Dulles International Airport. The museum also contains an IMAX theater.[1] A taxiway connects the museum to the airport.
Phase Two of the Udvar-Hazy Center will be dedicated to the behind-the-scenes care of the Smithsonian's collection of aircraft, spacecraft, related artifacts and archival materials. On December 2, 2008, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center received a gift of $6 million for phase two from Airbus Americas Inc. — the largest corporate gift to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008.
The wing includes:

The Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar — spacious enough to accommodate several aircraft at one time with a second-floor viewing area designed to give visitors a behind-the-scenes look.
Archives — the foremost collection of documentary records of the history, science and technology of aeronautics and space flight will be housed in a single location for the first time, providing researchers with ample space and equipment.
The Emil Buehler Conservation Laboratory — will provide conservators much-needed space to develop and execute specialized preservation strategies for artifacts.
Collections processing unit — a dedicated loading dock and specially designed secure area for initial inspection and analysis of artifacts.[5]

The orbital spacecraft Space Shuttle Discovery was put on public display in the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar on April 19, 2012, replacing the atmospheric test vehicle, Enterprise.[6] During the night of April 19, Enterprise was loaded onto a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft in preparation for its trip to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City on April 27, 2012, for final destination at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. Enterprise had been on display in the Space Hangar since the museum opened in 2003.

The museum is still in the process of installing exhibits, but 169 aircraft and 152 large space artifacts are already on display as of May 2012,[1] and plans call for the eventual installation of over 200 aircraft.[8] The current list is maintained at the Objects On Display page of the Smithsonian Institution NASM Collections site.
Events[edit]
A number of events are held at the museum throughout the year.[9] These include lectures, book signings, sleepovers, and events for children. Some of the museum's larger events include Air & Scare for Halloween,[10] an open house,[11] and Innovations in Flight: Family Day and Outdoor Aviation Display.[12]
Media appearances[edit]
The center made its first media appearance in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The center remained open while filming took place, although certain areas were closed.[13] The SR-71 that is on display in the museum was used as Jetfire, a Decepticon who switches sides to become an Autobot, in the film. In the film, it is referred to simply as the National Air and Space Museum.

The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, also called the Udvar-Hazy Center, is the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (NASM)'s annex at Washington Dulles International Airport in the Chantilly area of Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. It holds numerous exhibits, including the Space Shuttle Discovery and the Enola Gay.
The 760,000-square-foot (71,000 m2) facility was made possible by a $65 million gift in October 1999 to the Smithsonian Institution by Steven F. Udvar-Házy, an immigrant from Hungary and co-founder of the International Lease Finance Corporation, an aircraft leasing corporation.[2] The main NASM building, located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C, had always contained more artifacts than could be displayed, and most of the collection had been stored, unavailable to visitors, at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Silver Hill, Maryland. A substantial addition to the center encompassing restoration, conservation and collection-storage facilities was completed in 2010. Restoration facilities and museum archives were moved from the museum's Garber facility to the new sections of the Udvar-Hazy Center.[3]

Architecture and facilities[edit]

Designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, who also designed the National Air and Space Museum building, the Center required 15 years of preparation and was built by Hensel Phelps Construction Co.[4] The exhibition areas comprise two large hangars, the 293,707-square-foot (27,286.3 m2) Boeing Aviation Hangar and the 53,067-square-foot (4,930.1 m2) James S. McDonnell Space Hangar. The Donald D. Engen Observation Tower provides a view of landing operations at adjacent Washington Dulles International Airport. The museum also contains an IMAX theater.[1] A taxiway connects the museum to the airport.
Phase Two of the Udvar-Hazy Center will be dedicated to the behind-the-scenes care of the Smithsonian's collection of aircraft, spacecraft, related artifacts and archival materials. On December 2, 2008, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center received a gift of $6 million for phase two from Airbus Americas Inc. — the largest corporate gift to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008.
The wing includes:

The Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar — spacious enough to accommodate several aircraft at one time with a second-floor viewing area designed to give visitors a behind-the-scenes look.
Archives — the foremost collection of documentary records of the history, science and technology of aeronautics and space flight will be housed in a single location for the first time, providing researchers with ample space and equipment.
The Emil Buehler Conservation Laboratory — will provide conservators much-needed space to develop and execute specialized preservation strategies for artifacts.
Collections processing unit — a dedicated loading dock and specially designed secure area for initial inspection and analysis of artifacts.[5]

The center finished construction and opened on December 15, 2003. The Udvar-Hazy Center displays historic aviation and space artifacts, especially items too large for the National Air and Space Museum's building on the National Mall, including:[1]


The Enola Gay, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan
The orbital spacecraft Space Shuttle Discovery was put on public display in the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar on April 19, 2012, replacing the atmospheric test vehicle, Enterprise.[6] During the night of April 19, Enterprise was loaded onto a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft in preparation for its trip to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City on April 27, 2012, for final destination at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. Enterprise had been on display in the Space Hangar since the museum opened in 2003.

The Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia is our companion facility to the Museum on the National Mall in Washington, DC. Opened in 2003, its two huge hangars — the Boeing Aviation Hangar and the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar — display thousands of aviation and space artifacts, including a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, a Concorde, and the Space Shuttle Discovery. The Center also offers the Airbus IMAX® Theater and the Donald D. Engen Observation Tower, which gives you a 360-degree bird's-eye view of Washington Dulles International Airport and the surrounding area. Udvar-Hazy Center is also home to the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar where preservation of the National Air and Space Museum's collections takes place. A glassed-in mezzanine provides a view of restoration projects in progress. Researchers will also find the majority of the Archives' collections at the Udvar-Hazy Center reading room.
There are many things to do while visiting the Udvar-Hazy Center. We offer daily tours and educational activities for both children and adults. We also have scheduled lectures and events throughout the year.

“Breathtaking”


Reviewed July 20, 2012




This museum is awesome. It costs $15 to park, but if you go after 4? pm it's free. It's a very large hanger full of planes, missiles, and the Discovery shuttle. It was worth the time. The observation deck closes before the muesum though, so check the times and don't miss it - I did so looks like I have to go back ;).

“Great Docent, Great Museum”


Reviewed July 19, 2012




We happened to stumble on a fantastic docent at the downtown D.C. A&S museum: Scott Marquiss. We followed Scott to Hazy the next day where he made the museum really come to life. I'd suggest trying to arrange or time your trip to get a good docent like Scott when you go. I believe he alternates downtown and Hazy every Sunday. I think the tours start at 1:00. But there might be other times as well.

“Ok if you are interested in aircrafts”


Reviewed July 18, 2012




The museum is free but you pay for parking. The place is really interesting if you like aircrafts and space. Our 2 daughters are late teens so they enjoyed it for a bit but then got tired and bored after an hour or a bit more. The watch tower is not worth it so don't spend time in line.

“Great Docent, Great Museum”


Reviewed July 19, 2012




We happened to stumble on a fantastic docent at the downtown D.C. A&S museum: Scott Marquiss. We followed Scott to Hazy the next day where he made the museum really come to life. I'd suggest trying to arrange or time your trip to get a good docent like Scott when you go. I believe he alternates downtown and Hazy every Sunday. I think the tours start at 1:00. But there might be other times as well.

“Ok if you are interested in aircrafts”


Reviewed July 18, 2012




The museum is free but you pay for parking. The place is really interesting if you like aircrafts and space. Our 2 daughters are late teens so they enjoyed it for a bit but then got tired and bored after an hour or a bit more. The watch tower is not worth it so don't spend time in line.

The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, also called the Udvar-Hazy Center, is the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (NASM)'s annex at Washington Dulles International Airport in the Chantilly area of Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. It holds numerous exhibits, including the Space Shuttle Discovery and the Enola Gay.
The 760,000-square-foot (71,000 m2) facility was made possible by a $65 million gift in October 1999 to the Smithsonian Institution by Steven F. Udvar-Házy, an immigrant from Hungary and co-founder of the International Lease Finance Corporation, an aircraft leasing corporation.[2] The main NASM building, located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C, had always contained more artifacts than could be displayed, and most of the collection had been stored, unavailable to visitors, at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Silver Hill, Maryland. A substantial addition to the center encompassing restoration, conservation and collection-storage facilities was completed in 2010. Restoration facilities and museum archives were moved from the museum's Garber facility to the new sections of the Udvar-Hazy Center.[3]

Architecture and facilities[edit]




Entrance view with observation tower






The Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar in January 2013. The Space Shuttle Discovery is in the background.


Designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, who also designed the National Air and Space Museum building, the Center required 15 years of preparation and was built by Hensel Phelps Construction Co.[4] The exhibition areas comprise two large hangars, the 293,707-square-foot (27,286.3 m2) Boeing Aviation Hangar and the 53,067-square-foot (4,930.1 m2) James S. McDonnell Space Hangar. The Donald D. Engen Observation Tower provides a view of landing operations at adjacent Washington Dulles International Airport. The museum also contains an IMAX theater.[1] A taxiway connects the museum to the airport.
Phase Two of the Udvar-Hazy Center will be dedicated to the behind-the-scenes care of the Smithsonian's collection of aircraft, spacecraft, related artifacts and archival materials. On December 2, 2008, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center received a gift of $6 million for phase two from Airbus Americas Inc. — the largest corporate gift to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008.
The wing includes:

The Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar — spacious enough to accommodate several aircraft at one time with a second-floor viewing area designed to give visitors a behind-the-scenes look.
Archives — the foremost collection of documentary records of the history, science and technology of aeronautics and space flight will be housed in a single location for the first time, providing researchers with ample space and equipment.
The Emil Buehler Conservation Laboratory — will provide conservators much-needed space to develop and execute specialized preservation strategies for artifacts.
Collections processing unit — a dedicated loading dock and specially designed secure area for initial inspection and analysis of artifacts.[5]

The center finished construction and opened on December 15, 2003. The Udvar-Hazy Center displays historic aviation and space artifacts, especially items too large for the National Air and Space Museum's building on the National Mall, including:[1]


The Enola Gay, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan
The orbital spacecraft Space Shuttle Discovery was put on public display in the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar on April 19, 2012, replacing the atmospheric test vehicle, Enterprise.[6] During the night of April 19, Enterprise was loaded onto a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft in preparation for its trip to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City on April 27, 2012, for final destination at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. Enterprise had been on display in the Space Hangar since the museum opened in 2003.

The museum is still in the process of installing exhibits, but 169 aircraft and 152 large space artifacts are already on display as of May 2012,[1] and plans call for the eventual installation of over 200 aircraft.[8] The current list is maintained at the Objects On Display page of the Smithsonian Institution NASM Collections site.
Events[edit]
A number of events are held at the museum throughout the year.[9] These include lectures, book signings, sleepovers, and events for children. Some of the museum's larger events include Air & Scare for Halloween,[10] an open house,[11] and Innovations in Flight: Family Day and Outdoor Aviation Display.[12]
Media appearances[edit]
The center made its first media appearance in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The center remained open while filming took place, although certain areas were closed.[13] The SR-71 that is on display in the museum was used as Jetfire, a Decepticon who switches sides to become an Autobot, in the film. In the film, it is referred to simply as the National Air and Space Museum.

1. How important is it for you to see a space shuttle? The Hazy Center has the shuttle Discovery.
2. Where are you staying and do you have a car? If you're staying downtown with no car, then I'd visit the one on the Mall.
3. How do you approach a museum visit? If you just like looking at the aircraft/spacecraft and reading a brief explanation about each, then the Hazy Center is better.
