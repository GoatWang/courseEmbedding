Philip Sutton Cox AO (born 1 October 1939) is an Australian architect. Cox is the founding partner of COX Architects, one of the largest architectural practices in Australia.
He commenced his first practice with Ian McKay in 1963, then, in 1967 he founded his own practice, Philip Cox and Associates.[1][2] The firm has grown to become COX Architects, which has 400 staff.[3] Involved in much of concept design for each project over fifty years, Cox stepped back from the business in 2015 that is now responsible for projects throughout Australia and also in South-East Asia, China, the Middle East, South Africa and Europe. He has been described as “epitomising the Sydney School of Architecture” in earlier projects.[4][5] His work has won him multiple awards, the first being in 1963, one year after graduating from the University of Sydney. His most recent award was in 1989.[1]

Early years and education[edit]
Philip Sutton Cox was born on 1 October 1939 to Ron and May Cox. He was their second child. He has one older sister, Judith. His childhood was comfortable, growing up in Killara on the North Shore in Sydney but he was born just one month after the start of the Second World War, which ended when he was six.
Cox attended Gordon Public School and then the Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore) in North Sydney. In his first years at Shore, art was taught by John Lipscombe, who had helped plan the new art block which had been praised by the architect Harry Seidler, who had lectured in the building in July 1952. Cox decided at quite an early age that he wanted to be an architect, though this was not clear until it was nearly time to leave school. He won a Commonwealth scholarship which was to pay his fees.[6]
Cox studied at the University of Sydney between 1957 and 1962, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture, then at the University of New South Wales between 1970 and 1975, where he was awarded a Doctorate of Science.[6]
Major architectural works[edit]
Cox was the architect responsible for initially implementing the American Radburn design for public housing in New South Wales.
Cox and his firm have designed many iconic public buildings in Australia and throughout South East Asia including a number of the buildings used for the Sydney Olympics. The following list provides a summary of some of the major architectural design works of Cox and his firm, ordered from earliest to most recent, where Cox has either worked individually or as part of consortia:

Philip Sutton Cox AO (born 1 October 1939) is an Australian architect. Cox is the founding partner of COX Architects, one of the largest architectural practices in Australia.
He commenced his first practice with Ian McKay in 1963, then, in 1967 he founded his own practice, Philip Cox and Associates.[1][2] The firm has grown to become COX Architects, which has 400 staff.[3] Involved in much of concept design for each project over fifty years, Cox stepped back from the business in 2015 that is now responsible for projects throughout Australia and also in South-East Asia, China, the Middle East, South Africa and Europe. He has been described as “epitomising the Sydney School of Architecture” in earlier projects.[4][5] His work has won him multiple awards, the first being in 1963, one year after graduating from the University of Sydney. His most recent award was in 1989.[1]

Early years and education[edit]
Philip Sutton Cox was born on 1 October 1939 to Ron and May Cox. He was their second child. He has one older sister, Judith. His childhood was comfortable, growing up in Killara on the North Shore in Sydney but he was born just one month after the start of the Second World War, which ended when he was six.
Cox attended Gordon Public School and then the Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore) in North Sydney. In his first years at Shore, art was taught by John Lipscombe, who had helped plan the new art block which had been praised by the architect Harry Seidler, who had lectured in the building in July 1952. Cox decided at quite an early age that he wanted to be an architect, though this was not clear until it was nearly time to leave school. He won a Commonwealth scholarship which was to pay his fees.[6]
Cox studied at the University of Sydney between 1957 and 1962, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture, then at the University of New South Wales between 1970 and 1975, where he was awarded a Doctorate of Science.[6]
Major architectural works[edit]
Cox was the architect responsible for initially implementing the American Radburn design for public housing in New South Wales.
Cox and his firm have designed many iconic public buildings in Australia and throughout South East Asia including a number of the buildings used for the Sydney Olympics. The following list provides a summary of some of the major architectural design works of Cox and his firm, ordered from earliest to most recent, where Cox has either worked individually or as part of consortia:

Philip Sutton Cox AO (born 1 October 1939) is an Australian architect. Cox is the founding partner of COX Architects, one of the largest architectural practices in Australia.
He commenced his first practice with Ian McKay in 1963, then, in 1967 he founded his own practice, Philip Cox and Associates.[1][2] The firm has grown to become COX Architects, which has 400 staff.[3] Involved in much of concept design for each project over fifty years, Cox stepped back from the business in 2015 that is now responsible for projects throughout Australia and also in South-East Asia, China, the Middle East, South Africa and Europe. He has been described as “epitomising the Sydney School of Architecture” in earlier projects.[4][5] His work has won him multiple awards, the first being in 1963, one year after graduating from the University of Sydney. His most recent award was in 1989.[1]

Early years and education[edit]
Philip Sutton Cox was born on 1 October 1939 to Ron and May Cox. He was their second child. He has one older sister, Judith. His childhood was comfortable, growing up in Killara on the North Shore in Sydney but he was born just one month after the start of the Second World War, which ended when he was six.
Cox attended Gordon Public School and then the Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore) in North Sydney. In his first years at Shore, art was taught by John Lipscombe, who had helped plan the new art block which had been praised by the architect Harry Seidler, who had lectured in the building in July 1952. Cox decided at quite an early age that he wanted to be an architect, though this was not clear until it was nearly time to leave school. He won a Commonwealth scholarship which was to pay his fees.[6]
Cox studied at the University of Sydney between 1957 and 1962, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture, then at the University of New South Wales between 1970 and 1975, where he was awarded a Doctorate of Science.[6]
Major architectural works[edit]
Cox was the architect responsible for initially implementing the American Radburn design for public housing in New South Wales.
Cox and his firm have designed many iconic public buildings in Australia and throughout South East Asia including a number of the buildings used for the Sydney Olympics. The following list provides a summary of some of the major architectural design works of Cox and his firm, ordered from earliest to most recent, where Cox has either worked individually or as part of consortia:

Dear Sir,I am writing to you, because I have a problem that's dated back to the month of October and it has not been rectified. I am a very patient person and rather write up a commendation thtan a complaint. To be honest, I have written or called in a feww commendations for your employees in the past.We have had problems with some of our channels scrambling/making a puzzle, namely channel 210, 211 and 208. We called that in and was told to come in and get a new box or a technician will come out. My husband although he was tired, went and picked up the new box. The problem did not resolve. As a matter of fact, we weren't receiving any signal fron those channels at all. A techician was sent out, who brought another box, yet the problem remained. I called and spoke to one of the technicians on 10/22/10. He said that he noticed some breking up on his end, so he'll pass it on to the day supervisor to call me. By this time I was getting very tired and frustrated with this issue. I did not receive any call from any supervisor. On 10/26/10, I called manager Michael, who appologised and said that he will send someone out. He also said that he would credit our account fron 10/21/10 to 10/25/10. A technician came out and fixed the problem on 10/26/10. that night I noticed that channel 39, the weather channel was freezing/puzzling. I called and left a message with Micahel, manager on?11/4/10 with no response. On 11/5/10, I called and was told that this problem has been going on way too long, so they would send a field supervisor to diagnose and fix the problem. On 11/7/10, the technician came out. He said since the other televisions without a box are being affected, the problem is not withyou guys, it's with the station itself. He said he would report it and they would deal directly with the station. On 11/9/10, Todd ?Brinklow, (540-374-8519), called and left a message, wondering if the issue was resolved. I called him right back and left a message. Today is 11/18/10, and I'm yet to have the issue resolved or have anyone call back, including Todd. Yet I'm paying for poor service all this time.I am not sure if they think I'm a hypochondriac or something. Perhaps they are tired of me calling. Guess what, I'm tired of calling too. It's time consuming, spending hours on the phone and now taking time to write to you. I had decided to just deal with it but, a few minutes ago, when I tried to watch chan39, which I often do, I thought NO WAY. I am paying for this and not receiving quality service. The technicians who have been here, have seen it themslves and know that wer'e not making tis up. I am sorry that I had to take it to this level. If you aren't the one to deal with this matter, please forward. We have been with Cox for 14 yrs, have never missed a payment or late at any time. At this point wer'e questioning, whether we should continue to be with you.Keith and launarene Morgan1044 Ficklen RdFredericksburg va 22405540-899-3112accnt. 3655Thank you!
