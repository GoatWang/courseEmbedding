Variable Annuities and Variable Life Products: Questions to Ask

                            June 9, 2004
                       


Variable annuities and variable life insurance products combine features of insurance and securities investments.  They can be an important part of your retirement and investment plans, but it is important to make sure they are right for you.  Recently the SEC issued a report on how these products are sold.  Based on the problems we’ve seen, here are some important questions we recommend that you ask before purchasing a variable product.  

Might I need this money in the next few years?  Variable products are long-term investment vehicles.  They aren’t appropriate if you’ll need your money in the short term because substantial taxes and insurance company charges may apply if you withdraw your money early.


Do I have enough money right now to purchase this product?  Because variable products are long-term investments, it can be dangerous to your financial health to mortgage your home in order to purchase a variable annuity or variable life insurance product.  If a salesperson pressures you to do so, call us instead at 1-800-SEC-0330.


Am I being urged to purchase a variable annuity or variable insurance in my IRA, 401(k), or other retirement account?  One key benefit to purchasing variable products is the fact that earnings on the invested money accumulate tax-deferred.  But these tax benefits are of no value if you’re purchasing the product in your IRA, 401(k), or other retirement account because those accounts are already tax-advantaged.  Make sure that the features you’re buying are worth the money you’re paying.


Does the firm recommend this product to all its customers?  Everyone has different investment objectives.  Variable products are not “one size fits all.”  Be careful if a salesman recommends one product to all customers.  That may mean the product isn’t right for you.


What will I lose if I exchange this product?  If a salesperson is urging you to exchange your variable product for a new contract, you’ll need to compare both products carefully, because:

	
the guaranteed death benefit of the new product may be less than the old,
you may have to pay a “surrender charge” to get out of the old product,
the new product may impose higher annual fees and a new surrender charge, and 
the new product may impose a new surrender charge period.

DESCRIPTION

Fig. 1 Functional Block Diagram
ASNT1011A-KMA is a low power and high-speed digital 16-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) / serializer IC. The IC shown in Fig. 1 functions seamlessly over data rates (fbit) ranging from DC to 17Gbps. The main function of the IC is to multiplex 16 parallel data channels running at a bit rate of fbit/16 into a high speed serial bit stream running at fbit. It provides a high-speed output data channel for point-to-point data transmission over a controlled impedance media of 50Ω. The transmission media can be a printed circuit board or copper coaxial cables. The functional distance of the data transfer is dependent upon the attenuation characteristics of the transportation media and the degree of noise coupling to the signaling environment.
 
During normal operation, the serializer’s low-speed input buffer (LS DIBx16) accepts external 16-bit wide parallel data words (“d00”-“d15”) through 16 differential LVDS inputs and delivers them to the multiplexer’s core (MUX16:1) for serialization. A full rate clock must be provided by an external source (“ce”) to the high-speed clock input buffer (HS CIB) where it is routed to the high speed clock output buffer (HS COB) and the internal divider-by-16 (/16). The divider provides signaling for MUX16:1 and produces a full rate clock divided-by-16 “C16” for the low speed LVDS compliant clock output buffer (LVDS COB).The phase of “clo” can be modified by 90° increments by utilizing pins “phs1” and “phs2” and the clock processing block. By utilizing pin “bitorder”, the serializer can designate either “d00” or “d15” as the MSB thus simplifying the interface between ASNT1011A and a proceeding ASIC.
 
The serialized words are transmitted as 2-level signals “qcml” by a differential CML output buffer (Data OB). A full-rate clock is transmitted by HS COB in parallel with the high-speed data. The clock and data outputs are well phase matched to each other resulting in very little relative skew over the operating temperature range of the device. Both output stages are back terminated with on-chip 50Ω resistors. The serializer uses a single +3.3V power supply and is characterized for operation from −25°C to 125°C of junction temperature.

Vertical Bed Mill
KMA-1

Heavy duty vertical bed mill equipped with geared head spindle and massive hardened and ground bed ways for heavy milling  








The vertical column is made out of box shape high tensile strength casting reinforced with honeycombed ribbings. It offers excellent vibration dampening features and great mechanical and thermal stability.

 

The saddle and vertical head travels on hardened and ground box ways that offer maximum rigidity. All top, front, rear reference surfaces and T slots are precision ground to exact tolerance.

 

The vertical head is equipped with a #50 fixed quill spindle for heavy duty milling.



Besides a manual coarse and fine feed on the vertical head, it is also equipped with power feed for easy positioning. A tri-lever handle mounted in the front for easy operation performs manual rapid movement of the head.



A separate pendant control performs all the spindle operations, coolant and power drawbar operations .



The unique sliding saddle base design allows easy movement of the entire 23” of the cross travel, manually or by power.



The table is equipped with a double nut backlash eliminator, which adjusts the backlash on the table travel when the screw and nut start to wear out.

 

The automatic lubrication system lubes the table and saddle ways.

 

The extensive vertical head travel along with various feed rates offer capability for precise boring operations.

 

A horizontal milling head (5 HP, #50 taper) is installed on the side of the vertical column on Model KMA-3H. It travels on precision ball screw with AC servo drive.
