Early life[edit]
Michael Smith was born in 1964. He studied at the Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles and at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
Career[edit]
He started his career by working with the antiques dealer Gep Durenberger and with the New York designer John Saladino. He has been running his own interior design business since 1990.[2]
In an interview with The Washington Post, he describes his style as "updated traditional"; in fact, his work blends vintage and contemporary looks with elements such as "Georgian antiques, Uzbek suzani textiles, 18th-century Chinese wallpaper, sun-bleached Moroccan carpets and a dash of Anthropologie and Pottery Barn".[3]
He has created his own furniture and fabric collection, Jasper,[4] and has licensed collections of tiles and stone for Ann Sacks,[5] vintage and contemporary bathroom fixtures for Kallista,[6] vintage lighting fixtures for Visual Comfort,[7] floorcoverings for Patterson, Flynn & Martin,[8] rugs, carpets and tapestries for Mansour Modern,[9] and home fragrance products for Agraria.[3]
Architectural Digest included Smith among its "AD 100", its "selection of the top architects and interior designers" published in the magazine in recent years.[10] Its editorial "profile" of Smith characterizes his style as "a blend of classic European style and American modernism".[11] Smith was also named 2003 Designer of the Year by Elle Decor.[12]
Smith's clients reportedly include News Corporation president Peter Chernin, Oaktree Capital chairman Howard Marks, writer Gigi Levangie Grazer, model Cindy Crawford (for whom Smith has designed two California houses and two New York apartments),[13][14] film director Steven Spielberg, and actors Dustin Hoffman and Michelle Pfeiffer.[15]
His work is regularly featured in Architectural Digest, Elle Decor, Town & Country, W, and House Beautiful.[12]
White House makeover[edit]
In 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama appointed Smith to redecorate the residential quarters of the White House.[15] During this project, Smith worked with Michelle Obama and White House curator William Allman to select art on-loan from museums to be displayed in private quarters and elsewhere.[3]
In February 2010, President Obama appointed him a member of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House.[16] Smith's makeover of the Oval Office was revealed to the public in late August 2010.[17] Dominated by shades of taupe and beige, the designer redecorated the bookcases with Native American baskets and ceramics from the National Museum of the American Indian[3] and installed "a rug woven with quotations from Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy and others; two fawn-colored cotton-rayon sofas; two elegant midnight-blue lamps by Christopher Spitzmiller; and an extremely contemporary mica coffee table from Roman Thomas, a New York furnituremaker".[13]

In 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama appointed Smith to redecorate the residential quarters of the White House.[15] During this project, Smith worked with Michelle Obama and White House curator William Allman to select art on-loan from museums to be displayed in private quarters and elsewhere.[3]
In February 2010, President Obama appointed him a member of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House.[16] Smith's makeover of the Oval Office was revealed to the public in late August 2010.[17] Dominated by shades of taupe and beige, the designer redecorated the bookcases with Native American baskets and ceramics from the National Museum of the American Indian[3] and installed "a rug woven with quotations from Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy and others; two fawn-colored cotton-rayon sofas; two elegant midnight-blue lamps by Christopher Spitzmiller; and an extremely contemporary mica coffee table from Roman Thomas, a New York furnituremaker".[13]

Michael S. Smith’s Top Product Picks


 July 6, 2010
If nothing else, Obama White House Decorator Michael S. Smith is discreet. When asked about his experience designing for the first family, all he offered was, “It’s been an honor and it’s still ongoing. They’re an amazing family.” Smith’s discretion, no doubt, has served him well, as his is a high-profile clientele that extends across the world. His skill and talent, of course, are undeniable and have earned him a bevy of accolades, including a place in the 2002 and 2004 editions of Architectural Digest’s The AD 100 and recognition as Elle Décor’s 2003 Designer of the Year. 
Smith’s accomplishments, however, are not just limited to his work in interior spaces. His signature furniture and fabric line, Jasper, as well as his product collections for a variety of manufacturers, such as Kohler’s Kallista and Ann Sacks, have also enjoyed much success, which he attributes to their inspiration. “I always think about what I need in terms of my own projects,” he said. “As a result, I find places within the market where products just don’t exist.” 
Not surprisingly, many of Smith’s product designs, if not all, end up in his firm’s work. He noted, “We’re the biggest customers on the residential level of all of our own Kallista products,” of which there are four collections, including Town. All boast classic appeal and are “very jewel-like and beautifully made,” Smith said.

In his kitchen designs, while custom cabinetry tends to dominate, Smith has on occasion specified Arclinea’s Italia, which he “loves.” Of particular interest is its hardware. He added, “I’m really into its handle,” a no-nonsense, sleek rectilinear design that is integrated into the cabinet door.

When it comes to kitchen faucets, Smith is not a fan of pullouts, but Kohler’s new Purist offers up an attractive take on a popular must-have. He noted, “As someone who often has to spec pullouts, which are really impossible, I have to say it’s really pretty.”
For appliances, Smith frequently turns to BlueStar ranges, which he loves for their great cooking performance and good looks. He also admits a fondness for Wolf and its distinctive red knobs, as well as Sub-Zero’s Pro 48 glass-door refrigerator, which combines high-tech food preservation with compelling style. Smith said, “I love that.”
The same has probably been said of Smith’s work for the first family. This past February, the much-in-demand designer was named by President Obama to the Committee for the Preservation of the White House.

Following her early days as a church pianist in hometown Colorado Springs, Nicole gained recognition at a GMA sponsored music contest, captivating audiences with her original music and lyrical gifts.

Featured Music- Hills and Valleys- Tauren Wells More
Michigan native Tauren Wells started his music career at Indiana Bible College, forming the group Royal Tailor with a trio of classmate friends.

            I just got this CD last week and it is awesome, so uplifting.  I have the Christmas one also but have not listened to it yet, and the new Hallelujah one is just incredible!!! God has really blessed Michael Smith with the ability and voice gift to do this and us with being able to purchase it and have it fill us with God's love, promises, joy and peace that flows from the words and heartfelt songs!!!

            this is truly a upbeat album...I had not heard a lot of these songs so it was like new releases to me. I have several meaningful songs that keep me in revered state that deeply convicts and witnesses with the Holy Spirit. Each song MWS sings is a gift from heaven !

            What can one say? First it is Smitty. Then he is doing his old hits that really take you back, far enough to feel like you just found another treasure before you realize, Oh geez, it's Smitty! Never boring or wasting time with lyrics and music. Always an adventure with such inspiration to guide you.

Product Description▼▲
Smitty calls it "the most satisfying recording session I've ever experienced." You'll call it this year's must-have holiday album! Backed by a 67-piece orchestra at London's famed Abbey Road Studios, Michael merges spine-tingling arrangements with pop sensibilities to make a Christmas classic-to-be. Includes "Christmas Angels," "Emmanuel Hymn," "Highland Christmas," "Song of the King," "The Promise," "What Child Is This?" and more.

            Absolutely magnificent! I ordered this cd because of the artist, the price and because I was tired of the same old stuff out there called "Christmas music". Every time I listen to it the anointing of the Lord falls on me. I loved it so much I bought 12 more as gifts for my friends and they love it as much as I do. Buy it, buy it, buy it....what a great cd!!

            The combination of the orchestra and Michael does make this CD a very memorable and moving Christmas CD.

            Had the first 2 CD's for years and wanted the third one. Not disappointed! Although, never thought I would be. Michael and his music are such a blessing. Absolutely my favorite Christmas music.
