Dynegy set to close coal-fired Brayton Point power plant June 1



Houston (Platts)--22 May 2017 455 pm EDT/2055 GMT




Dynegy said Monday it will close as of June 1 its 1,488-MW coal-fired Brayton Point power plant in Somerset, Massachusetts.The Houston-based company said the decision to shut Brayton Point was made in 2013, before Dynegy owned the facility.In a statement, the company said it is "working with the town, our union partners and the community to ensure the smoothest transition possible."The facility, which was built and became operational in the 1960s, serves the southeast New England zone in the ISO New England market, and represents a large share of Dynegy's 6,543-MW ISO-New England and New York ISO portfolio.Article continues below...Request a free trial of: Coal TraderPlatts Coal Trader provides the latest prices for key benchmark coals, as well as:Daily pricing for tons and allowances for SO2 and NOx emissionsThe exclusive Platts OTC Broker Index, a market assessment compiled from three of the largest and most respected coal brokersWhat happened in yesterday's OTC markets, and whyAn analysis of coal price trends in all major U.S. producing areasDetails of how major coal companies are trading in the financial marketsCoverage of mine openings, closings, productionReports on who's in the market for coalRequest a free trialMore InformationDynegy, which has become the focus of possible takeover discussions, owns a total of 31,410 MW across the country.Dynegy took possession of the four-unit facility via a $3.3 billion acquisition of 10 power plants with combined capacity of 6,300 MW of capacity from Equipower, a unit of Energy Capital Partners, in April 2015.ECP bought the Brayton Point facility from Dominion in March 2013. In September 2013, ECP said the Brayton plant would be shut in May 2017, citing low electricity prices as well as high costs to meet environmental standards and maintain aging facilities.Meanwhile, in 2014, Dominion sold the Salem Harbor coal-fired power plant to project developer Footprint Power, which is building a 674-MW gas-fired facility on the site.Footprint said on its website that the new Salem Harbor facility, located northeast of Boston, is scheduled to begin operation in June.As of January, ISO-NE had 30,500 MW of generating capacity, with 40% being natural gas-fired, 31% nuclear, 9.7% renewables and 7.1% hydro.Coal-fired generation represented 2.4% of total generation, the ISO said.According to ISO-NE, since 2013 "more than 4,200 MW of primarily coal, oil and nuclear generating capacity have retired or announced retirement by mid-2020."--Jeffrey Ryser, jeffrey.ryser@spglobal.com--Edited by Jason Lindquist, jason.lindquist@spglobal.com

Brayton Point retirement may be delayed 








01/21/2014

















































Brayton Point Energy LLC, a private equity firm and owner of the Brayton Point coal-fired power plant will have to decide by the end of January if the plant’s retirement, originally scheduled for 2017, will be delayed. On Monday, the power plant owners agreed, in a filing sent to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to notify ISO of its decision by Jan. 29.
ISO New England, the region’s power grid operator designated the plant as a “must run” facility. The operator believes the plant is needed to avoid potential interruptions in power and meet future demand. However, Brayton Point is not required to operate; ISO wants the owners to make a decision so the operator can plan accordingly. ISO is also planning for the retirements of Vermont Yankee nuclear plant and Salem Harbor Power Station, among others.
Bryaton Point is the town’s largest taxpayer, paying out about $7 million this year, according to the Boston Globe.
Increased emission control regulations and the declining price of natural gas has made running a coal-fired facility challenging and costly.
In 2013 Dominion sold three power plants, including Brayton Point, for $472 million. The retirements of those plants were announced within a few months of the purchase.[Native Advertisement]

The Perils and Promise of Youth

                    One of the perks of writing the Nuclear Reactions column for Power Engineering is that I get to write about a wide variety of nuclear-related topics. I also get the opportunity on occasion to point out linkages (or differences) between seemingly unconnected topics. This column squarely fits into this latter category.
