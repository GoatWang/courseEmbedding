We focus on assisting clients with intellectual property protection, including registration of patents and trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and registration of copyrights with the U.S. Copyright Office.

Michael J. Brown



My experience
 
I am a registered patent attorney and have filed or directed the filings of at least 2000 patent and trademark applications in the U.S. and countries around the world. In addition to protection and registration of U.S.-based intellectual property rights, working with a network of firms around the world, I am able to assist clients with registration and protection of trademarks, patents and copyrights on a global or regional basis.
 
I have handled a variety of intellectual property disputes in patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names and rights of privacy and publicity, ranging from initial investigation of infringement through litigation and resolution.
 
In business transactions, I have advised on confidentiality agreements, asset due diligence, purchase agreement negotiation, privacy issues, material transfer agreements, licensing agreements, university licensing agreements, software development agreements, joint venture agreements, and transition services agreements, including such issues in the context of a bankruptcy or restructuring.
 
In my career, I have been associated with firms of different sizes, ranging from small intellectual property boutique firms to large multi-national general practice firms. I also served as outside intellectual property counsel for a multi-national manufacturer of oil and gas refining equipment. With this background, I can offer the benefit of my extensive experience in an environment where I can provide personal attention to my clients' concerns.



What kind of businesses do I represent?
 
I currently advise businesses in the following industries: apparel, cosmetics, toys, dental products, financial services, environmental remediation, content publishing, food processing, shipping, luxury goods, personal care services, software development, technology service providers, industrial manufacturing and others. I have also advised businesses in petroleum processing, computer retail, real estate services, transportation and logistics, consumer brands, and book publishing.
 
I work with individual inventors and founders of start up businesses, advising on cost-effective ways to protect inventions and new business ideas.

Intellectual Property Asset Protection and Transactions
 
Our practice assists clients with the protection of intellectual property through registrations, litigation and other adversarial proceedings, transactions and licensing.  We regularly advise and assist clients with intellectual property protection issues in the U.S. and overseas.
 
In the U.S., patents and trademarks can be registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and copyrights are registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.
 
U.S. Federal courts evaluate and rule on disputes in trademark, trade dress, patent and copyright matters, and domain name disputes are handled through arbitration proceedings under the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy of Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
 
Business transactions such as mergers, acquisitions and financing involving intellectual property assets require consideration of the impact of the transaction on the ownership and use of the intellectual property assets, as well as the impact of the intellectual property assets on the underlying transaction. Trade secret and confidential information can be protected through non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements and also through setting up best practices.

What is intellectual property?
 
Intellectual property, as the name suggests, covers creations of the mind.
These creations can be generally broken down into the following categories:
 
• PATENTS protect inventions such as machines, processes, compositions of matter and certain designs;
• TRADEMARKS are brand identities such as product or service names, logos or packaging;
• COPYRIGHTS are artistic creations, such as artwork, writings, film or music;
• TRADE SECRETS are non-public business information, such as secret business formulas, processes and methods


The importance of intellectual property
 
Most successful businesses in a wide variety of industries share a common trait: they pay attention to their intellectual property assets, including inventions, brands and creative works.  The intellectual property assets of successful businesses are what the businesses are known for.  Consumer product companies are known for their brand names.  Technology companies are known for their innovative and distinctive products.  Artists and entertainment companies are known for their creative works.  Each of these types of intellectual property, otherwise known as patents, trademarks and copyrights, have their own characteristics and means of protection.
 
Attention to intellectual property is important. Failure to protect your intellectual property assets or to make sure that you are not violating the intellectual property assets of another can result in:



• Loss of trademark rights
• Missed business opportunities
• Pre-emption in the market
• Infringement litigation


• Misappropriation of trade secrets
• Unfair competition
• No attribution for your work
• Unnecessary expenses


These are examples of the risks, but a proper evaluation of your specific needs can determine whether any of these apply to your situation.




Patents
 
Patents protect inventions, such as new products, processes, designs or compositions. While any idea may be an invention, in order for an invention to be patentable, the invention must be new and not obvious in light of existing technology.
 
A patent may be simply described as a government sponsored monopoly, granting the right to exclude others from making, using or selling an invention. One common misconception about patents is that owning a patent does not give the patent owner the right to do anything with its invention. As an exclusionary right, a patent is more of an offensive tool than a defensive one.
 
Patents are national in protection, and a patent in the U.S. will not by itself provide any enforceable rights outside of the U.S.  For protection outside of the U.S., additional patent applications may be necessary.
 







Trademarks
 
Trademarks are the names and logos used to identify the products and/or services of a business. A trademark serves the business by distinguishing the products and/or services of the business from its competitors. In the U.S., trademark rights are acquired through use of the trademark, however, registration is recommended, through Federal or state registers. Outside of the U.S., trademark rights are generally based upon registration.
 
Trademark rights are generally national in scope, however there are regional trademark registrations, such as the European Community Trademark and international trademark treaties that simplify registration in many countries, and provide more cost effective solutions than separate national trademark filings.
 







Copyrights
 
Creative works, including writings, artwork and music are automatically protected by copyright. Copyright provides the owner of the creative work with the exclusive right to control copying and creating new works based on the creative work, otherwise known as derivative works. Registration is not required for copyright to exist, but for U.S. copyright owners, a copyright registration with the U.S. Copyright Office is a prerequisite for filing a law suit for infringement of copyright.
 






Trade Secrets
 
Certain information about a business may provide the business with an advantage over competitors, provided that the information is not known to the competitors. New technology often is kept confidential during development before patenting or even instead of patenting. It is important that the business keep such technology and similar information confidential to maintain the competitive advantage, usually through non-disclosure, confidentiality and employment agreements.

Brown, Michael J

by Artist Directory


on January 3, 2014











Artist Statement
Motion Graphics: Kinetic images that change with the movement of the viewer. I use a lenticular printmaking technique combined with up to 300 of my photographs to create optical art that animates. The kinetic nature of my optical art does not show up in my jury images. Below is a link to a movie of my art taken at outdoor art shows including two clips of some experimental pieces. My newest pieces use up to 300 frames and animate like a movie as the viewer walks by. I do all the photography and produce these hand made lenticular graphics in my home-based studio. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd2HUCPelVU

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Almost 10 Years and Still Looking Fantastic - Ashburn, VA

Dr. Brown is very personable. He put me at ease right away and really listened to my needs and questions. He answered every question I had about the surgery (this was my first surgery so I was a tad anxious). Like I stated in my review I have been seeing him for almost 10 years and I wouldn't be doing that if he wasn't a great doctor and a good person. He will always have me as a client.

I had been researching and talking with friends to figure out where to get my procedure done and I had heard nothing but wonderful things about Dr.Brown, even all the way in Charlottesville! From the minute I walked in Dr. Brown was so kind. You can tell he is very knowledgeable in what he does and that he always strives for the perfect result. Such a wonderful doctor with a great staff, would...

Dr Brown ROCKS - Leesburg, VA

I had several consults in the area and the minute he walked in the room and shook my hand I just knew he was the one. Dr Brown did a breast augmentation for me. He was caring and compassionate and was very honest with me about the fact that breast augmentation basically takes what you've got and just enhances it. I could not have been more happy with the results or the aftercare etc..
I have recommended numerous friends to him and some have had the same procedure as me, and are super happy; while others have not trusted him with other procedures and they are super happy as well.
If you're looking for a Dr who is going to be honest and who truly cares about you then I would absolutely choose Michael Brown all day long.

In my initial visit with Dr. Brown, he spent a great deal of time explaining this procedure.  What would
happen from beginning to end. One of the things I look for in any doctor is their willingness to answer
all of your questions no matter how trivial they may seem.  He took all the time I needed and answered
all of my questions.  I left his office not only feeling he was a very dedicated surgeon but a very caring individual.  His office staff was very professional and supportive.  After my surgery, he was available to answer any concern I had.

Dr Michael Brown was exactly the doctor for me.  Personal and never kept me wondering what to expect.  The breast surgery outcome was exactly what I was hoping for.

Dr. Brown was fantastic - kind, caring, and patient with all of my questions. The surgery was very fast, no complications, and I healed up quickly. Really couldn't have asked for a better surgeon or staff, and I will definitely return to him for any future plastic surgery procedures. I've recommended him to a lot of my friends as well. I really felt like he and his staff cared about my outcome and I know that if I had questions or concerns I could call them at any time.
Out of all of the plastic surgeons I visited in Northern Virginia, I really feel like he was by far the best choice and wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone I know.

Dr. Brown is genuinely one of the best doctors I've had the pleasure of working with. At my initial consultation, he was warm, welcoming and had a wonderful overall disposition. His pleasant demeanor, great staff and beautiful office were the ultimate deciding factors in scheduling my operation. Dr. Brown made sure I was aware of each aspect of the operation, greeted me warmly the morning of, and laid to rest my fears of going under the knife. He even provided his home phone number, in the event something were to happen during my recovery. I just visited him for my six month post op, and both Dr. Brown and I are extremely pleased with the results.

I had two major surgeries performed by Dr Brown and I am scheduled for two more (one of which is a brachioplasty revision from another surgeon). I am very happy with my results and would recommend him to friends and family!

Dr Brown made me feel comfortable.  I was immediately confident that I made the right choice.  Dr Brown was knowledgable and helped me make this difficult decision.  Dr Brown also gave me a tour of his state of the art operating room which made me feel more comfortable.  I could not be happier.  Dr Brown is the only choice for breast augmentation in Northern Virginia.

Personal Statement

            I treat all of my patients as if they are members of my family. Surgery is not always the best solution to a problem, this is especially true on the face. I take the time with each facial consult to explain the surgical and non surgical enhancements that may be of benefit to them.

Topical Antioxidants- What does that even mean?


            “What the heck are antioxidants and why would I need to put them on my skin,” you ask? To understand the need for this step in your skincare regimen, you must first understand what 'free radicals‘ are and how they relate to your body.

	Scientifically, free radicals are molecules created as a by-product of oxygen metabolism as our bodies create energy at the cellular level. Basically, the oxygen molecule loses one electron, turning it into a ‘free radical.’

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Michael Brown has the following 1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Diagnostic Radiology
    Radiologists help doctors get a closer look at what’s happening inside your body. If your primary care doctor wants to investigate your symptoms further, they may refer you to a radiologist to get an ultrasound or x-ray. Some radiologists specialize in mammography and breast imaging, which is who you see when you need a mammogram. A Radiologist can also determine if bones are broken or fractured after any kind of accident.


    Radiologists are trained to perform MRIs and CT scans, both of which are used to determine the presence of diseases or disorders and help your doctor properly diagnose you. They can detect anything from tumors, bleeding and infections to bone and muscle disorders.
