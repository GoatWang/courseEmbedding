This practice is the result of more than two decades of experience working with companies of various sizes as well as individual entrepreneurs and inventors, helping to identify, develop and protect many different types of intellectual property assets.
 
We focus on assisting clients with intellectual property protection, including registration of patents and trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and registration of copyrights with the U.S. Copyright Office. We also assist with registration of patents and trademarks outside of the U.S., utilizing a network of law firms around the world.
 
We also handle trademark, trade dress, patent, design and copyright litigation in U.S. Federal courts, domain name arbitration under the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy, and advise on business transactions such as licenses, mergers, acquisitions and financing involving intellectual property assets, and trade secret and confidential information protection.
 
We are very familiar with the needs of start up businesses and have helped many businesses with essential agreements needed at the beginning phases, such as inventor and employee agreements and nondisclosure agreements.


















































Michael J. Brown



My experience
 
I am a registered patent attorney and have filed or directed the filings of at least 2000 patent and trademark applications in the U.S. and countries around the world. In addition to protection and registration of U.S.-based intellectual property rights, working with a network of firms around the world, I am able to assist clients with registration and protection of trademarks, patents and copyrights on a global or regional basis.
 
I have handled a variety of intellectual property disputes in patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names and rights of privacy and publicity, ranging from initial investigation of infringement through litigation and resolution.
 
In business transactions, I have advised on confidentiality agreements, asset due diligence, purchase agreement negotiation, privacy issues, material transfer agreements, licensing agreements, university licensing agreements, software development agreements, joint venture agreements, and transition services agreements, including such issues in the context of a bankruptcy or restructuring.
 
In my career, I have been associated with firms of different sizes, ranging from small intellectual property boutique firms to large multi-national general practice firms. I also served as outside intellectual property counsel for a multi-national manufacturer of oil and gas refining equipment. With this background, I can offer the benefit of my extensive experience in an environment where I can provide personal attention to my clients' concerns.



What kind of businesses do I represent?
 
I currently advise businesses in the following industries: apparel, cosmetics, toys, dental products, financial services, environmental remediation, content publishing, food processing, shipping, luxury goods, personal care services, software development, technology service providers, industrial manufacturing and others. I have also advised businesses in petroleum processing, computer retail, real estate services, transportation and logistics, consumer brands, and book publishing.
 
I work with individual inventors and founders of start up businesses, advising on cost-effective ways to protect inventions and new business ideas.

Intellectual Property Asset Protection and Transactions
 
Our practice assists clients with the protection of intellectual property through registrations, litigation and other adversarial proceedings, transactions and licensing.  We regularly advise and assist clients with intellectual property protection issues in the U.S. and overseas.
 
In the U.S., patents and trademarks can be registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and copyrights are registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.
 
U.S. Federal courts evaluate and rule on disputes in trademark, trade dress, patent and copyright matters, and domain name disputes are handled through arbitration proceedings under the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy of Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
 
Business transactions such as mergers, acquisitions and financing involving intellectual property assets require consideration of the impact of the transaction on the ownership and use of the intellectual property assets, as well as the impact of the intellectual property assets on the underlying transaction. Trade secret and confidential information can be protected through non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements and also through setting up best practices.

What is intellectual property?
 
Intellectual property, as the name suggests, covers creations of the mind.
These creations can be generally broken down into the following categories:
 
• PATENTS protect inventions such as machines, processes, compositions of matter and certain designs;
• TRADEMARKS are brand identities such as product or service names, logos or packaging;
• COPYRIGHTS are artistic creations, such as artwork, writings, film or music;
• TRADE SECRETS are non-public business information, such as secret business formulas, processes and methods


The importance of intellectual property
 
Most successful businesses in a wide variety of industries share a common trait: they pay attention to their intellectual property assets, including inventions, brands and creative works.  The intellectual property assets of successful businesses are what the businesses are known for.  Consumer product companies are known for their brand names.  Technology companies are known for their innovative and distinctive products.  Artists and entertainment companies are known for their creative works.  Each of these types of intellectual property, otherwise known as patents, trademarks and copyrights, have their own characteristics and means of protection.
 
Attention to intellectual property is important. Failure to protect your intellectual property assets or to make sure that you are not violating the intellectual property assets of another can result in:



• Loss of trademark rights
• Missed business opportunities
• Pre-emption in the market
• Infringement litigation


• Misappropriation of trade secrets
• Unfair competition
• No attribution for your work
• Unnecessary expenses


These are examples of the risks, but a proper evaluation of your specific needs can determine whether any of these apply to your situation.




Patents
 
Patents protect inventions, such as new products, processes, designs or compositions. While any idea may be an invention, in order for an invention to be patentable, the invention must be new and not obvious in light of existing technology.
 
A patent may be simply described as a government sponsored monopoly, granting the right to exclude others from making, using or selling an invention. One common misconception about patents is that owning a patent does not give the patent owner the right to do anything with its invention. As an exclusionary right, a patent is more of an offensive tool than a defensive one.
 
Patents are national in protection, and a patent in the U.S. will not by itself provide any enforceable rights outside of the U.S.  For protection outside of the U.S., additional patent applications may be necessary.
 







Trademarks
 
Trademarks are the names and logos used to identify the products and/or services of a business. A trademark serves the business by distinguishing the products and/or services of the business from its competitors. In the U.S., trademark rights are acquired through use of the trademark, however, registration is recommended, through Federal or state registers. Outside of the U.S., trademark rights are generally based upon registration.
 
Trademark rights are generally national in scope, however there are regional trademark registrations, such as the European Community Trademark and international trademark treaties that simplify registration in many countries, and provide more cost effective solutions than separate national trademark filings.
 







Copyrights
 
Creative works, including writings, artwork and music are automatically protected by copyright. Copyright provides the owner of the creative work with the exclusive right to control copying and creating new works based on the creative work, otherwise known as derivative works. Registration is not required for copyright to exist, but for U.S. copyright owners, a copyright registration with the U.S. Copyright Office is a prerequisite for filing a law suit for infringement of copyright.
 






Trade Secrets
 
Certain information about a business may provide the business with an advantage over competitors, provided that the information is not known to the competitors. New technology often is kept confidential during development before patenting or even instead of patenting. It is important that the business keep such technology and similar information confidential to maintain the competitive advantage, usually through non-disclosure, confidentiality and employment agreements.

Artist Statement
Motion Graphics: Kinetic images that change with the movement of the viewer. I use a lenticular printmaking technique combined with up to 300 of my photographs to create optical art that animates. The kinetic nature of my optical art does not show up in my jury images. Below is a link to a movie of my art taken at outdoor art shows including two clips of some experimental pieces. My newest pieces use up to 300 frames and animate like a movie as the viewer walks by. I do all the photography and produce these hand made lenticular graphics in my home-based studio. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd2HUCPelVU

Almost 10 Years and Still Looking Fantastic - Ashburn, VA

Dr. Brown is very personable. He put me at ease right away and really listened to my needs and questions. He answered every question I had about the surgery (this was my first surgery so I was a tad anxious). Like I stated in my review I have been seeing him for almost 10 years and I wouldn't be doing that if he wasn't a great doctor and a good person. He will always have me as a client.

I had been researching and talking with friends to figure out where to get my procedure done and I had heard nothing but wonderful things about Dr.Brown, even all the way in Charlottesville! From the minute I walked in Dr. Brown was so kind. You can tell he is very knowledgeable in what he does and that he always strives for the perfect result. Such a wonderful doctor with a great staff, would...

Dr Brown ROCKS - Leesburg, VA

I had several consults in the area and the minute he walked in the room and shook my hand I just knew he was the one. Dr Brown did a breast augmentation for me. He was caring and compassionate and was very honest with me about the fact that breast augmentation basically takes what you've got and just enhances it. I could not have been more happy with the results or the aftercare etc..
I have recommended numerous friends to him and some have had the same procedure as me, and are super happy; while others have not trusted him with other procedures and they are super happy as well.
If you're looking for a Dr who is going to be honest and who truly cares about you then I would absolutely choose Michael Brown all day long.

In my initial visit with Dr. Brown, he spent a great deal of time explaining this procedure.  What would
happen from beginning to end. One of the things I look for in any doctor is their willingness to answer
all of your questions no matter how trivial they may seem.  He took all the time I needed and answered
all of my questions.  I left his office not only feeling he was a very dedicated surgeon but a very caring individual.  His office staff was very professional and supportive.  After my surgery, he was available to answer any concern I had.

Dr Michael Brown was exactly the doctor for me.  Personal and never kept me wondering what to expect.  The breast surgery outcome was exactly what I was hoping for.

Dr. Brown was fantastic - kind, caring, and patient with all of my questions. The surgery was very fast, no complications, and I healed up quickly. Really couldn't have asked for a better surgeon or staff, and I will definitely return to him for any future plastic surgery procedures. I've recommended him to a lot of my friends as well. I really felt like he and his staff cared about my outcome and I know that if I had questions or concerns I could call them at any time.
Out of all of the plastic surgeons I visited in Northern Virginia, I really feel like he was by far the best choice and wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone I know.

Dr. Brown is genuinely one of the best doctors I've had the pleasure of working with. At my initial consultation, he was warm, welcoming and had a wonderful overall disposition. His pleasant demeanor, great staff and beautiful office were the ultimate deciding factors in scheduling my operation. Dr. Brown made sure I was aware of each aspect of the operation, greeted me warmly the morning of, and laid to rest my fears of going under the knife. He even provided his home phone number, in the event something were to happen during my recovery. I just visited him for my six month post op, and both Dr. Brown and I are extremely pleased with the results.

I had two major surgeries performed by Dr Brown and I am scheduled for two more (one of which is a brachioplasty revision from another surgeon). I am very happy with my results and would recommend him to friends and family!

Dr Brown made me feel comfortable.  I was immediately confident that I made the right choice.  Dr Brown was knowledgable and helped me make this difficult decision.  Dr Brown also gave me a tour of his state of the art operating room which made me feel more comfortable.  I could not be happier.  Dr Brown is the only choice for breast augmentation in Northern Virginia.

Personal Statement

            I treat all of my patients as if they are members of my family. Surgery is not always the best solution to a problem, this is especially true on the face. I take the time with each facial consult to explain the surgical and non surgical enhancements that may be of benefit to them.

Topical Antioxidants- What does that even mean?


            “What the heck are antioxidants and why would I need to put them on my skin,” you ask? To understand the need for this step in your skincare regimen, you must first understand what 'free radicals‘ are and how they relate to your body.

	Scientifically, free radicals are molecules created as a by-product of oxygen metabolism as our bodies create energy at the cellular level. Basically, the oxygen molecule loses one electron, turning it into a ‘free radical.’

Paul Fulmer, MDLee S. ratedDr. Fulmer was excellent. He explained my proceedure in detail and made me feel very comfortable with my Balloon Sinuplasty surgery both before and afterward. The surgery was non invasive and I was very comfortable throughout the whole proceedure (which took a total of less than 10 minutes). I was able to go back to work two days later and I highly recommend taking it easy for a couple of days to let the healing process start before over extending yourself. The follow up appointments mainly cleared some small scabs that form and once those are removed I was able to breath better than I have ever been able to. The first two weeks required four nasal rinses a day but once I got used to the routine it was second nature. Dr. Fulmer is a true professional and I highly recommend anyone that is thinking about having this surgery to go to him for his knowledge and expertise. -Lee S.R. Paul Fulmer, MDCindy N. ratedI came in for seasonal allergies, but the i was told they could make an apptmt for my constant sinuses. So when i came in i learned that i was eligible for a balloon Sinuplasty, i was nervous only because its surgery. But everyone here was extremely helpful from day one, when i came in for the procedure i was tended to hand and foot. So to speak... had a pleasent surgery, no problems. Two weeks of misery (congested) of course with the healing, but every time i come back in here I am greeted as if i am family. Now I am on my final apptmt and feeling AMAZING. From the doctor, to his INCREDIBLE staff, i was superbly pleased with the overall experience. I dont know how i could ever thank everyone enough!!!R. Paul Fulmer, MDCinthia C. ratedMy overall experience was great with Dr. Fulmer and all the clinical staff. The procedure itself was not as bad as people think. The recovery process was quick and Dr. Fulmer made sure to let me know exactly what to expect so that I wouln't panic. His staff is great and very helpful. Nikki made me feel so calm during the surgery. I am finally able to breathe like I never have in my life. My workouts are more productive and my quality of life has improved tremendously! I would recommend Dr. Fulmer and his staff to anyone looking to improve their life and get their breathing back. I am completely satisfied and very thankful for this procedure.First Med of Midlandtallblondeheb ratedExcellent physician and diagnostician; his years of ER experience provide a needed service in Midland so overcrowded due to the oil boom.  The ability to get this care when most physicians are not taking new clients is astronomical.  Due to the experience and availability of excellent PA's and attention to almost 99% of any medical need this facility provides excellence to the community.  As a healthcare professional myself I am certainly critical of who provides care to me for any needed medical circumstance, and this practice is one I recommend wholeheartedly.Tom S Morgan Attorney At LawRolando S. ratedI had got behind on child support after I was laid off and had heard so many different things from coworkers and friends that I decided to talk to an attorney for help.  Mr. Morgan set me straight and gave the answers I was looking for in order to get caught up.  The entire staff helped me very much and I would recommend his services to others that don't know where to go for straight, honest answers about child support and visitation rights.R. Paul Fulmer, MDBeverly W. ratedNo beating around the bush, recognized symptoms and began diagnosing and treatment without delay and I was completely prepared for what was next except how very quickly and completely I could breathe and how little a I had been breathing before. My cough was aliminated 60 - 75 percent immediately. I do recommend Dr Fulmer and his care and wonderful Vickie, to provide breathing, full breathing to all those I care about!R. Paul Fulmer, MDCindy H. ratedWords are inadequate for these wonderful people and what they do. They are exceptional and very attentive. I would recommend anyone with sinus and allergy issues to give this place an opportunity to to get you the relief that they have me!!! Give them a call, you wont be sorry!!! Dr. Fulmer, Nikki Wade, Tiffany, and Taylor are exceptional people who truly care how you feel and show it without a doubtR. Paul Fulmer, MDMichael W. ratedI have suffered from allergies and sinus problems since I was a child, having been to many doctors for my problems breathing and nasal congestion. My visit with Dr.Fulmer has been the best experience and finally I can breathe and live life with no problems, Sinus headaches and the pressure are a thing of the past. I would recommend this to anyone else who is also affected by the same issues.Parras Attorney At LawAnthony G. ratedMy name is Anthony Garza. Jeff was my attorney for a federal case. At first I didn't think he was going to be any help to my case. But he was by far the best lawyer I have ever witnessed practicing law. He won me my case on a 2-20 years if guilty. He won the jury all said I was not guilty. Thank u Jeff me and my family wish u the best at the rest of your practice. I recommend u to anyone.R. Paul Fulmer, MDHugh P. ratedI thought there was no hope for my sinus problems, until I heard about Dr. Fulmer. The sinus bioplasty is a miracle and I do not ever remember breathing this well. Additionally, I no longer snore and I do not need my CPAP any longer. Again, it's a miracle. Dr. Fulmer and Nurse Vicki took good care of me and made me feel as comfortable as possible. I am very glad I had this procedure done.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

Emile PandolfiDo You Hear What I Hear CD 



$26.79





Destiny Is Calling buy CD music A poet of popular music, November 1, 2005 Emile Pandolfi plays show tunes, movie music, and the Great American Song Book, like no one else. He even includes the occasional classical selection, which is inevitable, as he is a classically trained artist in the traditional sense. Pandolfi's dexterity at the keyboard is highly polished; yet one hardly notices. One does notice his gorgeous tone, which seemingly knows no depth; his pianissimo playing, which I can tell you, reaches all the way to the back of the hall; his massive fortissimos, which always leave the impression that he has more to give; his melting legato touch, which makes the piano sound like anything but a percussive instrument; and his seemingly limitless imagination. 
Once you've heard Pandolfi's presentation of a song, it will be difficult for you to imagine it any other way. Partly, this results from his own imagination: he is able to listen to music and lyrics with such freshness, even to the punctuation of lyrics, that he understands what many of us pass over. Then, he brings the resources of his technique, his sound-all his musical training and experience-to bear on the story in  ...
