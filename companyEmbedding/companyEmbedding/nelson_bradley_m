Energy Healing Simplified
For Dr. Bradley Nelson DC (ret), the journey towards Energy Healing, Muscle Testing, and The Body Code began years ago, when he was diagnosed with kidney disease at 13. After receiving treatment from Osteopathic Doctors and experiencing “spontaneous remission,” he decided that when he grew up, he would likewise pursue helping others, and use alternative healing methods to do so. After taking a brief detour through computer programming and business management, he did just that, pursuing training and beginning a chiropractic practice, which he continued for 17 years. In his tenure helping people heal their bodies and minds, he found that lessons learned in computer programming were directly applicable to Energy Healing. After retiring from his practice, Dr. Nelson wrote down his methods in his book, The Emotion Code, and began sharing the secrets of his success with others via seminars and workshops.
For Dr. Nelson, that wasn’t enough; he felt very strongly that these healing methods needed to reach the whole world, to help more people help themselves. He developed The Body Code and began to teach the methods he used in his practice to others so that everyone could have access to the astounding and life-changing secrets he had discovered in the course of his practice. Now, Dr. Nelson offers training on Energy Healing and Muscle Testing to all who are willing to learn, promising that his methods will change your life and your loved ones, as it has for his family and his countless patients. So join us on the journey; Begin your Energy Healing training today, learn The Body Code, and start changing lives.

Click Here to Enroll and Buy Wholesale from NikkenMagCreator by Nikken The MagCreator is my own device of choice for use with The Emotion Code, because it is a magnificently-made piece of equipment that will last for many years, and can most likely be handed down to your grandchildren. It is made of stainless steel, with long-lasting roller bearings, and is great for massage. Magnets are embedded in the rollers.Kenko MagDuo by Nikken The MagDuo, Nikken's new model of the MagBoy, is a great little massager which also works very well for unlocking The Body Code. The two magnets are housed in a hard plastic case, and can be removed and rubbed in the hands. During my years in practice I called the MagBoy my 'pain eraser' as it would usually alleviate discomfort of whatever type within about a minute.Click Here to Place a Retail Order on the Nikken Website

Lana has firsthand experience of being completely healed with the techniques used in The Body Code.What is Proxy Testing and how is it done?If you have read "The Emotion Code," you have gained an understanding of "Proxy Testing." In case you need to refresh your memory, I have excerpted portions of "The Emotion Code" below for your review:When someone has been given authority to act for someone else, we commonly refer to the authorized person as a proxy. A proxy is someone who acts as a substitute. In proxy testing, the proxy temporarily “becomes” the person being tested. By voluntarily putting themselves into the position of standing in for someone else, a proxy can be tested as if they were the subject of the testing, allowing their body to be used to benefit the subject. Proxy testing is most useful when you want to help someone who is not present or who is inaccessible for some reason.
When you release trapped emotions from someone at a distance, it is literally a form of remote or distance healing. Although remote healing has not been incorporated into Western Medicine, it has been practiced both anciently and in modern times by those who practice The Silva Method, Qigong, GungFu, Reiki and other respected techniques.TestimonialsHealing Allison in JapanI once worked with a number of ballerinas from a local dance school near my practice. Allison, one of the dancers that I had been treating, went to Japan to dance with a group from Disneyland. Late one night, I got a phone call from Allison’s worried mother. “Doctor Nelson, we have a big problem,” she said. “Allison has hurt her hip and can’t dance. She is supposed to be in a big show tomorrow. Is there anything you can do?” I told her I’d like to speak to Allison, so she gave me the number of her hotel in Japan. When I reached her, Allison described the problem with her hip and said it had started bothering her that day for no apparent reason, and that she was having difficulty walking. Dancing the next day was out of the question. Having gotten permission from Allison’s mother and from Allison to test her, I asked Jean to act as proxy.
Although Allison was literally on the other side of the earth, we had no problem making the connection. We chose to call Allison on the phone in this situation to get her input, but it’s important to note that proxy testing can be done without having the subject on the telephone while you are testing them.
The energetic connection between the proxy and the subject is sufficient. Distance is no barrier to energy. Energy is truly everywhere, and fills the world, and indeed fills the immensity of space. There is as much energy in the air between objects as there is in the objects themselves. Since energy is continuous and everywhere-present, working on Allison presented no difficulty. We discovered that Allison had two trapped emotions lodged in the tissues of her hip. The trapped emotions had to do with loneliness and grief over her trip to Japan. “Do you feel that you don’t want to be in Japan?” I asked Allison on the phone. She grudgingly admitted it was true. “It’s exciting to be here and all,” she said, “but I’m very homesick. I miss my mom and my friends. I just really don’t want to be here, and I wish I could go home.” By running a magnet down Jean’s back, we released the two trapped emotions from Allison. Even though Allison was half-a-world away in Japan, the results were instantaneous.
Before we hung up the phone with Allison, her hip pain was entirely gone. She went on stage the next day and danced without any problem. Dorene’s Remote ExperienceA patient named Dorene wanted to share this story about how remote healing was just as effective for her as being there in person.
I have seen Dr. Nelson intermittently over the last 10 years or so for various problems. I had been suffering for several days with the symptoms of a hiatal hernia, including heartburn and pain. I was really miserable, and I wasn’t getting anything done. My husband, Rick and I were sitting in our family room when Rick decided to make a phone call to Dr. Nelson to see if there was anything that he could do to help me. He found through testing that my symptoms were being caused by a trapped emotion and he treated it. I can honestly say that the relief was instantaneous as we were sitting there and the symptoms completely left me before the phone conversation was over. I highly recommend that people be open to this type of treatment. There are wonderful discoveries available to us today through remote treatments by those who are knowledgeable. - Dorene N. DISCLAIMER

Bradley Nelson (the emotion code, the body code)
Bradley Nelson is a chiropractor and craniopath who calls himself a "renowned holistic physician and lecturer" and calls his special secrets of healing "the Emotion Code" and "the Body Code." He bases his healing methods on an eclectic union of energy healing, Kirlian photography, applied kinesiology, magnet therapy, and a belief that the unconscious mind records everything one ever experiences and is the key to perfect health and happiness. Like many other healers whose imaginations seem to be their main driving force, Nelson believes there is only one cause and one cure for all illnesses.
Nelson claims to have gained his healing knowledge from a "higher power" through some sort of silent prayer. He begins his webinars and healing sessions with 15 seconds of silence to invoke the help of something "upstairs." He claims his healing crosses many borders. He can heal depression, relationships, and bodies--all with one magical system that can take place in just a few minutes and can be done at a distance. 
Here is what you can do with Nelson's Body Code:

Feel more emotionally connected with others than ever before!

Experience the lightness of releasing your trapped emotional baggage.

Be empowered to communicate with your own subconscious.

Learn the hottest techniques to tap into your own internal computer!

Acquire amazing tools to help your friends and loved ones!

Discover the unseen causes of illness most doctors aren't aware of.

Internalize and practice healing methods known only to a few.

Discern your real health challenge and know what to do about it now!

Learn to communicate with and heal your animals and pets!

I'm pretty sure that my doctor doesn't know how to use magnets or his subconscious mind to heal pets or "release trapped emotions."
Many of Nelson's claims are preposterous. For example, he claims that we inherit trapped emotions from parents and       ancestors and that the subconscious stores every      detail of every experience we've ever had. Even so, some preposterous claims may resonate with many broken-hearted people:

 Perhaps the most important discovery that Dr. Nelson has made is that trapped   emotional energies will often gather around the heart, creating a   "Heart-Wall" that may block you from giving and receiving love freely. 

If he were speaking metaphorically, I think I'd agree with him but I'd have to point out that this isn't a scoop. But Nelson means it literally. Energy is not a metaphor. It is literally surrounding the heart, which apparently is the literal seat of giving and receiving love. To which one can only say: Nelson, you should take some lessons in anatomy, physiology, and neurology to learn more about the emotions and the chemicals involved in feelings.
Some of Nelson's claims are popular myths among the "holistic," anti-scientific medicine crowd. For example, he passes on the tale that has been a favorite among this crowd for many years that prescription drugs are the third leading cause of death.  For those who care, this is a lie. Bradley's contribution to the lie is to claim that normal  use of prescription drugs is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control--a much better source than Nelson Bradley--report that in 2007 the number three cause of death in the U.S. was stroke with 135,952 deaths. Number one was heart disease with 616,067 deaths and number two was cancer with 562,875.
I don't doubt that Nelson has some satisfied customers and can whip up a frenzied page of testimonials should he so desire, but his healing methods are not based on solid science. I would be a bit suspicious of anyone who claims he knows something the entire scientific community has missed. Anyway, there is no reason to believe that energy healing of any kind is anything but placebo medicine. There is no justification for belief in muscle testing (applied kinesiology) as valid for anything. Kirlian photography does not prove energy fields exist around all living things. There is no evidence that magnets can "untrap emotions," whatever that might mean. All in all, I would have to say that if you seek treatment from Nelson, you are a believer in faith healing. Anyway, I wouldn't see a chiropractor for emotional problems. Make sure you read his disclaimer:

About Dr. Bradley Nelson DC (ret)
Dr. Brad : )
2012-04-24T05:19:27+00:00

I want to tell you the story about how I began on my healing journey…
My name is Dr Bradley Nelson DC (ret) and I am one of those lucky people who was blessed to discover an incredible secret that I want to share with you.
It is a secret that has transformed my life and the lives of thousands of people across the world…and I know it will do the same for you.
Now, before we go on to that, I want to share with you an inspiring story, it’s the story of how I found my true calling, and why I must share this knowledge with you…
Overcoming a Debilitating Disease as a 13 Year Old Boy…
When I was 13 years old, I was diagnosed with kidney disease. At the hospital, the Doctors told us that there was no treatment for what I had. They told me to be careful not to run or play too hard, because it could be dangerous.
I remember thinking that they didn’t really need to tell me that, because just walking would sometimes create pain in my back that would make me feel like I had been stabbed with a knife. Since this disease was potentially fatal, and since there was no medical treatment for it, my parents decided to try an alternative. They took me to see a couple of Osteopathic Doctors who practiced and lived in a trailer house situated in the middle of a field on the outskirts of town.
Their names were Dr. Alan Bain and Dr. Ida Harmon. “Doc and Ida” started working on me, and within a couple of weeks, I felt much better.The pain that I had been experiencing was much less frequent, and much less severe.
After about a month, I had just about forgotten that I was ever sick. My parents took me back to the clinic, where they ran the tests on me again. The tests were all negative, and as I recall, that was the 1st time I ever heard the phrase “spontaneous remission.” “Whatever we did must’ve worked!” – But of course, they hadn’t done anything. I knew in my heart that what my “alternative Doctors” had done HAD worked.

Finding My True Calling
I decided then and there that I wanted to be a Doctor when I grew up, but not just any kind of Dr, I wanted to be THAT kind of doctor. If I had to practice in a trailer house in the middle of a muddy field, that was okay with me.
Doc and Ida treated people by the busload who’d come to them from all over, even from other states. They were miracle workers, and my life would never be the same after my experience with them.
I remember very distinctly lying on my back on their table during a treatment session and telling Dr. Harmon, “When I grow up, I want to do what you do.” She replied, “No you don’t. If you go to school you’ll never learn the right way to heal. They’ll fill your head so full of dogma and nonsense that you’ll never be able to think for yourself again.” Maybe it was my age, but for some reason this advice really stayed with me.
A Detour Into the World of Computer Programming
As the years went on my dream of being a healer started to fade a bit. I was introduced to computer programming in college and I loved it. I loved business, and decided that I wouldn’t go into the healing arts after all. Instead, I was going to become a businessman.
When I was about 6 months away from starting the MBA program at Brigham Young University, my wife Jean and I went home to Montana for Christmas. As we were sitting with my mother and father in their living room, my father suddenly asked me, “Are you sure you don’t want to go to Chiropractic school? You’ve always wanted to do that, and it seems like a really great career.” I replied that, “No, I’ve decided to get my MBA, so I’m really going in a different direction.” He said “Well, why don’t you think about it one more time?” I told him that I would.

Receiving Direction From Above
Later that evening, Jean and I drew up a pro and con list. On one side was chiropractic, and on the other side was the MBA and the business world. The list was a little longer on the chiropractic side, but I wasn’t convinced. However, I was now not so sure what I really wanted to do. I had thought that my mind was made up, but now I felt like I was being torn between two exciting futures.
When Jean and I got married, we made an agreement that we would never make any momentous or important decision without praying about it to see if it was right. This was definitely one of those momentous decisions. So, that night found me on my knees. I essentially said, “Father in heaven, if it makes any difference to you, please help me to know what direction to go. I will go either way.”
I was awakened in the middle of the night with my mind full of thoughts about healing, and how wonderful it is to be able to serve other people that way. I remember thinking, “Well yes, that’s true, but this other direction is good, too….”
I had this experience 3 times that night. I woke up 3 times, and each time my mind was full of these “warm fuzzy feelings” about going into the healing arts. Nevertheless, I wasn’t convinced. (Do I seem a bit thick headed to you?)
The Single Most Pivotal Moment in My Life…
The next night found me on my knees once again, asking God for guidance. And this was a night that I will never forget if I live to be one million years old. This night, like the night before, I was awakened 3 times. And each time I was awakened, my mind was filled with the same thoughts as the night before. But somehow these feelings became progressively stronger and more powerful each time I was awakened.
The third time that I woke up that night my mind was overflowing with thoughts of service to mankind and to humanity; it’s impossible for me to describe what this experience was like. The feelings were absolutely overwhelming, and as my head was filled with thoughts of healing and helping the world, a voice spoke to me.
That voice was crystal clear, and it was as distinct and audible as anything I’ve ever heard. It said, “This is a sacred calling.”

The Body is a Sacred Temple
I’ve reflected on this experience many times since then. And I believe, because the human body is actually a sacred “temple” for our spirit to inhabit, that any time we are working to help that body function better, we are doing a sacred thing. If we are sewing up an injury, if we are helping someone who is disabled, if we are healing someone who is in need of healing, we are doing a sacred thing.
I ended up going to chiropractic school later that year. It was one of the great experiences of my life, and thanks to my classmates, it was a truly enlightening experience. But even so I was very much on guard. I remembered Ida’s warning to me from many years before, that I would lose the ability to think for myself.
No matter what healing method was taught by my instructors as being the “best way” to fix this or that problem, my attitude was always, “Well, maybe, maybe not. Maybe there’s a better way to do this, it just hasn’t been figured out yet.”

Computer Programming and the Healing Arts?
By this time, I had become pretty good at computer programming. In fact, I was able to help put myself through chiropractic school by programming the admissions software that our college used.
I remember my instructors saying how the brain is the most sophisticated computer in the known universe. And I can remember thinking, “Wow. If the brain is really a computer, will we ever have the ability to access the data that must be stored in there, because if we could, it would be amazing.”
I figured that someday, as technology advanced, we might eventually gain this ability. Little did I know how accessing the subconscious database would affect my practice and the rest of my life!
When I went into practice for myself one of the very first patients that I treated was a man who weighed about 300 pounds. He was in tears because he was in so much pain. I remember feeling a sense of panic wondering, “How can I know what this man really needs? What if I don’t do the right thing? How can I really help this man to get well as quickly as possible?”

My First Contact With the Power of The Body Code
I said a silent prayer to God at that point. “Father in Heaven, you got me into this. You need to help me now, if you will.” And He did. Somehow I was able to help that man to get out of pain in short order.
I came to rely on prayer. I prayed all the time for help, although no one knew it. I practiced for 20 years in one form or another, and it was my habit to ask a short, silent prayer of help for each patient that I treated, each time I treated them. I prayed that God would give me the “Gift of Healing,” one of the spiritual gifts that are spoken of in the Scriptures. I think I pestered Him for that gift on a daily basis for at least 10 years.
I learned for myself that prayers are answered. My patients got well. There were times, especially during the last years that I was in practice when the patient might present a problem that I didn’t know how to deal with, something that I had never seen before, and there were times when, in answer to my silent prayer of help, the information I needed to know would instantly flood into my mind. Sometimes this information was a completely different way of looking at things than I had never even considered before.
Leaving my Practice to Spread the Power of The Body Code
I loved my patients. I considered them my good friends. Leaving my practice was one of the hardest things that I ever had to do.
I was a bit like Marcus Welby M.D. If you’re old enough to remember, Marcus Welby was a medical doctor, and probably the 1st “Dr. show” that appeared on TV. During my childhood in the 1960s, it was one of my favorite shows and for some strange reason it made a huge impact on me. Dr. Welby was general practitioner, a “family Dr.”
He took care of families, and the show was always interesting because you never knew what was going to happen from one episode to the next. Sometimes I felt like a family doctor myself. I took care of families in many cases, working with everything from childhood asthma to the problems of old age.
“If we can find those imbalances, and fix them, perhaps your symptoms will go away”
As time went on, my patient’s problems seemed to increase in complexity as my ability to help them increased. The last 10 years that I spent in practice I specialized in working with people who were suffering from conditions that were considered “incurable” by Western medicine, complex problems like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, lupus, and even cancer.
Consistently I told these patients, “I don’t treat diseases. I don’t claim to cure diseases. I simply try to find the imbalances that are going on in the body. I believe that the symptoms that you are having are because of imbalances that are going on in your body. If we can find those imbalances, and fix them, perhaps your symptoms will go away.” And go away they did.
During those years, I saw patients with these difficult problems from all over the US and Canada. The vast majority of them got well, and quite rapidly. I didn’t end up helping everyone, and my success rate was not 100%, but it was very close to 100%.

Teaching Others to Help Themselves…
Somewhere along the line I developed this very powerful feeling that people could do a lot to help themselves. I had this deep, driving urge to empower people. I begin teaching seminars to do just that in 1998, and taught as many seminars to as many people as I could around the US and Canada for many years. But I was wearing myself out. I was working in my practice 60 hours a week and then flying off on weekends teaching seminars, and my family was suffering for it.
In 2002 I got a message from “upstairs” that I needed to turn my practice over to someone else, and sell everything I owned. It had become clear to me that these healing methods that I developed were not just for me or my patients.
These healing methods that I had developed were for the whole world…including you.

Letting Go of Emotional Baggage with The Emotion Code
I had to get out of practice so that I would have time to write “The Emotion Code.” I left practice in 2004, and in June of 2007 I published “The Emotion Code.” The success of that book has been astonishing to me, it taught me how powerful the written word is. There are people now on every continent and in nearly every country who are using The Emotion Code to get rid of their own emotional baggage and the best part is that they are helping their loved ones to do the same.
I get e-mails every day from people whose lives are changing; who are falling in love for the first time because they got rid of their Heart-Wall; people who are getting rid of their anxiety, panic attacks, phobias, depression, as well as their pain and discomfort.
I’ve been all over the world teaching The Emotion Code Seminar, from Australia to Germany, from Toronto to Auckland, from Seattle to New York City, from Dublin to Amsterdam.
The Emotion Code is Only One Small Piece of a Larger Picture…
But The Emotion Code was only one piece of the puzzle. Since our “trapped emotions” are the single most common kind of imbalance that we suffer from, it was the first piece of healing information that I needed to get out to the world.
The truth was that even with its worldwide popularity,The Emotion Code was just the tip of the iceberg.
The entire system that I had put together during those years that I was in practice, a system that I called “The Body Code”, was the essential, groundbreaking “missing piece” that I now needed to share with the world.

My Secret Weapon: Computer Programming and The Subconscious Mind?
Because of my years as a computer programmer I was always trying to combine the use of a computer with the healing work that I was doing. The Body Code was developed in response to my need to figure out what was really wrong with people in the absolute shortest timeframe possible.
I ran my practice in such a way that I had about 10 minutes per patient visit. That might not seem like a whole lot of time, and it’s not. I knew other holistic practitioners who would easily spend an hour with a patient. But I had a secret weapon, and that was the ability to access their Subconscious Mind through muscle testing. As time went on, I developed a “mind mapping” system that was perfect for my needs.
After The Emotion Code was published, I had a vague idea in the back of my mind that eventually I would teach The Body Code System to doctors. Although I had taught it in seminars before, I had no plans to teach it again, as I was putting all of my effort into getting The Emotion Code out to the world.
However, that was about to change.
“Share This Knowledge With Everyone…”
One early morning in August of 2008, I woke up to find my mind full of a very specific instruction to “Take all the information that you have gained, take everything that you have learned about healing, and put it into a self-study course that anyone can use and learn, and make it available to everyone, everywhere.”
It’s hard to describe how crystal-clear this instruction was. There was no question that this is what I was supposed to do. Yet for just a moment the thought of how much work this was going to be made me look upward and ask, “Are you sure about this?” (There was no response to this question, but I wasn’t expecting one, really)
I spent the next year working non-stop on The Body Code System. I would start working on it before the sun was up and often still be working on it after midnight.

It’s Really More a Matter of “Remembering” Than Learning
I believe that The Body Code System is the most advanced method of energetic healing and of natural healing that exists on the planet today.
It’s really amazing. And while I would love to take credit for it, I will never do that because I believe that I’m just the messenger. I believe that everything that has happened to me in my life has prepared me to be this messenger, to bring The Body Code System to the world, to bring The Emotion Code to the world, to give back the healing birthright that belongs to every single one of us, to turn us back into the healers that we are capable of being.
If this story resonates with your heart, if you can feel the truth of it, then I hope you will join me. There is so much you can do to help yourself to get well and stay well.
There are people all around you who need your help. You can help them. You can heal their lives. It’s really more a matter of “remembering” than learning. Somewhere, deep inside of you, there is a mighty healer that is about to awaken. I am honored to be in your presence, and to share this sacred knowledge with you.
To uncovering the potential in yourself,

Against Nature: “The Turing Problem”



		Published March 22, 2012 by Bradley M. Nelson	
 


The earliest use of the word “φύσις”, usually translated as Nature, occurs in Homer: “Hermes gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its nature.” Hermes initial function was that of a messenger, sent to warn Odysseus of the imprisoning wrath of Circe. In addition, Hermes wished to demonstrate the qualities of the natural world by using an herb, a Moly, or a white flowered herb with black roots. Hermes is trying to demonstrate the mundane features of this “magical” white plant. Eventually, the Greeks came to see Physis as that which is unchanging. Its counterpoint, Nomos, means “Nurture.” Nomos is that which exists as a result of human belief. So the questions went: Do the gods really exist? Or do we humans create their existence, making them a part of Nomos? It wasn’t until later that Physis came to be known in a more legalistic sense. (Or in the sense of the verb form phusis, indicating that Nature has a period of growth over time.)
…
The title to the tourist-facing website for the country of Dominica is “Discover Dominica, the Nature Island.” A cursory Google image search will show you beautiful foliage, cobalt blue waters, and relaxing hot springs. Indeed it would be a perfect place for a vacation. The website touts Dominica as “The ideal spot for a wedding or honeymoon!” Implicitly, they mean a “natural” wedding or honeymoon. Dominica is in the news today after two American men were arrested after they were caught engaging in an act of indecent exposure on an Atlantis cruise ship. It is alleged that they were having sex on their balcony of their rooms while the ship was docked. It’s unclear who caught them, but the story seems to suggest that a resident of the island caught the two men engaging in an act of buggery, a criminal act that carries a maximum 10 year prison sentence.
Homosexuality possesses qualities of both Nomos and Physis. Gay sex does indeed occur in the animal kingdom; there are species of animals who engage in sexual intercourse regardless of the sex of its partner. As a human identity, “homosexuality” is a Nomos, nurtured into existence by the greater society. Ironically, it is less possible to punish the Nomos, or the aspect of homosexuality that’s culturally fabricated. So they go after the Physis. When one engages in acts of sodomy, one has committed a “crime against Nature.” Tellingly, the courts in Dominica were only able to prosecute on the basis of Indecent Exposure. In other words, they exposed themselves as homosexuals. And of course the men were set free under certain financial conditions.
I just finished listening to a wonderful Radiolab episode on the English mathematician Alan Turing. He was arrested for “Acts of gross indecency.” His sentence? Chemical castration. The buggery laws of 1950s England were such that one had two choices: be imprisoned or take estrogen. The latter choice was aimed at erasing the potency of his manhood. Turing’s career centered around one principle intellectual problem: “What if machines become our equivalents?” He believed it to have been possible. And the English courts decided: Turing, against Nature, must be stripped of his manhood.

A Nietzschean Yogi?



		Published March 21, 2012 by Bradley M. Nelson	
 


Yoga class was the last place on earth I would expect to be reminded of Nietzsche’s view of the historical human. Yet there I was, listening to my instructor’s words of wisdom: “Live in the past, you’re always regretting something. Live for the future and you’re full of anxiety. Be here in the present.” Of course this sentiment smacks of late 1960’s Be Here Now counterculture, which is far removed from the iron that is the Nietzschean Übermensch. But I find a connection to what we call the “historical human.” In his Use and Abuse of History, he says “There is a degree of insomnia, of rumination, of the historical sense, through which something living comes to harm and finally perishes, whether it is a person or a people or a culture.” One perishes once the “historical sense” finally takes hold completely. For some, there is only a past that seeks to strangulate the living present. In other words, a memory is not something that you should hold on to, but something that should be discarded and forgotten in order to go about living. Of course Nietzsche was referring to History in a much more universal sense. (If I may use the words “universal” and “Nietzsche” in the same sentence…) Yet one must personalize this statement. After all, Nietzsche is nothing if not life-affirming. Nietzsche tells us to say Yes to life. One can easily see how quickly the Overman’s horizon begins to broaden.
But at the very beginning of class today, my teacher put on some music for us. The music was not exactly my style, but then again my “style” of music doesn’t lend itself very well to relaxation and meditation. I stopped short when I noticed that the singer sang the word “God”, as in “God leads us to the infinite.” I’m not exactly militant in my atheism, so I let it slide. But my teacher warned us that the music “uses the G. O. D. word”, and that she had received complaints in the past. She explained that the yogic god can be seen that way, but should be seen as “energy”, a concept that I was familiar with from classes past. I wanted to remember to ask her whether the man was an atheist or a christian. But I had forgotten, and at this point in time, I find the answer irrelevant.

If you liked this Angela Davis video, you might like…



		Published November 2, 2011 by Bradley M. Nelson	
 


May I ask why in the world is YouTube advertising an Ex-Gay video to me, after watching this clip of Angela Davis speaking about Judith Butler’s refusal to accept a German GLBT award? (An event that had escaped my attention back in the summer of 2010.) It was bad enough that YouTube tried to get me to watch some terrible contemporary horror film trailer after watching clips of The Brood. On Halloween, no less. What is the meaning of this dreadful misunderstanding?!

Why Demand a Center?



		Published September 30, 2011 by Bradley M. Nelson	
 


Bulls and bears are inherently peaceful creatures. That is, only if we leave them alone. Otherwise, they attack ferociously, maiming those who dare rouse them from their slumber. One gambles when one deals with these unpredictable creatures.
Is Wall Street as an organic entity, parallel to nature itself? It certainly is quite moody, given to fits of rage and fits of joy. In order to make sense of the markets, we attach a binary: a fertile Bull market vs. a barren Bear market. These labels depend on a quantification of Wall Street’s daily performance. When one looks from the broadly focused view of hindsight, the status of the markets appear to be a bit more ambiguous. Based on a more general observation, Wall Street in a constant state of flux.
There are those who do not wish for a Bull market. After all, there is profit to be squeezed out of a Bear market. There are companies whose stock profits by laying off hundreds of its employees. It appears to be financially responsible, and sparks an interest in purchasing its stock. Only on Wall Street can a “good” day for some be a “bad” day for all the others. It’s the simple laws of capital: you win, I lose. A truly bad day on Wall Street is a day where everyone breaks even. If nothing happens, no one wins and no one loses, and we all should have just stayed home, as if made redundant. On a bad day, the traders go home with a sense of bored neutrality.
It has been said that there is no central focus to the Wall Street occupation. But does Wall Street itself have a central focus? One may say that “gaining” money is its purpose. But the market isn’t a single organic entity. It consists of individual traders who deal with the stocks of individual corporations. Each gamble against one another. Poke the bull and it charges; disturb the bear and it attacks. Leave it alone and what happens? Everyone breaks even, no one goes home feeling happy or unhappy. Wall Street would cease to perpetuate its cycle.
In a world of Fox News vs. MSNBC, is it any wonder that we’re taken aback by the lack of a focused soundbite, by a lack of a center? This movement, which started out as a few scattered protesters with a nondescript sense of angst were mocked by the mainstream “Left” media. Yet the protests are gaining momentum as we speak, and soon the media may second-guess its paternalistic finger-waving. The organism growing down on Wall Street will indeed be “Too Big to Ignore.”
Why demand a center when the center no longer holds?

The Creative Class made this happen



		Published August 10, 2011 by Bradley M. Nelson	
 


Congrats to the Cult of Mac for helping to create the “World’s most valuable company.” $337.17 BILLION dollars. I don’t care to divide the cost of an iPhone into that amount, mostly because I know it’s not that simple. Awe-inspiring numbers aside, it is quite remarkable what Apple has achieved. Chiefly, they have created an army of faithful followers who just gotta’ have that new product, regardless of personal necessity. And look at what it’s done! It’s created a company that possesses a market cap that’s greater than that of Exxon Mobil. Our fuel is now plastic and handsomely designed!
David asked me on the train about how many New Yorkers own iPhones. I guessed around 50%. I guessed wrong: There are probably more.
