 Educational Background



 


University of Maryland

                  The University of Maryland, College Park is a public research university, the flagship campus of the University System of Maryland, and the original 1862 land-grant institution in the State. The University of Maryland is committed to achieving excellence as the State’s primary center of research and graduate education and the institution of choice for undergraduate students of exceptional ability and promise. The University creates and applies knowledge for the benefit of the economy and culture of the State, the region, the nation, and beyond. As the flagship of the University System of Maryland, the University shares its research, educational, cultural, and technological strengths with businesses, government, and other educational institutions. The University counts among its greatest strengths -- and a major component of its excellence -- the diversity of its faculty, students, and staff. The University of Maryland, College Park is committed to equal educational opportunity and strives to hire a diverse faculty and staff of exceptional achievement through affirmative actions, to celebrate diversity in all of its programs and activities, and to recruit and retain qualified graduate and undergraduate minority students.                




 


The Johns Hopkins University

                  The Johns Hopkins University opened in 1876, with the inauguration of its first president, Daniel Coit Gilman. "What are we aiming at?" Gilman asked in his installation address. "The encouragement of research ... and the advancement of individual scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and the society where they dwell."

The mission laid out by Gilman remains the university's mission today, summed up in a simple but powerful restatement of Gilman's own words: "Knowledge for the world."

What Gilman created was a research university, dedicated to advancing both students' knowledge and the state of human knowledge through research and scholarship. Gilman believed that teaching and research are interdependent, that success in one depends on success in the other. A modern university, he believed, must do both well. The realization of Gilman's philosophy at Johns Hopkins, and at other institutions that later attracted Johns Hopkins-trained scholars, revolutionized higher education in America, leading to the research university system as it exists today.

After more than 130 years, Johns Hopkins remains a world leader in both teaching and research. Eminent professors mentor top students in the arts and music, the humanities, the social and natural sciences, engineering, international studies, education, business and the health professions. Those same faculty members, and their research colleagues at the university's Applied Physics Laboratory, have each year since 1979 won Johns Hopkins more federal research and development funding than any other university.

The university has nine academic divisions and campuses throughout the Baltimore-Washington area. The Krieger School of Arts and Sciences, the Whiting School of Engineering, the School of Education and the Carey Business School are based at the Homewood campus in northern Baltimore. The schools of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing share a campus in east Baltimore with The Johns Hopkins Hospital. The Peabody Institute, a leading professional school of music, is located on Mount Vernon Place in downtown Baltimore. The Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies is located in Washington's Dupont Circle area.

The Applied Physics Laboratory is a division of the university co-equal to the nine schools, but with a non-academic, research-based mission. APL, located between Baltimore and Washington, supports national security and also pursues space science, exploration of the Solar System and other civilian research and development.

Johns Hopkins also has a campus near Rockville in Montgomery County, Md., and has academic facilities in Nanjing, China, and in Bologna, Italy. It maintains a network of continuing education facilities throughout the Baltimore-Washington region, including centers in downtown Baltimore, in downtown Washington and in Columbia.

When considered in partnership with its sister institution, the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System, the university is Maryland's largest employer and contributes more than $10 billion a year to the state's economy

The award was given in Glendale, Arizona, in conjunction with the Final Four. Mason and his parents, Frank Mason, Jr. and Sharon Harrison, were in attendance to receive the trophy. "It is such a great honor and privilege to be here," Mason said after being presented with the trophy. "I have to thank my parents for putting me in this position and helping me become the man I am today.".@FrankMason0 accepts the #APPOY trophy with his parents, Sharon Harrison and Frank Jr. #kubball pic.twitter.com/2JRfvHUXhJ— Kansas Basketball (@KUHoops) March 30, 2017
Earlier in the week, Mason was unanimously tabbed as one of AP's First-Team All-Americans. With the selection, he earned the first consensus First-Team All-American honor at Kansas since Thomas Robinson in 2012. The Player of the Year award dates back to 1960, with greats like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan also winning back in their college days. Mason is the first Jayhawk to win the award. Bradley's Hersey Hawkins beat out Danny Manning for the honor back in 1988. This won't be the last time Mason's name will come up in postseason award conversation. He's a finalist for the Wooden Award, the Naismith Award, the Bob Cousy Award and the Oscar Robertson Trophy.— Edited by Omar Sanchez
