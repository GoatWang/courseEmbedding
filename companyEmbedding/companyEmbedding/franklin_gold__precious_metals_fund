            Fund Description
        




The fund seeks capital appreciation by investing at least 80% of its net assets in the securities of companies around the world that mine, process or deal in gold and other precious metals such as platinum, palladium and silver. The fund has a secondary goal of current income.



            Strategy Statement
        








"We think precious metals are attractive because they are a hard asset that's not tied to a particular country or financial system, potentially providing stability in times of economic uncertainty.
"

            Strategy, Benefits, Results
        



            Strategy
        
Our fundamental, research-driven approach focuses on high-quality companies with attractive production profiles, strong reserve bases and active exploration programs.
We focus on companies that mine, process or deal in gold and other precious metals, which may provide portfolio diversification given their low correlation to the overall equity, bond and currency markets.



            Benefits
        
Inflation hedge. Gold and other precious metals tend to perform well during recessionary and inflationary times.
Diversification. By adding investments from different sectors to your portfolio, you may take advantage of expanding and contracting economic cycles.

Hypothetical $10K Investment



















            Investing In The Fund
        

What Are the Risks?

All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
Also, the fund concentrates in the precious metals sector which involves fluctuations in the price of gold and other precious metals and increased susceptibility to adverse economic and regulatory developments affecting the sector.
In addition, the fund is subject to the risks of currency fluctuation and political uncertainty associated with foreign investing.
Investments in developing markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with their relatively small size and lesser liquidity.
The fund may also invest in smaller companies, which can be particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions, and their prospects for growth are less certain than those of larger, more established companies.
Investing in a non-diversified fund involves the risk of greater price fluctuation than a more diversified portfolio.
These and other risks are described more fully in the fund’s prospectus.

Important Legal Information

CFA® and Chartered Financial Analyst® are trademarks owned by CFA Institute.
Total Returns include change in share price, assume reinvestment of all distributions, and reflect the deduction of fund expenses and applicable fees. Total Returns With Sales Charge: returns reflect the deduction of the stated sales charge. Total returns, distribution rate, and yields reflect any applicable expense reductions, without which the results for those impacted funds would have been lower.
For more information on any of our funds, contact your financial advisor or download a free prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund's investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information.  Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
Most Franklin Templeton funds offer multiple share classes. Share classes are subject to different fees and expenses, which will affect their performance. In general, Class A shares have a maximum initial sales charge; Class C shares have a 1% contingent deferred sales charge; Class Z, Advisor Class and Class R6 shares have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees; Class R shares have no sales charges, but do have a Rule 12b-1 fee.

Footnotes

A statistical measurement of the range of a fund's total returns. In general, a higher standard deviation means greater volatility. Based on the fund's monthly returns over the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A statistical measurement of a fund's historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by taking a fund's excess return over that of the three-month Treasury bill divided by its standard deviation. Higher values generally indicate better historical risk-adjusted performance. Based on the 3 years ended as of the date of the calculation.
The annualized percentage difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk, as measured by beta.  Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Percentage of the fund's returns explained by movements in the FTSE Gold Mines Index. 100 equals perfect correlation to the index. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A measure of the fund's volatility relative to the market, as represented by the FTSE Gold Mines Index. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the market. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Public Offering Price — Purchase price for each share of the fund on a given day. It includes the maximum initial sales charge, if any.
Net Asset Value — The amount per share you would receive if you sold shares that day.
Source: Morningstar®. The style box reveals a fund's investment style. The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Placement is determined by fund portfolio holding figures most recently entered into Morningstar's database and corresponding market conditions. Shaded areas show the past 3 years of quarterly data. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Source: Morningstar®. For each mutual fund and exchange traded fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure against other funds in the same category. This measure takes into account variations in a fund's monthly performance, and does not take into account the effects of sales charges, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The weights are: 100% 3-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% 5-year rating/40% 3-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 5-year rating/20% 3-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent 3-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Morningstar Rating™ is for the named share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Past performance is not an indicator or a guarantee of future performance.

For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Franklin Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin California Ultra-Short Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.

Our Mutual Funds


U.S. Global Investors, Inc. is a boutique investment advisor specializing in emerging markets and natural resources. Our portfolio managers travel the earth researching opportunities and evaluating risk, all in the pursuit of exceptional performance for our funds.
Explore our no-load mutual funds, ranging from natural resources, emerging markets and infrastructure, to money market, bond and domestic funds. We believe that we are specially qualified to be an integral part of your investment strategy.


Global Resources Fund (PSPFX)
The Global Resources Fund takes a multi-faceted approach to the natural resources sector by investing in energy and basic materials. The fund invests in companies involved in the exploration, production and processing of petroleum, natural gas, coal, alternative energies, chemicals, mining, iron and steel, and paper and forest products, and can invest in any part of the world.


Gold and Precious Metals Fund (USERX)
The Gold and Precious Metals Fund is the first-no load gold fund in the U.S. We have a history as pioneers in portfolio management in this specialized sector. Our team brings valuable background in geology and mining finance, important to understanding the technical side of the business.
The fund focuses on producers, companies currently pulling gold or other precious minerals out of the ground. These companies, often called “seniors,” generally have the largest market caps in the mining sector.


World Precious Minerals Fund (UNWPX)
The World Precious Minerals Fund complements our Gold and Precious Metals Fund by giving investors increased exposure to junior and intermediate mining companies for added growth potential. With a high level of expertise in this specialized sector, our portfolio management team includes professionals with experience in geology, mineral resources and mining finance.


China Region Fund (USCOX)
The China Region Fund invests in one of the world’s fastest-growing regions. The China region has experienced many changes since the fund opened in 1994 but we believe the region continues to hold further investment opportunities.
Many countries in the region possess characteristics similar to the United States prior to the industrial revolution: a thriving, young workforce, migration from rural to urban areas and shifting sentiment toward consumption.


Emerging Europe Fund (EUROX)
The Emerging Europe Fund focuses on a region that shares the same continent as the established economies of western Europe, but has more in common with other emerging markets around the world. Many countries across emerging Europe are rich in resources, have strong banking sectors, healthy economies and lower debt levels than their western neighbors. The fund pursues opportunities tied to the economic growth of these countries, as many are making great strides toward meeting the European Union’s standards. Turkey presents a growth opportunity, with its young, growing population, entrepreneurial mindset and pro-business policies. Several countries in emerging Europe, such as Greece, also stand to benefit from the European economic recovery.


All American Equity Fund (GBTFX)
The All American Equity Fund invests in the growth of America by seeking “All American” companies with the best prospects for growth.
Offering the opportunity to invest right here at home, often in well-recognized names, the fund invests at least 80 percent of its assets in “All American” companies.
The portfolio management team uses a variety of investment strategies to select companies identified as having superior growth, profitability and quality relative to companies in the same industry.


Holmes Macro Trends Fund (MEGAX)
The Holmes Macro Trends Fund seeks to identify strong sectors, and within those sectors, to identify companies that have the greatest potential for growth. The portfolio management team uses a variety of investment strategies to search for companies suitable for investment in the fund, including factors such as growth in earnings, return on equity, and revenue.


Near-Term Tax Free Fund (NEARX)
The Near-Term Tax Free Fund invests in municipal bonds with relatively short maturity. The fund seeks to provide tax-free monthly income by investing in debt securities issued by state and local governments from across the country.


U.S. Government Securities Ultra-Short Bond Fund (UGSDX)
The U.S. Government Securities Ultra-Short Bond Fund is designed to be used as an investment that takes advantage of the security of U.S. Government bonds and obligations, while simultaneously pursuing a higher level of current income than money market funds offer.

Please consider carefully a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and other important information, obtain a fund prospectus by clicking here or by calling 1-800-US-FUNDS (1-800-873-8637). Read it carefully before investing. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, Distributor. U.S. Global Investors is the investment adviser. 
Read additional important information.

 Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local income taxes, and if applicable, may subject certain investors to the Alternative Minimum Tax as well. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. The tax free funds may be exposed to risks related to a concentration of investments in a particular state or geographic area. These investments present risks resulting from changes in economic conditions of the region or issuer.
Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure, as well as economic and political risk. By investing in a specific geographic region, a regional fund’s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio.
The Emerging Europe Fund invests more than 25% of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil & gas or banking industries. The risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund’s performance more volatile.
Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in a specific industry, the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries.
 Stock markets can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector-related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus.
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating? based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

“Mother of All Bubbles” Keeps Gold in Focus
July 21, 2017

 
By Frank Holmes
CEO and Chief Investment Officer
		U.S. Global Investors

Today I want to discuss reports that global debt levels are at all-time highs, and what this means for your investment decisions going forward.
But first, a few comments about this past week. I recently returned from the Oxford Club’s Private Wealth Seminar, held at the historic Grand Hotel on Michigan’s Mackinac Island. The hotel, which some of you might remember as the setting for the 1980 film “Somewhere in Time,” starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, took a mere 93 days to build in the 1880s—impossible by today’s standards, especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at 660 feet.
While there, I had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts, including Alex Green, the Oxford Club’s chief investment strategist. You might have read some of his wonderful work for Investment U, the group’s educational arm.
Alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between Democrats and Republicans, in his view, is that Democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions, while Republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions.
I prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics, but Alex has a point. I’m convinced that Donald Trump, a Republican, won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both white-collar and blue-collar Americans who felt as if the U.S. economy was no longer working for them. U.S. corporate taxes are among the highest in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas, and out-of-control regulations threaten to strangle business growth.
But just as Green insinuated, the Trump administration has enacted, or has hinted at enacting, policies that rankle Americans of all political stripes, precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties.
Take Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals. (The operative word here is “suspected.”) Many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials. It could, in fact, violate the Fourth Amendment, which of course protects Americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures.”
This is just one among numerous policy-making decisions that have members of both political parties, as well as independents, scratching their heads. Trump was elected to reform taxes, slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly. It’s unclear how private-asset seizures fit into that picture.
If this administration resolved to stay on message and on course, and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday Americans, it might receive greater support from those who voted for Trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t.
U.S. Dollar in Bear Market, a Boon for Gold
Since the start of the year, the five-year Treasury yield, adjusted for inflation, has risen about 150 percent. Normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period, the U.S. dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market. Because gold is priced in dollars, this has been supportive for prices. Year-to-date, the yellow metal is up more than 8 percent.

As I said, the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far, but it slumped to a 13-month low against the euro this week following European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the European Union (EU) until at least the end of the year.









“We need to be persistent and patient and prudent, because we’re not there yet,” Draghi said, referring to the fact that EU inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow, despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis. (Indeed, the June purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging European markets were all above the key 50 mark for the first time in recent memory.)
UBS: We’re Still Constructive on Gold
That gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates, despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging.”
That’s one of the key takeaways from a UBS note this week, in which the Swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal. Investor demand this year has been slower than expected, but UBS analyst Joni Teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in India this summer could help push consumption in the world’s second-largest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year. With India having imported a phenomenal 525 metric tons in the first half of 2017 alone, Teves writes that “we expect gold demand in India this year to be around historic averages,” which would be very supportive for prices.
ETPs Attracted a Record $245 Billion in the First Half of 2017
Exchange-traded products (ETPs) also had a knockout first half. As Deutsche Bank reports this week, ETPs attracted a record $245 billion in the first six months of 2017, in what has historically been the weaker half of the year. To put into perspective just how impressive this figure is, $245 billion would be the second-largest full-year record amount following 2016’s $283 billion. We could see ETP inflows climb as high as $500 billion by the end of this year, Deutsche estimates.

Of course, runaway demand for ETPs and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold.
Having said that, though, BullionVault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported last week that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record 38 metric tons, as of the beginning of July. That’s enough gold to make more than 10 million 18-carat wedding rings, BullionVault says, or to supply the microchips for 1.5 billion iPhones. The site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices, following three months of “light liquidation.”
Global Debt on Alert
All of what I’ve said so far pertains to the near-term. Gold’s medium- to long-term investment case, I believe, looks even brighter. Many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven.”
According to the highly-respected Institute of International Finance (IIF), global debt levels reached an astronomical $217 trillion in the first quarter of 2017—that’s 327 percent of world gross domestic product (GDP). Notice that before the financial crisis, global debt was “only” around $150 trillion, meaning we’ve added close to $120 trillion in as little as a decade. Much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets, specifically China, which is spending big on international infrastructure projects.

It goes without saying that this is a huge risk. Some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles,” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended, in 2000 (the tech or dotcom bubble) and 2007 (the housing bubble).
Paying down this debt will not be easy. As Scotiabank mentions in a note this week: “Higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier, and as more money goes into servicing the debt, it means less money is available to spend on other things, which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity.”
Add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise, with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies. In May, the World Economic Forum (WEF) estimated that by 2050, the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions, in other words—could be as much as $400 trillion, an unimaginably large number.
The U.S. alone adds about $3 trillion every year to the pension deficit. I shared with you earlier in the month that the State of Illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as $250 billion, putting each Illinoisan on the hook for $56,000.
Central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success, nor can they continue forever. Plus, near-zero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place.
You can probably tell where I’m headed with all of this. Another crisis could be in the works. Savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction.
Gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times, and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen, according to Seabridge Gold. I always recommend a 10 percent weighting in gold—5 percent in bars and coins; 5 percent in gold stocks, mutual funds or ETFs.

Domestic Equity Market

Strengths

The utility sector was the best performing sector of the week, increasing by 2.59 percent versus an overall increase of 0.54 percent for the S&P 500.
Vertex Pharmaceuticals was the best performing stock for the week, rising 24.5 percent.
The pharmaceutical company reported positive data from its Phase1 and Phase 2 trials for cystic fibrosis patients.  The results are clear and compelling with one analyst calling it, “breakthrough – quality.”  Cowen increased its price target from $105 to $200.

Weaknesses

The industrial sector was the worst performing sector of the week, declining 1.01 percent versus an overall increase of 0.54 percent for the S&P 500.
Chipotle was the worst performing stock for the week, declining 12.76 percent.
Chipotle’s shares were once the best performing of the fast casual restaurant industry, but as with food, stock prices can spoil too. The company’s shares slid to a new 52-week low on broker downgrades due to concerns over a norovirus outbreak at one of the Virginia locations, along with another detrimental video about rodents living in the ceiling at another location.

Opportunities

Where is the inflation?  According to Blackrock’s strategists, “technological innovation is disrupting traditional business models putting a lid on inflation.” The longer that inflation seems to be a non-event, the better the chances are the Fed keeps interest rates low.
Your company’s 401k match may be getting bigger.  Company matches are on pace to become 4.7 percent of an employee’s salary this year, up from 3.7 percent last year.  The reason behind the increase? The labor force continues to stay tight. If this trend continues, and more companies start competing on benefits, the stream of capital flowing into the markets from 401ks may become substantial.
Historically, shipping volumes were used as an indication of economic growth. More products shipped implied companies were “moving product.”  More products sold, meant more capital changing hands (which, in the future, should eventually show up in GDP reports).  Earlier this week The Wall Street Journal highlighted the volume of cargo imports are currently at record monthly levels.

Threats

Labor participation in the workforce for men age 25 to 54 is lower than it was during the Great Depression.  According to a recent working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research, video games are responsible for reducing the amount of work the younger generations of men perform over the year by nearly 30 hours. The big concern here is the growth of this behavior, and whether or not the distraction will impact workforce’s overall productivity.
Is a recession in the midst? Historically, when the difference between the interest rate on a 10-year Treasury note and the interest rate on a 3-month Treasury bill resulted in a negative yield, an economic recession follows.  Although we are not at that critical point yet, the spread between the 10-year Treasury has been narrowing over the past few years. If the Fed continues to tighten, it’s possible the curve may become inverted (the T-Bill yielding more than the 10-year yield) in the next few years (implying a recession could be in the cards).
Another indicator for an impending recession is a labor market at full strength.  Currently, the U.S. has one of the lowest unemployment rates in history.  Another indicator: frothy asset prices.  Right now, the stock market is at all-time highs.  And then there is central bank tightening. The Federal Reserve has tightened three times and other global central banks are discussing tightening too. Lastly, a pervasive sense of calm is an indicator. Many are saying, “don’t worry, the market always comes back,” while the volatility index is near all-time lows.

	Strengths

U.S. housing starts rebounded last month, signaling positive momentum for home builders trying to meet solid buyer demand. Housing starts rose 8.3 percent in June from the prior month to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.215 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.

The number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment benefits fell last week, reflecting the healthiest job market in more than a decade. Initial jobless claims in the period from July 9 to July 15 fell by 15,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 233,000.
The major U.S. stock indices closed at record highs on Wednesday helped partly by technology. The technology sector broke its previous closing high that held since March 2000. It had been the best- performing sector this year with a 22.8 percent advance.

Weaknesses

German investor confidence dropped for a second month in July, according to the ZEW Center for European Economic Research. Its index of expectations, which aims to predict economic developments six months ahead, slid to 17.5 from 18.6 in June. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a decline to 18. Germany is entering a period of uncertainty as it heads toward September elections and the European Central Bank starts discussing when it might wind down euro-area monetary stimulus.
Sentiment among American homebuilders deteriorated to an eight-month low in July on concerns about higher material costs, according to data from the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo. Builders’ Housing Market Index decreased to 64 (estimate 67) from 66 in June (revised from 67). The six-month sales outlook dropped to a five-month low of 73 from 75. The index of current sales fell to 70, the weakest since November, from 72.
Home property prices in Beijing fell 0.4 percent month-over-month, the first decline in more than two years, while Shanghai further declined and Shenzen stalled, pointing to significant cooling in China’s biggest real estate markets.

Opportunities

Traders in the Treasury futures market are growing more convinced that U.S. yields will be lower for longer, no matter what the Federal Reserve says. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield tumbled five basis points to 2.26 percent on Tuesday, touching the lowest level since June 29. The view gained traction Tuesday after Senate Republicans failed to muster enough support for health-care reform, casting doubt on whether President Trump will have better luck with fiscal stimulus. This is coupled with another round of below-forecast inflation data last week that has traders questioning whether the U.S. economic outlook is strong enough for the Fed to raise its benchmark rate again this year, as policy makers forecast.
U.S. real GDP increased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2017, and Bloomberg analysts predict annual GDP of 2.6 percent in the second quarter. Second quarter GDP data will be released next week, on July 28.
As expected, ECB policy was left unchanged. Draghi reiterated pledges to increase volume or the duration of the quantitative easing program if the outlook in Europe worsens. He did not discuss tapering at his time, but said that it could be discussed later in the fall. The euro appreciated against the dollar, breaking out to a fresh 23-month high.

Threats

The U.K. housing market will cool this year as uncertainty around Brexit hits the economy, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Home-price inflation will slow to 3.7 percent from 7 percent in 2016, and London will be the most severely impacted, PwC said in a report published Tuesday. The changes reflect the wider economic picture as inflation and Brexit take their toll on consumer spending and investment.
High-level economic talks between the U.S. and China ended Wednesday without any concrete agreement or future agenda, leaving the Trump administration’s efforts to recast trade ties with Beijing in limbo. The failure to take specific steps to close America’s $347 billion trade deficit with China—70 percent of the U.S. global imbalance—raises pressure on the Trump administration to consider shifting from its embrace of cooperation with Beijing toward more confrontation.
According to Bloomberg Intelligence, a rapidly increasing number of company executives are discussing artificial intelligence during earnings calls and investor presentations, which could be a precursor for labor-disruptive technologies not only in manufacturing but also across the service sector. With the U.S. now arguably at, or very close to, full employment, wages should rise more steadily, which in turn will increase labor costs. This, combined with technological advances over the past decade, may cause automated systems to look far more attractive.

Gold Market
	 

	This week spot gold closed at $1,254.81, up $26.11 per ounce, or 2.13 percent. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week higher by 2.56 percent. Junior-tiered stocks underperformed seniors for the week, as the S&P/TSX Venture Index rose just 0.45 percent. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar Index was crushed lower this week by 1.27 percent.

Strengths

The best performing precious metal for the week was silver, up 3.34 percent as investors loaded up on ETFs that purchase the physical metal, perhaps speculating that silver would outperform gold if the latter rallied.  Gold traders and analysts remained bullish this week, for the fifth week, as the European Central Bank keeps its stimulus going, reports Bloomberg. In addition, as the dollar slumps amid an investigation into President Trump, gold heads for the first back-to-back weekly advance since early June, another Bloomberg article reads.
Gold bulls are keeping their faith in the metal, reports Bloomberg, as the equity rally pares the yellow metal’s gains. Gold bulls have pointed to slow inflation and Fed concerns that asset prices look “somewhat rich.” Similarly, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey shows fund managers are growing hesitant to buy U.S. equities. Jason Mayer of Sprott Asset Management says that the non-stop bull market has led to a lot of complacency where managers aren’t hedging. “Once that tide turns, that could prove to be bullish for gold and precious metals,” Mayer said.
After President Trump’s economic revitalization agenda once again faltered, the U.S. dollar fell to an 11-month low this week, reports Bloomberg. Opposition to Trump’s health-care reform bill, along with European shares dropping amid earnings disappointments, sent gold to its highest level this month.

Weaknesses

The only negatively performing precious metal for the week was palladium, off 1.62 percent.  Hedge funds and money managers seem to be losing their faith in gold, along with other precious metals, reports Bloomberg. Before posting its first weekly gain in six weeks, the net-long position in gold fell to the lowest in 17 months for the week ended July 11. Money managers are hitting the exit as they brace for monetary tightening in the U.S. and Western Europe, the article continues, and aren’t waiting around for signs that the Fed may change its rate trajectory.
U.K. Royal Mint sales dropped in the second quarter by 62 percent compared with the previous three months, reports Bloomberg. Sales are down 41 percent from a year earlier. And according to data on the Swiss Federal Customs Administration’s website, Swiss gold exports declined 169.5 tons in May. Month-over-month exports to India also fell, but exports to China and Hong Kong both rose.
Jaguar Mining previously had seen its 2017 gold production output at 100,000 ounces, but the company cut its forecast to 95,000-105,000 ounces, reports Bloomberg. Positive news, however, came after its decision to leave Turmalina at Level 9 and commence development and mining of Level 10 in Orebody A. Turmalina saw significantly stronger production in June versus April following this decision, the article continues.

Opportunities

Scotia Mining Sales notes that as silver has gotten cheap again, particularly when looking at the widening gold-silver ratio, investors have been piling into silver ETFs (while dropping out of gold ETFs). Interestingly enough, there seems to be a bearish outlook in the futures market, where hedge funds are now holding the first net short silver position seen in two years, the group writes. The risk of higher U.S. interest rates should drive silver prices lower, is the reasoning behind this. However, if the Fed “blinks” and silver prices rebound, they will rebound quickly and violently, Scotia continues.

Klondex Mines reported record, second-quarter operating results for its Nevada and Canadian operations this week, producing 66,629 gold equivalent ounces (GEOs), an increase of 94 percent from the first quarter. In the press release, the company also stated that it remains on track to meet its annual production guidance of 210,000 to 225,000 GEOs, up 36 percent from 2016. “As expected, the operating results for the second quarter were the best in the company’s history,” President and CEO Paul Huet said.
Roxgold Inc. announced an updated mineral resource estimate (MRE) and complete drilling results from its first half Infill and Extension drilling program at the Bagassi South deposit. The Bagassi South deposit is located less than two kilometers from Roxgold’s flagship underground gold mine at the 55 Zone. According to a press release, highlights of the estimate are as follows: 1) Indicated MRE of 352,000 tonnes at 16.6 grams of gold per tonne (g/t Au) for 188,000 ounces and 2) Inferred MRE of 130,000 tonnes at 16.6 g/t Au for approximately 69,000 ounces of gold. In other company news, Columbus Gold Corp. announced its intention to spin out its mineral projects in the U.S. into a separate publicly traded company to be named Allegiant Gold Ltd. The plan of arrangement would see shareholders of Columbus receive one share of Allegiant for every five shares of Columbus. This should unlock the value for their North American assets.

Threats

As Global Mining Research points out in a note this week, over the last few years there have been a number of companies that haven’t mined to their Life of Mine (LOM) plans. In particular, stripping requirements haven’t been met. One of the most well-known examples of this recently is Detour Gold, the research group points out, but clarifies that it certainly not the only one. Deferring the waste removal puts the company at risk for greater waste removal requirements in the future, which is obviously not a source of revenue.
Due to Goldcorp’s failure to properly consult with affected indigenous peoples on its proposed Coffee Gold project, the Yukon Socio-Economic Assessment Board decided to stop its assessment of the project, reports Seeking Alpha. This means the project’s timeline could be in jeopardy, along with costs associated with the project. This decision points to deeper troubles at Goldcorp in relation to the company’s Canadian operations, the article continues.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller is taking a wide-angle approach to his probe regarding President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia in last year’s election. He is now looking into other Trump business transactions, despite the President’s caution not to do so. “The roots of Mueller’s follow-the-money investigation lie in a wide-ranging money laundering probe launched by then-Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara last year,” the Bloomberg article reads.


Energy and Natural Resources Market
	 

	Strengths

Thermal coal was the best performing commodity this week, rising 3.8 percent. The move came after unconfirmed reports stated that Andrew Wheeler, a top coal industry lobbyist, is likely to be named number two official at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The best performing sector this week was the Bloomberg Global Coal Producers Index. The index rose 5.4 percent on the back of strong Chinese steel mill demand reflected in record steel output for the month of June, followed by positive momentum in coal prices triggered by the potential for a top coal lobbyist to join the high ranks of the EPA.
Braskem SA, a major Brazilian petrochemical refiner, was the best performing stock this week finishing up 9.2 percent. The company rallied after Morgan Stanley raised its recommendation to overweight citing widening margins on the back of a weaker Brazilian real, strong free cash flow generation, as well as a valuation that trails its petrochemical peers.  

Weaknesses

Lumber was the worst performing commodity this week dropping 4.0 percent. The commodity was the best performer the previous week after a severe wildfire threatened sawmills operations in British Columbia, Canada. This week, tempered U.S. housing data weighed on the commodity in spite of continuing risks of greater wildfires on the Canadian west coast.
The worst performing sector this week was the FTSE 350 Mining Index. The index fell 1.6 percent on the back of a single stock, Acacia Mining which dropped 19.3 percent. The company discontinued its dividend and lowered guidance as a result of a spat with the Tanzanian government that resulted in a ban on exports of its gold and copper concentrates.
The worst performing stock for the week was GAMESA. The Spanish renewable energy supplier dropped 5.8 percent after announcing it will shut down its Tillsonfurg, Ontario factory as a result of weaker-than-expected wind mill demand in North American markets.

Opportunities

Gold rallied above its 50-, and 100-day moving averages this week, setting up for what could prove to be a strong technical move to $1,300 as the U.S. dollar continues to weaken. In fact, when looked at in the context of the weak U.S. dollar, gold fares even better; the chart below shows the tight inverse correlation between gold and the U.S. dollar, which going by the chart, suggests gold could move as high as $1,350 an ounce.

China's economy expanded 6.9 percent in the second quarter, significantly ahead of the government’s target of 6.7 percent. With two consecutive quarters of 6.9 percent growth, China’s GDP is on track for its first year-on-year growth acceleration since 2010.
Property investment was one of the key drivers behind China’s strong GDP beat, providing a positive read-through for steel and industrial metals demand. Property investment grew 8.5 percent year-on-year, showing a marked acceleration from the previous growth rates of 6.9 percent.

Threats

OPEC July output is set to exceed 33 million barrels per day (bpd), according to tanker tracking data. If sustained until month-end, the volumes would represent a sizeable increase over the 32.4 million bpd average for the first half of the year.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) suggests U.S. shale output is likely to increase by greater than 100 thousand bpd next month, according to its recent drilling productivity report. The increase in volumes is expected to drive total U.S. shale output to 5.59 million bpd, the highest level in all of 2017. These improvements, together with OPEC output reaching its highest of the year threaten to derail the nascent recovery in oil prices.>
China reported record amounts of steel and aluminum production in June. Reports out of Beijing suggest mills around the country rapidly increased output to profit from rallying commodity prices into quarter-end. The rapid output growth suggests China has been unable to meet its promise of cracking down on marginal mills to help rebalance the global steel market. Markets reacted negatively to the news fearing that China, the world’s top steel exporter, may resort to dumping to alleviate its oversupply.

China Region
	 

	Strengths

South Korea’s Korea Stock Exchange Index (KOSPI) finished the week up 1.47 percent, beating out Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Composite Index (HSCI) and the Philippines’ PCOMP Index by 10 and 15 basis points, respectively.
Information technology finished the week as the top sector in the HSCI.  Tech rose 4.16 percent in the last five trading days despite a few hiccups late in the week for some of the most recent dominant performers.
China’s second quarter GDP growth rate came in at a steady 6.9 percent, ahead of consensus estimates for a 6.8 percent growth rate and even with the first quarter’s 6.9 percent print.  Retail sales, fixed asset investment, and industrial production also came in ahead of estimates for China this week.

Weaknesses

Consumer services constituted the worst performing sector in the HSCI for the week, falling 81 basis points and making the sector the only one to finish the week in the red.
Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh Stock Index dropped 1.79 percent in the last week, while Indonesia’s Jakarta Composite (JCI) Index declined 1.14 percent.
Both imports and exports missed in Indonesia for the June period.  Imports came in down 17.21 percent year-over-year, shy of expectations for a 9.25 percent increase and down from the prior period’s 24.03 percent, while exports fell 11.82 percent, missing estimates for a gain of 7.28 percent and the prior month’s pace of 24.08 percent growth.

Opportunities

A combination of a growing population in Asian urban areas together with more efficient transport systems will give a rising number of people greater access to more airports. The chart below shows urbanization rates in key Asian countries growing, which is likely to boost Asia’s long-term air travel demand growth.

According to a plan issued by the State Council, “China aims to make the artificial intelligence industry a ‘new, important’ driver of economic expansion by 2020,” reports Bloomberg.  Late Thursday, policy makers on the cabinet announced that they want to be global leaders in the space, with the AI industry generating more than 400 billion yuan of output per year by 2025.
China is facing less pressure from capital outflows, according to data released by its currency regulator Thursday.  China’s banks sold a net $93.8 billion of foreign exchange to clients in the first six months of 2017, writes ChinaDaily.com, down 46 percent year-on-year.  Economists say the situation may continue to improve in the second half of the year, the article continues.

Threats

The United States is banning its citizens from traveling to North Korea, starting 30 days from July 27th.  The announcement comes in the wake of the tragic imprisonment and death of student Otto Warmbier, North Korea’s recent test launches, and what the Trump administration is branding as disappointing efforts from the Chinese to rein in their rogue East Asian neighbors.
On July 19, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross opened economic talks by “scolding China over its trade surplus,” reports Bloomberg.  China and the U.S. have hit some rough patches since Trump became President and some U.S. firms could be at risk if a trade war breaks out.  Trump has considered restricting imports of Chinese steel and aluminum, a move that could prompt retaliation from Chinese President Xi Jinping, the article continues.
Finally, Canadian singer Justin Bieber will not be invited to perform in Beijing, media reports suggest.  The reason cited, per the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture, is apparently “bad behavior.” 

Emerging Europe
	 

	Strengths

Romania was the best performing country this week, gaining 2.98 percent. Shares of Electrica advanced as much as 7 percent after the company agreed to acquire minority stakes in its subsidiaries from Fondul Proprietatea. This transaction has been long awaited and should benefit both companies, according to Wood & Company research team.
The Hungarian forint was the best performing currency this week, gaining 1.89 percent against the dollar.
The real estate sector was the best performing sector among eastern European markets this week.

Weaknesses

Russia was the worst performing country this week, losing 1.81 percent. Oil prices fell Friday morning on renewed concerns about oversupply. OPEC officials are about to start meetings in Russia this weekend with counterparts from non-OPEC countries that have participated in this year’s output cuts. Delegates are supposed to discuss the possibility of including two previously exempted OPEC members, Nigeria and Libya, into the deal. But traders are becoming skeptical that meetings will produce any significant changes.
The Russian ruble was the worst performing currency this week, losing 58 basis points against the dollar.
The consumer staples sector was the worst performing sector among eastern European markets this week.

Opportunities

Local-currency bonds in Poland and Germany have advanced this month, pushing yields lower in the face of growing concern that the European Central Bank (ECB) will start reducing its monthly bond buying program. Polish and Hungarian bond yields on average are four times higher than those offered in Germany, which is attractive to investors still looking for a good carry trade.

Kepler Cheuvreux wrote in European Investment Notes that last week marked the beginning of our “late show.” The note stated that this is the summer rally in equities markets that promises to be the last of the series that began early last year. From here the company sees a 5-10 percent advance for major European indices.
The recent recession in Russia has created a space for a cyclical recovery. Potential growth is still very weak, but prospects for the second half of this year and next year are stronger than many think, according to research by Emerging Europe Economist. Inflation has fallen sharply, easing the pressure on real incomes and consumer spending. Inflation will stay low, allowing the central bank to loosen monetary policy and support the recovery.

Threats

The top three credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s, Fitch and Moody’s all withdrew from Russian domestic ratings, refusing to comply with the registration drawn up in 2014 when they downgraded Russia after the annexation of Crimea, according to Reuters. ACRA, a new Kremlin-backed rating agency promoted by the central bank, and Expert RA are the only agencies able to assess Russian debt. Investors may be skeptical to believe that the domestic-produced ratings would be of the same standards as international ones.
The administration of former U.S. president Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and seized their properties last year in December. Now Moscow threatens to expel U.S. diplomats saying that too many American spies operated in Moscow under diplomatic cover. Despite the seemingly friendly meeting between the Russian president and Donald Trump last week, the US-Russia relationship is delicate.
The European Commission, the EU’s regulatory arm, may impose sanctions on Poland for its judicial overhaul. If Article 7 of the EU treaty is triggered, Poland could lose its voting rights in the 28-nation bloc. This dispute with the European Commission over breaking the rule of law may deepen and political noise may put pressure on equities. The Warsaw stock exchange is one of the best performing emerging Europe markets, gaining 21 percent year to date.

“Mother of All Bubbles” Keeps Gold in Focus
July 21, 2017

 
By Frank Holmes
CEO and Chief Investment Officer
		U.S. Global Investors

Today I want to discuss reports that global debt levels are at all-time highs, and what this means for your investment decisions going forward.
But first, a few comments about this past week. I recently returned from the Oxford Club’s Private Wealth Seminar, held at the historic Grand Hotel on Michigan’s Mackinac Island. The hotel, which some of you might remember as the setting for the 1980 film “Somewhere in Time,” starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, took a mere 93 days to build in the 1880s—impossible by today’s standards, especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at 660 feet.
While there, I had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts, including Alex Green, the Oxford Club’s chief investment strategist. You might have read some of his wonderful work for Investment U, the group’s educational arm.
Alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between Democrats and Republicans, in his view, is that Democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions, while Republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions.
I prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics, but Alex has a point. I’m convinced that Donald Trump, a Republican, won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both white-collar and blue-collar Americans who felt as if the U.S. economy was no longer working for them. U.S. corporate taxes are among the highest in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas, and out-of-control regulations threaten to strangle business growth.
But just as Green insinuated, the Trump administration has enacted, or has hinted at enacting, policies that rankle Americans of all political stripes, precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties.
Take Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals. (The operative word here is “suspected.”) Many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials. It could, in fact, violate the Fourth Amendment, which of course protects Americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures.”
This is just one among numerous policy-making decisions that have members of both political parties, as well as independents, scratching their heads. Trump was elected to reform taxes, slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly. It’s unclear how private-asset seizures fit into that picture.
If this administration resolved to stay on message and on course, and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday Americans, it might receive greater support from those who voted for Trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t.
U.S. Dollar in Bear Market, a Boon for Gold
Since the start of the year, the five-year Treasury yield, adjusted for inflation, has risen about 150 percent. Normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period, the U.S. dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market. Because gold is priced in dollars, this has been supportive for prices. Year-to-date, the yellow metal is up more than 8 percent.

As I said, the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far, but it slumped to a 13-month low against the euro this week following European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the European Union (EU) until at least the end of the year.









“We need to be persistent and patient and prudent, because we’re not there yet,” Draghi said, referring to the fact that EU inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow, despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis. (Indeed, the June purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging European markets were all above the key 50 mark for the first time in recent memory.)
UBS: We’re Still Constructive on Gold
That gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates, despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging.”
That’s one of the key takeaways from a UBS note this week, in which the Swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal. Investor demand this year has been slower than expected, but UBS analyst Joni Teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in India this summer could help push consumption in the world’s second-largest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year. With India having imported a phenomenal 525 metric tons in the first half of 2017 alone, Teves writes that “we expect gold demand in India this year to be around historic averages,” which would be very supportive for prices.
ETPs Attracted a Record $245 Billion in the First Half of 2017
Exchange-traded products (ETPs) also had a knockout first half. As Deutsche Bank reports this week, ETPs attracted a record $245 billion in the first six months of 2017, in what has historically been the weaker half of the year. To put into perspective just how impressive this figure is, $245 billion would be the second-largest full-year record amount following 2016’s $283 billion. We could see ETP inflows climb as high as $500 billion by the end of this year, Deutsche estimates.

click to enlarge
Of course, runaway demand for ETPs and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold.
Having said that, though, BullionVault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported last week that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record 38 metric tons, as of the beginning of July. That’s enough gold to make more than 10 million 18-carat wedding rings, BullionVault says, or to supply the microchips for 1.5 billion iPhones. The site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices, following three months of “light liquidation.”
Global Debt on Alert
All of what I’ve said so far pertains to the near-term. Gold’s medium- to long-term investment case, I believe, looks even brighter. Many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven.”
According to the highly-respected Institute of International Finance (IIF), global debt levels reached an astronomical $217 trillion in the first quarter of 2017—that’s 327 percent of world gross domestic product (GDP). Notice that before the financial crisis, global debt was “only” around $150 trillion, meaning we’ve added close to $120 trillion in as little as a decade. Much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets, specifically China, which is spending big on international infrastructure projects.

click to enlarge
It goes without saying that this is a huge risk. Some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles,” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended, in 2000 (the tech or dotcom bubble) and 2007 (the housing bubble).
Paying down this debt will not be easy. As Scotiabank mentions in a note this week: “Higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier, and as more money goes into servicing the debt, it means less money is available to spend on other things, which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity.”
Add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise, with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies. In May, the World Economic Forum (WEF) estimated that by 2050, the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions, in other words—could be as much as $400 trillion, an unimaginably large number.
The U.S. alone adds about $3 trillion every year to the pension deficit. I shared with you earlier in the month that the State of Illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as $250 billion, putting each Illinoisan on the hook for $56,000.
Central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success, nor can they continue forever. Plus, near-zero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place.
You can probably tell where I’m headed with all of this. Another crisis could be in the works. Savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction.
Gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times, and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen, according to Seabridge Gold. I always recommend a 10 percent weighting in gold—5 percent in bars and coins; 5 percent in gold stocks, mutual funds or ETFs.

Index Summary

The major market indices finished mixed this week.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.27 percent. The S&P 500 Stock Index rose 0.54 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.19 percent. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index gained 0.49 percent this week.


The Hang Seng Composite gained 1.20 percent this week; while Taiwan was down 0.07 percent and the KOSPI rose 1.47 percent.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell 10 basis points to 2.24 percent.

Domestic Equity Market

click to enlarge
Strengths

The utility sector was the best performing sector of the week, increasing by 2.59 percent versus an overall increase of 0.54 percent for the S&P 500.
Vertex Pharmaceuticals was the best performing stock for the week, rising 24.5 percent.
The pharmaceutical company reported positive data from its Phase1 and Phase 2 trials for cystic fibrosis patients.  The results are clear and compelling with one analyst calling it, “breakthrough – quality.”  Cowen increased its price target from $105 to $200.

Weaknesses

The industrial sector was the worst performing sector of the week, declining 1.01 percent versus an overall increase of 0.54 percent for the S&P 500.
Chipotle was the worst performing stock for the week, declining 12.76 percent.
Chipotle’s shares were once the best performing of the fast casual restaurant industry, but as with food, stock prices can spoil too. The company’s shares slid to a new 52-week low on broker downgrades due to concerns over a norovirus outbreak at one of the Virginia locations, along with another detrimental video about rodents living in the ceiling at another location.

Opportunities

Where is the inflation?  According to Blackrock’s strategists, “technological innovation is disrupting traditional business models putting a lid on inflation.” The longer that inflation seems to be a non-event, the better the chances are the Fed keeps interest rates low.
Your company’s 401k match may be getting bigger.  Company matches are on pace to become 4.7 percent of an employee’s salary this year, up from 3.7 percent last year.  The reason behind the increase? The labor force continues to stay tight. If this trend continues, and more companies start competing on benefits, the stream of capital flowing into the markets from 401ks may become substantial.
Historically, shipping volumes were used as an indication of economic growth. More products shipped implied companies were “moving product.”  More products sold, meant more capital changing hands (which, in the future, should eventually show up in GDP reports).  Earlier this week The Wall Street Journal highlighted the volume of cargo imports are currently at record monthly levels.

Threats

Labor participation in the workforce for men age 25 to 54 is lower than it was during the Great Depression.  According to a recent working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research, video games are responsible for reducing the amount of work the younger generations of men perform over the year by nearly 30 hours. The big concern here is the growth of this behavior, and whether or not the distraction will impact workforce’s overall productivity.
Is a recession in the midst? Historically, when the difference between the interest rate on a 10-year Treasury note and the interest rate on a 3-month Treasury bill resulted in a negative yield, an economic recession follows.  Although we are not at that critical point yet, the spread between the 10-year Treasury has been narrowing over the past few years. If the Fed continues to tighten, it’s possible the curve may become inverted (the T-Bill yielding more than the 10-year yield) in the next few years (implying a recession could be in the cards).
Another indicator for an impending recession is a labor market at full strength.  Currently, the U.S. has one of the lowest unemployment rates in history.  Another indicator: frothy asset prices.  Right now, the stock market is at all-time highs.  And then there is central bank tightening. The Federal Reserve has tightened three times and other global central banks are discussing tightening too. Lastly, a pervasive sense of calm is an indicator. Many are saying, “don’t worry, the market always comes back,” while the volatility index is near all-time lows.

	Strengths

U.S. housing starts rebounded last month, signaling positive momentum for home builders trying to meet solid buyer demand. Housing starts rose 8.3 percent in June from the prior month to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.215 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.

The number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment benefits fell last week, reflecting the healthiest job market in more than a decade. Initial jobless claims in the period from July 9 to July 15 fell by 15,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 233,000.
The major U.S. stock indices closed at record highs on Wednesday helped partly by technology. The technology sector broke its previous closing high that held since March 2000. It had been the best- performing sector this year with a 22.8 percent advance.

Weaknesses

German investor confidence dropped for a second month in July, according to the ZEW Center for European Economic Research. Its index of expectations, which aims to predict economic developments six months ahead, slid to 17.5 from 18.6 in June. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a decline to 18. Germany is entering a period of uncertainty as it heads toward September elections and the European Central Bank starts discussing when it might wind down euro-area monetary stimulus.
Sentiment among American homebuilders deteriorated to an eight-month low in July on concerns about higher material costs, according to data from the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo. Builders’ Housing Market Index decreased to 64 (estimate 67) from 66 in June (revised from 67). The six-month sales outlook dropped to a five-month low of 73 from 75. The index of current sales fell to 70, the weakest since November, from 72.
Home property prices in Beijing fell 0.4 percent month-over-month, the first decline in more than two years, while Shanghai further declined and Shenzen stalled, pointing to significant cooling in China’s biggest real estate markets.

Opportunities

Traders in the Treasury futures market are growing more convinced that U.S. yields will be lower for longer, no matter what the Federal Reserve says. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield tumbled five basis points to 2.26 percent on Tuesday, touching the lowest level since June 29. The view gained traction Tuesday after Senate Republicans failed to muster enough support for health-care reform, casting doubt on whether President Trump will have better luck with fiscal stimulus. This is coupled with another round of below-forecast inflation data last week that has traders questioning whether the U.S. economic outlook is strong enough for the Fed to raise its benchmark rate again this year, as policy makers forecast.
U.S. real GDP increased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2017, and Bloomberg analysts predict annual GDP of 2.6 percent in the second quarter. Second quarter GDP data will be released next week, on July 28.
As expected, ECB policy was left unchanged. Draghi reiterated pledges to increase volume or the duration of the quantitative easing program if the outlook in Europe worsens. He did not discuss tapering at his time, but said that it could be discussed later in the fall. The euro appreciated against the dollar, breaking out to a fresh 23-month high.

Threats

The U.K. housing market will cool this year as uncertainty around Brexit hits the economy, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Home-price inflation will slow to 3.7 percent from 7 percent in 2016, and London will be the most severely impacted, PwC said in a report published Tuesday. The changes reflect the wider economic picture as inflation and Brexit take their toll on consumer spending and investment.
High-level economic talks between the U.S. and China ended Wednesday without any concrete agreement or future agenda, leaving the Trump administration’s efforts to recast trade ties with Beijing in limbo. The failure to take specific steps to close America’s $347 billion trade deficit with China—70 percent of the U.S. global imbalance—raises pressure on the Trump administration to consider shifting from its embrace of cooperation with Beijing toward more confrontation.
According to Bloomberg Intelligence, a rapidly increasing number of company executives are discussing artificial intelligence during earnings calls and investor presentations, which could be a precursor for labor-disruptive technologies not only in manufacturing but also across the service sector. With the U.S. now arguably at, or very close to, full employment, wages should rise more steadily, which in turn will increase labor costs. This, combined with technological advances over the past decade, may cause automated systems to look far more attractive.

Gold Market
	 

	This week spot gold closed at $1,254.81, up $26.11 per ounce, or 2.13 percent. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week higher by 2.56 percent. Junior-tiered stocks underperformed seniors for the week, as the S&P/TSX Venture Index rose just 0.45 percent. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar Index was crushed lower this week by 1.27 percent.

Strengths

The best performing precious metal for the week was silver, up 3.34 percent as investors loaded up on ETFs that purchase the physical metal, perhaps speculating that silver would outperform gold if the latter rallied.  Gold traders and analysts remained bullish this week, for the fifth week, as the European Central Bank keeps its stimulus going, reports Bloomberg. In addition, as the dollar slumps amid an investigation into President Trump, gold heads for the first back-to-back weekly advance since early June, another Bloomberg article reads.
Gold bulls are keeping their faith in the metal, reports Bloomberg, as the equity rally pares the yellow metal’s gains. Gold bulls have pointed to slow inflation and Fed concerns that asset prices look “somewhat rich.” Similarly, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey shows fund managers are growing hesitant to buy U.S. equities. Jason Mayer of Sprott Asset Management says that the non-stop bull market has led to a lot of complacency where managers aren’t hedging. “Once that tide turns, that could prove to be bullish for gold and precious metals,” Mayer said.
After President Trump’s economic revitalization agenda once again faltered, the U.S. dollar fell to an 11-month low this week, reports Bloomberg. Opposition to Trump’s health-care reform bill, along with European shares dropping amid earnings disappointments, sent gold to its highest level this month.

Weaknesses

The only negatively performing precious metal for the week was palladium, off 1.62 percent.  Hedge funds and money managers seem to be losing their faith in gold, along with other precious metals, reports Bloomberg. Before posting its first weekly gain in six weeks, the net-long position in gold fell to the lowest in 17 months for the week ended July 11. Money managers are hitting the exit as they brace for monetary tightening in the U.S. and Western Europe, the article continues, and aren’t waiting around for signs that the Fed may change its rate trajectory.
U.K. Royal Mint sales dropped in the second quarter by 62 percent compared with the previous three months, reports Bloomberg. Sales are down 41 percent from a year earlier. And according to data on the Swiss Federal Customs Administration’s website, Swiss gold exports declined 169.5 tons in May. Month-over-month exports to India also fell, but exports to China and Hong Kong both rose.
Jaguar Mining previously had seen its 2017 gold production output at 100,000 ounces, but the company cut its forecast to 95,000-105,000 ounces, reports Bloomberg. Positive news, however, came after its decision to leave Turmalina at Level 9 and commence development and mining of Level 10 in Orebody A. Turmalina saw significantly stronger production in June versus April following this decision, the article continues.

Opportunities

Scotia Mining Sales notes that as silver has gotten cheap again, particularly when looking at the widening gold-silver ratio, investors have been piling into silver ETFs (while dropping out of gold ETFs). Interestingly enough, there seems to be a bearish outlook in the futures market, where hedge funds are now holding the first net short silver position seen in two years, the group writes. The risk of higher U.S. interest rates should drive silver prices lower, is the reasoning behind this. However, if the Fed “blinks” and silver prices rebound, they will rebound quickly and violently, Scotia continues.

Klondex Mines reported record, second-quarter operating results for its Nevada and Canadian operations this week, producing 66,629 gold equivalent ounces (GEOs), an increase of 94 percent from the first quarter. In the press release, the company also stated that it remains on track to meet its annual production guidance of 210,000 to 225,000 GEOs, up 36 percent from 2016. “As expected, the operating results for the second quarter were the best in the company’s history,” President and CEO Paul Huet said.
Roxgold Inc. announced an updated mineral resource estimate (MRE) and complete drilling results from its first half Infill and Extension drilling program at the Bagassi South deposit. The Bagassi South deposit is located less than two kilometers from Roxgold’s flagship underground gold mine at the 55 Zone. According to a press release, highlights of the estimate are as follows: 1) Indicated MRE of 352,000 tonnes at 16.6 grams of gold per tonne (g/t Au) for 188,000 ounces and 2) Inferred MRE of 130,000 tonnes at 16.6 g/t Au for approximately 69,000 ounces of gold. In other company news, Columbus Gold Corp. announced its intention to spin out its mineral projects in the U.S. into a separate publicly traded company to be named Allegiant Gold Ltd. The plan of arrangement would see shareholders of Columbus receive one share of Allegiant for every five shares of Columbus. This should unlock the value for their North American assets.

Threats

As Global Mining Research points out in a note this week, over the last few years there have been a number of companies that haven’t mined to their Life of Mine (LOM) plans. In particular, stripping requirements haven’t been met. One of the most well-known examples of this recently is Detour Gold, the research group points out, but clarifies that it certainly not the only one. Deferring the waste removal puts the company at risk for greater waste removal requirements in the future, which is obviously not a source of revenue.
Due to Goldcorp’s failure to properly consult with affected indigenous peoples on its proposed Coffee Gold project, the Yukon Socio-Economic Assessment Board decided to stop its assessment of the project, reports Seeking Alpha. This means the project’s timeline could be in jeopardy, along with costs associated with the project. This decision points to deeper troubles at Goldcorp in relation to the company’s Canadian operations, the article continues.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller is taking a wide-angle approach to his probe regarding President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia in last year’s election. He is now looking into other Trump business transactions, despite the President’s caution not to do so. “The roots of Mueller’s follow-the-money investigation lie in a wide-ranging money laundering probe launched by then-Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara last year,” the Bloomberg article reads.


Energy and Natural Resources Market
	 

	Strengths

Thermal coal was the best performing commodity this week, rising 3.8 percent. The move came after unconfirmed reports stated that Andrew Wheeler, a top coal industry lobbyist, is likely to be named number two official at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The best performing sector this week was the Bloomberg Global Coal Producers Index. The index rose 5.4 percent on the back of strong Chinese steel mill demand reflected in record steel output for the month of June, followed by positive momentum in coal prices triggered by the potential for a top coal lobbyist to join the high ranks of the EPA.
Braskem SA, a major Brazilian petrochemical refiner, was the best performing stock this week finishing up 9.2 percent. The company rallied after Morgan Stanley raised its recommendation to overweight citing widening margins on the back of a weaker Brazilian real, strong free cash flow generation, as well as a valuation that trails its petrochemical peers.  

Weaknesses

Lumber was the worst performing commodity this week dropping 4.0 percent. The commodity was the best performer the previous week after a severe wildfire threatened sawmills operations in British Columbia, Canada. This week, tempered U.S. housing data weighed on the commodity in spite of continuing risks of greater wildfires on the Canadian west coast.
The worst performing sector this week was the FTSE 350 Mining Index. The index fell 1.6 percent on the back of a single stock, Acacia Mining which dropped 19.3 percent. The company discontinued its dividend and lowered guidance as a result of a spat with the Tanzanian government that resulted in a ban on exports of its gold and copper concentrates.
The worst performing stock for the week was GAMESA. The Spanish renewable energy supplier dropped 5.8 percent after announcing it will shut down its Tillsonfurg, Ontario factory as a result of weaker-than-expected wind mill demand in North American markets.

Opportunities

Gold rallied above its 50-, and 100-day moving averages this week, setting up for what could prove to be a strong technical move to $1,300 as the U.S. dollar continues to weaken. In fact, when looked at in the context of the weak U.S. dollar, gold fares even better; the chart below shows the tight inverse correlation between gold and the U.S. dollar, which going by the chart, suggests gold could move as high as $1,350 an ounce.

China's economy expanded 6.9 percent in the second quarter, significantly ahead of the government’s target of 6.7 percent. With two consecutive quarters of 6.9 percent growth, China’s GDP is on track for its first year-on-year growth acceleration since 2010.
Property investment was one of the key drivers behind China’s strong GDP beat, providing a positive read-through for steel and industrial metals demand. Property investment grew 8.5 percent year-on-year, showing a marked acceleration from the previous growth rates of 6.9 percent.

Threats

OPEC July output is set to exceed 33 million barrels per day (bpd), according to tanker tracking data. If sustained until month-end, the volumes would represent a sizeable increase over the 32.4 million bpd average for the first half of the year.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) suggests U.S. shale output is likely to increase by greater than 100 thousand bpd next month, according to its recent drilling productivity report. The increase in volumes is expected to drive total U.S. shale output to 5.59 million bpd, the highest level in all of 2017. These improvements, together with OPEC output reaching its highest of the year threaten to derail the nascent recovery in oil prices.>
China reported record amounts of steel and aluminum production in June. Reports out of Beijing suggest mills around the country rapidly increased output to profit from rallying commodity prices into quarter-end. The rapid output growth suggests China has been unable to meet its promise of cracking down on marginal mills to help rebalance the global steel market. Markets reacted negatively to the news fearing that China, the world’s top steel exporter, may resort to dumping to alleviate its oversupply.

China Region
	 

	Strengths

South Korea’s Korea Stock Exchange Index (KOSPI) finished the week up 1.47 percent, beating out Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Composite Index (HSCI) and the Philippines’ PCOMP Index by 10 and 15 basis points, respectively.
Information technology finished the week as the top sector in the HSCI.  Tech rose 4.16 percent in the last five trading days despite a few hiccups late in the week for some of the most recent dominant performers.
China’s second quarter GDP growth rate came in at a steady 6.9 percent, ahead of consensus estimates for a 6.8 percent growth rate and even with the first quarter’s 6.9 percent print.  Retail sales, fixed asset investment, and industrial production also came in ahead of estimates for China this week.

Weaknesses

Consumer services constituted the worst performing sector in the HSCI for the week, falling 81 basis points and making the sector the only one to finish the week in the red.
Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh Stock Index dropped 1.79 percent in the last week, while Indonesia’s Jakarta Composite (JCI) Index declined 1.14 percent.
Both imports and exports missed in Indonesia for the June period.  Imports came in down 17.21 percent year-over-year, shy of expectations for a 9.25 percent increase and down from the prior period’s 24.03 percent, while exports fell 11.82 percent, missing estimates for a gain of 7.28 percent and the prior month’s pace of 24.08 percent growth.

Opportunities

A combination of a growing population in Asian urban areas together with more efficient transport systems will give a rising number of people greater access to more airports. The chart below shows urbanization rates in key Asian countries growing, which is likely to boost Asia’s long-term air travel demand growth.

According to a plan issued by the State Council, “China aims to make the artificial intelligence industry a ‘new, important’ driver of economic expansion by 2020,” reports Bloomberg.  Late Thursday, policy makers on the cabinet announced that they want to be global leaders in the space, with the AI industry generating more than 400 billion yuan of output per year by 2025.
China is facing less pressure from capital outflows, according to data released by its currency regulator Thursday.  China’s banks sold a net $93.8 billion of foreign exchange to clients in the first six months of 2017, writes ChinaDaily.com, down 46 percent year-on-year.  Economists say the situation may continue to improve in the second half of the year, the article continues.

Threats

The United States is banning its citizens from traveling to North Korea, starting 30 days from July 27th.  The announcement comes in the wake of the tragic imprisonment and death of student Otto Warmbier, North Korea’s recent test launches, and what the Trump administration is branding as disappointing efforts from the Chinese to rein in their rogue East Asian neighbors.
On July 19, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross opened economic talks by “scolding China over its trade surplus,” reports Bloomberg.  China and the U.S. have hit some rough patches since Trump became President and some U.S. firms could be at risk if a trade war breaks out.  Trump has considered restricting imports of Chinese steel and aluminum, a move that could prompt retaliation from Chinese President Xi Jinping, the article continues.
Finally, Canadian singer Justin Bieber will not be invited to perform in Beijing, media reports suggest.  The reason cited, per the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture, is apparently “bad behavior.” 

Emerging Europe
	 

	Strengths

Romania was the best performing country this week, gaining 2.98 percent. Shares of Electrica advanced as much as 7 percent after the company agreed to acquire minority stakes in its subsidiaries from Fondul Proprietatea. This transaction has been long awaited and should benefit both companies, according to Wood & Company research team.
The Hungarian forint was the best performing currency this week, gaining 1.89 percent against the dollar.
The real estate sector was the best performing sector among eastern European markets this week.

Weaknesses

Russia was the worst performing country this week, losing 1.81 percent. Oil prices fell Friday morning on renewed concerns about oversupply. OPEC officials are about to start meetings in Russia this weekend with counterparts from non-OPEC countries that have participated in this year’s output cuts. Delegates are supposed to discuss the possibility of including two previously exempted OPEC members, Nigeria and Libya, into the deal. But traders are becoming skeptical that meetings will produce any significant changes.
The Russian ruble was the worst performing currency this week, losing 58 basis points against the dollar.
The consumer staples sector was the worst performing sector among eastern European markets this week.

Opportunities

Local-currency bonds in Poland and Germany have advanced this month, pushing yields lower in the face of growing concern that the European Central Bank (ECB) will start reducing its monthly bond buying program. Polish and Hungarian bond yields on average are four times higher than those offered in Germany, which is attractive to investors still looking for a good carry trade.

Kepler Cheuvreux wrote in European Investment Notes that last week marked the beginning of our “late show.” The note stated that this is the summer rally in equities markets that promises to be the last of the series that began early last year. From here the company sees a 5-10 percent advance for major European indices.
The recent recession in Russia has created a space for a cyclical recovery. Potential growth is still very weak, but prospects for the second half of this year and next year are stronger than many think, according to research by Emerging Europe Economist. Inflation has fallen sharply, easing the pressure on real incomes and consumer spending. Inflation will stay low, allowing the central bank to loosen monetary policy and support the recovery.

Threats

The top three credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s, Fitch and Moody’s all withdrew from Russian domestic ratings, refusing to comply with the registration drawn up in 2014 when they downgraded Russia after the annexation of Crimea, according to Reuters. ACRA, a new Kremlin-backed rating agency promoted by the central bank, and Expert RA are the only agencies able to assess Russian debt. Investors may be skeptical to believe that the domestic-produced ratings would be of the same standards as international ones.
The administration of former U.S. president Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and seized their properties last year in December. Now Moscow threatens to expel U.S. diplomats saying that too many American spies operated in Moscow under diplomatic cover. Despite the seemingly friendly meeting between the Russian president and Donald Trump last week, the US-Russia relationship is delicate.
The European Commission, the EU’s regulatory arm, may impose sanctions on Poland for its judicial overhaul. If Article 7 of the EU treaty is triggered, Poland could lose its voting rights in the 28-nation bloc. This dispute with the European Commission over breaking the rule of law may deepen and political noise may put pressure on equities. The Warsaw stock exchange is one of the best performing emerging Europe markets, gaining 21 percent year to date.

“Mother of All Bubbles” Keeps Gold in Focus
July 24, 2017

Today I want to discuss reports that global debt levels are at all-time highs, and what this means for your investment decisions going forward.
But first, a few comments about last week. I recently returned from the Oxford Club’s Private Wealth Seminar, held at the historic Grand Hotel on Michigan’s Mackinac Island. The hotel, which some of you might remember as the setting for the 1980 film “Somewhere in Time,” starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, took a mere 93 days to build in the 1880s—impossible by today’s standards, especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at 660 feet.
While there, I had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts, including Alex Green, the Oxford Club’s chief investment strategist. You might have read some of his wonderful work for Investment U, the group’s educational arm.
Alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between Democrats and Republicans, in his view, is that Democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions, while Republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions.
I prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics, but Alex has a point. I’m convinced that Donald Trump, a Republican, won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both white-collar and blue-collar Americans who felt as if the U.S. economy was no longer working for them. U.S. corporate taxes are among the highest in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas, and out-of-control regulations threaten to strangle business growth.
But just as Green insinuated, the Trump administration has enacted, or has hinted at enacting, policies that rankle Americans of all political stripes, precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties.
Take Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals. (The operative word here is “suspected.”) Many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials. It could, in fact, violate the Fourth Amendment, which of course protects Americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures.”
This is just one among numerous policy-making decisions that have members of both political parties, as well as independents, scratching their heads. Trump was elected to reform taxes, slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly. It’s unclear how private-asset seizures fit into that picture.
If this administration resolved to stay on message and on course, and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday Americans, it might receive greater support from those who voted for Trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t.
U.S. Dollar in Bear Market, a Boon for Gold
Since the start of the year, the five-year Treasury yield, adjusted for inflation, has risen about 150 percent. Normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period, the U.S. dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market. Because gold is priced in dollars, this has been supportive for prices. Year-to-date, the yellow metal is up more than 8 percent.

As I said, the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far, but it slumped to a 13-month low against the euro last week following European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the European Union (EU) until at least the end of the year.









“We need to be persistent and patient and prudent, because we’re not there yet,” Draghi said, referring to the fact that EU inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow, despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis. (Indeed, the June purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging European markets were all above the key 50 mark for the first time in recent memory.)
UBS: We’re Still Constructive on Gold
That gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates, despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging.”
That’s one of the key takeaways from a UBS note last week, in which the Swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal. Investor demand this year has been slower than expected, but UBS analyst Joni Teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in India this summer could help push consumption in the world’s second-largest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year. With India having imported a phenomenal 525 metric tons in the first half of 2017 alone, Teves writes that “we expect gold demand in India this year to be around historic averages,” which would be very supportive for prices.
ETPs Attracted a Record $245 Billion in the First Half of 2017
Like gold in India, exchange-traded products (ETPs) also had a knockout first half. As Deutsche Bank reports, ETPs attracted a record $245 billion in the first six months of 2017, in what has historically been the weaker half of the year. To put into perspective just how impressive this figure is, $245 billion would be the second-largest full-year record amount following 2016’s $283 billion. We could see ETP inflows climb as high as $500 billion by the end of this year, Deutsche estimates.

click to enlarge
Of course, runaway demand for ETPs and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold.
Having said that, though, BullionVault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported recently that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record 38 metric tons, as of the beginning of July. That’s enough gold to make more than 10 million 18-carat wedding rings, BullionVault says, or to supply the microchips for 1.5 billion iPhones. The site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices, following three months of “light liquidation.”
Global Debt on Alert
All of what I’ve said so far pertains to the near-term. Gold’s medium- to long-term investment case, I believe, looks even brighter. Many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven.”
According to the highly-respected Institute of International Finance (IIF), global debt levels reached an astronomical $217 trillion in the first quarter of 2017—that’s 327 percent of world gross domestic product (GDP). Notice that before the financial crisis, global debt was “only” around $150 trillion, meaning we’ve added close to $120 trillion in as little as a decade. Much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets, specifically China, which is spending big on international infrastructure projects.

click to enlarge
It goes without saying that this is a huge risk. Some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles,” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended, in 2000 (the tech or dotcom bubble) and 2007 (the housing bubble).
Paying down this debt will not be easy. As Scotiabank mentioned in a note last week: “Higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier, and as more money goes into servicing the debt, it means less money is available to spend on other things, which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity.”
Add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise, with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies. In May, the World Economic Forum (WEF) estimated that by 2050, the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions, in other words—could be as much as $400 trillion, an unimaginably large number.
The U.S. alone adds about $3 trillion every year to the pension deficit. I shared with you earlier in the month that the State of Illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as $250 billion, putting each Illinoisan on the hook for $56,000.
Central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success, nor can they continue forever. Plus, near-zero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place.
You can probably tell where I’m headed with all of this. Another crisis could be in the works. Savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction.
Gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times, and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen, according to Seabridge Gold. I always recommend a 10 percent weighting in gold—5 percent in bars and coins; 5 percent in gold stocks, mutual funds or ETFs.

How to Get a Better Bargain on Your Investment with Emerging Europe
July 20, 2017

American equities have been a good place to invest during the current bull market, now in its eighth year. Since the November election, the S&P 500 Index has surged close to 16 percent. But this means that valuations continue to creep up, and political risk threatens to derail further gains as President Donald Trump’s high-growth agenda stumbles on even more roadblocks.
Investors might therefore be looking for an alternative. I believe one of the most attractive destinations for your investment dollars right now is emerging European countries. Below you can see a valuation comparison between U.S. and emerging European equities. Trading at 9.2 times earnings, the latter are offering quite a bargain for investors seeking a “better bang for the buck.”

click to enlarge
More than that, though, “core” Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries—including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary—are currently among the fastest growing in the world. In a recent series on the region, the Financial Times put it succinctly: “The former communist countries that have joined the European Union (EU) since 2004 offer superior growth to western Europe and many other emerging markets, combined with the benefits and protections of EU membership.”
Expectations for economic growth in CEE countries have changed rapidly and positively. The consensus forecast is now 2.5 percent growth this year, 0.3 percent points higher than expectations near the beginning of the year.
Next year could be even brighter, with analysts expecting 2.6 percent growth, 0.1 percentage point higher than earlier forecasts. Stronger-than-expected external demand in Western Europe, a tighter labor market, an attractive environment for foreign investment, government stimulus measures, easy financing conditions and the revival of EU structural funds are all supporting stronger growth in the region.
Manufacturing Continues to Strengthen
Loyal readers of Frank Talk know that we closely follow the purchasing manager’s index (PMI), which measures the strength of a country’s manufacturing industry. We’ve found it to be not only a handy gauge of future commodities demand but also a country’s or region’s economic growth potential.  
For the first time in recent memory, most emerging European economies’ PMIs are above the key 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Greece rose from 49.6 in May to 50.5 in June, the first time its manufacturing sector was in expansion mode in nearly a year.

click to enlarge
Russia grew at a much slower pace in June, however, with its PMI falling to 50.3, just above the threshold. But as I shared with you this week, Capital Economics analysts believe Russian growth in the coming quarters “will be stronger than most anticipate,” with the Central Bank of Russia loosening monetary policy even further.
The fact that all CEE countries are above 50 points to synchronized growth. It also suggests that the worst of the region’s economic woes following the global recession might finally be in the rearview mirror.
Poland the Next “Economic Powerhouse”?
Writing recently for the New York Times’ opinions section, Ruchier Sharma, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s chief global strategist, singled out Poland as the world’s likeliest next advanced economy, following South Korea’s entry into the high-income club 20 years ago.
I have to agree. As Sharma points out, Poland has seen average annual growth of 4 percent since 1991, the year it transitioned from communism to democracy. During that period, it hasn’t had a single down year, amazingly enough.
The Polish economy continued to grow at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent in the second quarter, as suggested by the May retail sales and industrial output data. According to mBank analysts, fiscal-year growth will slightly exceed 4 percent, driven by public investments recovery and persistently strong consumption. The real retail sales growth in the second quarter held close to the prior-quarter level, which means that consumption growth should remain at around 5 percent, mBank estimates.
Poland’s impressive ascent should only help strengthen other CEE countries, both economically and politically. Its president, Andrzej Duda, seems fully aware of this and has taken several important strides to improve not just Poland’s economy but the region’s as well. The Three Seas Initiative, spearheaded last year by Duda and Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi?, seeks to connect the economies and infrastructure of 12 CEE countries between the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas. A number of EU officials see the Initiative as a threat to the EU bloc’s unity, which might be partially why President Trump agreed to meet with Initiative members when he visited Poland last month.

Stocks on the Rise
Also contributing to CEE growth right now is the steadily weakening U.S. dollar, as Reuters reports. Prague stocks rose to a seven-week high this week, while Hungary’s Budapest Stock Exchange Index (BUX) continues to hit new all-time highs.

click to enlarge
Speaking of Hungary, its government is considering whether to lower personal income taxes to 10 percent from the current 15 percent. This would be a major boost to Hungarians’ disposable income, which is already rising at a breathtaking pace. Wage growth in April was an amazing 14.6 percent.
Again, the CEE region looks more and more like a good place to invest, not least of which because of its attractive discount to American equities.

Russia Collusion Story: A Big “Nothing Burger” or a Case for Gold?
July 17, 2017

Gold got a boost Friday on weaker-than-expected inflation and retail sales figures, casting doubt on the Federal Reserve’s ability to continue normalizing interest rates this year.
Consumer prices rose slightly in June, at their slowest pace so far this year. The consumer price index (CPI), released on Friday, showed the cost of living in America rising only 1.6 percent compared to the same month last year, significantly down from the most recent high of 2.8 percent in February and below the Fed’s target of 2 percent. Much of the decline was due to energy prices, which fell 1.6 percent from May.

click to enlarge
As I’ve explained elsewhere, CPI is an important economic indicator for gold investors to track. The yellow metal has historically responded positively when inflation rises—and especially when it pushes the yield on a government bond into negative territory. Why lock your money up in a 2-year or 5-year Treasury that’s guaranteed to give you a negative yield?









But right now the gold Fear Trade is being supported by what some are calling turmoil in the Trump administration. Last week the Russia collusion story took a new twist, with emails surfacing showing that Donald Trump Jr.; Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and now-senior advisor; and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort all agreed to meet with a Russian lawyer last summer under the pretext that she had dirt on Hillary Clinton.
Whether or not this meeting is “collusion” is not for me to say, but the optics of it certainly look bad, and it threatens to undermine the president’s agenda even more. For the first time last week, an article of impeachment was formally introduced on the House floor that accuses Trump of obstructing justice. The article is unlikely to go very far in the Republican-controlled House, but it adds further uncertainty to Trump’s ability to achieve some of his goals, including tax reform and infrastructure spending. I’ll have more to say on this later
A Contrarian View of China
A new report from CLSA shows that Asian markets and Europe were the top performers during the first six months of the year. Korea took the top spot, surging more than 25 percent, followed closely by China.

click to enlarge
Despite persistent negative “news” about China in the mainstream media, conditions in the world’s second-largest economy are improving. Consumption is up and household income remains strong. The number of high net worth individuals (HNWIs) in China—those with at least 10 million renminbi ($1.5 million) in investable income—rose to 1.6 million last year, about nine times the number only 10 years ago. It’s estimated we could see as many as 1.87 million Chinese HNWIs by the end of 2017.
According to CLSA, global trade is robust, with emerging markets, and particularly China, driving most of the acceleration this year. In the first three months of 2017, global trade grew 4 percent compared to the same period last year, its fastest pace since 2011.
“Indeed the early months of 2017 have seen China become easily the biggest single country driver of Asian trade growth,” writes Eric Fishwick, head of economic research at CLSA.
A lot of this growth can be attributed to Beijing’s monumental One Belt, One Road infrastructure project, which I’ve highlighted many times before. But according to Alexious Lee, CLSA’s head of China industrial research, a “more nationalist America” in the first six months of the year has likely given China more leverage to assume “a larger global, and especially regional, leadership role.”
This comports with what I said back in January, in a Frank Talk titled “China Sets the Stage to Replace the U.S. as Global Trade Leader.” With President Donald Trump having already withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and promising to renegotiate or tear up other trade agreements—he recently tweeted that the U.S. has “made some of the worst Trade Deals in world history”—China has emerged, amazingly, as a champion of free trade, a position of power it will likely continue to capitalize on.
The country’s overseas construction orders have continued to expand, with agreements signed since 2013 valued at more than $600 billion.

Emerging Europe Expected to Remain Strong
Another recent report, this one from Capital Economics, shows that the investment case for emerging Europe remains strong in 2017. Russia is expected to strengthen over the next 12 months, while Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are likely to remain attractive.
“Russia’s economy has pulled out of recession and growth in the coming quarters will be stronger than most anticipate,” the research firm writes, adding that its central bank’s loosening of monetary policy should support the recovery even further.
To be sure, the region faces strong headwinds, including a rapidly aging population and the loss of an estimated 20 million skilled workers to foreign markets over the past 25 years, according to a July 11 presentation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
But I believe that as conditions in central emerging Europe countries continue to improve, many of those workers will be returning home. Life in the region is not the same as it was 10 or 20 years ago, when good jobs might have been scarce. Firms are now growing at a healthy rate and hiring more workers. As you can see below, unemployment rates in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have been falling steadily since at least 2012 and are now lower than the broader European Union.    

click to enlarge
This strength is reflected in emerging Europe’s capital markets. For the 12-month period as of July 12, Hungary’s Budapest Stock Exchange is up 38 percent. Poland’s WIG20 is up more than 43 percent. Meanwhile, the STOXX Europe 600 Index—which includes some of the largest Western European companies—has made gains of only 17 percent over the same period.

Markets Still Believe in Trump
As we all know, the mainstream media’s criticism and ire aren’t reserved for China alone. Ninety-nine percent of the media right now is against President Trump, for a number of reasons—some of them deserved, some of them not.
Markets, however, seem not to care what the media or polls have to say. The Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to hit new all-time highs. Even though it’s stalled a few times, the “Trump rally” appears to be in full-speed-ahead mode, more than eight months after the election.
Back in November, I wrote about one of my favorite books, James Surowiecki’s The Wisdom of Crowds, which argues that large groups of people will nearly always be smarter and better at making predictions than an “elite” few. Surowiecki’s ideas were vindicated last year when investors accurately predicted Trump’s election, with markets turning negative between July 31 and October 31.
For the same reason, I think it’s important we pay close attention to what markets are forecasting today.
The White House is under siege on multiple fronts, which, as I said, has been positive for gold’s Fear Trade. But equity investors also seem to like the direction Trump is taking, whether it’s pushing for tax reform and deregulation or shaking up the “beltway party,” composed of deeply entrenched D.C. lobbyists and career bureaucrats. Just last week, the president made waves for firing a number of bureaucrats at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), long plagued by scandal and controversy. Since he took office in January, Trump has told more than 500 VA workers “You’re fired!”   
The Fundamentals of “Quantamental”
Of course, we look at so much more than government policy when making investment decisions. We take a blended approach of not only assessing fundamentals such as market share and returns on capital but also conducting quantitative analysis.
It’s this combination that some in the industry are calling “quantamental” investing. At first glance, “quantamental” might sound like nothing more than cute wordplay—not unlike “labsky,” “bullmation” and other clever names we give mixed-breed dogs—but it’s rapidly replacing traditional investment strategies at the institutional level.
Business Insider puts it in simple terms: “Quantamental managers combine the bottom-up stock-picking skills of fundamental investors with the use of computing power and big-data sets to test their hypotheses.”
See my Vancouver Investment Conference presentation, “What’s Driving Gold: The Invasion of the Quants,” to learn more about how we use quantitative analysis, machine learning and data mining.
Wall Street: The Birthplace of American Capitalism and Government

The concept of quantamentals helps explain our entry into smart-factor ETFs. As most of you already know, members of my team and I visited the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) three weeks ago to mark the launch of our latest ETF.
While there, Doug Yones, head of exchange-traded products at the NYSE, gave us a short history lesson about the exchange and surrounding area.
Most investors are aware that the NYSE, which is celebrating its 225th anniversary this year, is the epicenter of capitalism—not just in the U.S. but also globally.

What many people might not realize is that on the site where the exchange now stands, Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. treasury secretary, floated bonds to replace the debt the nascent country had incurred during the Revolutionary War.
Right next door to the NYSE is Federal Hall, where George Washington took his first oath of office in April 1789. The building today serves as a museum and memorial to the first U.S. president, whose statue now looks out over Wall Street and its passersby.
In this one single block of Wall Street, therefore, American capitalism and government were born. Here you can find the essential DNA of the American experiment, which, over the many years, has fostered our entrepreneurial spirit to form capital and to create new businesses and jobs. Growth, innovation and competition run through our veins, and that’s largely because of the events that unfolded centuries ago at the NYSE and Federal Hall.

Commodities Halftime Report: Separating the Wheat from the Chaff
July 10, 2017

Of the 14 commodities we track closely at U.S. Global Investors, wheat rose to take the top spot for the first half of 2017, returning more than 25 percent. The grain was followed closely by palladium—used primarily in the production of catalytic converters—which gained 24 percent.

click to enlarge
To view our ever-popular, interactive Periodic Table of Commodity Returns, click here.
Between the start of the year and June 30, the Bloomberg Commodity Index contracted 4.03 percent, with energy weighing down on the mostly strong performances of precious and industrial metals and agriculturals.
Contributing to metals’ gains was U.S. dollar weakness. During the first six months, the greenback lost 7.54 percent, responding partially to President Donald Trump’s comment in April that the dollar was “getting too strong.”
More recently, the president tweeted his thoughts on gas prices, which he pointed out were “the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years” for the July Fourth holiday. “I would like to see them go even lower,” he added.
Trump Goes to Warsaw
Speaking of Trump, I feel as if he has represented the U.S. and its values admirably during his visit to Europe last week. His speech in Warsaw sought to strengthen ties between America and Poland, which the New York Times just named the “next economic powerhouse.”

Trump drew attention to a danger that’s “invisible” yet every bit as dangerous as terrorism and extremism—namely, “the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people.”
The U.S. and Poland “became great not because of paperwork and regulations,” the president said, “but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies.”
This is the Trump I believe voters elected last November. If he were only able to stay on message and give his Twitter account a rest, he might more easily help engender and inspire an environment that better reflects the vision he described to his Polish audience.
I’m also encouraged by his first one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. From what I’ve read, it sounds as if the two leaders managed to make some progress on Syria, with both sides agreeing to cooperate in maintaining “safe zones.”
Oil Embroiled
Regarding lower gas prices, Trump just might get his wish. Having fallen 14.30 percent in the first six months, oil is currently underperforming its price action of the past four years.

click to enlarge
Much of the thanks for oil’s slump goes to U.S. shale producers, which were quick to reactivate dormant rigs following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) December announcement that it would be cutting production. As a result, the market is awash in black gold. In May, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that domestic output should average 9.3 million barrels a day this year and nearly 10 million in 2018, a level unseen in the U.S. since 1970.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) popped above $47 a barrel last week, however, on news that oil and gas inventories in the U.S. dropped sharply the previous week. What’s more, the number of active North American oil rigs fell by two in the week ended June 30, from 758 to 756 rigs, the first such contraction since January, according to the Baker Hughes Rig Count.
Although constructive, there’s still quite a bit of terrain to cover before oil reaches the low- to mid-$50s we saw at the start of the year.
Where’s the Wheat?
As I told you back in May, the U.S. reclaimed its longstanding title as the world’s number one wheat exporter this year, displacing Russia, whose weak currency gave the Eastern European country a competitive advantage.
We might soon slip to second place yet again, for two primary reasons: 1) low U.S. wheat plantings and 2) severe droughts and unexpectedly hot weather conditions in the Northern Plains.
According to a March report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), American farmers just aren’t planting wheat like they used to. Not only are we seeing shrinkage in the acreage devoted to the amber grain—more and more farmers are switching to soybeans—but wheat seedings are down for a second straight year. The USDA, in fact, estimates them to be at their lowest level ever since records began nearly 100 years ago in 1919.
As to the second point, severe to extreme hot and dry weather conditions in the Northern Plains—specifically in areas of Montana and the Dakotas—are putting wheat (and corn) on the defensive. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, parts of Montana just experienced their driest May and June in 99 years and the driest January through June since 1983. Last week alone, temperatures in the region surged into the 90s and 100s, about 15 to 20 degrees above the norm. These conditions are expected to persist for several more weeks.

click to enlarge
Supply constraints have pushed the grain up 25 percent so far this year to a nearly two-year high. A bushel now costs a little over $5, but some analysts see it rising above $6 and $7.
Precious Metals Continue to Shine
Also benefiting from limited supply is silver, which climbed nearly 4.5 percent as of June 30. The Silver Institute reported in May that global silver mine production in 2016 declined for the first time in 14 years on lower-than-expected output from lead, zinc and gold projects. World supply decreased 0.6 percent year-over-year, or about 32.6 million ounces.
Meanwhile, silver’s use in solar photovoltaic (PV) cells hit a new record high last year, further boosting demand. As I shared with you in May, solar ranked as the number one source of new electric generating capacity in the U.S. in 2016, followed by natural gas and wind.
In the first half of 2017, palladium, the silvery-white metal used in the production of catalytic converters, has surged to a 16-year high on speculative demand.

At first blush, this trade might seem counterintuitive. After all, gas-powered vehicles, which use catalytic converters to control emissions, are expected to be surpassed in sales by electric vehicles, which do not require palladium, as early as 2040. Volvo just announced that it would completely phase out gas-only vehicles by 2019. Meanwhile, Tesla’s first mass-market battery electric vehicle (BEV) finally hit production last week.
Driving palladium’s rally this year, though, are bets that European car buyers will soon be switching from diesel-burning to gas-burning cars because of emissions concerns.









Palladium—one of the rarest elements on earth and mined almost exclusively in Russia and South Africa—is the smallest precious metals market, making its prices particularly vulnerable to such speculative trading. It’s achieved near-price parity with its sister metal, platinum, for the first time in two decades.  
On the other end of the spectrum is gold, whose market is larger than many major global stock and bond markets. Those include U.K. gilts, German bunds, the FTSE 100 Index, the Hang Seng Index and others.
Up 7.75 percent in the first six months, gold was supported largely by strong demand in India as consumers made their purchases ahead of the government’s Goods and Services Tax (GST), in effect since July 1, which levies a 3 percent tax on gold.
The impact of the country’s demonetization in December is also still being felt, with Indians’ confidence in fiat currencies tested. I believe Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheme to combat black money and public corruption, while admirable, has only reinforced Indians’ faith in the yellow metal as a store of value.
With consumer prices in the U.S. possibly set to begin rising on President Trump’s more protectionist policies—once he can get them enacted—gold priced in dollars could also be headed higher.
The Road Ahead
There’s a lot we’ll be keeping our eyes on in the second half of the year. For one, look to India’s upcoming Diwali holiday and fourth-quarter wedding season, during which gold gift-giving is considered auspicious.
Earlier in the year, I was excited about Trump’s ambitious infrastructure agenda, which would have greatly boosted domestic demand for base metals and energy. But with the Senate still locked in negotiations over what to do about Obamacare, an infrastructure deal looks as if it’s months if not years away.
Finally, I think with Tesla firing up its Nevada-based Gigafactory, investors would be prudent to keep their eyes on aluminum, cobalt, nickel and especially copper, as electric vehicles use around three times as much of the red metal as conventional vehicles. Lithium, which I featured back in March, is also expected to be a beneficiary of the move to BEVs.

Investor Beware! What Does the Illinois Budget Crisis Mean for Your Bond Fund?
July 6, 2017

A recent Capital Economics (CE) report shines an unforgiving light on Illinois’ ongoing budget woes—and what it finds isn’t pretty. The crisis, which has affected every level of government in the state, is a cautionary tale for not only public spending run amok but also independent investors taking too large of a risk by seeking high yields.
The Land of Lincoln’s credit is already the lowest-rated in the union and, until recently, its debt came precariously close to being downgraded to “junk.” Were this to happen, it would become the first state ever to receive such an ignoble rating.
The state’s 10-year bond yield has soared in recent months, which might attract certain unwary speculators. It’s our belief, however, that such debt should generally be avoided, as the risks are especially high.

click to enlarge
As I write this, a state budget could possibly be successfully negotiated, making it the first time in over two years that Illinois has operated with a budget. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner already vetoed the first bill that reached his desk, which includes tax hikes, but the veto was immediately overridden by the State Senate and is now headed for the House.
No matter the outcome, the point here is that political dysfunction is unfavorable—to put it lightly—and muni investors should remain cautious.
Illinois isn’t the only state facing problems. Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wisconsin are all (or were) mired in similar budgetary impasses. New Jersey public beaches reopened just in time for July 4 celebrations after a high-profile government shutdown closed them down.
For many muni investors, navigating around these numerous pitfalls might seem overwhelming. That’s why I believe an actively-managed municipal bond fund such as our Near-Term Tax Free Fund (NEARX) could be the solution.
More than 95 percent of NEARX is invested in munis that hold between an A and AAA investment-grade rating as of March 31. What this means is we’ve historically avoided exposure to debt issued by poorly-managed municipalities.
We also like to stay on the short end of the yield curve, especially now that the Federal Reserve has begun a new interest rate cycle. When rates rise, bond prices fall, and short- and intermediate-term munis are less sensitive to rate increases than longer-term munis whose maturities are further out.
To learn more about how rates affect municipal bonds, read our whitepaper.
On the Brink of Bankruptcy
Illinois’ total debt currently stands at about $60 billion, according to Capital Economics, which is above Detroit’s $20 billion bankruptcy in 2013 and just below Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt. The state’s unfunded pensions—for teachers, professors, state employees, judges, emergency personnel and more—could be as high as $250 billion. That puts each Illinoisan on the hook for an estimated $56,000.
Political dysfunction and mismanagement are bad enough, but the state’s adverse demographics make matters even worse.
Illinois is one of only four states whose populations shrank over the past five years, the others being Connecticut, Vermont and West Virginia. CE estimates that over the next decade, the state’s population could grow only 2.2 percent, far below the national average. The number of retirees, meanwhile, could surge 34 percent.

click to enlarge
That means fewer working-age Illinoisans are expected to be counted on to support retirees in the coming years, driving up the amount of unfunded pensions even higher.
So even if the Illinois government can resolve its budget soon, we see this as only a short-term fix. The state has even larger obstacles emerging on the horizon.
Our Solution
Again, this is why I think an actively-managed muni fund like NEARX is an attractive solution. Whereas other muni funds might accumulate Illinois debt based on its high yield, regardless of risk, we generally have stuck to investment-grade munis.
It must be said that if you look at NEARX’s holdings today, you’ll see that Illinois is one of its top issuers. The bonds were purchased at an earlier time, before the state’s budgetary problems really began to worsen. We haven’t accumulated any more since it became clear to us that the risks were too great.
We continue to hold the debt because we’re confident the state’s government can successfully unravel the political gridlock and arrive at a short-term resolution. It’s the state’s long-term demographic risks that investors should especially worry about. Our longest Illinois bonds mature in 2021, and as long as the state doesn’t default in the next four years—which, in our opinion, is highly unlikely—we should get a good return on the bonds based on their yield when they were purchased.

Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Though the Near-Term Tax Free Fund seeks minimal fluctuations in share price, it is subject to the risk that the credit quality of a portfolio holding could decline, as well as risk related to changes in the economic conditions of a state, region or issuer. These risks could cause the fund’s share price to decline. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local taxes and at times the alternative minimum tax. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes.
A bond’s credit quality is determined by private independent rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. Credit quality designations range from high (AAA to AA) to medium (A to BBB) to low (BB, B, CCC, CC to C).
The Near-Term Tax Free Fund invests at least 80 percent of its net assets in investment-grade municipal securities. At the time of purchase for the fund's portfolio, the ratings on the bonds must be one of the four highest ratings by Moody's Investors Services (Aaa, Aa, A, Baa) or Standard & Poor's Corporation (AAA, AA, A, BBB). Credit quality designations range from high (AAA to AA) to medium (A to BBB) to low (BB, B, CCC, CC to C). In the event a bond is rated by more than one of the ratings organizations, the highest rating is shown.

 Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local income taxes, and if applicable, may subject certain investors to the Alternative Minimum Tax as well. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. The tax free funds may be exposed to risks related to a concentration of investments in a particular state or geographic area. These investments present risks resulting from changes in economic conditions of the region or issuer.
Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure, as well as economic and political risk. By investing in a specific geographic region, a regional fund’s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio.
The Emerging Europe Fund invests more than 25% of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil & gas or banking industries. The risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund’s performance more volatile.
Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in a specific industry, the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries.
 Stock markets can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector-related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus.
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating? based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

“Mother of All Bubbles” Keeps Gold in Focus
July 24, 2017

Today I want to discuss reports that global debt levels are at all-time highs, and what this means for your investment decisions going forward.
But first, a few comments about last week. I recently returned from the Oxford Club’s Private Wealth Seminar, held at the historic Grand Hotel on Michigan’s Mackinac Island. The hotel, which some of you might remember as the setting for the 1980 film “Somewhere in Time,” starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, took a mere 93 days to build in the 1880s—impossible by today’s standards, especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at 660 feet.
While there, I had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts, including Alex Green, the Oxford Club’s chief investment strategist. You might have read some of his wonderful work for Investment U, the group’s educational arm.
Alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between Democrats and Republicans, in his view, is that Democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions, while Republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions.
I prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics, but Alex has a point. I’m convinced that Donald Trump, a Republican, won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both white-collar and blue-collar Americans who felt as if the U.S. economy was no longer working for them. U.S. corporate taxes are among the highest in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas, and out-of-control regulations threaten to strangle business growth.
But just as Green insinuated, the Trump administration has enacted, or has hinted at enacting, policies that rankle Americans of all political stripes, precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties.
Take Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals. (The operative word here is “suspected.”) Many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials. It could, in fact, violate the Fourth Amendment, which of course protects Americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures.”
This is just one among numerous policy-making decisions that have members of both political parties, as well as independents, scratching their heads. Trump was elected to reform taxes, slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly. It’s unclear how private-asset seizures fit into that picture.
If this administration resolved to stay on message and on course, and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday Americans, it might receive greater support from those who voted for Trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t.
U.S. Dollar in Bear Market, a Boon for Gold
Since the start of the year, the five-year Treasury yield, adjusted for inflation, has risen about 150 percent. Normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period, the U.S. dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market. Because gold is priced in dollars, this has been supportive for prices. Year-to-date, the yellow metal is up more than 8 percent.

click to enlarge
As I said, the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far, but it slumped to a 13-month low against the euro last week following European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the European Union (EU) until at least the end of the year.









“We need to be persistent and patient and prudent, because we’re not there yet,” Draghi said, referring to the fact that EU inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow, despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis. (Indeed, the June purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging European markets were all above the key 50 mark for the first time in recent memory.)
UBS: We’re Still Constructive on Gold
That gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates, despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging.”
That’s one of the key takeaways from a UBS note last week, in which the Swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal. Investor demand this year has been slower than expected, but UBS analyst Joni Teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in India this summer could help push consumption in the world’s second-largest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year. With India having imported a phenomenal 525 metric tons in the first half of 2017 alone, Teves writes that “we expect gold demand in India this year to be around historic averages,” which would be very supportive for prices.
ETPs Attracted a Record $245 Billion in the First Half of 2017
Like gold in India, exchange-traded products (ETPs) also had a knockout first half. As Deutsche Bank reports, ETPs attracted a record $245 billion in the first six months of 2017, in what has historically been the weaker half of the year. To put into perspective just how impressive this figure is, $245 billion would be the second-largest full-year record amount following 2016’s $283 billion. We could see ETP inflows climb as high as $500 billion by the end of this year, Deutsche estimates.

click to enlarge
Of course, runaway demand for ETPs and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold.
Having said that, though, BullionVault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported recently that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record 38 metric tons, as of the beginning of July. That’s enough gold to make more than 10 million 18-carat wedding rings, BullionVault says, or to supply the microchips for 1.5 billion iPhones. The site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices, following three months of “light liquidation.”
Global Debt on Alert
All of what I’ve said so far pertains to the near-term. Gold’s medium- to long-term investment case, I believe, looks even brighter. Many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven.”
According to the highly-respected Institute of International Finance (IIF), global debt levels reached an astronomical $217 trillion in the first quarter of 2017—that’s 327 percent of world gross domestic product (GDP). Notice that before the financial crisis, global debt was “only” around $150 trillion, meaning we’ve added close to $120 trillion in as little as a decade. Much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets, specifically China, which is spending big on international infrastructure projects.

click to enlarge
It goes without saying that this is a huge risk. Some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles,” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended, in 2000 (the tech or dotcom bubble) and 2007 (the housing bubble).
Paying down this debt will not be easy. As Scotiabank mentioned in a note last week: “Higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier, and as more money goes into servicing the debt, it means less money is available to spend on other things, which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity.”
Add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise, with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies. In May, the World Economic Forum (WEF) estimated that by 2050, the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions, in other words—could be as much as $400 trillion, an unimaginably large number.
The U.S. alone adds about $3 trillion every year to the pension deficit. I shared with you earlier in the month that the State of Illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as $250 billion, putting each Illinoisan on the hook for $56,000.
Central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success, nor can they continue forever. Plus, near-zero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place.
You can probably tell where I’m headed with all of this. Another crisis could be in the works. Savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction.
Gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times, and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen, according to Seabridge Gold. I always recommend a 10 percent weighting in gold—5 percent in bars and coins; 5 percent in gold stocks, mutual funds or ETFs.

How to Get a Better Bargain on Your Investment with Emerging Europe
July 20, 2017

American equities have been a good place to invest during the current bull market, now in its eighth year. Since the November election, the S&P 500 Index has surged close to 16 percent. But this means that valuations continue to creep up, and political risk threatens to derail further gains as President Donald Trump’s high-growth agenda stumbles on even more roadblocks.
Investors might therefore be looking for an alternative. I believe one of the most attractive destinations for your investment dollars right now is emerging European countries. Below you can see a valuation comparison between U.S. and emerging European equities. Trading at 9.2 times earnings, the latter are offering quite a bargain for investors seeking a “better bang for the buck.”

click to enlarge
More than that, though, “core” Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries—including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary—are currently among the fastest growing in the world. In a recent series on the region, the Financial Times put it succinctly: “The former communist countries that have joined the European Union (EU) since 2004 offer superior growth to western Europe and many other emerging markets, combined with the benefits and protections of EU membership.”
Expectations for economic growth in CEE countries have changed rapidly and positively. The consensus forecast is now 2.5 percent growth this year, 0.3 percent points higher than expectations near the beginning of the year.
Next year could be even brighter, with analysts expecting 2.6 percent growth, 0.1 percentage point higher than earlier forecasts. Stronger-than-expected external demand in Western Europe, a tighter labor market, an attractive environment for foreign investment, government stimulus measures, easy financing conditions and the revival of EU structural funds are all supporting stronger growth in the region.
Manufacturing Continues to Strengthen
Loyal readers of Frank Talk know that we closely follow the purchasing manager’s index (PMI), which measures the strength of a country’s manufacturing industry. We’ve found it to be not only a handy gauge of future commodities demand but also a country’s or region’s economic growth potential.  
For the first time in recent memory, most emerging European economies’ PMIs are above the key 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Greece rose from 49.6 in May to 50.5 in June, the first time its manufacturing sector was in expansion mode in nearly a year.

click to enlarge
Russia grew at a much slower pace in June, however, with its PMI falling to 50.3, just above the threshold. But as I shared with you this week, Capital Economics analysts believe Russian growth in the coming quarters “will be stronger than most anticipate,” with the Central Bank of Russia loosening monetary policy even further.
The fact that all CEE countries are above 50 points to synchronized growth. It also suggests that the worst of the region’s economic woes following the global recession might finally be in the rearview mirror.
Poland the Next “Economic Powerhouse”?
Writing recently for the New York Times’ opinions section, Ruchier Sharma, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s chief global strategist, singled out Poland as the world’s likeliest next advanced economy, following South Korea’s entry into the high-income club 20 years ago.
I have to agree. As Sharma points out, Poland has seen average annual growth of 4 percent since 1991, the year it transitioned from communism to democracy. During that period, it hasn’t had a single down year, amazingly enough.
The Polish economy continued to grow at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent in the second quarter, as suggested by the May retail sales and industrial output data. According to mBank analysts, fiscal-year growth will slightly exceed 4 percent, driven by public investments recovery and persistently strong consumption. The real retail sales growth in the second quarter held close to the prior-quarter level, which means that consumption growth should remain at around 5 percent, mBank estimates.
Poland’s impressive ascent should only help strengthen other CEE countries, both economically and politically. Its president, Andrzej Duda, seems fully aware of this and has taken several important strides to improve not just Poland’s economy but the region’s as well. The Three Seas Initiative, spearheaded last year by Duda and Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi?, seeks to connect the economies and infrastructure of 12 CEE countries between the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas. A number of EU officials see the Initiative as a threat to the EU bloc’s unity, which might be partially why President Trump agreed to meet with Initiative members when he visited Poland last month.

Stocks on the Rise
Also contributing to CEE growth right now is the steadily weakening U.S. dollar, as Reuters reports. Prague stocks rose to a seven-week high this week, while Hungary’s Budapest Stock Exchange Index (BUX) continues to hit new all-time highs.

click to enlarge
Speaking of Hungary, its government is considering whether to lower personal income taxes to 10 percent from the current 15 percent. This would be a major boost to Hungarians’ disposable income, which is already rising at a breathtaking pace. Wage growth in April was an amazing 14.6 percent.
Again, the CEE region looks more and more like a good place to invest, not least of which because of its attractive discount to American equities.

Russia Collusion Story: A Big “Nothing Burger” or a Case for Gold?
July 17, 2017

Gold got a boost Friday on weaker-than-expected inflation and retail sales figures, casting doubt on the Federal Reserve’s ability to continue normalizing interest rates this year.
Consumer prices rose slightly in June, at their slowest pace so far this year. The consumer price index (CPI), released on Friday, showed the cost of living in America rising only 1.6 percent compared to the same month last year, significantly down from the most recent high of 2.8 percent in February and below the Fed’s target of 2 percent. Much of the decline was due to energy prices, which fell 1.6 percent from May.

As I’ve explained elsewhere, CPI is an important economic indicator for gold investors to track. The yellow metal has historically responded positively when inflation rises—and especially when it pushes the yield on a government bond into negative territory. Why lock your money up in a 2-year or 5-year Treasury that’s guaranteed to give you a negative yield?









But right now the gold Fear Trade is being supported by what some are calling turmoil in the Trump administration. Last week the Russia collusion story took a new twist, with emails surfacing showing that Donald Trump Jr.; Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and now-senior advisor; and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort all agreed to meet with a Russian lawyer last summer under the pretext that she had dirt on Hillary Clinton.
Whether or not this meeting is “collusion” is not for me to say, but the optics of it certainly look bad, and it threatens to undermine the president’s agenda even more. For the first time last week, an article of impeachment was formally introduced on the House floor that accuses Trump of obstructing justice. The article is unlikely to go very far in the Republican-controlled House, but it adds further uncertainty to Trump’s ability to achieve some of his goals, including tax reform and infrastructure spending. I’ll have more to say on this later
A Contrarian View of China
A new report from CLSA shows that Asian markets and Europe were the top performers during the first six months of the year. Korea took the top spot, surging more than 25 percent, followed closely by China.

Despite persistent negative “news” about China in the mainstream media, conditions in the world’s second-largest economy are improving. Consumption is up and household income remains strong. The number of high net worth individuals (HNWIs) in China—those with at least 10 million renminbi ($1.5 million) in investable income—rose to 1.6 million last year, about nine times the number only 10 years ago. It’s estimated we could see as many as 1.87 million Chinese HNWIs by the end of 2017.
According to CLSA, global trade is robust, with emerging markets, and particularly China, driving most of the acceleration this year. In the first three months of 2017, global trade grew 4 percent compared to the same period last year, its fastest pace since 2011.
“Indeed the early months of 2017 have seen China become easily the biggest single country driver of Asian trade growth,” writes Eric Fishwick, head of economic research at CLSA.
A lot of this growth can be attributed to Beijing’s monumental One Belt, One Road infrastructure project, which I’ve highlighted many times before. But according to Alexious Lee, CLSA’s head of China industrial research, a “more nationalist America” in the first six months of the year has likely given China more leverage to assume “a larger global, and especially regional, leadership role.”
This comports with what I said back in January, in a Frank Talk titled “China Sets the Stage to Replace the U.S. as Global Trade Leader.” With President Donald Trump having already withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and promising to renegotiate or tear up other trade agreements—he recently tweeted that the U.S. has “made some of the worst Trade Deals in world history”—China has emerged, amazingly, as a champion of free trade, a position of power it will likely continue to capitalize on.
The country’s overseas construction orders have continued to expand, with agreements signed since 2013 valued at more than $600 billion.

Emerging Europe Expected to Remain Strong
Another recent report, this one from Capital Economics, shows that the investment case for emerging Europe remains strong in 2017. Russia is expected to strengthen over the next 12 months, while Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are likely to remain attractive.
“Russia’s economy has pulled out of recession and growth in the coming quarters will be stronger than most anticipate,” the research firm writes, adding that its central bank’s loosening of monetary policy should support the recovery even further.
To be sure, the region faces strong headwinds, including a rapidly aging population and the loss of an estimated 20 million skilled workers to foreign markets over the past 25 years, according to a July 11 presentation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
But I believe that as conditions in central emerging Europe countries continue to improve, many of those workers will be returning home. Life in the region is not the same as it was 10 or 20 years ago, when good jobs might have been scarce. Firms are now growing at a healthy rate and hiring more workers. As you can see below, unemployment rates in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have been falling steadily since at least 2012 and are now lower than the broader European Union.

This strength is reflected in emerging Europe’s capital markets. For the 12-month period as of July 12, Hungary’s Budapest Stock Exchange is up 38 percent. Poland’s WIG20 is up more than 43 percent. Meanwhile, the STOXX Europe 600 Index—which includes some of the largest Western European companies—has made gains of only 17 percent over the same period.

Markets Still Believe in Trump
As we all know, the mainstream media’s criticism and ire aren’t reserved for China alone. Ninety-nine percent of the media right now is against President Trump, for a number of reasons—some of them deserved, some of them not.
Markets, however, seem not to care what the media or polls have to say. The Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to hit new all-time highs. Even though it’s stalled a few times, the “Trump rally” appears to be in full-speed-ahead mode, more than eight months after the election.
Back in November, I wrote about one of my favorite books, James Surowiecki’s The Wisdom of Crowds, which argues that large groups of people will nearly always be smarter and better at making predictions than an “elite” few. Surowiecki’s ideas were vindicated last year when investors accurately predicted Trump’s election, with markets turning negative between July 31 and October 31.
For the same reason, I think it’s important we pay close attention to what markets are forecasting today.
The White House is under siege on multiple fronts, which, as I said, has been positive for gold’s Fear Trade. But equity investors also seem to like the direction Trump is taking, whether it’s pushing for tax reform and deregulation or shaking up the “beltway party,” composed of deeply entrenched D.C. lobbyists and career bureaucrats. Just last week, the president made waves for firing a number of bureaucrats at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), long plagued by scandal and controversy. Since he took office in January, Trump has told more than 500 VA workers “You’re fired!”   
The Fundamentals of “Quantamental”
Of course, we look at so much more than government policy when making investment decisions. We take a blended approach of not only assessing fundamentals such as market share and returns on capital but also conducting quantitative analysis.
It’s this combination that some in the industry are calling “quantamental” investing. At first glance, “quantamental” might sound like nothing more than cute wordplay—not unlike “labsky,” “bullmation” and other clever names we give mixed-breed dogs—but it’s rapidly replacing traditional investment strategies at the institutional level.
Business Insider puts it in simple terms: “Quantamental managers combine the bottom-up stock-picking skills of fundamental investors with the use of computing power and big-data sets to test their hypotheses.”
See my Vancouver Investment Conference presentation, “What’s Driving Gold: The Invasion of the Quants,” to learn more about how we use quantitative analysis, machine learning and data mining.
Wall Street: The Birthplace of American Capitalism and Government

The concept of quantamentals helps explain our entry into smart-factor ETFs. As most of you already know, members of my team and I visited the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) three weeks ago to mark the launch of our latest ETF.
While there, Doug Yones, head of exchange-traded products at the NYSE, gave us a short history lesson about the exchange and surrounding area.
Most investors are aware that the NYSE, which is celebrating its 225th anniversary this year, is the epicenter of capitalism—not just in the U.S. but also globally.

What many people might not realize is that on the site where the exchange now stands, Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. treasury secretary, floated bonds to replace the debt the nascent country had incurred during the Revolutionary War.
Right next door to the NYSE is Federal Hall, where George Washington took his first oath of office in April 1789. The building today serves as a museum and memorial to the first U.S. president, whose statue now looks out over Wall Street and its passersby.
In this one single block of Wall Street, therefore, American capitalism and government were born. Here you can find the essential DNA of the American experiment, which, over the many years, has fostered our entrepreneurial spirit to form capital and to create new businesses and jobs. Growth, innovation and competition run through our veins, and that’s largely because of the events that unfolded centuries ago at the NYSE and Federal Hall.

Commodities Halftime Report: Separating the Wheat from the Chaff
July 10, 2017

Of the 14 commodities we track closely at U.S. Global Investors, wheat rose to take the top spot for the first half of 2017, returning more than 25 percent. The grain was followed closely by palladium—used primarily in the production of catalytic converters—which gained 24 percent.

click to enlarge
To view our ever-popular, interactive Periodic Table of Commodity Returns, click here.
Between the start of the year and June 30, the Bloomberg Commodity Index contracted 4.03 percent, with energy weighing down on the mostly strong performances of precious and industrial metals and agriculturals.
Contributing to metals’ gains was U.S. dollar weakness. During the first six months, the greenback lost 7.54 percent, responding partially to President Donald Trump’s comment in April that the dollar was “getting too strong.”
More recently, the president tweeted his thoughts on gas prices, which he pointed out were “the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years” for the July Fourth holiday. “I would like to see them go even lower,” he added.
Trump Goes to Warsaw
Speaking of Trump, I feel as if he has represented the U.S. and its values admirably during his visit to Europe last week. His speech in Warsaw sought to strengthen ties between America and Poland, which the New York Times just named the “next economic powerhouse.”

Trump drew attention to a danger that’s “invisible” yet every bit as dangerous as terrorism and extremism—namely, “the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people.”
The U.S. and Poland “became great not because of paperwork and regulations,” the president said, “but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies.”
This is the Trump I believe voters elected last November. If he were only able to stay on message and give his Twitter account a rest, he might more easily help engender and inspire an environment that better reflects the vision he described to his Polish audience.
I’m also encouraged by his first one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. From what I’ve read, it sounds as if the two leaders managed to make some progress on Syria, with both sides agreeing to cooperate in maintaining “safe zones.”
Oil Embroiled
Regarding lower gas prices, Trump just might get his wish. Having fallen 14.30 percent in the first six months, oil is currently underperforming its price action of the past four years.

click to enlarge
Much of the thanks for oil’s slump goes to U.S. shale producers, which were quick to reactivate dormant rigs following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) December announcement that it would be cutting production. As a result, the market is awash in black gold. In May, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that domestic output should average 9.3 million barrels a day this year and nearly 10 million in 2018, a level unseen in the U.S. since 1970.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) popped above $47 a barrel last week, however, on news that oil and gas inventories in the U.S. dropped sharply the previous week. What’s more, the number of active North American oil rigs fell by two in the week ended June 30, from 758 to 756 rigs, the first such contraction since January, according to the Baker Hughes Rig Count.
Although constructive, there’s still quite a bit of terrain to cover before oil reaches the low- to mid-$50s we saw at the start of the year.
Where’s the Wheat?
As I told you back in May, the U.S. reclaimed its longstanding title as the world’s number one wheat exporter this year, displacing Russia, whose weak currency gave the Eastern European country a competitive advantage.
We might soon slip to second place yet again, for two primary reasons: 1) low U.S. wheat plantings and 2) severe droughts and unexpectedly hot weather conditions in the Northern Plains.
According to a March report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), American farmers just aren’t planting wheat like they used to. Not only are we seeing shrinkage in the acreage devoted to the amber grain—more and more farmers are switching to soybeans—but wheat seedings are down for a second straight year. The USDA, in fact, estimates them to be at their lowest level ever since records began nearly 100 years ago in 1919.
As to the second point, severe to extreme hot and dry weather conditions in the Northern Plains—specifically in areas of Montana and the Dakotas—are putting wheat (and corn) on the defensive. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, parts of Montana just experienced their driest May and June in 99 years and the driest January through June since 1983. Last week alone, temperatures in the region surged into the 90s and 100s, about 15 to 20 degrees above the norm. These conditions are expected to persist for several more weeks.

click to enlarge
Supply constraints have pushed the grain up 25 percent so far this year to a nearly two-year high. A bushel now costs a little over $5, but some analysts see it rising above $6 and $7.
Precious Metals Continue to Shine
Also benefiting from limited supply is silver, which climbed nearly 4.5 percent as of June 30. The Silver Institute reported in May that global silver mine production in 2016 declined for the first time in 14 years on lower-than-expected output from lead, zinc and gold projects. World supply decreased 0.6 percent year-over-year, or about 32.6 million ounces.
Meanwhile, silver’s use in solar photovoltaic (PV) cells hit a new record high last year, further boosting demand. As I shared with you in May, solar ranked as the number one source of new electric generating capacity in the U.S. in 2016, followed by natural gas and wind.
In the first half of 2017, palladium, the silvery-white metal used in the production of catalytic converters, has surged to a 16-year high on speculative demand.

click to enlarge
At first blush, this trade might seem counterintuitive. After all, gas-powered vehicles, which use catalytic converters to control emissions, are expected to be surpassed in sales by electric vehicles, which do not require palladium, as early as 2040. Volvo just announced that it would completely phase out gas-only vehicles by 2019. Meanwhile, Tesla’s first mass-market battery electric vehicle (BEV) finally hit production last week.
Driving palladium’s rally this year, though, are bets that European car buyers will soon be switching from diesel-burning to gas-burning cars because of emissions concerns.









Palladium—one of the rarest elements on earth and mined almost exclusively in Russia and South Africa—is the smallest precious metals market, making its prices particularly vulnerable to such speculative trading. It’s achieved near-price parity with its sister metal, platinum, for the first time in two decades.  
On the other end of the spectrum is gold, whose market is larger than many major global stock and bond markets. Those include U.K. gilts, German bunds, the FTSE 100 Index, the Hang Seng Index and others.
Up 7.75 percent in the first six months, gold was supported largely by strong demand in India as consumers made their purchases ahead of the government’s Goods and Services Tax (GST), in effect since July 1, which levies a 3 percent tax on gold.
The impact of the country’s demonetization in December is also still being felt, with Indians’ confidence in fiat currencies tested. I believe Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheme to combat black money and public corruption, while admirable, has only reinforced Indians’ faith in the yellow metal as a store of value.
With consumer prices in the U.S. possibly set to begin rising on President Trump’s more protectionist policies—once he can get them enacted—gold priced in dollars could also be headed higher.
The Road Ahead
There’s a lot we’ll be keeping our eyes on in the second half of the year. For one, look to India’s upcoming Diwali holiday and fourth-quarter wedding season, during which gold gift-giving is considered auspicious.
Earlier in the year, I was excited about Trump’s ambitious infrastructure agenda, which would have greatly boosted domestic demand for base metals and energy. But with the Senate still locked in negotiations over what to do about Obamacare, an infrastructure deal looks as if it’s months if not years away.
Finally, I think with Tesla firing up its Nevada-based Gigafactory, investors would be prudent to keep their eyes on aluminum, cobalt, nickel and especially copper, as electric vehicles use around three times as much of the red metal as conventional vehicles. Lithium, which I featured back in March, is also expected to be a beneficiary of the move to BEVs.

Investor Beware! What Does the Illinois Budget Crisis Mean for Your Bond Fund?
July 6, 2017

A recent Capital Economics (CE) report shines an unforgiving light on Illinois’ ongoing budget woes—and what it finds isn’t pretty. The crisis, which has affected every level of government in the state, is a cautionary tale for not only public spending run amok but also independent investors taking too large of a risk by seeking high yields.
The Land of Lincoln’s credit is already the lowest-rated in the union and, until recently, its debt came precariously close to being downgraded to “junk.” Were this to happen, it would become the first state ever to receive such an ignoble rating.
The state’s 10-year bond yield has soared in recent months, which might attract certain unwary speculators. It’s our belief, however, that such debt should generally be avoided, as the risks are especially high.

click to enlarge
As I write this, a state budget could possibly be successfully negotiated, making it the first time in over two years that Illinois has operated with a budget. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner already vetoed the first bill that reached his desk, which includes tax hikes, but the veto was immediately overridden by the State Senate and is now headed for the House.
No matter the outcome, the point here is that political dysfunction is unfavorable—to put it lightly—and muni investors should remain cautious.
Illinois isn’t the only state facing problems. Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wisconsin are all (or were) mired in similar budgetary impasses. New Jersey public beaches reopened just in time for July 4 celebrations after a high-profile government shutdown closed them down.
For many muni investors, navigating around these numerous pitfalls might seem overwhelming. That’s why I believe an actively-managed municipal bond fund such as our Near-Term Tax Free Fund (NEARX) could be the solution.
More than 95 percent of NEARX is invested in munis that hold between an A and AAA investment-grade rating as of March 31. What this means is we’ve historically avoided exposure to debt issued by poorly-managed municipalities.
We also like to stay on the short end of the yield curve, especially now that the Federal Reserve has begun a new interest rate cycle. When rates rise, bond prices fall, and short- and intermediate-term munis are less sensitive to rate increases than longer-term munis whose maturities are further out.
To learn more about how rates affect municipal bonds, read our whitepaper.
On the Brink of Bankruptcy
Illinois’ total debt currently stands at about $60 billion, according to Capital Economics, which is above Detroit’s $20 billion bankruptcy in 2013 and just below Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt. The state’s unfunded pensions—for teachers, professors, state employees, judges, emergency personnel and more—could be as high as $250 billion. That puts each Illinoisan on the hook for an estimated $56,000.
Political dysfunction and mismanagement are bad enough, but the state’s adverse demographics make matters even worse.
Illinois is one of only four states whose populations shrank over the past five years, the others being Connecticut, Vermont and West Virginia. CE estimates that over the next decade, the state’s population could grow only 2.2 percent, far below the national average. The number of retirees, meanwhile, could surge 34 percent.

click to enlarge
That means fewer working-age Illinoisans are expected to be counted on to support retirees in the coming years, driving up the amount of unfunded pensions even higher.
So even if the Illinois government can resolve its budget soon, we see this as only a short-term fix. The state has even larger obstacles emerging on the horizon.
Our Solution
Again, this is why I think an actively-managed muni fund like NEARX is an attractive solution. Whereas other muni funds might accumulate Illinois debt based on its high yield, regardless of risk, we generally have stuck to investment-grade munis.
It must be said that if you look at NEARX’s holdings today, you’ll see that Illinois is one of its top issuers. The bonds were purchased at an earlier time, before the state’s budgetary problems really began to worsen. We haven’t accumulated any more since it became clear to us that the risks were too great.
We continue to hold the debt because we’re confident the state’s government can successfully unravel the political gridlock and arrive at a short-term resolution. It’s the state’s long-term demographic risks that investors should especially worry about. Our longest Illinois bonds mature in 2021, and as long as the state doesn’t default in the next four years—which, in our opinion, is highly unlikely—we should get a good return on the bonds based on their yield when they were purchased.

Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Though the Near-Term Tax Free Fund seeks minimal fluctuations in share price, it is subject to the risk that the credit quality of a portfolio holding could decline, as well as risk related to changes in the economic conditions of a state, region or issuer. These risks could cause the fund’s share price to decline. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local taxes and at times the alternative minimum tax. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes.
A bond’s credit quality is determined by private independent rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. Credit quality designations range from high (AAA to AA) to medium (A to BBB) to low (BB, B, CCC, CC to C).
The Near-Term Tax Free Fund invests at least 80 percent of its net assets in investment-grade municipal securities. At the time of purchase for the fund's portfolio, the ratings on the bonds must be one of the four highest ratings by Moody's Investors Services (Aaa, Aa, A, Baa) or Standard & Poor's Corporation (AAA, AA, A, BBB). Credit quality designations range from high (AAA to AA) to medium (A to BBB) to low (BB, B, CCC, CC to C). In the event a bond is rated by more than one of the ratings organizations, the highest rating is shown.

 Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local income taxes, and if applicable, may subject certain investors to the Alternative Minimum Tax as well. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. The tax free funds may be exposed to risks related to a concentration of investments in a particular state or geographic area. These investments present risks resulting from changes in economic conditions of the region or issuer.
Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure, as well as economic and political risk. By investing in a specific geographic region, a regional fund’s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio.
The Emerging Europe Fund invests more than 25% of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil & gas or banking industries. The risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund’s performance more volatile.
Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in a specific industry, the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries.
 Stock markets can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector-related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus.
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating? based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
