Company Description


NewSquare Capital manages the S3 Portfolios, a proprietary family of investment strategies implemented primarily with ETFs. The portfolios seek to outperform their designated benchmark by raising and lowering asset class exposures, industry sector exposures, international country exposures, currency exposures, and various alternative asset class exposures to anticipate relative price movements. To this end, the portfolios utilize fixed income ETFs, individual fixed income securities, equity ETFs, international ETFs, currency strategy ETFs, and alternative class ETFs (including real estate, commodities, hedge fund strategies, private equity strategies, and potentially others) to adjust exposures where appropriate.
