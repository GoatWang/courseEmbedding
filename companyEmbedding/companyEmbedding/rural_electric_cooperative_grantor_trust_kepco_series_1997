OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Trustee ofRural Electric Cooperative Grantor Trust(KEPCO) Series 1997Dulles, VirginiaWe have audited the accompanying  balance sheets of Rural Electric Cooperative Grantor Trust (�KEPCO�) Series 1997 (the �Trust�) as of December�31, 2016 and 2015, and the related  statements of comprehensive income, changes in deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December�31,
2016. These  financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust�s Servicer. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these  financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Servicer, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the  financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of December�31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its  cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December�31, 2016, in conformity with U.S.�generally accepted accounting principles.The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Trust will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Trust will commence winding up upon the maturity of the notes receivable and Rural Electric Cooperative Grantor Trust Certificates. The notes receivable and Rural Electric Cooperative Grantor Trust Certificates both mature in 2017. The Trust has no mandatory liquidation date. However, the Servicer of the
Trust expects to liquidate the remaining assets in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of those actions. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. /s/  KPMG LLP����McLean, VirginiaMarch�9, 20173RURAL

1�SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe TrustRural Electric Cooperative Grantor Trust (�KEPCO�) Series 1997 (the �Trust�) was formed under a Trust Agreement dated December 20, 1996.Trust AssetsThe assets of the Trust consist of lender loan notes (the �1997 Notes�) bearing interest at 7.597 percent and maturing in 2017. The 1997 Notes originated from a transaction whereby National
Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation (�CFC�) refinanced loans from the Federal Financing Bank, guaranteed by the Rural Utilities Service (�RUS�) and, in exchange, CFC received from Kansas Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. (the �Cooperative�) the 1997 Notes. CFC subsequently placed the 1997 Notes into two trusts, which have since been terminated and replaced by the Trust. The 1997 Notes are guaranteed (the �Guarantee�) as to timely payment of principal and interest by the United States Government (�U.S. Government�), acting through the Administrator of RUS.  The General Counsel of the United States Department of Agriculture has issued an opinion that the Guarantee is supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.  The Trust issued certificates of beneficial interests (the �Series 1997 Certificates�) that bear interest at a variable rate and mature in 2017.  The
Trust will commence winding up upon the maturity of the 1997 Notes and Series 1997 Certificates, which both mature in 2017. The Trust has no mandatory liquidation date, however, the Servicer of the Trust expects to liquidate remaining assets in the ordinary course of business shortly after maturity of the 1997 Notes and Series 1997 Certificates.Swap AgreementThe Trust also holds certain rights the Cooperative assigned to the Trust under an interest rate swap agreement (the �Swap Agreement�). The Swap Agreement was entered into to hedge the interest rate exposure associated with the fixed-rate 1997 Notes and a variable-rate obligation. The counterparty to the Swap Agreement is JPMorgan Chase & Co. (�JPMorgan Chase�). Pursuant to the Swap Agreement, the Trust pays to
JPMorgan Chase a fixed rate of interest on the outstanding notional amount, and JPMorgan Chase pays the Trust a variable rate of interest on the outstanding notional amount. The structure is designed such that the interest amounts paid by the Cooperative to the Trust are the same amounts paid to JPMorgan Chase, pursuant to the Swap Agreement, plus the amounts payable to CFC, as servicer. The amounts paid by JPMorgan Chase to the Trust under the Swap Agreement are the same as the interest payable by the Trust to the holders of the Series 1997 Certificates.The initial notional amount of the Swap Agreement, which is not included on the Trust�s balance sheet, was $57,390,000.  The notional amount of the Swap Agreement decreases over time in an amount such that the outstanding notional amount is always equal to the outstanding balance of the 1997 Notes and the Series 1997 Certificates.  The
Swap Agreement terminates on December 4, 2017, but is subject to early termination upon the early redemption of the Series 1997 Certificates.Liquidity FacilityJPMorgan Chase provides a liquidity facility with respect to the Series 1997 Certificates until such time as all outstanding Series 1997 Certificates have been paid in full.  Investors have the right to put the certificates back to the remarketing agent in the event they are unable to resell the certificates. The remarketing agent is Goldman, Sachs & Co. TrusteeU. S. Bank Trust National
Association (�U.S. Bank Trust�) is currently the Trustee.8RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE GRANTOR TRUST (KEPCO) SERIES 1997NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSServicerCFC is the servicer of the Trust ( the �Servicer�) under the Loan Guarantee and Servicing Agreement dated as of February 15, 1988, as amended (the �Guarantee and Servicing Agreement�). CFC does not hold any retained interests
in the Trust. No delinquency in payment under either the 1997 Notes, the Guarantee or the Swap Agreement has occurred and no event of servicing termination, or, to the best of the Servicer's knowledge, event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become an event of servicing termination, has occurred or is continuing.Tax Status of the TrustThe Trust is a pass-through entity, which is not subject to income taxes. Therefore, it is expected that the Trust will not have any liability for federal or state income taxes for the current or future years.Basis of Presentation and Use of EstimatesThe
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (�U.S. GAAP�). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Trust�s Servicer to make estimates and assumptions with respect to, among other things, various future factors which are difficult to predict and are beyond the control of the Trust.  These estimates, which are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related disclosures. Areas in which estimates have been made include, but are not limited to, the fair value of derivative financial instruments. While the Trust�s Servicer makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates.  Notes ReceivableThe
Trust accounts for the notes receivable based on historical cost. No allowance for loan losses has been recorded because the timely payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Interest income is recognized on the notes as earned on an accrual basis. Grantor Trust CertificatesThe Trust recognizes interest expense on the Series 1997 Certificates on an accrual basis.Servicer Fee ExpenseThe Trust accrues and recognizes servicer fee expense of 9.30 basis points of the outstanding principal balance of the 1997 Notes.Derivative
Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesThe Trust is neither a dealer nor a trader in derivative financial instruments. The Trust entered into an interest rate swap to hedge its interest rate risk exposure related to the 1997 Notes.  Derivatives are reported at fair value on the balance sheets. Derivatives in a gain position are recorded as a derivative asset, while derivatives in a loss position are reported as a derivative liability.  Changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded as a component of derivative gain (loss) in the statements of comprehensive income.  The Trust did not have any derivatives in hedge accounting relationships at December 31, 2016 or 2015.  The Trust recorded a cumulative derivative transition gain of $4,628,105
in accumulated other comprehensive income (�AOCI�) at January 1, 2001 as a result of the adoption of the derivative accounting guidance that required derivatives to be reported at fair value on the balance sheets.  The transition adjustment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the interest rate swap derivative prior to the January 1, 2001 adoption of the derivative accounting guidance and its fair value at the date of initial adoption.  The transition gain is being reclassified into earnings and reported in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of derivative gain (loss).  Cash flows related to the interest rate swap are classified in operating activities in the statements of cash flows.9RURAL
ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE GRANTOR TRUST (KEPCO) SERIES 1997NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSComprehensive IncomeComprehensive income for the Trust consists of net income (loss) plus the impact of the reclassification into income of the cumulative derivative transition gain related to the transition adjustment recorded upon the January 1, 2001 adoption of the derivative accounting guidance.NOTE
2�GRANTOR TRUST CERTIFICATESEach Series 1997 Certificate represents an undivided fractional interest in the Trust. The Series 1997 Certificates are subject to redemption by the Cooperative, through the Trust, at any time based on the remaining principal amount plus accrued interest. In the event of a continuing default, the RUS, as guarantor, may prepay or purchase the 1997 Notes at that time. The principal payments received on the 1997 Notes from the Cooperative coincide with the payments due to the holders of the Series 1997 Certificates. Principal payments on the Series 1997 Certificates began in 1998 and extend over a period of twenty years.  As of December 31, 2016, there is a total of $3,240,000 of
principal due in fiscal year 2017 through maturity of the 1997 Notes on December 4, 2017.NOTE 3�DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIESEffective January�1, 2001, the Trust adopted the accounting guidance requiring that derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  At adoption, the Trust had an interest rate swap agreement that
had been entered into to hedge the interest rate exposure associated with the fixed-rate 1997 Notes and a variable-rate obligation. The interest rate swap was not designated as a qualifying hedge for accounting purposes on January�1, 2001, and has not been designated as a qualifying hedge since that date. Therefore, all changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap subsequent to January�1, 2001 have been recorded in the statements of comprehensive income as a component of derivative gain (loss), net.The table below summarizes the outstanding notional amount and fair value of the interest rate swap at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Swap Agreement, which is with a highly rated
counterparty, is subject to a master netting arrangement pursuant to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (�ISDA�). The Swap Agreement does not require collateral posting by either counterparty. ��December

interest rate swap matures on December 4, 2017. As such, we expect to reclassify the remaining cumulative derivative transition gain of $26,035 at December 31, 2016 from AOCI into earnings during 2017.NOTE 4�FAIR VALUEFair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date (also referred to as an exit price).  The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. Fair value measurement of an asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1:Quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities��Level 2:Observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities��Level 3:Unobservable inputsThe accounting guidance for fair value requires maximizing the
use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe following table presents the carrying value and fair value for all of the financial instruments of the Trust, including those carried at amortized cost, at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The table also displays the classification within the fair value hierarchy of the valuation technique used in estimating fair value.11RURAL

is a description of the valuation methodology used in estimating fair value of the financial instruments of the Trust , the significant inputs and assumptions, if applicable, and the classification within the fair value hierarchy. Interest Receivable - KEPCO and Swap CounterpartyThe carrying amounts of interest receivable approximate fair value because of the relatively short period of time between their accrual and expected receipt of payment. Notes ReceivableThe fair value for notes receivable is estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans
would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.  This valuation technique is classified as Level 3. 12RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE GRANTOR TRUST (KEPCO) SERIES 1997NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSServicer Fees PayableThe carrying amount of servicer fees payable approximates fair value because of the relatively short period of time between their accrual and
expected payment.Interest Payable - Grantor Trust Certificates and Swap CounterpartyThe carrying amounts of interest payable approximate fair value because of the relatively short period of time between their accrual and expected payment.Rural Electric Cooperative Grantor Trust CertificatesThe Series 1997 Trust Certificates pay a variable rate of interest that is reset weekly, and as such the carrying value approximates fair value. This valuation technique is classified as Level 2. Derivative LiabilityThe
interest rate swap is accounted for in the balance sheets as a liability measured at fair value. The swap agreement is subject to a master netting agreement pursuant to the ISDA. There is not an active secondary market for this type of interest rate swap. To calculate fair value, a forward interest rate curve is used to determine the projected floating rate cash flows and the discount factors needed to calculate the net present value of each interest payment. A model is used to determine the value of the derivative based on discounted cash flows utilizing observable market inputs. The significant observable market inputs include spot LIBOR rates and market swap rates. Independent validation procedures are used to corroborate the fair value measures obtained from the derivative counterparty. This valuation technique is classified as Level 2. Assets and Liabilities Measured at
Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe interest rate swap is the only asset/liability of the Trust that is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements. The following fair value hierarchy table presents information about the Trust�s assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2016 and 2015. ��December

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Ladies and Gentlemen:


You have requested our opinion with respect to certain state and federal
income tax consequences associated with the issuance of Certificates
representing an undivided fractional interest in the assets and obligations of
Rural Electric Cooperative Grantor Trust (KEPCO) Series 1997 (the "Trust")
formed under a Trust Agreement, dated December 20, 1996, among National Rural
Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation ("CFC"), Kansas Electric Power
Cooperative, Inc. (the "Cooperative") and The First National Bank of Chicago
(the "Trustee"), as such Trust Agreement is amended by the First Amendment to
Trust Agreement, dated July 1, 1997 (as amended, the "Trust Agreement")./1/  The
assets of the Trust include two United States Government guaranteed Notes issued
by the Cooperative (that are being deposited into the Trust by CFC), and a Swap
Agreement between the Cooperative and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York.
The Cooperative assigned to the Trust, effective December 18, 1997, its right to
receive and its obligation to make payments under the Swap Agreement.




/1/  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to
them in the Trust Agreement.

Our opinion is based upon the Trust Agreement, as amended, including the
representations contained  therein, and the facts set forth in the Registration
Statement (Registration No. 333-25029) filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on April 11, 1997, and Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 thereto (as so
amended, the "Registration Statement") with respect to the issuance of the
Certificates.  Our opinion is also based upon (i) current provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, existing regulations thereunder, and
current administrative rulings of the Internal Revenue Service, (ii) current
provisions of the District of Columbia Income and Franchise Tax Act, codified as
Chapter 18, Title 47 of the District of Columbia Code, and existing regulations
promulgated thereunder by the District of Columbia Department of Finance and
Revenue, (iii) current provisions of the Virginia Code and existing regulations
promulgated thereunder by the Virginia Department of Taxation, and (iv) court
decisions, all as of the date of the Registration Statement.  All such
authorities are subject to change and any such change could apply retroactively.
The opinions expressed herein are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or
State or local taxing authorities.  Based on the foregoing, and conditioned upon
our understanding that the transactions contemplated by the Trust Agreement will
be carried out strictly in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, it
is our opinion that, under existing law as of the date hereof:


(i) for Federal income tax purposes, (a) the Trust will not be
classified as an association taxable as a corporation, but will be
classified as a grantor trust; (b) each Certificateholder will be treated
as the owner of an undivided fractional interest in each of the assets held
by the Trust; and (c) pursuant to Treasury Regulation (S) 1.1275-6, the
Trust will be treated as owning a debt instrument having a principal amount
equal to the principal amount of the Notes and bearing interest at a rate
equal to the rate payable by Morgan Guaranty under the Swap Agreement (the
"Synthetic Note");


(ii) for District of Columbia income and franchise tax purposes the
Trust will, with respect to Certificateholders, be classified as a grantor
trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation, with the results
that (a) each Certificateholder will be treated as the owner of an
undivided interest in the Synthetic Note held by the Trust in the same
manner as for Federal income tax purposes, and (b) Certificateholders who
are not residents of or otherwise subject to tax in the District of
Columbia will not be subject to District of Columbia income or franchise
tax with respect to interest and other income from the Synthetic Note or a
Certificate solely as a result of the purchase, ownership or sale of
Certificates; and


(iii)  for Commonwealth of Virginia income and franchise tax purposes
the Trust will, with respect to Certificateholders, be classified as a
grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation, with the
results that (a) each Certificateholder will be treated as the owner of an
undivided interest in the Synthetic Note held by the Trust in the

same manner as for Federal income tax purposes, and (b) Certificateholders
who are not residents of or otherwise subject to tax in the Commonwealth of
Virginia will not be subject to Commonwealth of Virginia income or
franchise tax with respect to interest and other income from the Synthetic
Note or a Certificate solely as a result of the purchase, ownership or sale
of Certificates.


We participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement with
respect to the sale of the Certificates, including the discussions set forth in
the Registration Statement under the headings "United States Federal Income Tax
Considerations" and "State and Local Income Tax Consequences".  The discussions
and the legal conclusions with respect to United States federal income tax
matters, District of Columbia income tax matters and Commonwealth of Virginia
income tax matters set forth therein reflect our opinion, and we believe they
are accurate and complete in all material respects.


We hereby consent to the use of our name in the Registration Statement and
to the filing of this letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.  By
giving such consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons
whose consent is required under section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Very truly yours,
