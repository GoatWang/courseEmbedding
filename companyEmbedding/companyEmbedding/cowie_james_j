Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 2 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $32.00 (13.47% downside)

Welcome to James Cowie and Co Ltd



James Cowie and Co Ltd, specialists in metalwork fabrication and structural steel fabrication have a reputation throughout Scotland for the production and installation of quality structural steelwork and metalwork. Once a traditional country blacksmiths and agricultural engineering company, Arthur Carney purchased James Cowie and company in 1962, increasing the companys production capacity and shifting emphasis away from agriculture and towards construction. Since then our fabrication business has expanded continuously and as industry recognition has grown, James Cowie has moved increasingly into the field of structural fabrication.


In 1989, James Cowie and Co built its extensive purpose built and modern premises in Hamilton near Glasgow. Here we are fully equipped to fabricate everything from brackets to structural steelwork. These products can be installed on site or provided on a supply only basis through our committed sales department. James Cowie and Co produce to exact manufacturing specifications. Fabricated sections can be shot blasted, galvanised or spray painted to suit your particular requirements. All welding work, whether performed on site or within the workshop is undertaken by qualified welders.


James Cowies large production capacity means that we can process bulk orders quickly and effectively. Over the years, the company has taken part in many major building projects, high profile developments and high quality fabrication work in the renewable industry which illustrates the wide variety of metalwork skill and structural fabrication skills our team brings to any project. Please refer to the gallery section for examples.
