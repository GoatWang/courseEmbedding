Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Narrowly focused investments and investments focusing on a single country may be subject to higher volatility. There are additional risks associated with investing in base and precious metals as well as their respective mining industries. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility.
Carefully consider the Funds’ investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses before investing.

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Narrowly focused investments and investments focusing on a single country may be subject to higher volatility. There are additional risks associated with investing in base and precious metals as well as their respective mining industries. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility.
Carefully consider the Funds’ investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Funds’ summary or full prospectus, which may be obtained by calling 1-888-GX-FUND-1 (1.888.493.8631), or by visiting www.globalxfunds.com.

 View Chart Explanation
 Download Chart Data (.CSV)
How can the Fund trade at a premium/discount to its NAV?
The primary explanation is that timing discrepancies can arise between the NAV and the closing price of the Fund. Since shares of the Fund trade on the open market, prices are affected by the constant flow of information received by investors, corporations and financial institutions. Depending on how this changing information affects investor sentiment, shares of the Fund may deviate slightly from the value of the Fund's underlying assets. As a result, shareholders may pay more than NAV when they buy Fund shares and receive less than NAV when they sell those shares, because shares are purchased and sold at current market prices. However, due to the creation and redemption process that is unique to ETFs, market makers are able to minimize these deviations from NAV by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
What causes these time discrepancies?
Close of Trading Times. Although both the NAV and the closing trade of the Fund are generally calculated at the closing time of 4:00 p.m. eastern time, slight differences in this timing may cause discrepancies.
Time of Last Trade. Trading of Global X funds generally takes place during normal trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. eastern time). However, it is important to note that the last trade - from which the closing price is determined - may not occur at exactly 4:00 p.m. eastern time. Therefore, changing market sentiment during the time difference may cause the NAV to deviate from the closing price.
International Holdings. The premiums and discounts for funds with significant holdings in international markets may be less accurate due to the different closing times of various international markets. Because the Funds trade during U.S. market hours while the underlying securities may not, the time lapse between the markets can result in differences between the NAV and the closing price.

Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Global X NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The closing price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange. Indices are unmanaged and do not include the effect of fees, expenses or sales charges. One cannot invest directly in an index.
Since the Fund’s shares typically do not trade in the secondary market until several days after the Fund’s inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in Shares, the NAV of the Fund is used to calculate market returns. Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions. There is no guarantee that dividends will be paid.
Carefully consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses. This and other information can be found in the fund’s prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Global X Management Company LLC serves as an advisor to Global X Funds. The Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO), which is not affiliated with Global X Management Company LLC. Global X Funds are not sponsored, endorsed, issued, sold or promoted by Solactive AG, FTSE, Standard Poors, NASDAQ, Indxx, or MSCI nor do these companies make any representations regarding the advisability of investing in the Global X Funds. Neither SIDCO nor Global X is affiliated with Solactive AG, FTSE, Standard & Poors, NASDAQ, Indxx, or MSCI.
Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. International investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles, or from economic or political instability in other nations. Narrowly focused investments typically exhibit higher volatility. The Fund may invest in an underlying fund that invests in companies that invest in real estate, such as REITs, which exposes investors in the Fund to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which real estate companies are organized and operated. Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Many real estate companies, including REITs, utilize leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases risk and could adversely affect a real estate company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. High yielding stocks are often speculative, high-risk investments. These companies can be paying out more than they can support and may reduce their dividends or stop paying dividends at any time, which could have a material adverse effect on the stock price of these companies and the Fund’s performance.
High short-term performance of the fund is unusual and investors should not expect such performance to be repeated.

Carefully consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses. This and other information can be found in the fund’s prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Global X NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The closing price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange. Indices are unmanaged and do not include the effect of fees, expenses or sales charges. One cannot invest directly in an index.
Since the Fund’s shares typically do not trade in the secondary market until several days after the Fund’s inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in Shares, the NAV of the Fund is used to calculate market returns.
Global X Management Company LLC serves as an advisor to Global X Funds. The Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO), which is not affiliated with Global X Management Company LLC. Global X Funds are not sponsored, endorsed, issued, sold or promoted by Solactive AG, FTSE, Standard & Poors, NASDAQ, Indxx, or MSCI nor do these companies make any representations regarding the advisability of investing in the Global X Funds. Neither SIDCO nor Global X is affiliated with Solactive AG, FTSE, Standard & Poors, NASDAQ, Indxx, or MSCI.
Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. Preferred stock is subject to many of the risks associated with debt securities, including interest rate risk. In addition, preferred stock may not pay a dividend, an issuer may suspend payment of dividends on preferred stock at any time, and in certain situations, an issuer may call or redeem its preferred stock or convert it to common stock. High yielding stocks are often speculative, high-risk investments. These companies can be paying out more than they can support and may reduce their dividends or stop paying dividends at any time, which could have a material adverse effect on the stock price of these companies and the Fund’s performance.
High short-term performance of the fund is unusual and investors should not expect such performance to be repeated.

 View Chart Explanation
 Download Chart Data (.CSV)
How can the Fund trade at a premium/discount to its NAV?
The primary explanation is that timing discrepancies can arise between the NAV and the closing price of the Fund. Since shares of the Fund trade on the open market, prices are affected by the constant flow of information received by investors, corporations and financial institutions. Depending on how this changing information affects investor sentiment, shares of the Fund may deviate slightly from the value of the Fund's underlying assets. As a result, shareholders may pay more than NAV when they buy Fund shares and receive less than NAV when they sell those shares, because shares are purchased and sold at current market prices. However, due to the creation and redemption process that is unique to ETFs, market makers are able to minimize these deviations from NAV by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
What causes these time discrepancies?
Close of Trading Times. Although both the NAV and the closing trade of the Fund are generally calculated at the closing time of 4:00 p.m. eastern time, slight differences in this timing may cause discrepancies.
Time of Last Trade. Trading of Global X funds generally takes place during normal trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. eastern time). However, it is important to note that the last trade - from which the closing price is determined - may not occur at exactly 4:00 p.m. eastern time. Therefore, changing market sentiment during the time difference may cause the NAV to deviate from the closing price.
International Holdings. The premiums and discounts for funds with significant holdings in international markets may be less accurate due to the different closing times of various international markets. Because the Funds trade during U.S. market hours while the underlying securities may not, the time lapse between the markets can result in differences between the NAV and the closing price.

Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Global X NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The closing price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange. Indices are unmanaged and do not include the effect of fees, expenses or sales charges. One cannot invest directly in an index.
Since the Fund’s shares typically do not trade in the secondary market until several days after the Fund’s inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in Shares, the NAV of the Fund is used to calculate market returns. Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions. There is no guarantee that dividends will be paid.

In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Narrowly focused investments and investments focusing on a single country may be subject to higher volatility.
