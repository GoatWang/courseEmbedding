2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Tyler Technologies, Inc. is engaged in providing integrated information management solutions and services to the public sector. It provides software products and services; professional IT services; subscription-based services; property appraisal outsourcing services. Its products generally automate three major functional areas (1) financial management and education, (2) courts and justice and (3) property appraisal and tax.

3. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "Tyler reported a generally positive 4Q with bookings upside (+15% vs. 10% - 12% estimate) and an effective $0.04 EPS outperformance while we attribute the revenue miss on weaker services revenues as organic license revenue growth was 20%. While bookings outperformed, we seek additional color on the 4Q call regarding deal mix as initial FY17 revenue guidance calling for 10% growth was 1% below ours and consensus 11% estimates. The company's initial FY17 guidance does not call for any operating margin leverage by our estimates, which initially will drive weak Y/Y EPS growth (+11%), but we expect EPS to work higher throughout FY17."

Consensus Ratings for Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 8 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $185.25 (4.46% upside)
