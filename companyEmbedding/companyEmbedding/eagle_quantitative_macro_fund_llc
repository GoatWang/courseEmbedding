OFFERING  UNIQUE  ACCESS  TO  TRUE  ABSOLUTE  RETURN  ALTERNATIVE  INVESTMENTS
Eagle’s View Capital Management, LLC (“Eagle’s View”) offers investment management services to high net worth individuals and family office clients.
 
Eagle’s View seeks to capitalize upon market inefficiencies often overlooked by most traditional hedge fund investment vehicles. Historically, Eagle’s View has invested across a variety of unique strategies, including, but not limited to: electricity arbitrage, capitalizing on inefficiencies in shipping derivatives, algorithmic pattern recognition, big data/machine learning, and quantitative global macro. Eagle’s View generally invests in niche-oriented strategies and managers that have an “edge” and show little or no correlation to mainstream asset classes such as equities, fixed income or commodities markets.
