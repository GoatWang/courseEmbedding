We’d love to sell you a set of performance calipers and we carry the best with names like Brembo, Baer, and Wilwood. But with these calipers, what you’re paying for is their ability to make the car stop better. The fact that they also look great is just a byproduct of good design. So let’s take a look at the next alternative, painting.When done properly, painting calipers is very time consuming. First they have to be completely clean or the paint is not going to stick. And even if you do everything right, there is still a good chance that the paint will peel in the future. But the big knock against painting is that it can’t do anything about the shape of the calipers. The design of some calipers is just not that great looking, and putting them in color won’t change that.Which brings us to the best option: caliper covers. Although paint is cheaper, when you factor in what your time is worth, caliper covers are the least expensive alternative. The covers we offer are laser cut from stainless steel or from 6061-T6 aluminum, which is then given a powder coated finish. The aluminum covers are available in multiple colors and with custom logos. With caliper covers you get a durable product with a finish that will never peel, in a shape that will look great on any brake caliper.Caliper covers are easy to install, won’t interfere with brake operation, and are easy to remove when brake service is necessary. They also reduce brake dust, so those nice custom wheels will stay cleaner. And although you may not think attaching covers will make calipers cooler, they will actually reduce caliper temperatures by 30°-50°F. The covers act as a heat sink, drawing heat out of the calipers, which prolongs the life of brake system components.
While you’re installing caliper covers, why not install a set of wheel bands? These protective bands attach to the perimeter of the wheels to protect them from curb damage. They come in colors that complement caliper covers, giving your wheels a custom effect like no other. A plastic track attaches to the wheel, with a tough replaceable plastic insert that will take the brunt of a scrape instead of your rim, saving you replacement or refurbishing costs.Featured BrandsMGPAmerican Car CraftFeatured VideosMGP Caliper Covers 01Caliper Covers Overview02Ford F-150 Project0360 Second Installation Caliper Covers04Caliper Covers Introduction05Rich Evans Designs for Caliper Covers06Chevy Camaro SS Caliper Covers Installation07Caliper Covers Promo08Ford Mustang Caliper Covers Installation09MGP Caliper Covers Manufacturing Slideshow10Caliper Covers Before/After Installation11Guides & Articles Caliper CoversDecember 01, 2016Why Are Caliper Covers Only Available For My...When it comes to creating the right look for your car or truck, a shimmering set of wheels can do more to make or break its appearance than almost any other accessory....

We’d love to sell you a set of performance calipers and we carry the best with names like Brembo, Baer, and Wilwood. But with these calipers, what you’re paying for is their ability to make the car stop better. The fact that they also look great is just a byproduct of good design. So let’s take a look at the next alternative, painting.When done properly, painting calipers is very time consuming. First they have to be completely clean or the paint is not going to stick. And even if you do everything right, there is still a good chance that the paint will peel in the future. But the big knock against painting is that it can’t do anything about the shape of the calipers. The design of some calipers is just not that great looking, and putting them in color won’t change that.Which brings us to the best option: caliper covers. Although paint is cheaper, when you factor in what your time is worth, caliper covers are the least expensive alternative. The covers we offer are laser cut from stainless steel or from 6061-T6 aluminum, which is then given a powder coated finish. The aluminum covers are available in multiple colors and with custom logos. With caliper covers you get a durable product with a finish that will never peel, in a shape that will look great on any brake caliper.Caliper covers are easy to install, won’t interfere with brake operation, and are easy to remove when brake service is necessary. They also reduce brake dust, so those nice custom wheels will stay cleaner. And although you may not think attaching covers will make calipers cooler, they will actually reduce caliper temperatures by 30°-50°F. The covers act as a heat sink, drawing heat out of the calipers, which prolongs the life of brake system components.
While you’re installing caliper covers, why not install a set of wheel bands? These protective bands attach to the perimeter of the wheels to protect them from curb damage. They come in colors that complement caliper covers, giving your wheels a custom effect like no other. A plastic track attaches to the wheel, with a tough replaceable plastic insert that will take the brunt of a scrape instead of your rim, saving you replacement or refurbishing costs.Featured BrandsMGPAmerican Car CraftFeatured VideosMGP Caliper Covers 01Caliper Covers Overview02Ford F-150 Project0360 Second Installation Caliper Covers04Caliper Covers Introduction05Rich Evans Designs for Caliper Covers06Chevy Camaro SS Caliper Covers Installation07Caliper Covers Promo08Ford Mustang Caliper Covers Installation09MGP Caliper Covers Manufacturing Slideshow10Caliper Covers Before/After Installation11Guides & Articles Caliper CoversDecember 01, 2016Why Are Caliper Covers Only Available For My...When it comes to creating the right look for your car or truck, a shimmering set of wheels can do more to make or break its appearance than almost any other accessory....

Wheel covers protect the underlying stamped steel wheels and help prevent mounting studs and lug nuts from rusting, and they help make the vehicle attractive less expensively than fitting alloy wheels. Unfortunately, wheel covers are not always properly installed and can pop off when you hit a bump or pot hole, and scraping curbs can damage them, making them unsightly and weakening them, allowing them to fly off. We offer individual replacements as well as complete wheel cover sets for cars, light trucks, and even tractor trailers, to maintain or enhance your vehicle’s appearance.

At one time all wheel covers were metal but today just about all factory wheel covers are made of plastic. Three kinds of covers can be found on modern cars, differentiated by how they are attached to the wheel. The vast majority snap on and are retained in the traditional manner at the perimeter of the wheel, with spring steel clips or wire retainers. Then there is the bolt-on style that is used on a few specific makes and models, of which there are 2 types - those that are retained with the lug nuts, and those that are secured with plastic caps that thread onto the lug nuts.

Anyone who’s attempted to remove rusted lug nuts from corroded wheel studs can attest to the importance of wheel covers. Most stamped steel wheels were never designed to be exposed, and their utilitarian design and finish can also detract from an otherwise good looking vehicle’s appearance. If one of your wheel covers has become lost or damaged you can restore your vehicle’s looks and protection inexpensively with one of our new or remanufactured wheel covers. These covers will fit and perfectly match your original covers. We offer covers for all popular late-model cars in the original sizes, materials, designs, and finishes. These covers are identical to factory original, and once installed, will be indistinguishable from the rest of the wheel covers on your vehicle.

If you’ve lost a few covers or just want an easy styling upgrade, then consider installing a complete set of wheel covers. We offer covers in durable materials like tough ABS plastic in a variety of eye-catching designs and finishes that are easy to install and certain to enhance your vehicle’s appearance. Wheel covers are an easy way to get a custom look. They’re much less expensive and much less maintenance intensive than a set of custom wheels. In fact, they’re so affordable you could keep several sets on hand and change them to suit your mood. And if you have a classic car there’s no need to hunt around for used parts that are acceptable when, for select applications, we can offer you authentic reproduction hub caps and full wheel covers that are correct in every detail.


Our imposter wheel skins are an inexpensive alternative to installing a set of custom wheels or replacing damaged factory styled steel and aluminum wheels. Made of rugged, triple chrome plated ABS plastic, wheel skins are designed to overlay your factory wheels, so you can cover damage or transform dull and boring wheels into chrome wheels. They’re specifically designed for each application and custom molded for a precise fit. They just snap into place over your wheels, and correspond to every curve and feature of your wheels so well that no one will be able to tell you didn’t spring for a set of chrome rims. Wheel skins are also easy to maintain and much simpler and less expensive to replace than an alloy wheel should one become damaged.


Cars and light trucks aren’t the only vehicles that can benefit from the great looks and ease of maintenance of a wheel skins type product. For heavy-duty trucks, trailers, buses and RVs we offer wheel simulators. Simulators are similar in concept in that they conform to the shape of the wheel, and in fact some even install over the lug nuts. They’re made of rugged, polished stainless steel, and like wheel skins they’re a great way to dress up your rig without the expense of aluminum wheels, or cover up worn or corroded aluminum or steel wheels. Simulators are available in a wide range of styles in sizes from 16” to 24.5”. In addition to simulators we also offer wheel covers for tractors and trailers, including Aero covers that have been proven to provide up to 2% fuel savings.


Alloy wheels can suffer the same type of curb scrape damage as wheel covers, but are much more expensive to replace. An alternative to replacing pricey aluminum wheels due to curb damage is to prevent scrapes and scratches from occurring in the first place with wheel bands. Wheel bands have a hard plastic track that attaches to the perimeter of alloy wheels, with a plastic formula extrusion that fits inside the track. If you contact a curb, the replaceable extrusion bears the brunt of the impact, not your expensive alloy wheel. Wheel bands fit up to 22” wheels and they attach securely with 3M adhesive. Plus they’re available in your choice of several eye-catching colors, so you can give your ride a custom touch at the same time.

Demon camber. You may know it as oni-camber. You've seen the look, and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point. The great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention. From the interviews we've read with owners and drivers of these machines, that is exactly what they are after. They've said that it's all about being noticed.Custom wheels and tires have been around for years, and continue to be immensely popular. But customizers are always looking for ways to be ahead of the game, to be first with a trend. It is no longer enough to have the most outrageous set of rims. That look can be taken to the next level with stanced cars. Technically, demon camber is extreme negative camber. Let's explain what "negative camber" is and how that effect is achieved.Camber is one of the alignment specifications which affect the angle, or tilt of the wheel compared to the vehicle's body. If you are looking directly at the front or rear of a car, the angle of the tire relative to the ground is the camber. Look at the illustration below. Negative camber means that the tops of the tires lean in relative to the car's body. Zero camber means the tire is perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Positive camber means the tops of the tires are leaning out...March 18, 2015Pickup Truck Cab And Bed SizesTimothy ZahlAmericans love to have choices. Buying a dress shirt?

Neither are we, so upgrading your car or truck's power and handling is just a click away in our Performance Parts department. You can pack more air and fuel into your engine with free flowing filters and cold air intakes, big carburetors and throttle bodies, high flow injectors and intake manifolds; get a fat spark to fire that mixture with performance plugs, wires, and ignition systems; and give those spent gases a quick exit and get a rumble to boot with headers and low restriction exhaust systems. And if you crave massive increases in go-power, we have complete engines, turbochargers and superchargers, and nitrous oxide systems. But performance isn't just about power, you have to handle the turns and hit the binders once in a while and for that we have suspension and brake systems for every need and purpose. Check out our vast selection of lift kits, lowering kits, shocks, struts, springs and sway bars and state of the art drilled and slotted brake rotors, multi-piston calipers, and performance compound brake linings.We all like to modify and customize our vehicles, but sometimes you just need to fix them or do maintenance to make sure they last. We can help you save money by doing the job yourself, with auto parts and tools to repair any part of your machine and maintenance supplies to help keep it going for many more miles. Water pumps, alternators, starters, clutches, timing belts, mufflers, and more are all here along with the chemicals and tools you need to get repair jobs done right. Regular maintenance has been proven to extend the life of a vehicle and we can help keep yours in top shape with filters, lubricants, spark plugs, brake pads and more. And to make sure you never tire of looking at your pride and joy we have an extensive selection of wax and polish, car wash, tire dressing and detail supplies.

You can pack more air and fuel into your engine with free flowing filters and cold air intakes, big carburetors and throttle bodies, high flow injectors and intake manifolds; get a fat spark to fire that mixture with performance plugs, wires, and ignition systems; and give those spent gases a quick exit and get a rumble to boot with headers and low restriction exhaust systems. And if you crave massive increases in go-power, we have complete engines, turbochargers and superchargers, and nitrous oxide systems. But performance isn't just about power, you have to handle the turns and hit the binders once in a while and for that we have suspension and brake systems for every need and purpose. Check out our vast selection of lift kits, lowering kits, shocks, struts, springs and sway bars and state of the art drilled and slotted brake rotors, multi-piston calipers, and performance compound brake linings.We all like to modify and customize our vehicles, but sometimes you just need to fix them or do maintenance to make sure they last.
