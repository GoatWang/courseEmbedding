mBeaconPay a patent pending product of IFAN....    Financial, Inc., Netclearance Systems Begin Commercial Deployment Of Smart Beacon Technology   APRIL 14, 2016   SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 14, 2016 / IFAN Financial, Inc. - (OTC PINK: IFAN), ("IFAN" or "the Company"), a designer, developer, and distributor of software to enable mobile payments, announced that it has begun commercial deployment of the mBeaconPay and mBeacon2 ("M2") payments technology in collaboration with its strategic partner Netclearance Systems ("Netclearance"). This deployment follows the successful completion of beta testing for these systems.   mBeaconPay is the first mobile OS agnostic cash-based payment terminal for retail, transit, gas and hospitality. The mBeaconPay supports all wireless proximity technologies such as BLE, NFC, QR and Wi-Fi in a single unit and integrates seamlessly with all point of sale system. mBeaconPay was recently nominated for Best Cash Innovation Award by PYMNTS.com, one of the leading publications in the payments and commerce industry.   The mBeacon2 is a dual transmitter beacon that engages Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE devices in proximity. mBeacon2 is ideal for engagement applications and also can be deployed in presence applications. The mBeacon2 transmits a Wi-Fi and BLE signal simultaneously that can trigger events and engage mobile clients regardless of smartphone operating system   J. Christopher Mizer, President and CEO of IFAN Financial commented, "Our mBeaconPay and M2 represent one of the most versatile technologies in our industry. This technology is suitable for small to large scale retail operations, basically any business-to-consumer entity where the company take payments from the customer using any global currency, including Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. It integrates seamlessly with our PayX platform, offering flexible form factors, including white label and flexible power options, and is plug and play with point-of-sale terminals, while supporting multiple enterprise applications.   "mBeaconPay and M2 provide loud connectivity via Wi-Fi, Ethernet or Mesh, and have configurable power transmission and receive sensitivity. We have engineered extended battery-life into our battery powered models, lasting over 5 years without a charge, and all enjoy integrated enterprise security (AES, SHA, ECC)."   Mizer added, "The future is cashless, and we already see this in several of the smaller economies in Europe. There are over 35,000 beacon deployments in Denmark and Norway, with $28 billion in transactions processed. Combined the GDP of both nations is $847 billion, about half of which is consumer spending. This means that beacons are already handling about 5% of consumer spending there already. We look forward to demonstrating the versatility of our platform as we announce further commercial contracts that will utilize the mBeaconPay and M2 technology."
