		We know that life is better together and everyone is happiest when they’re with family, whether it’s immediate family, extended family, or a family of friends.  That’s why we treat everyone who walks through our doors like part of our family, sharing the food we love with the people we love, and spending the time we have, together.
      





















Where Great Food and Great Friends Come Together

			Since its founding in Orlando in 1982, Olive Garden has been dedicated to providing a warm and welcoming dining experience to everyone who walks in the door. These principles combined with its delicious food led to rapid expansion until it was the largest chain of Italian themed restaurants in the nation. 
          
Inspired by Italian generosity and food made with love, Olive Garden’s menu is always changing and expanding to ensure that there is always a new dish to try, a new flavor to discover. From exciting new specials and classic Italian favorites to a full menu of appetizers, desserts, wines, gluten-free and new lighter fare options, there’s something delicious for everyone at Olive Garden.

Olive Garden is Community

				Every day, in every Olive Garden location across the country, team members spend extra time to prepare, package, freeze and store unserved, surplus food for donation to local food banks, shelters and other charitable organizations.  Last year, those restaurants donated three million pounds of wholesome and ready-to-eat food.  Since 2003, Olive Garden has donated 33 million pounds of food to help those in need.
