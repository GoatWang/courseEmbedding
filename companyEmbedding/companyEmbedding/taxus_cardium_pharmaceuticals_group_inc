Generx Biology & Delivery














Ad5FGF-4 Construct CAR ReceptorBinding for Localized Cardiac Transfection

FGF-4 – The Therapeutic Growth Factor
Generx is an adenovector (serotype 5) DNA-based gene therapy construct that encodes the Fibroblast Growth Factor-4 (FGF-4) gene. In transfected heart cells, using Cardium’s proprietary methods of gene therapy, Generx drives the cellular production of FGF-4, a secreted protein that activates other angiogenic growth factor pathways (such as VEGF, PDGF, HGF and nitric oxide), indicating that it is high in the hierarchical control of the angiogenic cascade. Company-sponsored research demonstrated that Generx has the capacity to promote and enhance cardiac microvascular circulation through both the enlargement of pre-existing collateral arterioles (arteriogenesis) and the formation of new capillary vessels (angiogenesis).
Taxus Cardium has developed a new and unique, in vitro angiogenesis bio-assay that provides a valuable tool for demonstrating the pro-angiogenic potency of Generx. This assay quantifies two key biological activities:


The dose-dependent release of the FGF-4 protein from Ad5FGF-4 transfected cells
The ability of the released FGF-4 in the “conditioned” transfected cell culture media to promote endothelial tube formation (angiogenesis) when added to a second co-culture containing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF).















 













Innovative Generx Intracoronary Delivery
Generx is designed to bind to cell surface Coxsackievirus-Adenovirus Receptors that are abundant in the heart and accessed using the Company’s proprietary ischemia-driven method of gene therapy. Lessons learned from the extensive preclinical and clinical experience with Generx include the finding that induction of transient ischemia during intracoronary Generx administration, together with the introduction of nitroglycerin, significantly facilitates the transfection of Generx into heart cells by several mechanisms, including enhanced penetration through microvessel endothelium and upregulation of Coxsackie-Adenovirus Receptor (CAR).[i]
Taxus Cardium has therefore developed an innovative proprietary method for Generx delivery which combines antegrade intracoronary artery delivery during transient balloon occlusion of a coronary artery, producing transient myocardial ischemia, and concomitant infusion of nitroglycerin, all of which can be safely applied by interventional cardiologists.











One-time treatment via a non-surgical delivery by intracoronary administration by interventional cardiologist during angiography procedure
Utilizes standard balloon catheter which can be easily integrated into diagnostic angiography procedures or with other percutaneous coronary interventions
New induced transient ischemia / reperfusion techniques designed to enhance DNA uptake and FGF-4 expression in the heart
40% administered to right coronary circulation and 60% to left coronary circulation












[i] Shi et al., Hum Gene Ther Methods. 2012; 23(3):204-12.

About Taxus Cardium
Overview



















Taxus Cardium Pharmaceuticals Group Inc. is a holding company that manages and operates a portfolio of equity-based and potential royalty-driven investments as follows: (1) Angionetics, currently a majority-owned business unit focused on the late-stage clinical development and commercialization of Generx®, an angiogenic gene therapy product candidate designed for medical revascularization for the potential treatment of patients with myocardial ischemia and refractory angina due to advanced coronary artery disease. (Please visit www.angionetics.com for more information); (2) the Excellagen® technology platform, now under management by Activation Therapeutics (www.activationtherapeutics.com), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Taxus Cardium Pharmaceuticals Group, has broad potential applications as a delivery platform for small molecule drugs, proteins and biologics and as an FDA-cleared flowable dermal matrix for advanced wound care, which is currently being held as an investment for future sale or internal commercialization. (Please visit www.excellagen.com  for more information); (3) LifeAgain, an advanced medical data analytics (ADAPT®) technology platform focused on developing new and innovative products for the life insurance and healthcare sectors; and (4) Healthy Brands Collective, a functional food and nutraceutical company which acquired Taxus Cardium’s To Go Brands® business. (Please visit www.healthybrandsco.com for more information). 

















Business Strategy & Goals

The advancement of our international Phase 3 registration clinical study for Generx® which is currently underway in the Russian Federation, and the release of findings from interim data analysis in the mid-2014.
With clinical success, initiate marketing and sale of Generx in Russia and other CIS countries with local distribution partners, and initiate meetings with the U.S. FDA to seek harmonization between the International Clinical Study with Cardium’s already FDA-cleared Generx Phase 3 clinical study in an effort to advance the U.S.-based clinical studies supported by a strategic clinical development partner.
Strategically partner and monetize our FDA-cleared pharmaceutically formulated collagen commercial wound care product Excellagen®, for select U.S.-based vertical market channels, and build on Cardium’s capabilities and resources to leverage Excellagen as an advanced regenerative medicine delivery platform by identifying new and innovative product extensions for tissue regeneration based on stem cells, biologics, peptides and small molecule drugs for future development by Cardium.
Advance the commercialization of our non-core LifeAgain Insurance Solutions advanced medical data analytics business investment that is focused on the development, marketing and sale of “survivable risk” term life insurance for cancer survivors or others with medical conditions who are currently considered uninsurable based on traditional underwriting standards, but in medically-definable subgroups of whom are now expected to have a normal life span due to medical advancements. The Company plans to potentially support the growth and development of this business and technology platform through the sale of a minority stake in our LifeAgain business to a strategic partner or financial investors
Monetize Cardium’s equity stake in its non-core Healthy Brands Collective (Cell-nique Corporation) investment. We acquired this investment through the recent sale of our To Go Brands® health sciences business through an asset exchange for a preferred equity position in Healthy Brands. Healthy Brands has been making significant acquisitions and has reported plans to move forward as a public company as its current businesses advance and grow through further acquisition.

Board of Directors





















Christopher J. Reinhard
Mr. Reinhard is co-founder of Cardium and has served as a director and the Chief Executive Officer, President and Treasurer of Cardium since its inception in December 2003. Mr. Reinhard has played a leadership role in the pre-clinical, clinical and commercial development of the Generx program. In 1996, he was co-founder of Collateral Therapeutics, which licensed the Generx technology covering methods of cardiovascular gene therapy based on discoveries by researchers at the University of California, San Diego. He helped lead a five year strategic partnership with Schering AG that supported the clinical development of Generx and ultimately led Schering to purchase Collateral for approximately $160 Million. After Schering was subsequently acquired by Bayer, Mr. Reinhard and Dr. Dylan-Hyde co-founded Cardium Therapeutics to re-acquire rights to the technology and advance the Generx program as a non-surgical approach to the treatment of coronary heart disease. He is also Chief Executive Officer and President of Tissue Repair Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cardium, since August 2006. He served as a director and Chief Executive Officer of Cardium’s subsidiary InnerCool Therapies Inc., from its acquisition in March 2006 until sale of the business to Royal Philips Electronics in July 2009; and its subsidiary To Go Brands Inc., from its acquisition in September 2012 until sale of the business to Cell-Nique Corporation in November 2013. Previously, he served as a director and the Chief Executive Officer, President and Treasurer of Aries Ventures Inc. from October 20, 2005 through its merger with Cardium in January 2006. He also served as Chief Financial Officer of Aries Ventures Inc. from October 20, 2005 to November 16, 2005. For the past fifteen years, Mr. Reinhard has focused on the commercial development of innovative therapeutics and medical devices. Before founding Cardium, he was a co-founder of Collateral Therapeutics, Inc., a former Nasdaq listed public company, and served as a director (from 1995) and President (from 1999) of Collateral Therapeutics until the completion of its acquisition by the Schering AG Group (now part of Bayer HealthCare) in 2002. He continued as Chief Executive of Collateral Therapeutics through December 2004. Mr. Reinhard played a major role in effecting Collateral Therapeutics’ initial public 5 offering in 1998, and the sale of Collateral Therapeutics to Schering. From 2004-2008, Mr. Reinhard was Executive Chairman of Artes Medical, Inc., a publicly-traded medical technology company; and prior to cofounding Collateral Therapeutics, he was Vice President and Managing Director of the Henley Group, a publicly traded diversified industrial and manufacturing group, and Vice President of various public and private companies created by the Henley Group through spin-out transactions, including Fisher Scientific Group, a leading international distributor of laboratory equipment and test apparatus for the scientific community, Instrumentation Laboratory and IMED Corporation, a medical device company. Mr. Reinhard received a B.S. in Finance and an M.B.A. from Babson College.

Previously, he served as the Chief Business Officer, General Counsel, Executive Vice President and Secretary of Aries Ventures Inc. from October 20, 2005 through its merger with Cardium in January 2006. Dr. Dylan-Hyde has focused on the development of innovative biologics and devices for cardiovascular and ischemic diseases for more than fifteen years. He served as General Counsel and Vice President of Collateral Therapeutics, Inc. until its 2002 acquisition by the Schering AG Group (now part of Bayer HealthCare). Dr. Dylan-Hyde played a major role in developing Collateral’s intellectual property portfolio, in furthering its business development efforts and in advancing the company toward and through its acquisition by Schering, and continued as an executive officer and later consultant until 2005.

Medical & Scientific Literature







Generx [Ad5FGF-4]
Intracoronary gene transfer of fibroblast growth factor-5 increases blood flow and contractile function in an ischemic region of the heart. Giordano et al., Nature Medicine. 1996; 2(5):534-9.
This preclinical work demonstrated for first time that intracoronary FGF gene transfer induces angiogenesis and increased blood flow and function in ischemic regions of the pig heart, and is the foundation for the Ad5FGF-4 (Generx) clinical development program.
Increased regional function and perfusion after intracoronary delivery of adenovirus encoding fibroblast growth factor 4: report of preclinical data. Gao et al., Hum Gene Ther. 2004;15(6):574-87.
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/104303404323142024
This manuscript reports on the preclinical biodistribution and toxicology studies performed in support of Generx clinical studies. Using the pig model of stress-induced myocardial ischemia, two weeks after intracoronary injection of Ad5FGF-4, transgene protein (human FGF-4) was detected in hearts, but not in any extracardiac site, including plasma. By the highly sensitive method of PCR, Ad5FGF-4 DNA was detected in extracardiac tissues, primarily in animals treated at the highest dose, but no mRNA was detected in any tissue positive for DNA. Histological evaluations identified no evidence of toxicity in any organ examined. This work supports the safety of intracoronary delivery of Generx.
Angiogenic Gene Therapy (AGENT) trial in patients with stable angina pectoris. Grines et al., Circulation, 2002; 105(11):1291-7.
http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/105/11/1291.full.pdf
This manuscript reports on findings from AGENT-1, the first ever clinical study of intracoronary Ad5FGF-4 gene delivery in patients with stable exertional angina. Single intracoronary delivery was found to be safe, and showed a trend toward improvement in exercise treadmill time (ETT) following administration of Ad5FGF-4 (pooled active groups) compared to placebo.
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Ad5FGF-4 gene therapy and its effect on myocardial perfusion in patients with stable angina. Grines et al., J Am Coll Cardiol. 2003; 42(8):1339-47.
http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1132725
The mean change observed in Generx-treated patients was a 4.2% absolute reduction (which represents a 20% relative reduction) in the reversible perfusion defect size from baseline at eight weeks (p<0.001), while the placebo group showed only a 1.6% absolute reduction from baseline (not significant) at eight weeks following treatment. The observed treatment effect for patients receiving Generx was similar in magnitude to that reported in the literature for patients undergoing angioplasty/stent or revascularization procedures with reversible perfusion defects of comparable size at one year following these procedures.
Effects of Ad5FGF-4 in patients with angina: an analysis of pooled data from the AGENT-3 and AGENT-4 trials. Henry et al., J Am Coll Cardiol. 2007 Sep 11;50(11):1038-46
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109707019997
A by-patient analysis of the pooled data from two large, multi-center, international studies using ETT as the clinical endpoint (AGENT-3 and AGENT-4) revealed a substantial placebo response in males but not in females. Analysis of the AGENT-3 data identified a significant reduction in angina class in the Ad5FGF-4 treated patients at both 6 and 12 months and a statistically significant increase in ETT duration at 12 weeks in females. This report supports use of quantitative SPECT imaging as the clinical endpoint in order to avoid placebo effects.
Ischemia-reperfusion increases transfection efficiency of intracoronary adenovirus type 5 in pig heart in situ. Shi et al., Hum Gene Ther Methods. 2012; 23(3):204-12.
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/hgtb.2012.048
This preclinical study provides evidence that ischemia/reperfusion increases DNA uptake following intracoronary delivery of adenovirus and is the basis for the Company’s proprietary method of enhanced cardiovascular gene delivery that utilizes an intracoronary angioplasty balloon catheter to produce transient myocardial ischemia during intracoronary Generx administration.
Mechanistic, technical, and clinical perspectives in therapeutic stimulation of coronary collateral development by angiogenic growth factors. Rubanyi GM. Mol Ther. 2013 Apr;21(4):725-38 
Dr. Gabor Rubanyi, the Company’s Chief Scientific Officer, authored this comprehensive review on angiogenic growth factor therapy, highlighting the mechanistic, technical and clinical insights that have contributed to and been exploited by Taxus Cardium in the clinical development of Generx.
Cardiac Microvascular Insufficiency
Coronary microvascular dysfunction in the clinical setting: from mystery to reality. Herrmann et al., Eur Heart J. 2012; 33:2771-2781.
http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/22/2771.full.pdf
This review describes the functional and structural abnormalities of the coronary microvasculature that can lead to myocardial ischemia despite normal coronary angiograms (“microvascular angina”). It reports that, “~50% of patients undergoing angiography with signs and/or symptoms of myocardial ischemia are found to have normal, or ‘near normal (non-obstructed)’ coronary arteries”. This establishes a scientific basis for and a substantial target patient population for Generx gene therapy.
Coronary microvascular dysfunction: an update. Crea et al., Eur Heart J. 2013; 33:2771-2781.
This review identifies coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) as a third potential mechanism of myocardial ischemia (along with atherosclerotic and vasoplastic diseases), and with a patient population of 3-4 million in the U.S. alone. The four classes of CMD are described (Type 1: in the absence of myocardial diseases and obstructive CAD; Type 2: in the presence of myocardial diseases; Type 3: in obstructive CAD; Type 4: iatrogenic).
Direct myocardial revascularization and angiogenesis–how many patients might be eligible? Mukherjee et al., Am J Cardiol. 1999;84(5):598-600.
The need for non-traditional, non-surgical methods of myocardial angiogenesis such as that provided by Generx gene therapy is demonstrated by this assessment of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, in which a large percentage were found to have diffuse coronary disease involving multiple large and smaller coronary arteries, small distal vessels or other co-morbidities that make them ineligible or poor candidates for traditional methods of treatment. These “poor or no-option” patients represent approximately 12 % (over 1.0 million) of all patients with symptomatic CAD in the United States alone.
Beneficial effect of recruitable collaterals: a 10-year follow-up study in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing quantitative collateral measurements. Meier et al., Circulation. 2007;116(9):975-83.
http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/116/9/975.full.pdf+html
This independent long-term prospective study provided key evidence indicating that men and women with more recruitable collateral circulation have a better chance of surviving a heart attack than patients who have less developed collateral circulation. This important study quantitatively evaluated coronary collateral blood flow in 845 patients with coronary artery disease during a 10-year follow-up period and showed that long-term cardiac mortality was approximately 66% lower in patients with a highly developed collateral vessel blood supply (p=0.019). For the first time, this study showed the importance of collateral circulation beyond simply the relief of angina and provided further support of the potential for long term benefits from angiogenic therapy, the primary premise behind Generx’s therapeutic potential.
Assessment and impact of the human coronary collateral circulation on myocardial ischemia and outcome. Seiler C. Circ Cardiovasc Interv. 2013; 6(6):719-28.
This recent article reviews the history of and current methods for assessing collateral function and impact on myocardial ischemia. Included is a review of qualitative, semi-quantitative, and quantitative methodology, as well as a review of the literature pertaining to the favorable impact of coronary collateral development on outcomes.
