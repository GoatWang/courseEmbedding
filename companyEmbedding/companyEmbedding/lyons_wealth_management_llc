A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

Lyons Income Overlay






				Lyons Income Overlay
Lyons Income Overlay is a solution designed for investors with concentrated stock positions or other marginable securities. The goal of the strategy is to allow our clients to maintain their concentrated position while our Overlay seeks to augment portfolio income and protect capital.
Unlike covered call programs, the Lyons Income Overlay does not involve trading on the underlying stock portfolio; either directly or through options. Instead, the portfolio uses the borrowing capacity of the concentrated stock holding to fund the construction of the Overlay, which is built entirely from listed equity options on positions that are unrelated to your stock holdings. Please see important disclosures in the Lyons Income Overlay section.

Lyons Tactical Portfolio






				Lyons Tactical Portfolio
The objective of the Tactical Allocation Portfolio is to outperform the S&P 500 during extended market uptrends and long-duration market declines. A systematic approach is taken to select a portfolio of 25 stocks based upon return on capital, free cash flow, and enterprise value. We then apply the Quantitative Risk Indicator (QRI) to our portfolio to help us navigate sustained bear markets.
The portfolio focuses on our key fundamental beliefs: that quality stock selection and dividends can outperform basic indexing and that over time a strategy can be both tactical and tax friendly. The Lyons Tactical Portfolio seeks to track the performance of the Lyons Tactical Allocation Index. Please see important disclosures in the Lyons Tactical Allocation Portfolio section.

Lyons Small Cap Portfolio






				Lyons Small Cap Portfolio
The Lyons Small Cap Portfolio employs a value-based investment philosophy targeting companies with high-performing capital investments that can help sustain long-term price appreciation. We seek companies that exhibit strong balance sheets, cash flow, and internal returns, and that we perceive to be undervalued. Our process combines quantitative modeling with fundamental research, beginning with a ranking model to identify a target set of stocks as the basis for further analysis. After thorough evaluation, we select those companies with the highest relative combination of performance and value for investment in the portfolio.
The managers employ a diligent risk management process both at the security and portfolio levels. We apply individual sell discipline to exit positions that no longer represent a value to the portfolio or otherwise don't meet our criteria. Based on the firm's proprietary risk gauge, we may take temporary defensive positions in cash, Treasuries, or other short-term instruments during periods of heightened equity market risk. Such allocations may comprise all or a portion of the portfolio’s assets, and are intended to mitigate the risk of outsize losses inherent in large market declines.

Lyons Tactical Allocation Portfolio





Description
The objective of the portfolio is to achieve total return from capital appreciation and income while applying a proactive risk management approach that seeks downside protection. The portfolio invests in an equal-weighted basket of 25 dividend paying stocks selected through the manager's fundamental screening process. The portfolio applies a proprietary risk management model to determine monthly allocation to equities or Treasuries based on price rate-of-change metrics.  Based on this strategy, the portfolio allocates 100% to U.S. equities when equities are anticipated to outperform cash. When maintaining an equity allocation, portfolio holdings are rebalanced quarterly. When equities are anticipated to significantly under perform cash, the portfolio allocates 100% to a defensive position in U.S. Treasury ETFs or cash.
Available in both a Separately Managed Account and Mutual Fund.  For Mutual Fund information please go to http://www.catalystmutualfunds.com/products
 

 
The Lyons Tactical Allocation Index Total Return (“the Index”) is the exclusive property of Lyons Wealth Management, LLC (“Lyons Wealth”). Lyons Wealth has contracted with The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. (collectively, with its subsidiaries and affiliates, “NASDAQ OMX”) to calculate and maintain the Index.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

Lyons Income Overlay






				Lyons Income Overlay
Lyons Income Overlay is a solution designed for investors with concentrated stock positions or other marginable securities. The goal of the strategy is to allow our clients to maintain their concentrated position while our Overlay seeks to augment portfolio income and protect capital.
Unlike covered call programs, the Lyons Income Overlay does not involve trading on the underlying stock portfolio; either directly or through options. Instead, the portfolio uses the borrowing capacity of the concentrated stock holding to fund the construction of the Overlay, which is built entirely from listed equity options on positions that are unrelated to your stock holdings. Please see important disclosures in the Lyons Income Overlay section.

Lyons Tactical Portfolio






				Lyons Tactical Portfolio
The objective of the Tactical Allocation Portfolio is to outperform the S&P 500 during extended market uptrends and long-duration market declines. A systematic approach is taken to select a portfolio of 25 stocks based upon return on capital, free cash flow, and enterprise value. We then apply the Quantitative Risk Indicator (QRI) to our portfolio to help us navigate sustained bear markets.
The portfolio focuses on our key fundamental beliefs: that quality stock selection and dividends can outperform basic indexing and that over time a strategy can be both tactical and tax friendly. The Lyons Tactical Portfolio seeks to track the performance of the Lyons Tactical Allocation Index. Please see important disclosures in the Lyons Tactical Allocation Portfolio section.

Lyons Small Cap Portfolio






				Lyons Small Cap Portfolio
The Lyons Small Cap Portfolio employs a value-based investment philosophy targeting companies with high-performing capital investments that can help sustain long-term price appreciation. We seek companies that exhibit strong balance sheets, cash flow, and internal returns, and that we perceive to be undervalued. Our process combines quantitative modeling with fundamental research, beginning with a ranking model to identify a target set of stocks as the basis for further analysis. After thorough evaluation, we select those companies with the highest relative combination of performance and value for investment in the portfolio.
The managers employ a diligent risk management process both at the security and portfolio levels. We apply individual sell discipline to exit positions that no longer represent a value to the portfolio or otherwise don't meet our criteria. Based on the firm's proprietary risk gauge, we may take temporary defensive positions in cash, Treasuries, or other short-term instruments during periods of heightened equity market risk. Such allocations may comprise all or a portion of the portfolio’s assets, and are intended to mitigate the risk of outsize losses inherent in large market declines.
