WEXFORD CAPITALPARTNERS









About

                Wexford Capital Partners is a private investment firm focused on companies where our experience and relationships will create value for both existing shareholders and our network of investors.  We are actively seeking lower middle market industrial, consumer and financial services opportunities, including lightly stressed companies and family-owned businesses with ownership transition challenges.
            




Collegial


                            We are not driven by a specific transaction type or structure; rather we are interested in collaborating with founders and management to identify the core strengths, needs, and opportunities of current business operations.  Once a business plan is agreed upon, our role is to bring capital and human resources to achieve that plan.
                        





Capital


                            We will use our extensive knowledge of banking and capital markets to develop efficient capital structures. Our network of investors are primarily family offices and other non-institutional capital sources that are not bound by typical private equity hold periods. We prefer to partner with these investors because they will invest across the capital structure, share our interest in long-term value creation and are knowledgeable about interests and concerns of the family and entrepreneurial businesses.
                        





Relationships


                            After our investment, we will provide strategic and financial perspectives from our extensive network of industry and professional contacts.  The experience and capabilities of these individuals have proven to be a valuable resource to management teams.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
