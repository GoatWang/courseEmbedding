The ​Technology ...















​Our lineage of innovation & entrepreneurship starts with the "Wizard of Menlo Park" himself, Thomas A. Edison. Born out of a decade-long effort at General Electric's Global Research Center, Menlo Micro is bringing to the market a series of technology innovations that have enabled us to reinvent one of the most essential and fundamental building blocks required for nearly every electronic system imaginable....the switch.Switches are ubiquitous and perform various functions in electronic systems.  Some switch AC or DC signals, and others switch radio frequency (RF) signals.  Some are mechanical switches that open and close a circuit with physical contacts, and others are solid-state switches that use a semiconductor-based device to perform that function.  All switches are designed for specific application requirements, and all come with tradeoffs.What's different about a Menlo Micro switch?  It's all in the materials...Driven by the extreme operating conditions required by General Electric's industrial businesses, the GE Global Research team was led to look at the micro-mechanical switch from an entirely different perspective.  That different approach led to a deep understanding of failure modes, and in turn, the development of a unique set of patented metal alloys and processing techniques that enable reliable operation without sacrificing performance.With the core technology development completed and qualified for production in GE systems, the Menlo Micro team is bringing high-performance switch products to multiple end markets, with a goal of revolutionizing the way electronic systems are designed. Some of the key attributes of the Menlo Micro switch technology include:Size.  Board space and weight are at a premium in many applications.  Traditional mechanical switches take up lots of space, have limited number of channels, and in some cases need to be manually assembled.  Menlo Micro switching elements are smaller than the width of a human hair and are architected to be scalable, depending on the power ratings required.  All switches are manufactured using automated wafer-level processes and tools.  They are so small we can fit hundreds of them in a space smaller than 10mm2.Speed.  Making mechanical structures small also means you can make them move fast.  Make them real small, and you can make them open and close real fast.  A typical mechanical switch might operate in a few milliseconds, whereas Menlo Micro switches can operate 1000x faster, in only a few microseconds.  This can have enormous implications on systems that were previously limited in performance by how fast they could reconfigure, or open and close critical circuits.Power Handling.   This is an area where Menlo Micro completely throws conventional wisdom out the window.  When faced with the prospect of handling higher power levels, most people think bigger.  More mass, more metal, larger air gaps between conductors.  We took a different approach.  We make everything smaller and move the electrical contacts closer and closer together.  Our miniaturized switches and scalable architecture allows us to handle 100s of volts and 10s of amps without arcing. Freidrich Paschen would be proud.Power Efficiency.  In an increasing number of systems, power is getting more and more expensive.  When you're working off a battery, every 0.1dB and every microamp counts.  Both RF and AC/DC losses need to be balanced with amplification and in some cases extra power supplies.  This is where the Menlo Micro technology really shines.  We can scale our switches to have ultra-low losses, from 1 ohm down to a few milliohms.  And not only that, but our electrostatic-driven actuator means that a single switch only needs a few pA to function.  That's 0.000000000001 Amps for those who are counting.Reliability.  When you are developing products to meet the needs of businesses that serve markets like healthcare, aviation, and other mission-critical industrial applications, reliability is not an after-thought, it's the primary design criteria.  In the end, that's why we are here.  Our mechanical switching device has lifetimes more than 1000x longer than traditional mechanical switches; not millions of cycles, but 10s of billions of cycles without degrading performance.  Even more important than the performance that's been demonstrated to date, is the deep understanding in material science, reliability and failure analysis that enables us to model and predict failures so we can push the technology even further.  We have lots of performance enhancements planned in the very near future.These are just some of the features that have been demonstrated so far...and the fun part is that we're just getting started. As we continue to build up the Menlo Micro team, and engage with dozens and dozens of innovative customers, our product capability will expand and our innovation will never stop.  Innovation and entrepreneurship: it is in our lineage and part of our DNA.

GE Launches MEMS StartupSolution to switching issue

LAKE WALES, Fla. — GE�s Global Research Center has spun-off a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) startup called Menlo Microsystems Inc. (Irvine, Calif.), funded by General Electric (GE) Ventures, Paladin Capital Group and partners Corning (a supplier) and MicroSemi Corp. (a distributor to adjacent markets). Its only product category — MEM digital switches — can be used in aerospace, automated test equipment (ATE), next generation 5G mobile handsets / basestations, industrial Internet of Things (IoTs), battery management, home-automation, electric vehicles and medical instrumentation applications.

Spawned by what it claims is the industry's first reliable MEMS digital switch, Menlo Microsystems claims it is already a success with over 35,000 units in GE systems that have been field-tested before the spin-off. However, the road to success in what would seem a simple problem — converting a mechanical switch, or relay, into an electronic version — is littered with the remains of startups whose poor reliability eventually forced the companies out of the market.



GE's Global Research Center invented its microelectromechanical system (MEMS) electronic switch invented a proprietary alloy (blue and green) which could be opened and closed in microseconds by an electrostatic gate (red) with only 0.4 ohms resistance when closed.

What makes GE Research's architecture used in Menlo Microsystems MEMS digital switches different? According to its chief executive officer (CEO) Russ Garcia, formerly CEO of MEMS startup Wispry and executive vice president of MicroSemi, the answer is focused on the proprietary alloy that GE engineered specifically for digital switches with a lifetime of over a billion switching events.
"Our key differentiation is an alloy developed specifically for reliability and already proven in over 35,000 MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] machines made by GE," Garcia told EE Times in an exclusive interview. "Originally developed for remote circuit breakers, GE adapted the alloy to power hundreds of volts and 10s of amps at RF [radio frequencies] with linearity and low insertion loss."



The GE Research Center design is scalable by adding more units in series for higher voltages, and more in parallel to for higher currents. Here model MM3100 uses eight in series to handle 25 volts and six in parallel to carry 1 amp for a 25 Watt application.

The success of the MRI applications gave the GE engineer who invented it, Chris Keimel — now a co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) — and a GE Ventures executive (the other co-founder) the idea to spin-off Menlo Microsystems into a separate company.
"GE only makes systems, not components, so it made sense to spin-off Menlo Microsystems to serve the many other industrial and consumer applications that GE does not serve," Garcia told EE Times.
Today GE is still manufacturing the digital switches, consisting of an electrostatic-gate activated cantilever (see figure) that can handle milliwatts to kilowatts by using multiple units (see second figure). The higher volumes that Menlo Microsystems is hoping for has it actively engaging independent foundries to be ready by the end of the decade when 5G handsets and basestations are in full swing.



By 2019, Menlo Microsystems and its partner Microsemi plan to tap a total available market (TAM) of almost $14 billion with its dual strategy of licensing and manufacturing MEMS digital switches.
