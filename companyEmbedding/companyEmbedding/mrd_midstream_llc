What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

B. MRD Operating’s

(i) The obligations hereunder with

the Primary Term (as defined in the Existing Gas Processing
Agreement).
 
3



(ii) If MRD Operating owns or
acquires any AMI Interests that are not dedicated and/or committed
under the Existing Midstream Agreements, then MRD Operating shall
promptly and exclusively dedicate and commit the Hydrocarbons
produced from such AMI Interests to the JV for the provision of
Midstream Services.

(iii) If any Hydrocarbons produced
from AMI Interests are released from the dedication of the Existing
Midstream Agreements, MRD Operating agrees to promptly and
exclusively dedicate and commit such Hydrocarbons to the JV for the
provision of Midstream Services. Further, upon the expiration of
the primary term in any Existing Midstream Agreement, if MRD
Operating so elects, MRD Operating may extend the term of such
Existing Midstream Agreement but insofar, and only insofar, as such
agreement relates to gathering services through pipeline systems
already constructed and completed at the time of such expiration,
and associated compression, treating and dehydration services being
provided under such Midstream Agreement prior to such extension. In
no event shall MRD Operating (x) extend or expand the terms
and provisions of any of the Existing Midstream Agreements with
respect to any Midstream Services (including, without limitation,
processing) other than such gathering services and associated
compression, treating and dehydration services described in the
preceding sentence, or (y) increase any of its volume
commitments of Hydrocarbons already dedicated and/or committed
therein.

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if (x) MRD Operating dedicates Hydrocarbons produced from AMI
Interests to the JV for the provision of Midstream Services,
(y) the provision of such Midstream Services requires Other
Operations, and (z) neither the JV nor any of its equity
owners or their respective Affiliates elect to proceed with such
Other Operations pursuant to the procedures set forth in the
limited liability company agreement of the JV then in effect (the
“ JV LLC Agreement ”), then the JV’s
exclusive rights to provide such Midstream Services, and in the
Hydrocarbons attributable thereto, shall be automatically released
from the dedication herein without any further action on any
Person’s part.

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if (x) MRD Operating dedicates Hydrocarbons produced from AMI
Interests to the JV for the provision of Midstream Services,
(y) the provision of such Midstream Services requires Other
Operations, and (z) the facilities to be constructed pursuant
to such Other Operations are not available at the time MRD
Operating is ready to deliver such Hydrocarbons to such facilities,
then the JV’s exclusive rights to provide such Midstream
Services, and in the Hydrocarbons attributable thereto, shall be
automatically released, on a temporary basis, from the dedication
herein without any further action on any Person’s part, until
such time as such facilities are available.

(vi) If (x) MRD Operating
dedicates Hydrocarbons produced from AMI Interests to the JV for
the provision of Midstream Services, (y) the provision of such
Midstream Services requires Other Operations, and (z) the JV
does not elect to proceed with such Other Operations, but an equity
owner or an Affiliate of such equity owner elects to proceed with
such Other Operations pursuant to the procedures set forth in the
JV LLC Agreement, then the JV’s exclusive rights to provide
such Midstream Services,
 
4



and in the Hydrocarbons attributable
thereto, shall be automatically released from the dedication herein
without any further action on any Person’s part, and MRD
Operating shall dedicate such Hydrocarbons to the equity owner or
Affiliate who proceeds with such Other Operations.

(vii) For the avoidance of doubt, no
release of Hydrocarbons contemplated in the preceding paragraphs
shall include a release of any Hydrocarbons dedicated and committed
under the Existing Gas Processing Agreement. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the release of Hydrocarbons dedicated
and committed under the Existing Gas Processing Agreement shall be
governed by the provisions of the Existing Gas Processing
Agreement.

C. Exclusivity Regarding the
Provision of Midstream Services . MRD Operating and PTX, and
each of their respective Subsidiaries, shall not invest in, provide
services to, receive any consideration in respect of, or otherwise
engage in, contract for, or conduct any Midstream Services in the
AMI, except (i) Other Operations by and through the JV or any
of its Subsidiaries, (ii) as provided in the Pipeline
Agreements, this Agreement and the JV LLC Agreement and
(iii) any agreement executed by MRD Operating after the
Effective Date for the provision of Midstream Services on an
interruptible and/or uncommitted basis for Hydrocarbons released
from the dedication of this Agreement in accordance with Section
II.B or pursuant to one or more Pipeline Agreements.

non-assigning Parties shall be null and void.

Agreement, together with the Pipeline Agreements, the Existing Gas
Processing Agreement and any future agreements executed between MRD

a change in, any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or
shall constitute a waiver of, or consent to a change in, any other
provisions hereof, nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing
waiver unless expressly provided in the waiver.

shall be deemed modified to conform with the requirements of such
law or regulation.

(vi) Severability . The
invalidity of any one or more provisions of this Agreement will not
affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole, and in case of

What Is the Midstream Industry?

Most natural gas in the U.S. must be processed before it reaches the marketplace (companies) and end-users (people like you). Midstream is the link between natural gas being produced at a wellhead and then filling society’s need for energy and by-products.

Where do we fit in? If you take a hot shower, heat your home or use anything made from rubber, plastics or synthetics, we were part of providing it. If you save on heating or cooling costs through home insulation, we help make it possible. If you have cables running through your home or office, you benefit from the energy we provide.



What Exactly Is Natural Gas?

Like oil and coal, natural gas is a fossil fuel. Twenty-five percent of the energy consumed in the U.S. is natural gas, making it the second-largest source of energy; and that’s growing.
 
It is colorless, shapeless, odorless and tasteless. When burned, natural gas creates a great deal of energy ― but with few emissions.



Why and How Is It Processed?

Raw natural gas is processed to ensure it meets quality regulations, is safe to use, and to make it a useful and marketable product for society.

It’s also processed to extract valuable liquids. These liquids are called natural gas liquids (NGLs). They include ethane, propane and butane. Companies use NGLs to produce products containing rubber, plastics or synthetics.

After processing, our trucks transport NGLs to a facility where NGLs are fractionated into other compounds.



What Type of Plants Does DCP Have? 

Our plants are centralized processing facilities, located near or within major production fields. They process raw natural gas turning it into pipeline-quality residue gas, treating it to remove contaminants or impurities and creating valuable NGLs.

Several types of natural gas processing plants are used throughout the industry to produce pipeline quality "dry" gas. The type of plant and technology used is greatly dependent upon the geologic nature of the gas being processed.  In addition to centralized plants which process gas near the source of production, there are specialized plants.

Sweetening and Treating Plants
Specifically designed to remove large quantities of sulfur and carbon dioxide and other impurities from an otherwise dry natural gas stream.

Straddle Plants
In addition to processing done at the wellhead and at centralized processing plants, processing is also accomplished at straddle extraction plants. Straddle plants are located on interstate or intrastate pipelines that carry pipeline quality gas.

Fractionation Plants
The majority of NGLs are sent downstream to be fractionated into their individual components at specialized plants.



What Is Fractionation? 

Fractionation results in the separation of NGLs into their individual components. It’s based on the different boiling points of the individual hydrocarbons in the NGL stream. From the lightest to the heaviest, the NGLs are passed through a series of distillation towers named for the extracted hydrocarbon: ethane, propane and butane.

These hydrocarbons are then provided to locations where gas gets traded. Several of the market hubs are located at DCP facilities, including Spindletop Storage Hub and the Carthage Hub, part of our East Texas system.



How Is It Transported?

As gas moves through the different processing phases, it’s compressed and expanded as needed. Once the gas has been fully processed and is ready to leave the plant, it’s re-compressed in a residue compressor to achieve sufficient pressure to be sent from the plant outlet to a mainline transmission pipeline.



Is This Process Safe? 

Pipelines provide the safest method of transportation for natural gas and NGLs. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s records show pipelines consistently have the highest safety record among all major fuel transportation systems.
 
Safety is our core value. We adhere to the strictest safety regulations. We monitor our pipelines 24 hours a day and conduct regular inspections, routine tests and equipment maintenance. We also train our employees and all local emergency service providers to ensure response preparedness in the unlikely event of an emergency.
 
But, it is important to remember that you can do your part, too, by practicing safe digging. Always call 811 before you dig. It’s the only way to know what’s below.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
