Architect Once Envisioned a Guggenheim of GroceriesBy David W. Dunlap 

PhotoWilliam N. Breger with a model of his helical supermarket of the 1960s.Credit Robert Walker/The New York Times
William N. Breger, who designed what may be the oddest synagogue in New York, has died at 92. The TriBeCa Synagogue was not his wackiest idea, however. That would have been a circular, automated, Guggenheim-like supermarket.
In 1959, Mr. Breger was commissioned by the Daitch-Shopwell chain (now Food Emporium) to design a Supermarket of the ’60s — “where shopping will be fast and fun.”
Shoppers would be whisked by elevator to the top of a seven-level helix and receive markers with code numbers. A moving sidewalk would take them down the ramps, past every item Daitch had to offer. They had merely to step off the sidewalk whenever they saw something they wanted, and mark it with their code. The marked items would be sent independently down conveyor belts.
At the bottom of the helix, shoppers would pay through an automated device and get a receipt that could be exchanged for the goods at a pick-up point in the parking lot.
Fun? Maybe the first time. Fast? Maybe never.
Daitch-Shopwell executives said any resemblance to Frank Lloyd Wright’s newly opened Guggenheim Museum was “purely coincidental.” Actually, the arrangement sounds more like a precursor to the B&H pick-up system. In any case, Mr. Breger’s supermarket was never built.

50 Years Later, Questions Over Who Designed a World’s Fair DomeBy David W. Dunlap 


Slide Show



Imagine an elegant, inverted, 175-foot-wide sieve covering a half-acre of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. Within it, long-necked cattle egrets glide overhead. A scarlet macaw scolds loudly from a branch, while northern bobwhite quails rustle the underbrush. Flashes of sapphire blue — the bills of Argentine ruddy ducks — glint against the dark waters of a small pond.
Here is where Bird Week and Building Blocks meet: at the Queens Zoo Aviary, a geodesic dome constructed 50 years ago as the 2,100-seat World’s Fair Pavilion, transformed for the 1965 fair into the Churchill Center and then moved a half-mile west to serve as a birdhouse for the zoo, which opened in 1968.

There may not be as many twists to its story as there are facets on its semi-spherical aluminum frame, but there are plenty enough.
The latest is the question of who gets credit for the dome, one of the most resilient, handsome and purposeful of the generally odd lot of World’s Fair pavilions. For years, it has been attributed to R. Buckminster Fuller, the designer and inventor most closely associated with geodesic domes. These lightweight structures, composed of tubular struts arranged in triangles and polygons, can be assembled quickly to span great volumes at relatively little expense.
It is Fuller’s name that appears on a sign at the entrance to the aviary.
But a little-known architect, Thomas C. Howard, 82, of Raleigh, N.C., seems to have had a lot more to do with it. He was the president of Synergetics Inc. in Raleigh, which held the contract for the dome; Eggers & Higgins of New York designed the rest of the building.
These firms proved to be life savers. William Whipple Jr., chief engineer of the fair, said the budget for the pavilion, which served as the fair’s assembly hall, had originally been set at $1 million. But when the first design was put out for bids in 1963, none came in for less than $1.75 million.
“With opening day only a year away,” Mr. Whipple wrote in the June 1964 issue of Civil Engineering magazine, “all bids were rejected and an entirely new concept was sought that would fulfill the same requirements but cost not more than half as much. After a rapid examination of various unorthodox alternatives, it was decided to use as the roof a geodesic dome.” The revised design cost $950,000. The pavilion was finished just in time.
On Jan. 24, 1965, between the fair’s two seasons, Sir Winston Churchill died. Revered in the United States as the British prime minister who stood up to Nazi Germany in the most hopeless hours of World War II, Churchill seemed to be a natural subject for a new attraction.
PhotoThe dome when it was part of the Churchill Pavilion at the 1965 World's Fair.Credit Bill Cotter
Within the dome, Philip George designed an exhibit centered on a reproduction of the study at Chartwell, Churchill’s country home. Paintings by Churchill and his special passport as an honorary American citizen were among the displays.
The tribute was not without a marketing strategy. The 1964 season had not been nearly as popular or lucrative as officials had hoped. So they scrambled to find ways to entice visitors who had avoided the fair before and to lure back those who had already seen it.
Even before the fair reopened in 1965, the dome was being envisioned as a prospective birdhouse. The transformation, including the addition of an elevated walkway at treetop level, was designed by Clarke & Rapuano and Andrews & Clark.
The aviary, an open enclosure under wire mesh, was plagued by problems, including malevolent visitors who grabbed birds or threw stones at them. After being closed for many years, it reopened in 1992, renovated by Mark K. Morrison Landscape Architecture.
Katrina Howard Fairley is now lobbying to ensure that her father, Mr. Howard, is recognized as the original designer in the long list of architects involved with the building. Those responsible for maintaining Mr. Fuller’s legacy said her assertions may have merit.
The executive director of the Buckminster Fuller Institute in Brooklyn, Elizabeth Thompson, said Mr. Fuller lectured globally about geodesic domes, on which he held patents, and sent business to companies like Synergetics, composed of his followers.
Jaime L. Snyder, Mr. Fuller’s grandson and co-executor of the Estate of R. Buckminster Fuller in Santa Barbara, Calif., said, “The Synergetics Inc. story is important history which needs to be told.”
Speaking of his famous grandfather, Mr. Snyder said: “I know he thought very highly of Mr. Howard’s skills — once commenting to me that he was one of the persons who best understood his geodesic design principles. We simply have never been privy to any documentation about the World’s Fair Pavilion, nor other Synergetics Inc. designs that would shed any light on this matter.”
Where the pavilion once stood — opposite the Festival of Gas — there is now the Buzz Vollmer Playground, named for Arnold H. Vollmer, an engineer and landscape architect. The playground was designed by Johansson & Walcavage.
At least, that’s what the sign says.

Scholarly Perspectives on Inscription at the 9/11 Memorial MuseumBy David W. Dunlap 

PhotoAn excerpt from the Loeb Classical Library edition of "Aeneid."Credit 

“No day shall erase you from the memory of time,” says the inscription on the repository of unidentified remains at the National September 11 Memorial Museum, which opens next month. The line — “nulla dies umquam memori vos eximet aevo” — is taken from Virgil’s “Aeneid,” in which “you” are not nameless, numberless, innocent citizens, but two bloodthirsty young Trojan soldiers. The Times asked a few classicists to share their thoughts about the appropriateness of this quotation. Here are three responses:
PhotoHelen MoralesCredit Spencer Bruttig, UCSB
Helen Morales
Professor of Classics
University of California, Santa Barbara
One way of looking at it is this: if we take into account its original context, the quotation is more applicable to the aggressors in the 9/11 tragedy than to those honored by the memorial. After all, Nisus and Euryalus were on what became a suicide mission; before their inevitable deaths they were high on killing the enemy. Virgil’s line memorializing them is ironic. So my first reaction is that the quotation is shockingly inappropriate for the U.S. victims of the 9/11 attack.
But my second reaction is that this may be a productive irony. Which is to say that the quotation makes us remember the suicidal killers of 9/11 as well as their victims. Remember with horror, anger, disbelief, to be sure, but remember them nonetheless. And wonder, as might Virgil’s readers have wondered of Nisus and Euryalus, what drives young men to commit such atrocities. This may not be the intention of the designers of the memorial, who quite probably have used Virgil as a rent-a-quote Latin author, but monuments often exceed the expectations of their creators.

A Flashlight’s Peek Inside a Sculptor’s MasterpieceBy David W. Dunlap 


Video

Conserving a General and His Horse


The reporter David W. Dunlap visits the monument of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, a decorated Civil War hero, at the southeast corner of Central Park.

                By Axel Gerdau on                                                    Publish Date August 9, 2013.

It is Fifth Avenue’s most exclusive space, in one of its most public landmarks.
How exclusive? No one has been inside since 1990. And no one who has more than a 32-inch waist can dream of getting inside. (That includes this reporter.)
But the space is briefly open again for inspection, allowing at least a peek inside with flashlights and mirrors.
“It looks like something from Jules Verne,” said Christopher J. Nolan, the vice president for planning, design and construction at the Central Park Conservancy.
Mr. Nolan is right. The interior of the Sherman Monument at the southeast corner of Central Park — a sculptural masterpiece by Augustus Saint-Gaudens — really does look like something out of “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea”; equal parts organic, mechanical, equine and steampunk.
The 110-year-old monument at Grand Army Plaza, at Fifth Avenue and Central Park South, is undergoing its first significant restoration since 1990. This fall, repaired and regilded, it will be on view again.
A four-story cocoon of scaffolding now surrounds the sculpture. It affords a close-up view of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, the Union leader who marched through Georgia, believed war was hell and sat many hours for Saint-Gaudens; a winged Victory whose horror suggests she knows at what price victories are won; and a mount modeled on a high-jumping show horse named Ontario, which the artist admired at Madison Square Garden, and on the horse of Selene from the Parthenon.
Inside the cavity of the horse’s body, under a flashlight’s glare, one sees sinuous sections of cast bronze bolted together with such precision that the hairbreadth seams are almost invisible from the exterior.
Without a flashlight, pinpoints of daylight can be seen marking the location of weepholes — holes that were deliberately cut into the lower parts of the sculpture to allow rainwater and melted snow to drain out. Some holes have been blocked by iron pins that were used in the casting process but broke off over the years.
That was what Matthew Reiley was fishing for last week, with a magnet attached to a slender telescoping rod. Mr. Reiley is the associate director of conservation at the Central Park Conservancy, which is responsible for maintaining all the park’s monuments, statues and fountains. As M. C. Reiley, he is also a sculptor in cast metal.
As he gingerly extracted a heavily rusted six-inch-long pin, Mr. Reiley said the sight of such detritus conjured the ghosts of the original fabricators. “It’s a piece of junk,” he said, “but I’m in love. As a foundryman, it’s like we’re brothers.”
“The quality of this casting is unparalleled,” Mr. Reiley said.
A few feet away, John Harrigan, a conservator for Central Park who is also a figurative sculptor in his own right, was painstakingly welding and gently working the palm frond carried in Victory’s left hand, to strengthen the deteriorated junctures between leaves and stalk and then return the metal to its smooth, slender profile.
“This is where art, conservation and dentistry all meet,” Mr. Nolan said.
Even the hatch into the interior, invisible to any passerby, has been molded to fit perfectly into the contours of the horse’s croup, or rump. Ordinarily, the hatch is covered by a bronze version of a crupper strap, which runs from the saddle to a loop around the horse’s tail. The crupper strap in the Sherman Monument can be unscrewed and pulled aside to allow the hatch door to be lifted off.
The artist’s attention to detail, which bordered on the obsessive, is everywhere evident. The copyright notice on the left rear hoof is not just MCMIII, but May MCMIII.
“He didn’t speak a lot about his art, but he did say that because sculpture lasts so long, it’s a crime to do anything but the very best,” said Henry J. Duffy, the museum curator at the Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site in Cornish, N.H., and an adviser to the conservancy on the Sherman Monument.
A bigger picture emerges from the sum of these details.
The Sherman Monument is surely one of the most glorious public sculptures in New York, often overlooked because it is such a familiar sight, lording it over the horse-drawn carriages, pigeons, tourists, pigeons, food vendors, pigeons, office workers and pigeons that crowd Grand Army Plaza.
“Saint Gaudens thought it was the best work he ever did — and that’s saying a lot,” Mr. Duffy said. That would place the Sherman Monument, in the artist’s eyes, ahead of such landmarks as the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial, opposite the State House in Boston, and the Adams Memorial in the Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington.
“In that piece, Saint-Gaudens really brought the equestrian genre to another level,” Mr. Duffy said. “The animal represents action. The man represents intellect. But then he adds allegory. It brings us out of the ordinary and almost into the spiritual.”

Landmarks in History of Gay Rights, Found and LostBy David W. Dunlap

A year ago, if the old Portofino at 206 Thompson Street in Greenwich Village was remembered at all, it would have been as the restaurant where Elaine Kaufman cut her teeth in the early 1960s, before opening her own place uptown.

This year, now the Malt House, it is a landmark in American history — minor, to be sure, but a landmark all the same. The case of United States v. Windsor, which culminated on Wednesday when the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, can be traced to an evening in 1963 when Edith S. Windsor met Thea Clara Spyer over dinner at Portofino. After half a lifetime together, they were married in 2007.
The rediscovery of Portofino is a reminder that social landmarks don’t make their significance readily apparent. A bit of context is often needed to appreciate the triumphs, disasters and dramas that have played out in these buildings. Read more…

More Than Just ‘Endangered,’ a J.F.K. Terminal Is to Be DemolishedBy David W. Dunlap

Building BlocksHow the city looks and feels — and why it got that way.
PhotoCredit 
With its elliptical four-acre parasol roof — cantilevered so far out that it almost seemed to be floating over the tarmac — Terminal 3 has long been a distinctive remnant of early jet travel and an emblem of Pan American World Airways, once considered the most glamorous American carrier (when “glamour” and “airline” could occupy the same sentence without irony). Pan Am called it the Worldport. Almost everyone else thought of it as a flying saucer.
By extending the roof 114 feet out from the terminal, through a cable system that made the top of the building look like an ensemble of small suspension bridges, Pan Am’s architects sought to protect passengers from the rain and snow. “It will eliminate the huddled dash through bad weather by extending the roof like a huge oblong umbrella over the aircraft parking space,” Richard Witkin wrote in The New York Times in 1957 as he described the plan.

It’s General Sherman’s Time to Shine, but Not Too MuchBy David W. Dunlap 


Slide Show



General Sherman, still marching through Georgia these many years later, has completely lost his luster.

So much gold has eroded from the monumental equestrian statue of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in Grand Army Plaza on Fifth Avenue that the statue looks more like a work in tarnished brass than in gilded bronze. It is dull, streaked and pock-marked. The deterioration was rendered all the more visible after the Halloween snowstorm of 2011 destroyed all 10 Bradford callery pear trees that had ringed the monument and provided a bit of a screen.
That was when the Central Park Conservancy, a private, nonprofit organization that manages the park, knew it had to begin planning a renovation of the two-block plaza in Manhattan. New trees were needed, of course. So was new paving. And the general?
“He’s not quite as victorious as he could be,” said Christopher Nolan, the vice president of the conservancy for planning, design and construction. Read more…

Or at least that is how it may feel next year when the Fulton Center opens in Lower Manhattan and its artistic centerpiece — a curving, 79-foot-high net of reflective aluminum diamonds set in a stainless-steel tracery — sends ambient daylight into mezzanines, passageways and perhaps even passenger platforms.
The structure, “Sky Reflector-Net” by James Carpenter, is the largest single work ever commissioned by Arts for Transit and Urban Design, a unit of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It has just been installed within the conical dome of the Fulton Center at Broadway and Fulton Street, designed by Grimshaw Architects. The center is the monumental headhouse for five stations serving the 2, 3, 4, 5, A, C, J, R and Z lines.
The “Sky Reflector-Net” cost about $2.1 million. The total budget for the Fulton Center is $1.4 billion, almost twice as much as the original estimate in 2003.
Above all, the artwork is intended to help travelers orient themselves in this labyrinth, which was built piecemeal over the years.

Another Summer Nears Without Chase Manhattan PlazaBy David W. Dunlap 


Slide Show



It took “both imagination and a sense of citizenship to clear an open plaza on some of the city’s most valuable land and to throw it open to the light of the sun — and to the public.”
Those were the words of David Rockefeller, the president of Chase Manhattan Bank, when 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza opened in 1961. He was speaking about himself, but he happened to be right.

Spared Demolition, an 1889 Building Gets a Second LifeBy David W. Dunlap

To create a modern subway interchange in Lower Manhattan, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority first had to contend with an exquisite antique, one that stood eight stories tall.

Ten years ago, the dilapidated Corbin Building, completed in 1889 at Broadway and John Street, seemed destined for demolition. It was in the way of the authority’s planned Fulton Street Transit Center, intended to impose order on the chaotic convergence of subway lines at Fulton Street, thereby helping downtown recover from the 2001 attack.
Today, the facade of the Corbin Building is an ornament in Lower Manhattan. Cleaned and restored, it sits like a ruddy little gem in the Broadway canyon, richly decorated with terra-cotta flora and fauna, belted by alternating bands of  varied sandstone, capped at either end by pyramidal peaks. Monumental arches march down John Street like an aqueduct, enlivened by carmine-colored cast-iron window bays.
Inside, it turns out, the architectural delights continue. Read more…

David W. Dunlap

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

David W. Dunlap is an American journalist who works as a reporter for The New York Times. He currently writes a regular column, Building Blocks, that looks at the New York metropolitan area through its architecture, infrastructure, spaces, and places.[1] He has extensively documented the rebuilding of the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks in 2001. He began writing about landmarks in 1981, when he was evicted from the New York Biltmore Hotel so that he would not be able to see its interior being demolished.[2]
He began his career as a clerk to James Reston in 1975, became a graphics editor in 1976, and then reporter in 1981. Between 1994 and 1999, Dunlap covered gay, lesbian, and AIDS issues for The New York Times. He was the first reporter to officially cover the "gay and lesbian beat".[3] The New York Times decided to officially document news about gay and lesbian communities after the AIDS-related death of Times reporter Jeffrey Schmalz in November 1993. Dunlap was sometimes criticized for covering the news from a politically left-leaning position.[3]
Awards[edit]
Dunlap won the Citation of Excellence award from the American Institute of Architects. In 1992, he received the American Planning Association's New York Metro Chapter journalism award; other winners have included Brendan Gill, Paul Goldberger, Kenneth T. Jackson, and Elizabeth Kolbert.[4][5]

                           From modest chapels to majestic cathedrals, and historic synagogues to modern mosques and Buddhist temples: this photo-filled,
                              pocket-size guidebook presents 1,079 houses of worship in Manhattan and lays to rest the common perception that skyscrapers,

                              New York as a truly vibrant center of community and cultural diversity. Published in conj

                                 published in the "New York Times" on June 26, 1995. Discusses Austrian Josef Kohout, who was sent to a concentration camp
                                 in Bavaria, Germany, because he was homosexual. States that, even after the camps were liberated by Allied forces, homosexual
                                 prisoners were officially regarded as criminals, rather than as political prisoners. Notes that Kohout's journal and other
                                 items are displayed at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C

1959-75 | The Rise and Fall of the West (Side)David W. Dunlap

A recently installed sign in a West End Avenue park has answered the mystery of the runic stones visible from West 64th Street. They once served as an embankment for the Hudson River Railroad tracks.
Unfortunately — for newspaper historians, at least — the sign makes no mention of what else was on the site from 1959 to 1975: an enormous printing plant that was intended to be the foundation of a new headquarters for The New York Times.
At the time, The Times was quartered in a 15-story building at 229 West 43rd Street that it had constructed in 1913 and expanded three times. It made for implausible and, at times, almost impossible logistics. The newspaper was, in essence, operating a factory around the clock in the most densely populated entertainment district in America.
Because of limited storage capacity in the building, newsprint had to be trucked in constantly. Tractor-trailers had to jackknife into docks on the street. Throughout the night, the process was reversed, as delivery trucks sped copies of the papers to homes, newsstands, railway stations and airports. All the while, thousands of people swarmed around the active loading bays, on their way to restaurants, movies, Broadway shows and more illicit pleasures.

1965 | A Half Century of Civil Rights Coverage BeginsDavid W. Dunlap

To those who grew up reading The Times’s coverage of civil rights, the byline over the front-page obituary of Julian Bond on Monday was almost as familiar a name as Mr. Bond’s: “By Roy Reed.”
Fifty years ago, that byline began appearing on the front page; never more memorably, perhaps, than in the paper of March 8, 1965, the day after “Bloody Sunday.”
And this week it appeared again, on an obit Mr. Reed filed years ago. “I really had forgotten I’d written it until my daughter called and said, ‘You had an article on Page 1 of today’s Times,” he said by telephone from Hogeye, Ark., where he’s lived for many years. Read more…

1896 | ‘Without Fear or Favor’David W. Dunlap

Political madness has surely gripped the nation when a Fox News journalist publicly embraces a 119-year-old guiding principle of The New York Times, as Megyn Kelly did this week by vowing — Donald Trump’s taunts notwithstanding — to “continue doing my job without fear or favor.”
Consciously or not, Ms. Kelly borrowed from one of the most venerable playbooks in the field: the modestly titled “Business Announcement” written by Adolph S. Ochs on April 18, 1896, after he had assumed control of The Times, and published on Page 4, the editorial page, the next morning. Read more…

1943 | In Tehran, The Times’s International Edition Is BornDavid W. Dunlap

David W. Dunlap is a Metro reporter and writes the Building Blocks column. He has worked at The Times for 40 years.
Tehran. Cradle of Islamic revolution. Crucible of anti-American hatred.
And birthplace of the international edition of The New York Times.
It was June 1943, the middle of World War II. Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher, and his assistant, James Reston (who went on to a distinguished career of his own), flew into Tehran from Habbaniyah, Iraq, aboard a Boeing 307 Stratoliner that had been pressed into service by the Army Transport Command.
They were there to meet Maj. Gen. Donald H. Connolly at the Persian Gulf Service Command Headquarters. His soldiers were engaged in supplying Allied troops, one of the “least glamorous tasks in the whole global war,” Turner Catledge of The Times wrote. “These are the men who are shoving the goods to Russia along the rail and motor route from Persian Gulf ports.”
General Connolly faced a crisis in morale.
Most of his men were doing the same kind of work (and for a lot less money) that they did back home, running railroads, driving trucks and repairing machinery, Mr. Catledge reported. They had to cope with temperatures that ranged at least 120 degrees, between desert floors and mountain passes. They were isolated in their posts. “And most onerous of all, perhaps, were the monotony and the lack of obvious connection with combat,” Mr. Catledge wrote.
Mr. Sulzberger had been studying morale issues in the armed forces for two years. He proposed a solution. It turned out, he said, that Camp Lee, in Virginia, possessed strong morale because its commanding officer, a former newspaperman, made it a priority to keep the troops informed. “The enlisted personnel at Camp Lee understood they were in uniform because Axis madmen had set out to overrun the world,” Meyer Berger wrote in “The Story of The New York Times.”

The Times, Mr. Sulzberger told General Connolly, would, at its own expense, furnish an eight-page tabloid to the armed forces, called Overseas Weekly. It would essentially be a pint-sized version of what was then known as The News of the Week in Review section of The Times.
However, the publisher said, there was a fly in the ointment. A very big fly. Army Special Services jumped on the proposal at first, but suddenly balked, fearing that other newspapers would be infuriated if The New York Times was the sole designated supplier of news to the troops.
An aide to General Connolly more or less whispered in his ear: Sir, you could requisition The Times from the Army Exchange Service as a commodity — just like toothpaste — to be carried at the PX.
A deal was struck. Page forms known as matrices, or mats, were cast in plastic at The Times’s headquarters on West 43rd Street in Manhattan, then flown to Iran. They weighed six ounces. Army bookkeepers could not accept a commodity at no cost, so The Times charged $7.20, the raw cost of the plates.
Though dated Aug. 22, when the pages closed in New York, the first copy of Overseas Weekly (PDF) did not hit the post exchange in Teheran until Sept. 9.

Despite what seems now like an impossibly long lag time, Overseas Weekly spread rapidly. By the end of the war in 1945, it was being printed at 16 sites. Later that year, it could even be obtained in Japan (where it was printed at Asahi Shimbun) and Germany (where it was printed at Frankfurter Zeitung). It was everywhere except areas under Soviet control.
No fools, Times business executives realized they’d created a large new audience. So they continued publishing Overseas Weekly until June 19, 1949, when it was supplanted by The New York Times International Air Edition.
This time, for a birthplace, the editors chose Paris.

1904 | The ‘Evil’ That Is Ticker TapeDavid W. Dunlap 

PhotoCredit 
David W. Dunlap is a Metro reporter and writes the Building Blocks column. He has worked at The Times for 40 years.
Stock brokerages had scarcely begun tossing ticker tape out of their windows at celebratory parades in Lower Manhattan when the practice came under withering criticism in the pages of The Times. A writer signed only as “An Old Native New Yorker” complained 111 years ago that Broadway had become “a dumping place” because of this “nuisance.”
Bad enough that the trees in Trinity churchyard were “decked with what looks like a collection of stringed rags,” Old Native New Yorker lamented. Mortal peril lurked, too!
“It does not require much imagination to picture the possibility of a spirited horse being frightened by a bit of tape flashing unexpectedly across his eyes, and a single plunge into the dense crowd usually pressing close to the edge of the sidewalk would be a pretty serious matter.”
Despite this dire warning on May 10, 1904, ticker-tape parades survived.
Real ticker tape, however, disappeared long ago, leaving the ghost of an Old Native New Yorker to rest soundly — we hope — during even the most clamorous parades.

1965 | Here’s the Pope. Where’s the Paper?David W. Dunlap 

David W. Dunlap is a Metro reporter and writes the Building Blocks column. He has worked at The Times for 40 years.
It was a journalist’s dream: For the first time in history, the pope was coming to town.
It was a journalist’s nightmare: The New York Times wasn’t publishing.
On Sept. 16, 1965, editorial and clerical workers at The Times belonging to the Newspaper Guild (now called the NewsGuild), went out on strike in a contract dispute over automation, among other issues. Backed up by nine mechanical and production unions, the Guild effectively forced the newspaper’s management to suspend publication.
A. M. Rosenthal, known to all as Abe, was then metropolitan editor. His deputy was Arthur Gelb. As managers, they reported to work during the strike, spending day after day in the newsroom “staring out at a sea of empty desks,” Mr. Gelb wrote in his memoir, “City Room.”
And Pope Paul VI was due in New York on Oct. 4 to address the United Nations — “the first time a pontiff would be setting foot in the New World,” Mr. Gelb added.
Hoping that the strike might be settled in time, Mr. Rosenthal and Mr. Gelb drew up an assignment list detailing who would cover what angle of this historic story. But as Oct. 2 dawned, the two sides in the labor dispute were far apart.

2012 | Life, Liberty and LegibilityDavid W. Dunlap 

David W. Dunlap is a Metro reporter and writes the Building Blocks column. He has worked at The Times for 40 years.
“He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people,” the Declaration of Independence declares, before concluding, “A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.”
It’s thrilling language, really. And so I had made it my custom every Fourth of July to take a few moments to read the declaration in its entirety on the back page of the A section. In one of its finer traditions, The Times has set aside that valuable advertising space every year since 1922 to display a facsimile of the founding document.
But in 2011, I stumbled. The challenge of discerning 18th-century calligraphy had grown insurmountable. (Or should I say “infurmountable”?) Yes, I was approaching my 60th birthday. But it was more than my aging eyes. I asked around the office. No one could read the declaration.
PhotoA comparison of the 1922 and 2011 presentations of the Declaration of Independence show how a narrower page greatly diminished the size at which the facsimile could be reproduced.Credit 
The chief culprit seemed to be the fact that The Times is so much narrower now than it was in the 1920s, when it could truly be called a broadsheet. At intervals over the years, the width of newsprint rolls — what we used to mean when we said “web” — had shrunk, and shrunk again. The web, equal in width to four pages side by side, was once 64 inches. It is now 48 inches. Each inch trimmed, when multiplied over the millions of copies of the paper printed every year, represented a tremendous saving of money for the company.
However, while news columns, advertising columns, photos and headlines could be narrowed accordingly, the Declaration of Independence held fast to its original aspect ratio, roughly 1:1.25. That meant it was occupying an ever smaller portion of the ever narrower page.
I put it to Arthur Sulzberger and Tom Bodkin, then the assistant managing editor in charge of design, that if our purpose in reproducing the declaration was to indulge reflexively in the mania for patriotic décor on the Fourth, we were doing our job. But if our mission was to broaden public appreciation of the document, we were failing miserably. And wasting a full page doing so.
In late 2011, Mr. Bodkin assigned an art director, Catherine Gilmore-Barnes, to rethink the presentation. A graduate of the School of Visual Arts, Ms. Gilmore-Barnes joined The Times in 1994 and initially worked for The Times Magazine. She is an accomplished sailor, so one might impute to her an appreciation of historical artifacts that still function well.
Ms. Gilmore-Barnes proposed transcribing the declaration in the Imperial typeface used for body copy by the newspaper. To preserve tradition, the type was to sit under a color reproduction of the declaration (actually, the William J. Stone facsimile of 1823). The transcription followed the original capitalization, punctuation and spelling.
PhotoA page proof of the first redesign by Catherine Gilmore-Barnes, which called for the facsimile to run above a transcribed version of the text. The publisher and the executive editor worried that the transcription type was too small.Credit 
When Jill Abramson, who was then the executive editor, saw the mock-up, she worried that the new type might be too small for comfortable reading. Mr. Sulzberger agreed. In an elegant solution, Ms. Gilmore-Barnes increased the type size and tucked the facsimile into the transcription between two bold red rules.
PhotoIn the final redesign, Ms. Gilmore-Barnes increased the type size and tucked the facsimile into the text.Credit 
As a happy dividend, there was room enough on the redesigned page for a transcribed list of all the signers, and the states they represented, beginning of course with John Hancock, who is supposed to have said that he wrote boldly so that John Bull — or King George III, in alternate tellings — could read his signature without need of spectacles.
Our intent exactly.
PhotoJohn Trumbull’s 1818 depiction of the presentation of the declaration by Thomas Jefferson to John Hancock is stirring, if not wholly accurate.Credit The Architect of the Capitol
The prototype presented to Mr. Sulzberger carried the headline, “The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America.” The publisher suggested identifying the document unequivocally. Ms. Gilmore-Barnes added a skyline: “The Declaration of Independence.”
That’s the page newspaper readers will see on July 4. Now we have to figure out a mobile format, so Mr. Bull can read it on his iPhone next year. Without spectacles.

1970s | Reining In a Racial Slur in The TimesDavid W. Dunlap

On June 26, Looking Back gave a brief overview of how The Times had used a noxious racial slur in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The post did not detail what happened in the 1960s and ’70s, when the word began appearing in print more and more frequently.
Statistics show the trend, but time was needed to solicit the recollection of two retired Times news executives who were instrumental in the eventual decision to limit the use of the word.
