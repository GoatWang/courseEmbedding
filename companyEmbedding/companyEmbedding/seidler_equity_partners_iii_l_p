Overview | About Us | Seidler Equity Partners









































 (213) 683-4622 Contact Us

About Us 
















What Makes Us Different? 
We think about your business the same way you do – as a true partner, not just a capital provider.














Flexible Partnership Approach  




We are a relationship-driven firm that strives to genuinely understand our partners' short and long-term professional and personal financial objectives. Because those objectives can vary greatly, we emphasize flexibility in developing the right transaction to fit each situation. Over the past 20+ years, we have invested in both minority and majority positions and employed a variety of customized deal structures to achieve our partners’ goals. 






Patient Investment Horizon 




We invest in growing businesses where we can work collaboratively with our partners to increase a company’s value over time. We believe success is most likely to be achieved by implementing a thoughtful plan for smart growth, not a risky scheme in search of a quick buck. As a result, we have established stable and thriving partnerships, some of which have spanned more than a decade. 






Conservative Capital Structure 




We believe the optimal use of cash for most growing companies is to fund expansion, not service a heavy debt load. We seek to generate investment returns by applying sound business principles and executing insightful growth strategies, rather than using maximum leverage. 






Experienced, Valuable Partner 




We help our partner companies achieve their full potential by harnessingthe extensive resources of our professional team. We apply decades of strategic, operational and organizational experience primarily as board-level and project-focused partners, leaving day-to-day decisions in the hands of management. In addition, our network of trusted service providers, industry experts, financial institutions, and acquisition support professionals are valuable assets for executives determined to build and maintain the best business in their industry. 






Shared Incentive Mentality 




We know every dollar a business earns is the result of a team effort. Consequently, we don’t impose costly fees or other arbitrary external requirements on our partner companies. Instead, we work shoulder-to-shoulder with them to closely align incentives and maximize value for all stakeholders.

Testimonials 
















  

   

  Print  


Raegan Moya-Jones
Co-Founder and CEO, Aden & Anais
"I was introduced to the Seidler team just four years after I co-founded aden + anais. The business was in rapid growth mode. We knew in our gut that with access to additional capital and the resources of a firm that had “been there before” with growing companies, the sky was the limit for aden + anais.
Since partnering with Seidler, we have become a truly global business with distribution in more than 60 countries and direct operations in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Most importantly, we have been able to maintain our entrepreneurial culture, which is a big part of our success.
There is no question that our partnership with Seidler has been a critical factor in our success. Their experience, steady guidance and desire to support our management team helped us achieve our goals faster than we could have done on our own. The fact that they didn’t encumber me with the usual handcuffs that often come from well-meaning financial partners was quite simply a CEO’s dream."

We provide you with resources beyond just  capital, serving as a  value-added partner to  help your business achieve its full potential.
		







We take pride in delivering on our handshakes to complete a streamlined investment process so you can stay focused on your business.
		







We listen carefully to your business needs, understand your transaction objectives and provide flexible and creative solutions to achieve your goals.
		


 


















Seidler Equity Partners is a private investment firm that partners with company owners and management teams to help them achieve their strategic vision to expand their businesses.
Our tradition of thoughtful, flexible capital solutions began with our origin as a family office in the early 1990’s. We have since grown to become an internationally recognized investment firm with more than $1 billion in capital under management, a deep team of talented professionals, and a wealth of experience from successfully partnering with exceptional companies across a wide variety of industries.
We specialize in transactions traditional investment firms are not well-equipped to complete: purchasing minority equity positions, using little or no debt, and providing an extended investment horizon. Uniting your management team with a strong balance sheet and a trusted, effective business partner offers the greatest value creation potential for your business.
We are actively looking for opportunities to share our team’s experience and resources with company owners who are passionate about their culture and are dedicated to growing revenue, expanding product and service offerings, and maximizing value.
 






"There is no question that our partnership with Seidler has been a critical factor in our success. Their experience, steady guidance and desire to support our management team helped us achieve our goals faster than we could have done on our own..."
