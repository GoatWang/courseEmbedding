History[edit]
Atmos Energy Corporation's history dates back to 1906 in the Panhandle of Texas. Over the years, through various business combinations and mergers, the company became known as Pioneer Corporation, a large diversified West Texas energy company. In 1983, Energas, the natural gas distribution division of Pioneer, was spun off and became an independent, publicly held natural gas distribution company. In October 1988, Energas changed its corporate name to Atmos Energy Corporation and its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "ATO". 
Atmos Energy has grown through acquisitions, its most recent acquisition was the distribution and pipeline operations of TXU Gas Company in October 2004. Today, Atmos Energy Corporation is one of the largest all-natural-gas distributors in the United States. Atmos sold the Gaffney, South Carolina operations of United Cities Gas to Piedmont Natural Gas in 2000.[3] Atmos sold its Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, and Georgia operations to Liberty Utilities in 2012 and 2013.[4][5]

History[edit]
Atmos Energy Corporation's history dates back to 1906 in the Panhandle of Texas. Over the years, through various business combinations and mergers, the company became known as Pioneer Corporation, a large diversified West Texas energy company. In 1983, Energas, the natural gas distribution division of Pioneer, was spun off and became an independent, publicly held natural gas distribution company. In October 1988, Energas changed its corporate name to Atmos Energy Corporation and its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "ATO". 
Atmos Energy has grown through acquisitions, its most recent acquisition was the distribution and pipeline operations of TXU Gas Company in October 2004. Today, Atmos Energy Corporation is one of the largest all-natural-gas distributors in the United States. Atmos sold the Gaffney, South Carolina operations of United Cities Gas to Piedmont Natural Gas in 2000.[3] Atmos sold its Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, and Georgia operations to Liberty Utilities in 2012 and 2013.[4][5]
