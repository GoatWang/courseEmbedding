The Company — Ocean Power Technologies

















































































The Earth’s oceans are a vast source of natural resources and are crucial from economic and security vantage points.  
Information from the oceans can help us understand climate change and natural disasters while also providing sources for food and energy. Persistent, reliable and cost effective instrumentation, communication, and power sources are necessary to support the maritime activities to obtain such information. Present solutions and technologies suffer from the need for costly and repetitive maintenance as well as the rather limited electric power output they provide.
  Ocean Power Technologies (Nasdaq:OPTT) is a pioneer in renewable wave-energy technology that converts ocean wave energy into electricity. OPT's proprietary PowerBuoy® technology is based on a modular design and has undergone and continues to undergo periodic full-scale ocean performance validation. OPT specializes in advanced autonomous (not grid connected), cost-effective, and environmentally sound ocean wave based power generation and management technology. 
The PowerBuoy system integrates patented technologies in hydrodynamics, electronics, energy conversion, and computer control systems to extract the natural energy in ocean waves. The result is a leading edge, ocean-tested, proprietary autonomous system that turns wave power into reliable, clean, and environmentally beneficial electricity for offshore applications.  
Wave power is abundant in all areas of the world and its harnessing offers a dependable clean source of renewable and cost effective energy. OPT’s PowerBuoy converts such energy to provide persistent and reliable power generation for marine applications.
Current solutions for applications that require persistent, long-term operation and/or require significant power, such as batteries, solar, micro-wind and diesel, are limited and costly. The PowerBuoy with its expandable, onboard battery system (Energy Storage System) can act as an offshore Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).

The PowerBuoy will deliver:

Reduced operational costs (OPEX) by eliminating frequent maintenance visits to service traditional energy sources.
Real time data with enhanced density enabled by the availability of increased electrical power: Allows more effective operational decisions for improved assets utilization.
Greater availability of reliable power: Enables the introduction of new technical solutions and enhanced capability. 
Proactive control and fault analysis of equipment through real time remote desktop user control and monitoring. 

OPT’s PowerBuoy technology is designed to serve the offshore power requirements of the following markets:

PB3 — Ocean Power Technologies

















































































PB3  OPT’s PB3 can act as an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) which constantly recharges itself by harvesting energy from the waves. It is ocean-deployed, moored and floats over the point of use and can operate in any ocean depth over 20 meters and up to 1,000 meters (1 km).The PB3 supplies power continuously to on-board payloads or equipment located on the seabed while also providing real time data transfer and communication to remote shore facilities. The PB3 is sized and designed to store sufficient electric energy to provide reliable "ride through" power in extended periods of flat-calm seas.   







 The conversion of wave energy into electric power is carried out through a direct drive generator that continuously charges an on-board battery pack (Energy Storage System). Power from the battery is delivered to meet application and end-user needs. This is particularly advantageous for applications that have varying power requirements including continuous and larger occasional peaks.OPT has designed the PB3 to minimize operational costs (OPEX) whereby deployment and recovery thereof is simplified, leveraging vessels widely employed in offshore marine operations. The PB3 can be either towed to site or deployed from a vessel’s deck.Maintenance intervals, by design, are every 3 years. The PB3 control and management system includes self-monitoring data collection, processing and transmittal to allow pro-active maintenance strategies, thus increasing availability and operational effectiveness.The PB3 technology was demonstrated for a US Navy project to provide power to coastal security networks and survived rigorous sea trials, including operation off the New Jersey coast through Hurricane Irene in 2011. It is designed to be packaged and transported in a standard, 40 foot ISO shipping container excluding the moorings. Exterior payloads are anticipated to be shipped in the ISO shipping container and would require minimal on-site preparation to mount on the buoy prior to deployment. Product Specifications for the PB3 are shown in the table below.

Range of products[edit]

Devices for the Grid-connected utility market, currently the Mark 3 PowerBuoy.
Devices for the Autonomous market requiring lower levels of power for deep-ocean applications such as maritime security and homeland defense, offshore oil and gas operations, aquaculture and oceanographic data sampling. The Company’s PowerBuoy in ratings of 2 kilowatt to 40 kilowatt is ideal for these applications, including the LEAP autonomous PowerBuoy sold to the US Navy.
Infrastructure products and services - cable installations, grid interconnection, permitting and site development, including the Company’s Undersea Substation Pod product, available to all companies in the marine energy sector.
Undersea Substation Pod - Device for aggregating diverse power generation devices and supplying an interface with onshore power distribution.

Projects[edit]
Current[edit]

LEAP Autonomous PowerBuoy, New Jersey, USA [1][2] - O.P.T. has successfully operated a system off New Jersey, designed and manufactured by O.P.T. under the US Navy’s Littoral Expeditionary Autonomous PowerBuoy (LEAP) program for coastal security and maritime surveillance.
Coos Bay, Oregon, USA [3]- O.P.T. has proposed a utility-scale, commercial wave park in North America at Coos Bay, Oregon. The planned size of this park is up to 100 megawatts, and it will be the largest wave energy project in the world when completed.
Reedsport, Oregon, USA[4][5] - O.P.T. is developing a commercial wave park on the west coast of the United States located 2.5 miles offshore near Reedsport, Oregon. The first phase of this project is for ten PB150 PowerBuoys, or 1.5 megawatts. Due to legal and technical problems, this project has now ground to a halt, August 2013. [6]
Santoña, Spain[7][8] - In July 2006, O.P.T. formed a joint venture with Iberdrola S.A., global oil major TOTAL, the Spanish Government IDAE (Institute of Energy Savings and Efficiency), and the local regional development agency SODERCAN, for the turnkey construction of a wave farm off the North coast of Spain. OPT has been awarded funding by the European Union to deploy a PowerBuoy at the Santoña site developed by the joint venture.
Cornwall, England, UK[9][10] - O.P.T. aims to develop its wave power generation technology at Wave Hub, a renewable energy project off Cornwall in the South West of England, which expects to create the UK's first offshore facility for the demonstration and proving of arrays of wave energy generation devices.
Portland, Victoria, Australia[11] - Ocean Power Technologies Australasia Pty Ltd, as part of Victorian Wave Partners is developing a 19 megawatts wave power station connected to the grid near Portland, Victoria. The project has received an AU $66.46 million grant from the Federal Government of Australia.

Completed[edit]

Scotland [12][13] - An O.P.T. wave power generation buoy was successfully deployed at sea in 2011 by a team including Scotland-based Global Maritime Scotland Ltd, Port Services (Invergordon) Ltd and OPT, with the support of the Cromarty Firth Port Authority.
Oahu, Hawaii [14][15] - From 2009 to 2011, O.P.T. ocean-tested its wave power generation system at the US Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) at Kaneohe Bay. The Oahu system was launched under the Company's program with the US Navy for ocean testing and demonstration of such systems, including connection to the Oahu grid.
Atlantic City, New Jersey[16] - The principles demonstrated with the earlier prototype power generation buoys, deployed and tested off the coast of Atlantic City, were integrated into the designs of the buoys for Hawaii and Spain.

Technology[edit]
Powerbuoy[edit]
The Company's primary product is the PowerBuoy wave generation system.[17] It uses a "smart," oceangoing buoy to capture and convert wave energy into low-cost, clean electricity.
Undersea Substation Pod (USP)[edit]
The USP[18] is an electrical power aggregator from up to ten offshore power generation devices, be they wind, wave power or other, into one common interconnection point for transmission to the onshore power grid. The USP can likewise be configured to supply onshore power to offshore devices.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report, and elsewhere in this report, for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Our fiscal year ends on April 30. References to fiscal 2017 are to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017.  Overview  We are commercializing proprietary systems that generate electricity by harnessing the renewable energy of ocean waves. Our PowerBuoy systems use proprietary technologies to convert the mechanical energy created by the rising and falling of ocean waves into electricity. We currently have developed our PB3 PowerBuoy product. Since fiscal 2002, government agencies have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, which were largely for the support of our product development efforts. Our goal is that an increased portion of our revenues will be from the sale of products and services, as compared to revenue from grants to support our product development efforts. As we continue to advance our proprietary technologies, we expect to have a net use of cash in operating activities unless or until we achieve positive cash flow from the commercialization of our products and services.  We are marketing our PowerBuoy, which is designed to generate power for use independent of the power grid, to customers that require electricity in remote locations. We believe there are a variety of potential applications for our PowerBuoy, within markets such as oil and gas, ocean observing, security and defense and as well as other markets, which we refer to collectively as autonomous application markets.  We were incorporated in New Jersey in 1984, began business operations in 1994, and were re-incorporated in Delaware in 2007. We currently have five wholly-owned subsidiaries: Ocean Power Technologies Ltd., organized under the laws of the United Kingdom, Reedsport OPT Wave Park LLC, organized under the laws of Oregon, and Oregon Wave Energy Partners I, LLC, organized under the laws of Delaware, Ocean Power Technologies (Australasia) Pty Ltd ("OPTA"), organized under the laws of Australia. OPTA owns 100% of Victorian Wave Partners Pty. Ltd. ("VWP"), which is also organized under the laws of Australia. We acquired the remaining 12% of OPTA which we did not previously own in September 2015.  Table of Contents  Product Development  The development of our technology has been funded by revenue generating projects, capital we raised and by development engineering contracts we received starting in fiscal 1995, including projects with the DOE, the U.S. Navy, the Department of Homeland Security and MES. Please see Item 1 of this Annual Report- "Business - Customers" and "Historic Projects" for more information.  Through these historic projects, we also continued development of our PowerBuoy technologies. We are continuing to focus on marketing and developing our PowerBuoy products and services for use in autonomous power applications.  During fiscal 2017, we continued to focus on the commercialization of our PowerBuoy technology and our PB3 product in autonomous application markets. We completed our work under our DOE contract that focused on further optimization of our modular PTO technology and delivered the project final report to the DOE in the prior year. In the prior year, we successfully completed the final stage and associated review with the DOE of the contract deliverables during which the DOE reviewed advancements related to PTO design aspects such as reliability, cost take out, manufacturability and scalability. As we continued to focus on the development and validation of our PB3 PowerBuoy commercial product, our activities concentrated mainly on implementing all of our lessons learned during our efforts in the prior fiscal year from our ocean deployments and accelerated life testing ("ALT"). The resulting improved PB3 PowerBuoy was deployed off the coast of New Jersey in July of 2016 and was retrieved early December 2016 upon completing all intended testing and validation. Inspection and refurbishment of the PB3 PowerBuoy were completed and this PB3 was shipped for delivery to MES in Japan to fulfill the requirements of our lease with MES, including a deployment off of Kozushima Island in the Pacific Ocean. ALT of the PB3 commercial PTO is ongoing with no failures to date. In addition to the deployment of the PB3 PowerBuoy, the prior generation pre-commercial PB3 ("PB3-A1"), was fitted with a sensor that collects tagged marine mammal migration information as well as with a Self-Contained Ocean Observing Payload ("SCOOP"). The marine mammal migration detection sensor was attached to the PB3-A1 PowerBuoy as part of an agreed scope of work with the Wildlife Conservation Society ("WCS") through a memorandum of agreement between WCS and OPT. The SCOOP payload was integrated into PB3-A1 to complete the Phase 1 work scope of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement ("CRADA") between the National Data Buoy Center ("NDBC") and OPT. The PB3-A1, deployed off the coast of New Jersey in May 2016, was retrieved in October 2016. From July 2016 through October 2016, both PB3-A1 and PB3 were concurrently deployed generating valuable performance validation data. Both the NDBC SCOOP as well as the WCS tagged mammal migration detection sensor met all of their performance requirements. This pre-commercial PowerBuoy, referred to as "PB3-A1" has now undergone a full upgrade and has achieved full commercial status by retrofitting it with the final commercial PTO including our modular energy storage system, and to make it available to support our on-going commercialization efforts. In addition to the PB3 commercial product validation activities, a concerted effort has been underway which focuses on proactively implementing additional features driven by extensive and direct discussions with potential users and customers in our target markets. Such features include:  ? The design, development and implementation of a versatile mooring interface that allows the PB3 to accommodate various types of mooring configurations depending on the specifics and the needs of the customer, eliminating the need for a redesign to the device.  ? The design, development and implementation of a flexible power transmission system intended to support delivery of power and communication capabilities to customer payloads which are external to the PowerBuoy, and which may reside in the water column or on the seabed.  Additionally, and building upon our initial success in implementing an auto-ballast system in our commercial PB3, we further enhanced this feature in order to achieve faster and more cost effective PB3 deployments and retrievals.  Further, the development of our PB15, the next scale-up of our autonomous PowerBuoy, is underway in accordance with our product roadmap. We completed the preliminary design of our PB15 in fiscal 2017. We believe the PB15 PowerBuoy would have a peak power generation rating of 15kW with a nominal ESS rating of 450 kWh, and an average continuous power output that depends on the deployment site's metocean conditions. While this scale-up leverages every aspect of the product development and validation of the PB3, it may also strategically position the product to allow OPT to respond to higher power needs as expressed by potential end-users and customers in our target markets.  Table of Contents  As previously stated, the PB3 has achieved commercial status through a series of design iterations which focused on improving its reliability and survivability in the ocean environment. Though the PB3 will continue to undergo further enhancements through customary product life cycle management, we believe the PB3 has achieved a maturity level for immediate commercial use. We believe that the PB3 will generate and store sufficient power to address various application requirements in our target markets. Our product development and engineering efforts are focused, in part, on increasing the energy output and efficiency of our PowerBuoys and, if we are able to do so, we believe the PowerBuoy would be useful for additional applications where cost savings and additional power are required by our potential customers. We continue to explore opportunities in these target markets, and we have not yet finalized any product offerings in these potential markets. We believe that by increasing the energy output of our PowerBuoys we may be able to address larger segments of our target markets. By improving our design and manufacturing, we also seek to reduce the cost of our PowerBuoys through further design iterations and manufacturing ramp-up. In so doing, we seek to improve customer value, displace additional incumbent solutions, and become a viable power source for new applications in our target markets.  We also are continuing to work to develop solutions seeking to improve our products' durability and reliability and to reduce their cost. For example, the redesigned PB3 leverages our knowledge base from past designs to incorporate new design features which we believe will improve its reliability and efficiency, including a redesigned PTO and a higher efficiency and higher voltage ESS. In July 2016, we deployed our first commercial PB3 PowerBuoy, off of the coast of New Jersey. This deployment was the final validation of the PB3 prior to the March 2017 six-month lease of the PB3 PowerBuoy under a previously announced customer agreement. In April 2017, our commercial PB3 was deployed off the coast of Kozushima Island in Japan as part of this lease, and continues to operate meeting all project requirements.  Capital Raises  On June 2, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, which was amended on June 7, 2016 (as amended, the "Purchase Agreement") with certain institutional purchasers (the "Purchasers"). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we sold an aggregate of 417,000 shares of common stock together with warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 145,952 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock was sold together with a warrant to purchase 0.35 of a share of common stock at a combined purchase price of $4.60. The net proceeds from the offering to us were approximately $1.7 million, after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us, but excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants issued in the offering. The warrants have an exercise price of $6.08 per share, will be exercisable on December 8, 2016, and will expire five years following the date of issuance.  On July 22, 2016, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the "Second Amended Purchase Agreement") with certain purchasers (the "July Purchasers"). Pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended Purchase Agreement, the Company sold an aggregate of 595,000 shares of Common Stock together with warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 178,500 shares of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock was sold together with a warrant to purchase 0.30 of a share of Common Stock at a combined purchase price of $6.75. The net proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately $3.6 million, after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, but excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants issued in the offering. The Warrants were exercisable immediately at an exercise price of $9.36 per share. The Warrants will expire on the fifth  On October 19, 2016, the Company sold 2,760,000 shares of common stock at a price of $2.75 per share, which includes the sale of 360,000 shares of the Company's common stock sold by the Company pursuant to the exercise, in full, of the over-allotment option by the underwriters in a public offering. The net proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately $6.9 million, after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by the Company.  Table of Contents  On May 2, 2017, the Company sold 6,192,750 shares of common stock at a price of $1.30 per share, which includes the sale of 807,750 shares of the Company's common stock sold by the Company pursuant to the exercise, in full, of the over-allotment option by the underwriters in a public offering. The net proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately $7.2 million, after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by the Company.  The sale of additional equity or convertible securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. We do not have any committed sources of debt or equity financing and we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us when needed, or at all. If we are unable to obtain required financing when needed, we may be required to reduce the scope of our operations, including our planned product development and marketing efforts, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we may be forced to cease our operations.  Backlog  As of April 30, 2017, our negotiated backlog was $0.3 million. As of April 30, 2016, our backlog was negligible. In 2016, we have excluded from backlog the suspended utility scale project with MES as we do not expect work under that contract to continue due to the shift in focus to an autonomous PB3 based project. Subsequently, on May 31, 2016, we entered into a contract with MES totaling approximately $1.0 million, a portion of which was performed in fiscal 2016 as agreed under a LOI signed in March 2016. Our backlog can include both funded amounts, which are unfilled firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer (U.S. Congress, in the case of U.S. Government agencies), and unfunded amounts, which are unfilled firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. If any of our contracts were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining terms of such contract. Our backlog was fully funded at April 30, 2017.  The amount of contract backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenue because modifications to, or terminations of present contracts and production delays can provide additional revenue or reduce anticipated revenue. A substantial portion of our revenue has been for the support of our product development efforts. These revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, and changes in estimates from time to time may have a significant effect on revenue and backlog. Our backlog is also typically subject to large variations from time to time due to the timing of new awards.  Going Concern  Our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. We have experienced substantial and recurring losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of $187.4 million at April 30, 2017. Based on the Company's cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of April 30, 2017, and including the proceeds received from our May 2017 financing transaction in which we received aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $7.2 million, the Company believes that it will be able to finance its capital requirements and operations into the quarter ending July 31, 2018. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2017, contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern, based on, among other factors, that our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional external capital and increase revenues. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to generate revenues, become profitable, raise additional outside capital or to continue as a going concern. If we are not successful in our efforts to raise additional capital sufficient to support our operations, we would be forced to cease operations, in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our company.  Table of Contents  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We believe the following accounting policies require significant judgment and estimates by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  Legal contingencies  As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report under the heading "Legal Proceedings" and in Note 15, "Commitments and Contingencies," in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is currently subject to various legal proceedings and claims. The Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable in accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies". There is a significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated since the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. In management's opinion, any reasonable possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  Revenue recognition and unearned revenues  The Company's contracts are either cost plus or fixed price contracts. Under cost plus contracts, customers are billed for actual expenses incurred plus an agreed-upon fee. Under cost plus contracts, a profit or loss on a project is recognized depending on whether actual costs are more or less than the agreed upon amount.  The Company has two types of fixed price contracts, firm fixed price and cost-sharing. Under firm fixed price contracts, the Company receives an agreed-upon amount for providing products and services specified in the contract, a profit or loss is recognized depending on whether actual costs are more or less than the agreed upon amount. Under cost-sharing contracts, the fixed amount agreed upon with the customer is only intended to fund a portion of the costs on a specific project. Under cost sharing contracts, an amount corresponding to the revenue is recorded in cost of revenues, resulting in gross profit on these contracts of zero. The Company's share of the costs is recorded as product development expense.  Generally, revenue under fixed price or cost plus contracts is recognized using the cost to cost percentage-of-completion method, measured by the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion. In certain circumstances, revenue under contracts that have specified milestones or other performance criteria may be recognized only when the customer acknowledges that such criteria have been satisfied. If an arrangement involves multiple deliverables, the delivered items are considered separate units of accounting if the items have value on a stand-alone basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services.  In addition, recognition of revenue (and the related costs) may be deferred for fixed price contracts until contract completion if the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the total costs of the project prior to completion. These contracts are subject to interpretation and management may make a judgment as to the amount of revenue earned and recorded. Because the Company has a small number of contracts, revisions to the percentage-of-completion determination, management interpretation or delays in meeting performance and contractual criteria or in completing projects may have a significant effect on revenue for the periods involved. Upon anticipating a loss on a contract, the Company recognizes the full amount of the anticipated loss in the current period.  Table of Contents  Unbilled receivables represent expenditures on contracts, plus applicable profit margin, not yet billed. Unbilled receivables are normally billed and collected within one year. Billings made on contracts are recorded as a reduction of unbilled receivables, and to the extent that such billings and cash collections exceed costs incurred plus applicable profit margin, they are recorded as unearned revenues.  Stock-based compensation  Costs resulting from all share-based payment transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at their fair values.  Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the date of grant using any valuation model requires judgment. We may use a Monte Carlo simulation model for performance-based stock awards, if applicable, and use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options. Option pricing models, including the Black-Scholes model, require the use of input assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term and the expected dividend rate. Beginning in fiscal 2014, expected volatility for 2015 was based on the Company's historical volatility. In prior years, we estimated our expected volatility based on that of what we considered to be similar publicly-traded companies because our stock had been publicly traded in the U.S. only since April 2007, so we did not have significant observable share-price volatility for the U.S. capital markets. We did not estimate our expected volatility based on the price of our common stock on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange, on which our shares traded from October 2003 until we voluntarily delisted in January 2011, because we did not believe, based on the historically low trading volume of our shares on that market, that the volatility of our common stock on the AIM market was an appropriate indicator of the expected volatility of our common stock. We estimate the expected term using the average midpoint between the vesting terms and the contractual terms of our options as permitted by the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, Share-Based Payment. If we determine another method to estimate expected term is more reasonable than our current method, or if another method for calculating this input assumption is prescribed by authoritative guidance, the fair value calculated for future stock-based awards could change significantly. Longer expected terms have a significant impact on the value of stock-based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend rate is not significant to the calculation of the fair value of our stock-based awards.  In addition, we are required to develop an estimate of the number of stock-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover.  Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock-based compensation. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements during the quarter of the change. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements. These adjustments affect our cost of revenues, product development costs and selling, general and administrative costs. To date, the effect of forfeiture adjustments on our consolidated financial statements has been insignificant. The expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period and/or our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates.  The aggregate share-based compensation expense related to all share-based transactions related to employees was approximately $1.2 million and $0.3 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Table of Contents  Warrant liabilities  The Company accounts for warrants issued in connection with its public offerings in June and July, 2017 in accordance with the guidance on "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" which provides that we classify the warrant instruments as a liability at its fair value. The warrant liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes any change in fair value in its consolidated statements of operations within "Change in fair value of warrant liabilities". The Company will continue to adjust the carrying value of the warrants for changes in the estimated fair value until such time as these instruments are exercised or expire. At that time, the liabilities will be reclassified to "Additional paid-in capital", a component of "Stockholders' equity" on the consolidated balance sheets.  Income taxes  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the . . .

Ocean Power Technologies, Inc.: Riding A Wave That's About To Crash - Ocean Power Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPTT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Ocean Power Technologies, Inc.: Riding A Wave That's About To CrashJul.21.16 | About: Ocean Power (OPTT) Heath White Long only, value, growth at reasonable price, medium-term horizonSummaryOcean Power Technologies makes buoys that harness wave action for power. They haven’t actually sold any.
        Ocean Power Technologies is running out of cash, with very limited income prospects.
        Ocean Power Technologies is diluting fast.
        Insiders are selling.
        Ocean Power Technologies is a strong sell.
        Over the last week, Ocean Power Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPTT) has seen a gigantic surge in stock price and volume, from about $3 on essentially no volume to a high over $15 on twice the entire float of the stock. This euphoria is driven by some announcements that now, at long last, the company might be in a position to make some money. But the stock is already falling back to earth, ~$10 as I write, and it has further to fall. OPTT is a strong sell. OPTT has no commercial product Ocean Power Technologies makes buoys whose purpose is to harness wave power and turn it into electricity. It's a promising idea, but they haven't been able to make it commercially viable. The company was founded in 1997 and at least since 2012 has never turned a profit. Until this year, the goal was to create a utility-scale network of buoys to feed the grid. That line of research has recently been abandoned in favor of making autonomous (i.e. not grid-connected) buoys that power things like wildlife tracking devices, mid-ocean weather instruments, naval submarine detectors, and so on. These buoys already exist, of course, but they are powered by solar or batteries. Ocean Power Technologies' hope is that it can be shown that their products are more efficient or lower maintenance. The excitement around the stock centers around the announcement that the company has "deployed" their new autonomous buoy off the coast of New Jersey. But this is a testing or proof-of-concept deployment; it isn't bringing in any money. What will bring in some money is licensing this buoy (once proven) to Mitsui Energy and Shipbuilding, a Japanese company with more than $7B in revenue last year. There appears to be a 6-month lease signed, contingent on the new buoy working as planned, beginning March 2017, for $975K. This is of course pocket change for Mitsui - they were involved in the utility-intended buoys too, and are just continuing their association with Ocean Power as a flyer that might work someday.
 But this is the only business income on the horizon for Ocean Power Technologies, and it won't be soon enough or last them very long. OPTT is running out of cash Ocean Power Technologies had less than $6.8M in cash as of their most recent reporting, with a burn rate of ~$10M/year. On the last call they were confident that they would make it through the quarter ending in January, which is not an enormous vote of confidence. So they are taking the only route open to them: OPTT is diluting like mad Ocean Power Technologies raised $1.6M in an offering in June, and they just announced another offering of unspecified size. This has tanked the stock price by about 25%. OPTT is way overvalued Normal valuation metrics mean nothing for a speculative company, but anyway: P/S > 28, P/B almost 7, negative earnings and even negative EBITDA as far back as you care to look. None of this counts the dilution from the upcoming offering. Insider selling If my tiny company was on the verge of great things, I would hold onto my penny stock, or maybe mortgage my house to buy more. Instead, in May, founder and CEO George Kirby sold 55,000 shares at $1.57. The stock is over $10 today. Conclusion Ocean Power Technologies, Inc. is one of those companies that promises much and never delivers. Running out of options, they pivoted this year to an entirely new business strategy. They still have no commercial product and I expect the turnaround to be too little, too late. The income on the horizon will only doubtfully keep them solvent for a year. It will certainly not justify the absurd ramp-up in the stock price recently, which is driven by momentum traders who will be gone as quickly as they arrived. OPTT is a strong sell.

Range of products[edit]

Devices for the Grid-connected utility market, currently the Mark 3 PowerBuoy.
Devices for the Autonomous market requiring lower levels of power for deep-ocean applications such as maritime security and homeland defense, offshore oil and gas operations, aquaculture and oceanographic data sampling. The Company’s PowerBuoy in ratings of 2 kilowatt to 40 kilowatt is ideal for these applications, including the LEAP autonomous PowerBuoy sold to the US Navy.
Infrastructure products and services - cable installations, grid interconnection, permitting and site development, including the Company’s Undersea Substation Pod product, available to all companies in the marine energy sector.
Undersea Substation Pod - Device for aggregating diverse power generation devices and supplying an interface with onshore power distribution.

Projects[edit]
Current[edit]

LEAP Autonomous PowerBuoy, New Jersey, USA [1][2] - O.P.T. has successfully operated a system off New Jersey, designed and manufactured by O.P.T. under the US Navy’s Littoral Expeditionary Autonomous PowerBuoy (LEAP) program for coastal security and maritime surveillance.
Coos Bay, Oregon, USA [3]- O.P.T. has proposed a utility-scale, commercial wave park in North America at Coos Bay, Oregon. The planned size of this park is up to 100 megawatts, and it will be the largest wave energy project in the world when completed.
Reedsport, Oregon, USA[4][5] - O.P.T. is developing a commercial wave park on the west coast of the United States located 2.5 miles offshore near Reedsport, Oregon. The first phase of this project is for ten PB150 PowerBuoys, or 1.5 megawatts. Due to legal and technical problems, this project has now ground to a halt, August 2013. [6]
Santoña, Spain[7][8] - In July 2006, O.P.T. formed a joint venture with Iberdrola S.A., global oil major TOTAL, the Spanish Government IDAE (Institute of Energy Savings and Efficiency), and the local regional development agency SODERCAN, for the turnkey construction of a wave farm off the North coast of Spain. OPT has been awarded funding by the European Union to deploy a PowerBuoy at the Santoña site developed by the joint venture.
Cornwall, England, UK[9][10] - O.P.T. aims to develop its wave power generation technology at Wave Hub, a renewable energy project off Cornwall in the South West of England, which expects to create the UK's first offshore facility for the demonstration and proving of arrays of wave energy generation devices.
Portland, Victoria, Australia[11] - Ocean Power Technologies Australasia Pty Ltd, as part of Victorian Wave Partners is developing a 19 megawatts wave power station connected to the grid near Portland, Victoria. The project has received an AU $66.46 million grant from the Federal Government of Australia.

Completed[edit]

Scotland [12][13] - An O.P.T. wave power generation buoy was successfully deployed at sea in 2011 by a team including Scotland-based Global Maritime Scotland Ltd, Port Services (Invergordon) Ltd and OPT, with the support of the Cromarty Firth Port Authority.
Oahu, Hawaii [14][15] - From 2009 to 2011, O.P.T. ocean-tested its wave power generation system at the US Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) at Kaneohe Bay. The Oahu system was launched under the Company's program with the US Navy for ocean testing and demonstration of such systems, including connection to the Oahu grid.
Atlantic City, New Jersey[16] - The principles demonstrated with the earlier prototype power generation buoys, deployed and tested off the coast of Atlantic City, were integrated into the designs of the buoys for Hawaii and Spain.

Technology[edit]
Powerbuoy[edit]
The Company's primary product is the PowerBuoy wave generation system.[17] It uses a "smart," oceangoing buoy to capture and convert wave energy into low-cost, clean electricity.
Undersea Substation Pod (USP)[edit]
The USP[18] is an electrical power aggregator from up to ten offshore power generation devices, be they wind, wave power or other, into one common interconnection point for transmission to the onshore power grid. The USP can likewise be configured to supply onshore power to offshore devices.

Range of products[edit]

Devices for the Grid-connected utility market, currently the Mark 3 PowerBuoy.
Devices for the Autonomous market requiring lower levels of power for deep-ocean applications such as maritime security and homeland defense, offshore oil and gas operations, aquaculture and oceanographic data sampling. The Company’s PowerBuoy in ratings of 2 kilowatt to 40 kilowatt is ideal for these applications, including the LEAP autonomous PowerBuoy sold to the US Navy.
Infrastructure products and services - cable installations, grid interconnection, permitting and site development, including the Company’s Undersea Substation Pod product, available to all companies in the marine energy sector.
Undersea Substation Pod - Device for aggregating diverse power generation devices and supplying an interface with onshore power distribution.

Projects[edit]
Current[edit]

LEAP Autonomous PowerBuoy, New Jersey, USA [1][2] - O.P.T. has successfully operated a system off New Jersey, designed and manufactured by O.P.T. under the US Navy’s Littoral Expeditionary Autonomous PowerBuoy (LEAP) program for coastal security and maritime surveillance.
Coos Bay, Oregon, USA [3]- O.P.T. has proposed a utility-scale, commercial wave park in North America at Coos Bay, Oregon. The planned size of this park is up to 100 megawatts, and it will be the largest wave energy project in the world when completed.
Reedsport, Oregon, USA[4][5] - O.P.T. is developing a commercial wave park on the west coast of the United States located 2.5 miles offshore near Reedsport, Oregon. The first phase of this project is for ten PB150 PowerBuoys, or 1.5 megawatts. Due to legal and technical problems, this project has now ground to a halt, August 2013. [6]
Santoña, Spain[7][8] - In July 2006, O.P.T. formed a joint venture with Iberdrola S.A., global oil major TOTAL, the Spanish Government IDAE (Institute of Energy Savings and Efficiency), and the local regional development agency SODERCAN, for the turnkey construction of a wave farm off the North coast of Spain. OPT has been awarded funding by the European Union to deploy a PowerBuoy at the Santoña site developed by the joint venture.
Cornwall, England, UK[9][10] - O.P.T. aims to develop its wave power generation technology at Wave Hub, a renewable energy project off Cornwall in the South West of England, which expects to create the UK's first offshore facility for the demonstration and proving of arrays of wave energy generation devices.
Portland, Victoria, Australia[11] - Ocean Power Technologies Australasia Pty Ltd, as part of Victorian Wave Partners is developing a 19 megawatts wave power station connected to the grid near Portland, Victoria. The project has received an AU $66.46 million grant from the Federal Government of Australia.

Completed[edit]

Scotland [12][13] - An O.P.T. wave power generation buoy was successfully deployed at sea in 2011 by a team including Scotland-based Global Maritime Scotland Ltd, Port Services (Invergordon) Ltd and OPT, with the support of the Cromarty Firth Port Authority.
Oahu, Hawaii [14][15] - From 2009 to 2011, O.P.T. ocean-tested its wave power generation system at the US Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) at Kaneohe Bay. The Oahu system was launched under the Company's program with the US Navy for ocean testing and demonstration of such systems, including connection to the Oahu grid.
Atlantic City, New Jersey[16] - The principles demonstrated with the earlier prototype power generation buoys, deployed and tested off the coast of Atlantic City, were integrated into the designs of the buoys for Hawaii and Spain.

Technology[edit]
Powerbuoy[edit]
The Company's primary product is the PowerBuoy wave generation system.[17] It uses a "smart," oceangoing buoy to capture and convert wave energy into low-cost, clean electricity.
Undersea Substation Pod (USP)[edit]
The USP[18] is an electrical power aggregator from up to ten offshore power generation devices, be they wind, wave power or other, into one common interconnection point for transmission to the onshore power grid. The USP can likewise be configured to supply onshore power to offshore devices.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
