David Maura Named Executive Chairman of the Board of Spectrum Brands Holdings | Business Wire
























































David Maura Named Executive Chairman of the Board of Spectrum Brands 
      Holdings






January 21, 2016 06:30 AM Eastern Standard Time



MIDDLETON, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPB), a global consumer products 
      company offering an expanding portfolio of leading brands providing 
      superior value to consumers and customers every day, announced today 
      that David M. Maura has been named Executive Chairman of its Board of 
      Directors, effective immediately.
    


      Mr. Maura, 43, has served as a Director of Spectrum Brands since June 
      2010 and has served as its Chairman of the Board since July 2011 and as 
      its interim Chairman of the Board prior to that. Mr. Maura is also an 
      Executive Vice President and a Director of HRG Group, Inc. (NYSE: HRG).
    

      “It is an honor for me to continue to work in this leadership capacity 
      as the Executive Chairman of Spectrum Brands,” said Mr. Maura, “and 
      especially so with our Chief Executive Officer, Andreas Rouvé, who is 
      off to a very strong start and with whom I have developed a close 
      working relationship. Andreas is providing outstanding leadership at 
      Spectrum Brands as he and our senior executive team take Spectrum Brands 
      to the next level of growth and profitability. I am extremely optimistic 
      with regard to the outlook for our Company. As we integrate our recent 
      acquisitions, meaningfully deleverage our balance sheet and execute our 
      Spectrum First organic growth strategy, I can say with confidence that I 
      believe that our Company’s best days are still ahead.”
    

      Norman S. Matthews, Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance 
      Committee, said, “The Board recognizes the countless and valuable 
      contributions David Maura has made to the growth and expansion of 
      Spectrum Brands over the past six years, particularly through his focus 
      on strategy, capital allocation, and mergers and acquisitions. Our 
      expectation is that David’s ongoing contributions will continue to drive 
      superior returns for Spectrum Brands.”
