Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan

        Trust administration​
    





                We know that administering trusts, companies and other structures is a significant undertaking that may last generations. HSBC Private Bank has the expertise and administrative capabilities you need to protect and grow your wealth, helping you achieve lasting peace of mind.
            







 Grow, Manage and Preserve your wealth














Why consider trust and fiduciary services?
Trusts, foundations and other wealth structures can help you manage complex family wealth. They can help protect your family business and allow your wealth to be managed privately and independently. They can also provide continuity, preserving capital and helping family members enjoy financial benefits across generations.
Our trusts and other solutions are designed to suit your particular needs and ambitions, giving you a global solution for managing your wealth.
Choosing a trustee
Determining who will administer your structure is as important as your succession plan and the decision to create the structure itself. Trustees ultimately accept personal responsibility and legal liability for the financial welfare of the trust fund, so selecting a responsible trustee to protect, manage and distribute the assets in your trust is a key decision that will have lasting implications.
It’s essential to have a trustee with professional legal knowledge and financial expertise, as a trust may involve generations of work, detailed record-keeping and coordination with lawyers, accountants and other advisers. Trusts and other structures may also involve complex management, in addition to challenging financial and investment decisions. 
Basics of a trust
A trust is a private arrangement whereby you, as the settlor, transfer the legal ownership of your assets (which then become the trust assets) to the trustee, who manages and holds the assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries may include you and your family.

Wealth Management Services - New York Private Bank and Trust


















 Language:   


  Private Office

Broadway, NYC, 1843Wealth Management Services
Our number one goal is to protect and perpetuate our clients’ wealth as we would our own. New York Private Bank & Trust provides clients with fully customized, tax-managed, investment advice based on unbiased and independent analysis. Services include complete investment program construction; best in class investment products, evaluation and oversight; and risk and performance analysis.
Our investment professionals are uniquely qualified to advise fixed-income investment portfolios and other separately managed portfolios. We offer clients including foundations, non-profit organizations, and trusts separately managed fixed-income accounts, and unique co-investment opportunities directed by seasoned portfolio managers.
One longstanding client, Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio, sums up their NYPB&T experience as follows:
“Cuyahoga Community College has been a client of New York Private Bank and Trust (NYPB&T) for many years. They have delivered outstanding investment performance to the college’s fixed-income portfolio, especially in a very challenging low interest rate environment, and at highly competitive fees.
NYPB&T differentiates themselves with clear concise investment reporting, strict adherence to investment policy guidelines, and responsive 24/7 availability of their portfolio managers to our finance team. We strongly recommend the investment management and trust services of New York Private Bank and Trust.”
– David J. Kuntz, CPA
Executive Vice President/Treasurer
NYPB&T’s portfolio managers currently oversee aggregate fixed-income investments of over $2 billion, comprised primarily of municipal, corporate, mortgage backed, and treasury securities. The managers have long tenures with the Bank and have successfully managed through the wide range of interest rate and credit cycles seen over the last three decades.
An NYPB&T Separately Managed Account (SMA) requires $5 million of investible assets and has a flat fee which declines for accounts over $20 million. SMAs are designed to meet the specific investment objectives of individual and institutional investors, and are governed by an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) developed in consultation with the client to ensure portfolio composition meets their needs and expectations. For fixed income portfolios, SMAs offer certain advantages over mutual funds that allow for better management of credit risk, portfolio duration, and taxes.

Investment Advisory
New York Private Bank & Trust provides services designed to assist investors in all aspects of decision-making related to the investment of their assets.

Investment objectives development
Investment strategy review
Asset and liability modeling
Analysis of unique investment opportunities

Performance reporting, evaluation and monitoring

Trust & Estate Administration
New York Private Bank & Trust offers a full range of fiduciary services that take into account investment management, tax, reporting and estate planning needs. At all times, we act in our clients’ best interests by remaining objective and avoiding any potential conflicts of interest. New York Private Bank & Trust does not not invest trust assets in proprietary investment products. We seek access to the best available managers and then monitor their performance to ensure that they continue to perform in our client’s best interests.

Intellectual Capital: Our staff of fiduciary experts has extensive experience working with high net worth families and individuals administering sophisticated estates and trusts with traditional as well as non-traditional fiduciary assets.
Services Offered: New York Private Bank & Trust offers a complete array of trust services including: acting as executor of an estate, administrative trustee, full trustee, co-trustee, trustee of charitable remainder or foundation trusts, as well as trustee of life insurance trusts, Rollover IRA accounts, Dynasty Trusts and Asset Protection Trusts.
The Delaware Advantage: By offering trust administration through our Delaware based trust affiliate; New York Private Trust Company, we extend to our fiduciary clients the benefits of a trust jurisdiction that is forward thinking, innovative and respected in fiduciary and investment matters. Our Delaware trust situs allows an individual to create trusts having a perpetual duration, asset protection capability, flexibility in financial planning and investment management, as well as favorable tax treatment by eliminating or reducing state fiduciary income tax.

Estate Administration
Proper estate planning includes both minimizing future tax liabilities as well as ensuring the client’s wealth is distributed according to their wishes.
New York Private Bank & Trust’s fiduciary experts have extensive experience working exclusively with high net worth families and individuals in administering sophisticated estates. This experience includes administering estates with traditional assets (stocks, bonds and tangible personal property), as well as non-traditional assets such as real estate holdings, operating business interests, partnerships, oil and gas interests, collectibles, hedge funds, private equity, structured notes and other alternative investments.
Estate administration services include:

Identifying and valuing estate assets
Paying taxes, creditors and expenses
Preparing and filing tax documents
Distributing assets to beneficiaries

Non-Traditional Assets
Our substantial experience in dealing with sophisticated investments, real estate portfolios and operating business interests, allows us to assess a client’s entire portfolio and adopt a course of action designed to maximize value for the family, even if it means continuing to hold such assets. Estates owning real estate assets have access to the Milstein family’s world-class experience in developing, managing and operating real estate nationally and internationally. Similarly, through our affiliates, New York Private Bank & Trust’s fiduciary experts have access to sophisticated investment and business specialists with deep experience in evaluating on-going businesses, hiring and over-seeing management and determining how to best maximize value.
We welcome the opportunity to work with you and your advisors in exploring ways in which New York Private Bank & Trust’s team of fiduciary experts can assist you in reaching your goals.


Precious Metals
Through our subsidiary, NYPB&T Precious Metals, LLC, we offer clients the ability to efficiently purchase and store physical precious metals. Using our state-of-the-art technology platform, we provide access to an institutional dealer network for transactions and a global network of secure vaulting facilities for safe storage of allocated bullion.
Gold as the New Government Bonds – A summary for the wealth management clients of Gold Bullion International 
Gold as an asset class:

Our experts are highly experienced in helping clients understand the dynamics of gold investing and how gold may help them preserve wealth for future generations.

Gold’s role in portfolio construction:

“True” portfolio diversification – low correlation to most asset classes in “normal” markets and negatively correlated during periods of market stress
Useful for protecting against losses from “tail events” and financial crises
Protection against wealth decay impacts of inflation and currency devaluation

Other gold characteristics:

Moderate volatility
The gold market is deep and liquid
Gold has no credit or counterparty risk

An array of precious metals products:

Gold, silver, platinum, and palladium (bullion bars and coins)
Global storage locations: Salt Lake City, New York, Toronto, London, Zurich, Singapore, and Melbourne. Clients may move holdings between vault locations and transfer-in metals held elsewhere.

Transparency and Liquidity

Transactions are performed on an agency basis through a network of institutional dealers that actively compete for each transaction.
Our competitive bidding model provides transparency, best execution, and access to a broad pool of liquidity

Storage and security

Bullion is stored in allocated form and clients retain direct, titled ownership at all times
Client holdings are fully insured for 100% replacement value by Lloyd’s of London
Physical audits of stored metals by KPMG at each vault location

Delivery

Clients may take possession of precious metals holdings at any time
Precious metals are delivered via insured, commercial courier or armored vehicle

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7.

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.
