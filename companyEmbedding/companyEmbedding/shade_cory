Bite Beauty Cava Amuse Bouche Lipstick
Bite Beauty Edgy Neutrals Amuse Bouche Lipsticks ($26.00 for 0.15 oz.) includes five new shades and a few repromoted shades.  Per the brand, four of the five are limited edition (all but Cava).  Honeycomb, Molasses, and Thistle are repromoted shades, and the swatches below are of the original launches (I did not repurchase as they were reviewed recently).  I also included a swatch of the re-released Cava in Luminous Creme form.

Lots of unusual shades here! Molasses is my favorite so far I think. I like the super creamy finish of these.

I’m not sure what I think of the LE shades. They’re pretty, but perhaps a bit too yellow for my taste?

Seriously, I must be burned out on lipsticks because nothing here intrigues me.  I don’t really wear brown lipsticks and never wear really nude lipsticks.  They seem to wash me out and so I tend to stay with more colorful options. I am sure these will work for many though and since Bite has such a nice formula I think they will work for many.

Cava and Thistle are calling my name!  Bite Beauty is such a weakness of mine. I need to compare these shades to ones I already have.  I’m thinking Cava may be similar to Sake.

Not so similar that you can’t do both, at least on me.

Hmmm.  I think it’s worth a trip to swatch!  It really is a beautiful shade, and this is my favorite formula of lipstick.

Oh how I hope that when I go to try on Cava Luminous Cream, plus Thistle and Honeycomb, one of them works on me! Those are so pretty!
I love Molasses, but fear that it looks too much like my MAC Royally Riotous? I’ll check in the Swatch Gallery!

These seem to have a nice ‘juicy’ effect on your lips, Christine! I do like Portobello and Porcini in particular.

All of these, except MAYBE Thistle would look HORRENDOUS on me, and i’m sad because I love to support Canadian brands. 
But I hope they are the usual amazing BITE formula for people who DO like the colours!!

I don’t think any of these colors would work on me, but I do like the finish.  Hopefully this line will be successful and Bite will expand it.

Honeycomb is a beautiful colour – I’m glad it was included in this collection! When I first saw the new skintone-like shades, I thought they were more of a concealer!

Mushroom names…yes!  New ones are too yellow for me as well, but may revisit Molasses. Cava and Thistle (and Sake, Valerie) are already in my bite bag.  For me, the descriptions are pretty true.  Cava leans lilac, Thistle is a lavender greige, and Sake is pink/mauve ( as pink as I go.) But some shades look radically different on me than on Christine.  So, try ’em, Valerie.  You’ll probably like them all.  Dying to hear how Cava pulls on Nancy.

On one hand, I’m happy to see a twist on neutrals.  On the other hand, I think most of these shades are really unappealing.  I like Cava, Thistle, and Molasses.  Most of the shades are too yellow-based for my taste.  I wish they’d done a few more grayed shades to balance out the collection.
Oh, and Cava is listed twice.  Was there supposed to be another color?

? I can’t wear nearly all of these shades or they’d make me look like a corpse or they’re too yellow-based for my complexion. They’re cool colours though. The only one I could get on with is Molasses, it’s quite an unusual caramel colour.

I’m glad to see that they brought back Cava. I remember seeing a lot of disappointment that it was discontinued, and it’s good to see a company that responds to its customer base. 
As far as the new shades, those browns look like they’d be terrible on me, and yet I’m completely fascinated by them, because they also look so original.

Well… I might be able to wear Thistle, although it would probably work better on me if I layer it over something darker. I wish nude lips were not the BIG THING for spring, because they make me look sick, or worse…
If you have the coloring for it (which apparently most people do?) these look great, and several of the shades are interesting…  and at least they have included two shades that lean cool, which most brands probably won’t bother to do, so I guess I shouldn’t complain so much!

I’m really digging the mushroom shades! I think I’m one of the people that could pull a few of these yellowish browns off but it’s really the price tag that has me waiting to pull the trigger. I have several Bite lipsticks that I bought and haven’t worn yet so I might hold off. Cava, Cremini, and Enoki are calling my name 🙂

Molasses is the only one I find even vaguely interesting.

So, I’m curious…what’s the difference between the Cava Amuse Bouche and the Cava Luminous Creme?  I understand that they are two different formulas – I have a bunch of the Amuse Bouche lipsticks, but it’s been a while since I’ve used the Luminous Creme. I’ve got both in my cart at Sephora because I just can’t decide – the Amuse Bouche is $26.00 and the Luminous Creme is $24.00; both are 0.15 oz. For those of you who have both formulas, how would you describe the difference? And do you have a preference? Do you see a difference color-wise in the two Cavas? Maybe I’ll just have to order both!

I JUST got the Amuse Bouche Cava! Man do I LOVE IT! If I had seen Thistle on you, I would’ve gotten that as well. Probably still will, I have a thing for muted lavender-purple-grey shades. Cava is def my type of every day neutral & its soooo comfortable. I’m so glad that sheens & shiny lips are back in the game.
I don’t entirely understand the difference between the Amuse Bouche that I have & the Luminous Creme. They both look the same.
Anyway, very happy w/this formula & shade! ?

						Lamp
					





				
				 Lamps can highlight your decor or simply shed light where it’s needed in your home. Whether you need a lamp for your bedside table or a decorative lamp for the hallway, look for one that combines form and function.  
How to Choose the Right Lamp
Assess your lighting needs. Are you looking for a nightstand lamp to brighten up the guest room or a table top lamp for your desk? Do you simply need a new floor lamp to update the style of a room? Will you use it for work? Try a rotary switch lamps for dimming. Find a lamp style that suits your space. Depending on the room, you may want a lamp that blends in or one that makes a statement. The color, size, shape and light output will impact the look and feel of the room. Keep the style of the room in mind, and think of the lamp as an accent piece that enhances the décor. Hint: These bronze finish lamps work well in almost any space.

Respect the Shade
Lamps and shades may be purchased together or separately. Either way, the shade plays a major role in the overall look of a lamp. Little touches like vintage metal light shades can completely change the way a room feels without a total overhaul.

I hate mica and shimmer so when I found her site five years ago I was really happy.The samples back then were huge! I loved Cory's blushes, ordered 2 colors that lasted ages.I went back last year to reorder. The pigments were not mixed very well and the product smelled like baby powder. I thought she used rice powder...anyway the talc broke me out.I ordered a year later Cory's lip and cheek stain. I was pretty excited to get it because it seemed like the product I was looking for~all natural, no Carmine (instead the pigment was produced from beets) in olive oil.Well two months later I got a pathetic, tiny vial of red viscous liquid leaking inside a ziploc baggie. I could have looked past that, I know shipping can be tough on packaging. I opened it and WHEW...WHAT A STINK! I thought "ok, it is a naturally sourced product" I saw no preservatives in the ingredient list, not even grapefruit seed extract. I wrote to Cory (You can't call) and asked her about the smell and if it was okay to use. She never responded. I waited for 2 weeks. I finally decided to try it.I didn't have a reaction right away, but when I did it, I got huge horrid painful welts where I had applied the cheek stain. They have finally dried up (they weren't pimples, they were something else :S) and flaking off...but WTF???? I will never order anything from Cory again.

I ordered about a dozen sample blushes, and now that I've tried them I realize it will probably take me a long, long time to use up all the product. The colors are stunning, really, and there is a ton to choose from. The cons for me are that the samples come in little bags that are hard to work with and application can be tricky since they are so pigmented. Other than that I've been really impressed. I only need a tiny granule to get a good amount of color.  I'm glad I tried these. They were inexpensive and shipped to me quickly (although I've read it took other people quite a while to get their orders).

I've developed a sensitivity to mica and it seems like it's in almost everything nowadays. I ordered a few different shades in the sample sizes: Deliverance, Haste, Justice, and Liberty and two bronzers: Bahama and Tahiti. The sample sizes are very generous in my opinion. They each come in a tiny ziploc bag but since a little goes a very long way I know they will last a while. I pour out just a few grains into the palm of my hand and apply with a blush brush, and even then the blush can look too heavy. So be very careful in how much you use. The color lasts all day long and looks just as good as when it was applied until I wash it off. I am really impressed with this blush, and have also ordered some mineral makeup from Cory that I'm excited to try.Deliverance: Very bright coral pink. I'd only use it at night when I'm going out. Too bright for daytime, in my opinion.Haste: Orange coral. Too orange for me, but I could see it working on some skin tones.Justice: Nice light coral. Still a little more orange than I would like, but it's very wearable.Liberty: Light rosy pink. I was looking for a dupe to my HG Milani Luminous (before the mica sensitivity) and this is the closest I've found from these samples. It's a very good dupe and I'll most likely order the full size of this shade.Tahiti: Way too light on my skin. I applied and applied but couldn't see a difference.Bahama: Perfect bronzer shade for me. I'll probably order the travel size when my sample runs out.

It's a nice peachy shade for fall and has amazing staying power.  It has not caused any breakouts, and a little bit goes a very very long way.

It is definitely the Holy Grail of bronzers for PPP skin.  Recently, I decided to send for 10 or more samples of Cory blush.  I was THRILLED when I sampled the first one which happened to be FOXY.  Each day I couldn't wait to put my makeup on to experience another one of the FABULOUS Cory blush colors.  Each one blends into the skin perfectly.  The color can be soft or more intense by regulating the amount of product you place on your blush.  So far my "must have" colors are SINFUL, FOXY, PROMISE, COSMO PINK, OCOTILLO BRONZER, WHATEVER, DEVILISH, BRONZE HAZE, LAVA, and WICKED.  I am a big fan of Aromaleigh blushes, but Cory's color and texture are even nicer.  As for the smell of tobacco or the blending not being perfect, these are things I have not experienced.  I am amazed at the unbelievably gorgeous colors, the application, the very excellent price for the quality, the service!  To me Cory is terrific!		     Report Abuse           				mortmain				   on  2/24/2008 11:18:00 AM   More reviews by mortmain    Age: 44-55 Skin: Normal, Other, Not Sure Hair: Brown, Other, Other Eyes: Brown     			I highly recommend Cory's products in general:  the color range is phenomenal, the application smooth, the price very inexpensive considering how little product is needed.  I, too, am fair-complected, and although I generally prefer matte blushes, Devilish is a favorite for me.  The shimmer is slight, more of a healthy glow, as an earlier poster noted.  In fact, I have sometimes used this color as a finisher, an all-over color.Other colors I have tried and loved are Plum Berry, a matte mauve, Misty Rose, a pale pink shimmery hi-lighter, Tahiti Bronzer.I recommend trying the makeup for yourself --- samples are only .35.

The consistency is not even, so all of a sudden you'll get a red streak across your face while applying. The real dealbreaker is THE HORRIBLE CIGARETTE SMELL! There are other mmu companies out there that are prepared in more sanitary conditions. Also, the customer service is terrible- she doesn't answer emails and there is no phone number you can call. I will never repurchase from this company. It's really too bad, the colors were beautiful.

Very easy to apply and leave no streaky mark upon application. What I love about this blush is that you only need a little to add colors to your cheeks. The color is natural looking and it actually LASTS all day. There are so many beautiful mineral blushes on the market today including Lauress, Everydayminerals, Alima, Afterglowcosmetics.  Afteglow blushes to last for a long time too but their colors aren't as impressive as Cory's blushes. The other name brand mineral blushes just do not last on my skin. They disappear within an hour or so. Even though some of the other name brands have beautiful blushes they are poorly pigmented which forced me to have to apply too many layers to achieve the same colors as Cory's.  This in turn can make my face look cakey, overdone, accentuate pores, flaws, rub away concealers,  and unnatural. Therefore I have to give Cory's blush a five for ease of application, natural looking, nice color selection, and long lasting. I almost forget to mention that Cory's price is unbeatable too!

Cory is the only make up line I now use for foundation and blushes. The make up comes in plastic containers which I feel like break over time esp since this make up will last a LONG time on your shelf even with everyday use.

The samples are only .35 each.  I also got some blush samples to try.  I love "devilish" shade.  I am fair skinned  and quite pale; I would buy the lightest foundation shade in the drugstore. This gives me a healthy glow.  It is quite nuetral I can wear either peach or pink toned lipstick/clothing and it will not clash.  The only disadvantage with Cory is that is a wait for products. I do suggest trying the blushes if you are trying/buying the foundation.  She has a great range of colours. July 2006  I changed this to will not repurchase.  Cory has not been answering her emails.  I placed an order and received it (delayed).  But worst was one of the products was in a faulty container.  I sent her two emails (two weeks apart) and received only her auto response.  This was to "incorrect orders" email for customer service issues.   If you check delphi forum for mineral makeup mania you can see the problems.  Also there is many other wonderful mineral makeup companies that answer emails promptly (Everyday Minerals within an hour on the weekend) and ship quickly.  This was a minor issue and most vendors would have sent the correct jar (container) out and she did not even bother to answer the email.  I can't imagine if I was short shipped, etc.  2007 Still love the blush but will not order from her.		     Report Abuse  2 of 2 people found this helpful.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
