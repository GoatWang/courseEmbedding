"Why don't you have a cart on your website?"
We believe that our products require the personal touch of a live sales person in order to fully understand the customer's requirement or application and to 
	provide the maximum discount available.  Most websites that sell via a cart system  
	offer a flat discount or none at all.  Our goal is to get you the right product at the right price as quickly 
	as possible the FIRST TIME.

Shopping 
                        FAQs
Which 
                        credit cards do you accept?
                          Visa, 
						MasterCard and Discover/Novus cards are accepted, 
                          as well as debit cards that bear the Visa or 
						MasterCard 
                          logo. American Express is also accepted. Back 
                          to Top

Can 
                        I cancel my order?
                          Yes, you can, as long as manufacturing of your item has not yet begun,  shipped, or is a special built-to-order 
					  item. If the order has already been 
                          sent to the vendor we will attempt to cancel the order, 
                          but cannot guarantee that the cancellation will be possible. 
                          If you do receive an order that was canceled, accept delivery 
                          of the item and call  Customer Service  for return 
                          instructions. Back to Top
I 
                        canceled my order but I haven't received a credit yet. 
                        How long do credits take?
                          We submit all requests for credits within 24 hours of 
                          receipt; however, it may take 7-10 business days for you 
                          to receive your credit. Back to Top
Can 
                        I return an item that is damaged, defective, or I just 
                        don't want?
                          If, within 30 days, you wish to return a defective or damaged item, it may be repaired, replaced or credited upon full M&M Control Service and/or factory evaluation for the full merchandise amount less any shipping charges. Material no longer needed may be subject to a restock charge. Special order or built-to-order items are not  returnable unless defective or damaged and will be repaired or replaced only.
Merchandise 
                        returned without authorization will be refused, and the 
                        carrier will charge you freight in both directions. To 
                        avoid additional restocking charges, please return your 
                        merchandise in the original box and packing materials, 
                        including all accessories and the owner's manual. Do not 
                        destroy or discard original packing for 30 days. The value 
                        of missing accessories will be deducted from the credit 
                        amount of a return.
Special / Built-to-order merchandise is not returnable. Refurbished merchandise 
                        can only be returned if damaged or defective. Certain 
                        merchandise may require manufacturer service first before 
                        return is allowed. Back to Top
What
                        happens if the item I ordered is not available?
 Our
                          vendors ship products before the estimated delivery
                          in the vast majority of cases. On occasion, however,
                          an order may be delayed due to availability or other
                          circumstances. In the unlikely event there is a change
                          or delay in filling your order, we will notify you
                          via phone, postal mail or e-mail. We know that this
                          can be inconvenient, and we will offer you one of the
                          following alternatives as appropriate to your situation:
Offer an 
                        ALTERNATE selection (if possible). 
Offer a BACKORDER 
                        and new estimated delivery. You can wait for the new delivery 
                        date, or cancel. See below:
CANCEL your 
                        order. We constantly update our computer system with new 
                        information from our vendors. On rare occasions new circumstances 
                        come to our attention after the placement of your order. 
                        Therefore, we reserve the right to cancel your order for 
                        a full refund at any time. Also see FAQ "Can I cancel my order?"
Why 
                        was I charged sales tax on my purchase?
                          State tax is applied to an item if M&M Control
                            or the vendor conducts business in the ship-to-address state, in a drop ship situation. Back to Top

Shipping 
                        FAQs
How 
                        long will it take to receive my order?
                          Factory ship times vary. Once material is ready to ship, the standard shipping time for orders shipped via UPS ground 
                          is 1-5 days or more dependent on location and shipping method. Large items are shipped via common carrier 
                          (trucking company) and may take up to 7-14 days to arrive dependent on location and shipping method. 
                          Back to Top

Can 
                        I have an order shipped to my P.O. Box? 
                          UPS is our approved carrier, and will ship only to a valid street address to ensure proper delivery. 
                          Back to Top
Can 
                        I ship my order to a different address? 
                          Yes! If placing an order with a customer service agent please advise address at the time of the order. If sending a PO electronically via fax or e-mail, please indicate shipping instructions and location on your order. Remember to use a street address, not a Post Office Box, for any shipping address. Back to Top
How 
                        are shipping charges calculated?
                          Shipping charges vary according to product type, weight, destination, and shipping method. Product pricing as quoted does not include shipping charges. All products are shipped FOB Destination. Therefore, we are not able to reduce shipping charges for any reason.
Most products are shipped via UPS (because they offer package insurance and excellent tracking software). Larger items are generally shipped via common carrier, and require higher shipping rates. Express / Accelerated delivery options may be available and in most cases, require an additional fee. Back to Top
