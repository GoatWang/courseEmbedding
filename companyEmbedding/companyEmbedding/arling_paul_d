Interview With The Chairman And CEO: Universal Electronics (UEIC) - Paul D. ArlingHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Interview With The Chairman And CEO: Universal Electronics (UEIC) - Paul D. ArlingWall Street TranscriptJuly 25, 2011ReblogShareTweetShare67 WALL STREET, New York - July 25, 2011 - The Wall Street Transcript has just published its Electronic Components Report offering a timely review of the sector to serious investors and industry executives. This special feature contains expert industry commentary through in-depth interviews with public company CEOs, Equity Analysts and Money Managers. The full issue is available by calling (212) 952-7433 or via The Wall Street Transcript Online. Topics covered: Growing Electronic Component Content - Secular, Seasonal and Cyclical Demand Trends - Supply Chain Disruptions Companies include: AT&T (T); Aruba Networks (ARUN); Ingram Micro (IM); ASML (ASML); AVX (AVX); Aeroflex (ARX); and many more. In the following brief excerpt from the Electronic Components Report, expert analysts discuss the outlook for the sector and for investors. Paul D. Arling is Chairman and CEO of Universal Electronics (UEI).  Mr. Arling joined UEI in May 1996 as CFO and was named to the company's board of directors in August 1996. He was appointed President and COO in September 1998, was promoted to CEO in October of 2000 and was appointed Chairman in July 2001. Prior to UEI, Mr. Arling was with LESCO, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of professional turf-care products. He served in various capacities while with LESCO between 1993 and 1996, including Director of Corporate Planning, Controller and ultimately CFO. Before joining LESCO, Mr. Arling was Director of Planning for Imperial Wallcoverings, in Cleveland, Ohio. He also provided strategic management consulting services while at the Michael Allen Company in Darien, Conn. Mr. Arling holds a B.S. in economics and an MBA from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. TWST: What has taken place at Universal Electronics over the last year that investors should focus on? Mr. Arling: UEI has a strong, long-term track record of both sales and earnings growth. In fact, we have been profitable every quarter since the fourth quarter of 1997, when we developed a strong balance sheet and further strengthened our position in the marketplace, even during these difficult past two years. We are also in a fast-growing and ever-changing industry that requires new forms of control. We are the global leader in developing this kind of innovative technology. UEI now makes about one-third of all remotes made on the planet, in terms of both the chips and the remotes made for all AV devices in the world. In addition, we have also successfully added two companies to our portfolio to further support our position as the leader in the remote control market globally. We completed an acquisition approximately two years ago, February of 2009, of a universal remote-control-chip business. Just last November, we acquired a China-based manufacturing company, which further expands our presence in the consumer electronics market, as well as putting us in the range of between $485 million to $510 million in projected sales for 2011. TWST: As the global leader in wireless control technology, would you expand a bit on the breadth of products and services that UEI provides today? Mr. Arling: The heart of the universal remote control is a chip that resides within the product that contains the control codes and the software that's engaged in controlling either a TV, a set-top box, a DVD player, Blu-ray or AV receiver or really anything in your AV stack. We develop that fundamental software and set of codes. Beyond that, we also design and manufacture the remotes themselves for major customers across the world. TWST: Who are your main competitors at this point and what gives you the advantage over them? Mr. Arling: The main competitors vary by the markets in which we participate. In consumer electronics, or what we refer to as the OEM market, there are a number of companies who are engaged in the remote control market, such as Alps, SMK and Philips. The subscription broadcasting side includes cable, satellite and IPTV markets, and the competitors vary by region. Here in the United States, you have companies like Universal Remote Control, again SMK and Philips. In Europe, the business is more localized, and competitors include companies such as ruwido, which is based in Austria. So that is a general look at our competitors.What makes us different is again the heart of the product and the intellectual property we've built around it, not just our database. And UEI has the world's largest database of codes, which is embedded as I said before in about a third of the world's remote controls today, but also some of the features that we have built into the products. We have a 25-year history of creating the innovations that address the ever-changing needs of the markets we serve, and we have proven our leadership in innovation even more significantly over the last couple of years. TWST: As we look ahead to the next several years and examine the way the markets you serve are developing, what specific trends are emerging that are going to help you steer UEI's focus? Mr. Arling: There are a couple of trends. One is the change in regional growth patterns over the last five years. Five years ago, major growth was occurring in Western Europe and the U.S. Now, the growth has shifted to countries outside the U.S. and outside of Western Europe. While the U.S. and Western European markets are still the largest in the world, the growth that we are seeing in the other regions of the world is substantial, particularly in Latin America and Asia. To proactively address these foreseen changes, UEI made investments over the last five years, and particularly over the last two to three years, in Latin America and Asia to develop not only a product that is specifically designed for those regions by placing individuals in those regions, but built out a sales and support infrastructure to be able to serve the customers in those regions.
