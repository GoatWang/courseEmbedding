The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

ForeSight® FAQs
Most common questions regarding ForeSight.









Frequently Asked Questions:







Does ForeSight handle all lines of business in a single system?


Absolutely. ForeSight was designed and implemented with the end-user in mind by allowing all lines of business to be illustrated in common manner without performing different actions to achieve similar results for dissimilar insurance products.
                                


Does ForeSight work on an tablet devices?


Yes. ForeSight's user experience is uniquely designed to work on tablet devices and adapt to each environment accessing it. Because of the adaptive model the user works through a common workflow while taking advantage of the capabilities of each device accessing it, including tablet devices.
                                


Do you offer both online and offline access?


ForeSight is architected to be the same system without regards to the deployment device or user access method. The system you access through your browser is the same system you access when deployed to your machine.
                                


Can you utilize components from existing systems in building the insurance products within ForeSight?


Because of the technology we used while architecting the solution we are able to integrate and access external and third-party components in a very elegant and efficient performing manner. We commonly integrate insurance company's calculation components within ForeSight to leverage the effort already put in to create the accurate calculation results companies have worked hard to achieve while realizing the true value of the ForeSight system.
                                


Do you have an automated testing solution?


TestBench is our proprietary testing solution for testing output and calculation results within ForeSight for implemented insurance products.
                                


Can ForeSight® illustrate sales concepts such as Split Dollar and Private Split Dollar?


Yes, ForeSight can illustrate Split Dollar and Private Split Dollar along with many other sales concepts such as Business Continuation, Executive Bonus, Key Person, Mortgage Cancellation, Perm vs. Term, Social Security Bridge, Stretch IRA and many more.
                                


Is there an easy way to update rates and jurisdiction approval data for ForeSight®?


Yes, the ForeSight data management tool, DataSight, allows you to control data updates to the illustration system.  With DataSight you can maintain data that changes frequently such as product configuration, availability and features, account information, and product rates. You can also clone products to create new products based on existing product configurations in DataSight.
                                


Can ForeSight® reports contain marketing sheets that print with illustration reports?


Yes, ForeSight reports output can incorporate marketing content in PDF format.

Reflexive Questioning



Business rules in FireLight® define acceptable data entry and queue additional questions and/or forms to generate a complete and 100% In Good Order application (IGO e-apps) submission. The level and complexity of data capture in FireLight is completely up to your implementation and carrier defined data requirements on current state filed forms. 








Electronic Signature – eSign



At no additional cost, FireLight® provides a proprietary e-signature feature with multiple signature capture options in both connected and offline instances. FireLight offers your sales force the ability to present and capture e-signatures directly on tablet devices for a comfortable, highly adoptable, acceptable e-signing process workflow. The advanced built-in e-signing process includes multiple layers of identity authentication options and provides an admissible audit trail to meet your compliance requirements.
