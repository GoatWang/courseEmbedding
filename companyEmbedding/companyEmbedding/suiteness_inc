The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Suiteness - Terms and Conditions





























Terms and Conditions
Below you will find the Terms and Conditions for Suiteness effective July 1, 2015.




Terms used in this Agreement
The terms "we", "us", "our" and "Suiteness" refer to Suiteness Inc., a Delaware corporation. The term "you" refers to the customer visiting the Website and/or booking a reservation through us on this Website, or through our customer service agents.
Purpose of this Website
This Website is provided solely to assist you to gather travel information, determine the availability of travel-related goods and services, make legitimate reservations or otherwise transact business with travel suppliers, and for no other purposes.
This Website (“Website”) is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of all the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, the "Terms of Use” or “Agreement"). Please read the Terms of Use carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. You should also read our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website. By accessing or using this Website, booking any reservations for travel products or services on this Website, or contacting our call center agents, you agree that the Terms of Use then in force shall apply. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, please do not use or book any reservations through this Website or our call center agents. 
Use of the Website
As a condition of your use of this Website, you warrant that

you are at least 18 years of age;
you possess the legal authority to create a binding legal obligation; 
you will use this Website in accordance with these Terms of Use; 
you will only use this Website to make legitimate reservations for you or for another person for whom you are legally authorized to act; 
you will inform such other persons about the Terms of Use that apply to the reservations you have made on their behalf, including all rules and restrictions applicable thereto; 
all information supplied by you on this Website is true, accurate, current and complete; and 
if you have an Suiteness account, you will safeguard your account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your account by you and anyone other than you. 

We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny access to anyone to this Website and the services we offer, at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of these Terms of Use.
DISPUTES
Suiteness is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.
You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Website, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy Policy (“Claims”) by contacting Customer Support. If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.
Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, travel suppliers or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms of Use, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms of Use required arbitration.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Terms of Use as a court would.
Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section. If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees, unless the arbitrator determines your Claims are frivolous. You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to “Suiteness: Arbitration Claim Manager,” at Suiteness, Inc., 300 Lakeside Drive, Suite 404 Oakland CA, 94618. If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided.
Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.
Prohibited Activities
The content and information on this Website (including, but not limited to, price and availability of travel services), as well as the infrastructure used to provide such content and information, are proprietary to us or our suppliers and providers. While you may make limited copies of your travel itinerary (and related documents) for travel or service reservations booked through this Website, you agree not to otherwise modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell or re-sell any information, software, products, or services obtained from or through this Website. Additionally, you agree not to:

use this Website or its contents for any commercial purpose;
make any speculative, false, or fraudulent reservation or any reservation in anticipation of demand; 
access, monitor or copy any content or information of this Website using any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means or any manual process for any purpose without our express written permission; 
violate the restrictions in any robot exclusion headers on this Website or bypass or circumvent other measures employed to prevent or limit access to this Website; 
take any action that imposes, or may impose, in our discretion, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;
deep-link to any portion of this Website (including, without limitation, the purchase path for any travel services) for any purpose without our express written permission; or 
"frame", "mirror" or otherwise incorporate any part of this Website into any other website without our prior written authorization.

If your booking or account shows signs of fraud, abuse or suspicious activity, we may cancel any travel or service reservations associated with your name, email address or account, and close any associated Suiteness accounts. In addition, we may verify (i.e. preauthorize) your credit card. If you have conducted any fraudulent activity, Suiteness reserves the right to take any necessary legal action and you may be liable for monetary losses to Suiteness, including litigation costs and damages. To contest the cancellation of a booking or freezing or closure of an account, please contact Suiteness Customer Service.
Supplier Rules and Restrictions
Additional terms and conditions will apply to your reservation and purchase of travel-related goods and services that you select. Please read these additional terms and conditions carefully. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions of purchase imposed by any supplier with whom you elect to deal, including, but not limited to, payment of all amounts when due and compliance with the supplier's rules and restrictions regarding availability and use of fares, products, or services. We reserve the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion.
Some hotel suppliers may require you to present a credit card or cash deposit upon check-in to cover additional expenses incurred during your stay. Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by us for your hotel booking.
Suiteness is not liable for any costs incurred due to relocation.
You acknowledge that some suppliers offering certain services and/or activities may require you to sign their liability waiver prior to participating in the service and/or activity they offer. You understand that any violation of any such supplier's rules and restrictions may result in cancellation of your reservation(s), in your being denied access to the applicable travel product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such reservation(s), and/or in our debiting your account for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.
Privacy Policy
Please review our current Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of this Website, to understand our practices.
Prices
You acknowledge that the authorities in certain countries may impose certain additional taxes (tourist tax, etc), which have to be paid locally. You are exclusively responsible for paying such additional taxes.
You acknowledge that, except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amount we retain for our services, we do not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The hotel suppliers invoice us for certain charges, including, where appropriate, tax amounts. The hotel suppliers remit the applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. The tax recovery charges which we charge you on prepaid hotel transactions represent the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc) that we pay to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the rental of the room. They do not represent a collection of taxes from you for us to remit to the applicable tax authorities. The actual tax amounts paid by us to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers. We retain our service fees as compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Our service fees vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation.
Suiteness does not act as co-vendor with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location.
Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (facilitation fee and/or service fee) in certain jurisdictions. For hotel stays in New York State, but outside of New York City, for example, tax recovery charges, as described above, are collected to cover the taxes due on the rent received by the hotel for the room and there is no local hotel occupancy tax due on our services. The actual tax amounts on our services may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time of your hotel stay.
Prepaid Hotel Reservations
Suiteness’s and it's affiliates pre-negotiate certain room rates with hotels to facilitate the booking of reservations on your behalf. You also acknowledge that Suiteness provides you services to facilitate such booking of reservations for a consideration (the “facilitation fee.”) You authorize Suiteness to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges and service fees. You agree that your credit card will be charged for the total reservation price by Suiteness.
You may cancel or change your prepaid hotel reservation, but you will be charged the cancellation or change fee indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. If you do not cancel or change your reservation before the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, which varies by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours) prior to your date of arrival, you will be subject to a charge equal to applicable nightly rates, tax recovery charges and service fees. In the event you do not show for the first night of the reservation and plan to check-in for subsequent nights in your reservation, you must confirm the reservation changes with us no later than the date of the first night of the reservation to prevent cancellation of your reservation. You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some reservations cannot be changed or cancelled after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations.
You may not book reservations for more than 8 rooms online for the same hotel/stay dates. If we determine that you have booked reservations for more than 8 rooms in total in separate reservations, we may cancel your reservations, and charge you a cancellation fee, if applicable. If you paid a non-refundable deposit, your deposit will be forfeited. If you wish to book reservations for 9 or more rooms, you must contact our group travel specialists by phone at (800) 916-3290 or by filling out the group travel form online. One of our group travel specialists will research your request and contact you to complete your reservation. You may be asked to sign a written contract and/or pay a nonrefundable deposit.
Pay Now or Pay Later Details
With certain hotels, you may be presented with the option to pay online now or pay later at the hotel. If you select the “Pay Online Now” option, Suiteness will charge the amount to your credit card in US dollars immediately. If you select “Pay Later at the Hotel”, the hotel will charge your credit card in the local currency at the time of your stay. Please note that taxes and fees vary between the two payment options. Tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change in the time between booking and stay. Suiteness coupons may only be applied to "Pay Online Now" bookings.
International Travel
You are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements are met. Suiteness has no special knowledge regarding foreign entry requirements or travel documents. We urge customers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.
Passport and Visa: You must consult the relevant Embassy or Consulate for this information. Requirements may change and you should check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. We accept no liability if you are refused entry onto a flight or into any country due to your failure to carry the correct and adequate passport, visa, or other travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries you may just be transiting through. This includes all stops made by the aircraft, even if you do not leave the aircraft or airport.
Health: Recommended inoculations for travel may change and you should consult your doctor for current recommendations before you depart. It is your responsibility to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements, obtain the recommended inoculations, take all recommended medication, and follow all medical advice in relation to your trip.
Disinsection: Although not common, most countries reserve the right to disinsect aircraft if there is a perceived threat to public health, agriculture or environment. The World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization have approved the following disinsection procedures: (1) spray the aircraft cabin with an aerosolized insecticide while passengers are on board or (2) treat the aircraft's interior surfaces with a residual insecticide while passengers are not on board. For more information, see: http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/policy/safetyenergyenv/disinsection.htm BY OFFERING RESERVATIONS FOR TRAVEL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH AREAS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND ARE NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.

Your mobile device must be connected to the internet for the Mobile Application to function correctly. You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for your device to have internet connectivity and are responsible for all sums your service provider may charge you arising out of the Mobile Application transmitting and receiving data (including but not limited to data roaming charges). As further described in our Privacy Policy, the Mobile Application will automatically transfer a small amount of data as part of its normal operation, including how you use the Mobile Application, which Content you access, and technical errors or problems which the Application may encounter while being used. By using the Mobile Application, you acknowledge, agree and consent to the automatic collection of this information.
Currency Converter
If a currency converter is available on this website, currency rates are based on various publicly available sources and should be used as guidelines only. Rates are not verified as accurate, and actual rates may vary. Currency quotes are not updated every day. You are advised to check the date on the currency converter feature for the day that currency was last updated. The information supplied by this application is believed to be accurate, but Suiteness, and/or our respective suppliers do not warrant or guarantee such accuracy. When using this information for any financial purpose, we advise you to consult a qualified professional to verify the accuracy of the currency rates. We do not authorize the use of this information for any purpose other than your personal use and you are expressly prohibited from the resale, redistribution, and use of this information for commercial purposes.
Payments and Fees
In the event that your payment is taken at the time of booking, the company taking that payment and charging your credit card will be Travel Partner Exchange or another member of Suiteness doing business as Suiteness, who takes such payment on behalf of the company providing the travel service or the travel service provider directly. Some bank and card companies charge their account holders a transaction fee when the card issuer and the merchant location (as defined by the card brand, e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express) are in different countries. The currency exchange rate, if applicable, and any transaction fee is determined solely by the bank or other agency processing the transaction. These fees may be applied by the card issuer as a charge to the cardholders account. When applied by the card issuer, the fees will be listed separately from the transaction amount on a credit or debit card statement. This means the amount listed on your credit or debit card statement may be a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on this Website. If you have any questions about these fees or any exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.
