FBL Financial Group, Inc. is a financial services holding company whose purpose is to protect livelihoods and futures. Its primary operating subsidiary, Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company, underwrites and markets a broad range of life insurance and annuities to individuals and businesses. These products are distributed by multiline exclusive Farm Bureau agents, principally under the consumer brand name Farm Bureau Financial Services. In addition, FBL manages all aspects of two Farm Bureau-affiliated property-casualty insurance companies for a fee. FBL Financial Group is headquartered in West Des Moines, Iowa, and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FFG.
History[edit]
The company traces its history to the Great Depression in the 1930s, when the Iowa chapter of the Farm Bureau established Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company in 1939 to meet the insurance needs of its farmers.[1]
Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company was founded as Iowa Life Insurance Company on October 30, 1944, and opened for business in 1945.
Over the years, various state Farm Bureaus merged their insurance company operations into the company. In July 1996, FBL Financial Group was listed on the New York Stock Exchange at a split-adjusted initial public offering price of $8.75.
In 2003, one of FBL's primary operating subsidiaries, EquiTrust Life Insurance Company, began distribution of single premium deferred annuity products nationally through independent marketing organizations. In 2004, EquiTrust began marketing indexed annuity products, and became a significant presence in the independent distribution annuity marketplace. FBL sold EquiTrust Life to a controlled affiliate of Guggenheim Partners in 2011.[2]

					Full Description



FBL Financial Group, Inc., incorporated on October 13, 1993, sells individual life insurance and annuity products principally under the consumer brand name of Farm Bureau Financial Services. The Company's segments include Annuity segment, which sells a range of annuity products; Life Insurance segment, which sells a range of life insurance products, and Corporate and Other segment, which provides various support operations, corporate capital and other product lines. In addition, it offers life and annuity products through its subsidiary, Greenfields Life Insurance Company (Greenfields Life). It sells its products in the Midwestern and Western sections of the United States. Its other subsidiaries support various functional areas and affiliates by providing investment advisory, and marketing and distribution services. In addition, the Company managed all aspects of two Farm Bureau affiliated property-casualty insurance companies, which operated in eight states in the Midwest and West, as of December 31, 2016.The Company's life insurance and investment products are available for sale to both members and non-members. Property-casualty products sold by the property-casualty insurance companies affiliated with Farm Bureau are available for sale to Farm Bureau members. Annual Farm Bureau memberships in its marketing territory are available to individuals, families, partnerships or corporations. The Company has service agreements with all of its property-casualty company partners in its marketing area, pursuant to which the property-casualty companies provide certain services, which include recruiting and training the shared agency force that sells both property-casualty products for that company and life products for the Company. The Company's agents are independent contractors and exclusive agents.Annuity SegmentThe Annuity segment primarily consists of fixed-rate and indexed annuities, and supplementary contracts (some of which involve life contingencies). Traditional annuities provide for tax-deferred savings and supplementary contracts provide for the systematic repayment of funds that accumulate interest. The Company offers annuities that are marketed to individuals in anticipation of retirement. It offers traditional annuities in the form of flexible premium deferred annuities (FPDA) that allow policyholders to make contributions over a number of periods. For traditional annuity products, policyholder account balances are credited interest at rates that the Company determines. In addition to FPDAs, the Company markets single premium deferred annuities (SPDA) and single premium immediate annuity (SPIA) products, which feature a single premium paid when the contract is issued.Life Insurance SegmentThe Life Insurance segment consists of whole life, term life and universal life policies. These policies provide benefits upon the death of the insured and may also allow the customer to build cash value on a tax-deferred basis. The Company offers traditional participating whole life insurance products. It also markets non-participating term insurance policies that provide life insurance protection for a specified period. The Company also offers a return of premium term product, which returns a percentage of premiums after a set number of years. The Company's universal life policies provide permanent life insurance protection with a flexible or fixed premium structure, which allows the customer to prefund future insurance costs and accumulate savings on a tax-deferred basis. It offers indexed universal life policy, which provides life insurance protection with flexible premium payments and provides a death benefit with cash accumulation.Corporate and Other SegmentThe Corporate and Other segment includes advisory services for the management of investments and other companies, and marketing and distribution services for the sale of mutual funds and insurance products not issued by the Company. It also includes leasing services with affiliates; closed blocks of variable annuity, variable life, and accident and health products; interest expense, and investments and related investment income not specifically allocated to its product segments.

					Full Description



FBL Financial Group, Inc., incorporated on October 13, 1993, sells individual life insurance and annuity products principally under the consumer brand name of Farm Bureau Financial Services. The Company's segments include Annuity segment, which sells a range of annuity products; Life Insurance segment, which sells a range of life insurance products, and Corporate and Other segment, which provides various support operations, corporate capital and other product lines. In addition, it offers life and annuity products through its subsidiary, Greenfields Life Insurance Company (Greenfields Life). It sells its products in the Midwestern and Western sections of the United States. Its other subsidiaries support various functional areas and affiliates by providing investment advisory, and marketing and distribution services. In addition, the Company managed all aspects of two Farm Bureau affiliated property-casualty insurance companies, which operated in eight states in the Midwest and West, as of December 31, 2016.The Company's life insurance and investment products are available for sale to both members and non-members. Property-casualty products sold by the property-casualty insurance companies affiliated with Farm Bureau are available for sale to Farm Bureau members. Annual Farm Bureau memberships in its marketing territory are available to individuals, families, partnerships or corporations. The Company has service agreements with all of its property-casualty company partners in its marketing area, pursuant to which the property-casualty companies provide certain services, which include recruiting and training the shared agency force that sells both property-casualty products for that company and life products for the Company. The Company's agents are independent contractors and exclusive agents.Annuity SegmentThe Annuity segment primarily consists of fixed-rate and indexed annuities, and supplementary contracts (some of which involve life contingencies). Traditional annuities provide for tax-deferred savings and supplementary contracts provide for the systematic repayment of funds that accumulate interest. The Company offers annuities that are marketed to individuals in anticipation of retirement. It offers traditional annuities in the form of flexible premium deferred annuities (FPDA) that allow policyholders to make contributions over a number of periods. For traditional annuity products, policyholder account balances are credited interest at rates that the Company determines. In addition to FPDAs, the Company markets single premium deferred annuities (SPDA) and single premium immediate annuity (SPIA) products, which feature a single premium paid when the contract is issued.Life Insurance SegmentThe Life Insurance segment consists of whole life, term life and universal life policies. These policies provide benefits upon the death of the insured and may also allow the customer to build cash value on a tax-deferred basis. The Company offers traditional participating whole life insurance products. It also markets non-participating term insurance policies that provide life insurance protection for a specified period. The Company also offers a return of premium term product, which returns a percentage of premiums after a set number of years. The Company's universal life policies provide permanent life insurance protection with a flexible or fixed premium structure, which allows the customer to prefund future insurance costs and accumulate savings on a tax-deferred basis. It offers indexed universal life policy, which provides life insurance protection with flexible premium payments and provides a death benefit with cash accumulation.Corporate and Other SegmentThe Corporate and Other segment includes advisory services for the management of investments and other companies, and marketing and distribution services for the sale of mutual funds and insurance products not issued by the Company. It also includes leasing services with affiliates; closed blocks of variable annuity, variable life, and accident and health products; interest expense, and investments and related investment income not specifically allocated to its product segments.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FBL Financial Group, Inc. is a financial services holding company whose purpose is to protect livelihoods and futures. Its primary operating subsidiary, Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company, underwrites and markets a broad range of life insurance and annuities to individuals and businesses. These products are distributed by multiline exclusive Farm Bureau agents, principally under the consumer brand name Farm Bureau Financial Services. In addition, FBL manages all aspects of two Farm Bureau-affiliated property-casualty insurance companies for a fee. FBL Financial Group is headquartered in West Des Moines, Iowa, and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FFG.
History[edit]
The company traces its history to the Great Depression in the 1930s, when the Iowa chapter of the Farm Bureau established Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company in 1939 to meet the insurance needs of its farmers.[1]
Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company was founded as Iowa Life Insurance Company on October 30, 1944, and opened for business in 1945.
Over the years, various state Farm Bureaus merged their insurance company operations into the company. In July 1996, FBL Financial Group was listed on the New York Stock Exchange at a split-adjusted initial public offering price of $8.75.
In 2003, one of FBL's primary operating subsidiaries, EquiTrust Life Insurance Company, began distribution of single premium deferred annuity products nationally through independent marketing organizations. In 2004, EquiTrust began marketing indexed annuity products, and became a significant presence in the independent distribution annuity marketplace. FBL sold EquiTrust Life to a controlled affiliate of Guggenheim Partners in 2011.[2]

FBL Financial Group, Inc. is a financial services holding company whose purpose is to protect livelihoods and futures. Its primary operating subsidiary, Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company, underwrites and markets a broad range of life insurance and annuities to individuals and businesses. These products are distributed by multiline exclusive Farm Bureau agents, principally under the consumer brand name Farm Bureau Financial Services. In addition, FBL manages all aspects of two Farm Bureau-affiliated property-casualty insurance companies for a fee. FBL Financial Group is headquartered in West Des Moines, Iowa, and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FFG.
History[edit]
The company traces its history to the Great Depression in the 1930s, when the Iowa chapter of the Farm Bureau established Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company in 1939 to meet the insurance needs of its farmers.[1]
Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company was founded as Iowa Life Insurance Company on October 30, 1944, and opened for business in 1945.
Over the years, various state Farm Bureaus merged their insurance company operations into the company. In July 1996, FBL Financial Group was listed on the New York Stock Exchange at a split-adjusted initial public offering price of $8.75.
In 2003, one of FBL's primary operating subsidiaries, EquiTrust Life Insurance Company, began distribution of single premium deferred annuity products nationally through independent marketing organizations. In 2004, EquiTrust began marketing indexed annuity products, and became a significant presence in the independent distribution annuity marketplace. FBL sold EquiTrust Life to a controlled affiliate of Guggenheim Partners in 2011.[2]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
