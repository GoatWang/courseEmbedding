            Bonus: Bosch Season 3 - Official Trailer
         
 

Angered by the truths behind his mother's murder, LAPD detective Harry Bosch struggles to find integrity in an imperfect justice system. The killing of a homeless veteran, the suicide of a serial killing suspect, and the high-profile murder trial of a Hollywood director pits Bosch against ruthless opponents who all threaten to destroy him. BOSCH Season 3 promises to be the most compelling yet.

And my standards have been met with Season 3.  Titus Welliver is captivating (I really tried to make this season last, but I watched all the episodes in less than 24 hours with a good night's sleep in between).  I can't look away when he is on screen.  Also giving an excellent performance this season is Jamie Hector as Bosch's partner Jerry Edgar.I hope Amazon continues with this show.  I would like to see more episodes!Read more1010 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsSeason 3 of Bosch is the best so farByLes Rayburnon April 24, 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseAmazon Studios deserves significant recognition and praise for demonstrating the creative potential of streaming. Season 3 of Bosch is the best so far. We've often told friends that "the best show on television, isn't on TV--it's on Amazon."Calling this a "cop-show" is sort of like saying that Raymond Chandler wrote detective stories. While it's certainly a police procedural, and can be enjoyed as such--but it's also an exploration of complex characters and flawed human beings. What are the impacts of our childhood on the adults we become? How can we be better parents for our own children? How do we all deal with tough choices of right and wrong--especially in a world where things are so often reduced to left or right.In short, Bosch is a television show for "grown folks" as my father would have said. In a single word, "Amazing."Watch it. Devour it. And whatever you do, appreciate it like the treasure that it is.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsAs goes the painting, so goes the plotByDavid Melloron May 10, 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseThis series is great practice for self dicipline.  Each episode ends with so many tantalizing loose ends it's a wonder the sweater hasn't returned to the sheep's back.  The temptation to watch the entire season in one go is almost too strong.  Resist if you can as there is too much to absorb in overly large draughts.The ensemble of characters mesh - and grind - with such precision and power the viewer is never expected to overlook implausability or a writer's lack of rigor. This is tight, talented, and captivating entertainment.  Thanks to the entire production company.It has been a pleasure following the multiple storylines of this series.  I have especially enjoyed watching Maddy grow up nudged by the ripples of her father's work.  There is a J.K. Rowling maturation of the installments that gives the plot a sheen of reality seldom seen in American video.Please keep this going.  There is too much left untold.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsBest TV Ever!Byxamion April 25, 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseLoved the books for years. Loved Season 1. Loved Season 2. So glad we now have Season 3. Foreknowledge is forewarned. I tried to limit myself to no more than two episodes at a time. Why? Superb writing, casting, acting, production. Three complaints - Too few episodes [only 10?]; episodes too short [that basic cable 48 minute "hour"]; and, where are the awards? As in previous seasons, I'll rewatch all 10. Then, it's back to my life until the promised Season 4 arrives. Oh, wait - there's a new Connelly book due this July? On it!Read more0Comment|

Mini Bio (1)


          They don't come any nicer than John Davidson. The dark-haired, Pittsburgh-born singer/TV personality, who was born in 1941 and the son of a Baptist minister, is highly-defined and sometimes cursed by his clean-cut, fresh-faced, apple-cheeked handsomeness. After graduating from high school in White Plains, New York, and earning a B.A. in Theater Arts from Denison University, John took his naturally-gifted baritone voice to the musical stage. The affable six-footer made his Broadway bow with Bert Lahr and Larry Blyden in the short-lived musical, "Foxy", in 1964 at the Ziegfeld Theater. TV producer Bob Banner, who discovered such other formidable talents as Carol Burnett, Dom DeLuise and Bob Newhart, caught John in one of his performances and immediately took him under his wing.Within a short time, John was moving quickly in the musical fast lane. On TV, he co-starred as "Matt" in a 1964 Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation of the classic musical, "The Fantasticks", alongside an esteemed company that included Mr. Lahr, Ricardo Montalban, Stanley Holloway and the lovely soprano, Susan Watson. He also appeared as a regular on The Entertainers (1964), and grew in stature enough to host The Kraft Summer Music Hall (1966), keeping his face and voice consistently front-and-center on the prime-time variety show circuit. Back on stage, he won a Theater World Award in 1965 for his role as "Curly" in "Oklahoma!", a part he would play many times over the years. Demonstrating leading man potential, John was handed tuneful co-star assignments in the rather antiseptic Disney movies, The Happiest Millionaire (1967) and The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968), both featuring the reigning "Cinderella" of the time, Lesley Ann Warren, but he did not move ahead in films.While an overly cute, lightweight image severely hampered his chances to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor, the bedimpled performer, nevertheless, made great strides as a full-fledged TV presence in the 1970s. He earned his own daytime talk show, The John Davidson Show (1969), and appeared in such mini-movie offerings as Coffee, Tea or Me? (1973) with Karen Valentine. He co-starred with another eternal cutie at the time, Sally Field, in The Girl with Something Extra (1973), playing newlyweds, but the sitcom was unsuccessful. Through the lean years, John maintained by singing on his own TV Christmas specials and guesting in episodes of The Love Boat (1977) and Fantasy Island (1977). Interest in John, however, slacked off.It wasn't until the next decade when his career revitalized by hosting That's Incredible! (1980). The show's format fit John's buoyant nature to a tee and lasted four years, alongside co-host Cathy Lee Crosby. His talent for self-effacing "straight man" humor showed up first as a The Hollywood Squares (1965) regular, then as takeover host of The New Hollywood Squares (1986), which lasted several years. He also took over Dick Clark's emcee post on the syndicated game show, The $10,000 Pyramid (1973), during the 1992-1993 season.Music, however, has always been John's first passion. In addition to recording 12 solo albums in both the pop and country music venues, he plays the guitar and banjo and has sung in English, French and Spanish. A perennial nightclub and concert favorite, he has starred in many national tours and stock productions including "The Music Man", "110 in the Shade", "Paint Your Wagon", "Li'l Abner", "Camelot", "Carousel", "I Do! I Do!" and "Will Rogers' Follies", among others. He's appeared in legit plays, including the off-Broadway comedy, "High Infidelity", opposite both Barbara Eden and Morgan Fairchild, and, in 1996, returned to Broadway, after 32 years, in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, "State Fair". Two years later, he was inspired to try out his one-man show, "Bully", as Theodore Roosevelt, after playing the president earlier in the musical, "Teddy and Alice". John has made sporadic appearances in films, including the disaster epic, The Concorde... Airport '79 (1979), and Edward Scissorhands (1990).Divorced in 1982 from singer Jackie Miller, who once was part of the folk duo, Jackie and Gayle, after 13 years of marriage and two children, John is currently with second wife and former backup singer, Rhonda Davidson (nee Rivera) (since 1983). Together, they have a child of their own, Ashleigh Davidson. Most recently, he appeared with one of his children, Ashleigh, in a 2005 musical production of "Shenandoah".

present) (1 child)

Trivia (16)

      Member of Delta Upsilon fraternity.


      His father was the minister who married Dick Clark and his wife, Kari Clark.


      As of 2000, John's daughter, Jennifer Davidson (age 27), is a professional ice skater. His son, John Davidson Jr. (Age 30), is an entrepreneur.


      He met his current wife, Rhonda Davidson (nee Rivera), while doing his daytime talk show, The John Davidson Show (1969). Rhonda was the lead member of his back-up singing trio of ladies, known as "Blush". Together, they have one daughter, Ashleigh Davidson.


      He was the headlining performer at the Beverly Hills Supper Club, in Southgate, Kentucky, on the night of May 28, 1977. At approximately 9 PM that night, a fire began to rage through the club, eventually resulting in the deaths of 165 people. It was the second worst club fire in American history. John, fortunately, was not harmed.


      Attended White Plains High School, graduating in 1959. Voted Best Looking in high school yearbook.


      Was model for RCA portable televisions.


      He was nominated for a 1974 Joseph Jefferson Award for Best Guest Artist for his performance in "Oklahoma!", at the Arie Crown Theatre in Chicago, Illinois.


      Generally considered to be among John Davidson's best acting performances was in an episode of The Streets of San Francisco: Mask of Death (1974), where he plays a female impersonator and entertainer. Surprisingly beautiful and convincing, Davidson performs a perfect spot-on imitation of Carol Channing. Unfortunately, his character is a schizophrenic, with dual personality disorder, who embodies both "him" and "her" simultaneously... one of them a cold-blooded murderer. One particularly chilling scene is where "she" threatens "him" during a spellbinding conversation in a mirror. The performance remains among the most unusual and remarkable of the series.


      Now living in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico with his wife, Rhonda Davidson. [December 2009]


      Lives in New Jersey and still performs across the country. [June 2000]


      Boston, MA, USA: Touring with "Wicked" in the role of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. [August 2013]


      Protege of former The Hollywood Squares (1965) predecessor - Peter Marshall.


      Frequently dines with Peter Marshall.


      Not to be confused with and is no blood relation to early 20th century Hollywood actor John Davidson ,who was born on December 25, 1886 in New York City, New York, USA. Who also passed away on January 16, 1968.


      Currently living in Atlantis, Florida [2015].


Personal Quotes (2)

      I don't know why people are so surprised by my live performances. My approach is so simple; every song I sing, every story I tell, every move I make, must move the audience to laughter, tears, or inspiration. Otherwise, why do it? It's the communication. Singing well has always been important to me, but the most important factor is the connection to the audience.


      Trust me. (Frequently spoken to contestants on "The Hollywood Squares".)

Biography


They don't come any nicer than John Davidson. The dark-haired, Pittsburgh-born singer/TV personality, who was born in 1941 and the son of a Baptist minister, is highly-defined and sometimes cursed by his clean-cut, fresh-faced, apple-cheeked handsomeness. After graduating from high school in White Plains, New York, and earning a B.A. in Theater ...

Biography


They don't come any nicer than John Davidson. The dark-haired, Pittsburgh-born singer/TV personality, who was born in 1941 and the son of a Baptist minister, is highly-defined and sometimes cursed by his clean-cut, fresh-faced, apple-cheeked handsomeness. After graduating from high school in White Plains, New York, and earning a B.A. in Theater ...

Cisco Hires Juniper's Top Technologist To Lead Service Provider Networking Group

Pages12next ›last »After seven years of driving the innovation engine at Juniper Networks, Jonathan Davidson is leaving for networking rival Cisco.
Davidson is joining Cisco's Service Provider business unit, as well as the company's senior leadership team, as the senior vice president and general manager of its Service Provider Networking organization.
 "Jonathan drove strategy, development and business growth for Juniper's entire portfolio – including networking solutions, routing, switching, data center, cloud, and security," said Yvette Kanouff, who leads Cisco's Service Provider business, in a blog post on Monday. "He brings extensive experience in strategy and network engineering leadership as well as strong customer relationships that will serve us well."
[Related: Presidio COO Talks IPO Aftermath, M&A Strategy Ahead And 'Juggernaut' Cisco]
Davidson was previously executive vice president and general manager of Juniper Development and Innovation. He held multiple top executive positions at Juniper since 2010.
Kent MacDonald, vice president of business development at Long View Systems, a Calgary, Alberta-based Cisco Gold Partner, said onboarding Davidson validates the networking giant's technology roadmap and hopes the hire will help boost service provider sales.
"It's a great validation of Cisco's vision and technology roadmap that they were able to recruit Jonathan," said Kent McDonald. "He has a proven track record. It's great to see this addition to the Cisco leadership team."
Before Juniper, Davidson spent nearly 15 years at Cisco, including the role of director of Product Management for three years, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Davidson could not immediately be reached by CRN.
Davidson helped develop Cisco's service provider solutions during his tenure while leading the enterprise routing product management and service provider team, according to Kanouff.
"We couldn't be more excited that Jonathan joins our journey as we usher in the next generation of networking and network automation innovation," said Kanouff.

Branding Lessons from Harley-Davidson’s Turnaround
Clyde Fessler Shares Tips for Rebuilding a Brand

Harley-Davidson stores used to look like warehouse spaces with motorcycles, but have since become showcases of unique individuality, like this one.




	Mention Wal-Mart, Amazon, or Target and watch as emotions flash across a listener’s face. Whether drawn from experience, knowledge, or the news, brands often leave impressions that are difficult to overcome. Some are positive, others negative, but either way there is something there with the ability to evoke a customer response.

	That response is what many businesses are trying to protect. HVAC distributors are no exception. Each day, distribution businesses endeavor to create positive experiences for their customers all while differentiating themselves from the distributor down the street. Often there is overlap in products and services as the competition drags on and distributors can be left to wonder, “How do I keep my customers coming back?”

Rags to Riches Branding

	Meet Clyde Fessler, retired vice president of business development for the Harley-Davidson Motor Co. turned motivational speaker. Fessler was a key player in the turnaround Harley-Davidson experienced after the company’s competitors began taking market share; some were imitating the product as well. That coupled with a Hell’s Angel biker-bar image made it difficult for Harley-Davidson to survive earlier on in its history.

	Fessler explained the ups and downs of these tough times at Harley-Davidson to the distributors that attended one of the keynote luncheons during Heating, Air-conditioning and Refrigeration Distributors International’s (HARDI’s) 2013 Annual Conference. He encouraged attendees that even though a product can be imitated, a brand cannot. Fessler then unfolded a story of Harley-Davidson’s comeback and the key takeaways he had learned about branding that change businesses.

Three Questions in Brand Building

	When it comes to building a brand, Fessler explained there were three key elements distributors should consider. All three come in the form of questions that require honest answers. The first question Fessler asked is, “Who are you?” It can be answered by looking at key services and functions of a business and focusing in on what the business is meant to be. Businesses with an identity crisis can struggle to answer this question as they endeavor to be all things to all customers.

	The second question is, “Who are your customers?” Who the distributor is selling to could change the business game as well as the marketing and branding messages being considered.

	The third question to ask is, “What do your customers expect?” If customers expect hands-on training with lunch and the distributor provides an instructional video without refreshments, the training service might not be viewed as productive because it wasn’t what the customer expected.

	Jonathan Byrnes, senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), expressed the importance of meeting customer expectations in his book, “Islands of Profit in a Sea of Red Ink.”

	“Managers at different levels of your customer companies will have fundamentally different definitions of effective customer service,” he said. “Even if you make your customers’ front-line managers happy, you may still lose the executive suite.”

	He goes on to explain that, “Customer service is the starting point and ending point for any effective account relationship. It is
	a critical profit lever that is very often misunderstood.”

Tips to Improve Brand, Business








A Harley-Davidson business tip — Promote your brand, not your product.




	Many companies already have a brand image and customer service plan in place. Here are some tips that Fessler provided to help improve brand and business performance during his presentation.

	“Make your staff and customers the ambassadors of your brand,” he said. For Harley-Davidson, this meant making their dealers unique sellers who had completely bought in to the company culture.

	When competition got in the way of Harley-Davidson, the company often went a different way to bypass them.

	“Your business needs to be the alternative to your competitors,” explained Fessler. “Drive a wedge between you and your competition. Turn left when they go right.”

	He went on to express the importance of turning negatives into positives and both for the customer as well as for the distribution business. Fessler also showed how examining why a business is not getting the sale as opposed to why it is getting sales can be eye opening into the brand and the sales process.

Challenging Management Constructs

	Most businesses experience complacency in its sales and processes at one time or another. Even some of the most successful companies, like Harley-Davidson, have hit lows that seemed insurmountable. To help address this, Fessler noted how important it is to establish metrics on everything done in the business.

	“If you want to change something,” he said, “measure it.”

	Byrnes took a look at the challenge of change as well and he explained that, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” is one of the worst management approaches that can be taken in business.

	“Leading companies are great because no matter how good they are, they are desperate to get better. Lagging companies are most often complacent and self-satisfied, that’s why they stay behind,” said Byrnes. “Every company has enormous potential waiting to be unleashed; a potential for enhanced profitability, for accelerated growth, and for renewing change. The key to achieving this potential is precise thinking and business discipline on the part of every manager, particularly those at the top.”

If Looks Could Kill

	One of the fundamental changes Harley-Davidson made during its turnaround was to its stores and branches. What used to look like warehouse spaces with motorcycles lining the aisles, became showcases of unique individuality for each store.

	“If your location looks like a warehouse, then customers will expect warehouse pricing,” noted Fessler. “Harley-Davidson had to enter the modern world of merchandising.”

	These changes and hard work from the management and its employees helped turn around Harley-Davidson to become one of the most famous American motorcycle companies. The final ingredient to this success was the people, according to Fessler.

	“People bring the passion to the business.”

SIDEBAR: Harley-Davidson Business Tips

	1. Make your staff and customers ambassadors for your brand.

	2. Be the alternative.

	3. Drive a wedge between you and your competition.

	4. Turn left when your competition turns right.

	5. Establish metrics on everything you do.

	6. Turn negatives into positives.

	7. Explore why you are not getting the sale.

	8. Enter the modern age of merchandising.

	9. Promote your brand, not your product.

	10. Take care of people; they are what bring the passion to your business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

They don't come any nicer than John Davidson. The dark-haired, Pittsburgh-born singer/TV personality, who was born in 1941 and the son of a Baptist minister, is highly-defined and sometimes cursed by his clean-cut, fresh-faced, apple-cheeked handsomeness. After graduating from high school in White Plains, New York, and earning a B.A. in Theater ...

Did You Know?

Personal Quote:
I don't know why people are so surprised by my live performances. My approach is so simple; every song I sing, every story I tell, every move I make, must move the audience to laughter, tears, or inspiration. Otherwise, why do it? It's the communication. Singing well has always been important to me, but the most important factor is the connection to the audience.

Did You Know?

Personal Quote:
I don't know why people are so surprised by my live performances. My approach is so simple; every song I sing, every story I tell, every move I make, must move the audience to laughter, tears, or inspiration. Otherwise, why do it? It's the communication. Singing well has always been important to me, but the most important factor is the connection to the audience.
