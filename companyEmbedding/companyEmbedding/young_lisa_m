Publisher's Description▼▲
The predominant message in our culture is that it's okay to have sex whenever, wherever, and however we want. Sex has become just sex. But while society has taken sex too far, the church hasn't taken it far enough.God wants couples to make love in marriage-with passion, with purpose, and with pleasure. Marriages aren't experiencing all the benefits that come from a healthy sex life. Couples are facing a barrage of influences that keep them from connecting with each other regularly-the kids, the career, the house, the errands, etc.SEXPERIMENT shows people that sex in marriage is more than just sex, and it's more than a chore. The Youngs believe it's time to get back to understanding the context of sex in marriage and that it's time for couples to break the barriers keeping them from a healthy sexual relationship. Couples ought to experience the benefits of having sex regularly, intentionally, and creatively. SEXPERIMENT will allow couples to discover that the intersection of God and sex can lead to a life punctuated by exclamation marks!


Author Bio▼▲
Ed Young is a pastor, author, and conference speaker noted for his creative communication style. He has a passion for making the complex simple as he speaks truth to people in ways they can understand and apply to their everyday lives. Through his leadership as founding and Senior Pastor of Fellowship Church, the church has become one of the most attended churches in America.Lisa Young, the wife of pastor Ed Young, hosts Flavour, a ministry designed specifically for women at Fellowship Church. She has also co-authored The Marriage Mirror and The Creative Marriage and has contributed to Ed's books, Beauty Full and Kid CEO. In addition, she has written a cookbook, Body for God, and her most recent book, Flavour Your Day, combines inspirational thoughts from Lisa with beautiful illustrations from nationally recognized artist, Olivia Bennett.


Editorial Reviews▼▲
"Ed Young will teach you the difference between temporary moments of happiness and true inner joy for a lifetime."Joyce Meyer
"Young writes like he's sitting across the table, talking directly to you."The Washington Post
"Young not only brings energy to his topic, but also meaningful, biblically based content."Christian Retailing Magazine
"Ed and Lisa Young have modeled a Christ-centered marriage for over 25 years. Their straightforward, encouraging and practical teaching in SEXPERIMENT will take your marriage to a greater depth of intimacy than you've ever known before."Craig Groeschel, Senior Pastor of LifeChurch.TV Author of WEIRD, Because Normal Isn't Working
"Honestly, most of the preaching and teaching about sex, love, and marriage is not getting the job done. The marriages and sex lives represented in the church look no better than the world's. And the reason is because our approach to the subject is based on restraint rather than vision. In SEXPERIMENT, Ed Young, a man with a marriage and family worth aspiring to, changes that. If you want to experience all of the pleasure and happiness God intended for your marriage, this book is a must-read."Steven & Holly Furtick, Lead Pastor at Elevation Church; Author, Sun Stand Still
"Marriage without good sex is like a house without heat in the winter. You might be able to survive in it but it's not nearly as enjoyable. Ed and Lisa are among the best when it comes to encouraging us to keep the ""heat on"" in the house. Their practical, honest, and open style of communication on this topic is both real and refreshing. I want to encourage you to take this challenge as an opportunity to stir the fire in your marriage."Pastors Kevin & Sheila Gerald of Champions Centre
"Ed and Lisa are simply fun to be around and their joy as a family speaks even louder than their world renowned church does. My wife and I look at their marriage, the way they still laugh with each other and live life so passionately, and are instantly inspired. Additionally, all their children actually want to hang out with them! Higher praise for parents, you will not find. Obviously, their marriage is impacting, if it works in their own house first. This book should be a pre-marriage pre-requisite and an annual 'wanna stay happily married' re-read! Thank God for a couple that continues to help others build strong marriages."Carl & Laura Lentz, Lead Pastor at Hillsong in New York City
"Our culture worships sex but is often confused about marriage. I've always believed that the church should be at the forefront in portraying the delight of sex in the context of marriage. Ed Young's book does just that with humor, wisdom, and candor."Judah & Chelsea Smith Senior Pastors at The City Church
"It's not a lack of love that makes a marriage monotonous; it's a lack of passion. Sexperiment will help you put the passion back where it belongs...and take your marriage where it needs to be!"Rev. Run

                This review was written for Sexperiment: 7 Days to Lasting Intimacy with Your Spouse.
            
 
            Drawing upon lessons gleaned from their own marriage and from years of counselling couples through their ministry at Fellowship Church, pastoral couple Ed and Lisa Young offer up a book about marriage and the truth about God's design for sex within marriage. The premise of the book starts with the "Sexperiment' challenge, a challenge their church was given for married couples to make love every day for one week with a purpose of "greater intimacy with each other and, ultimately, greater intimacy with God". The positive results from people in their congregation led to the creation of the book. Sexperiment tackles such issues as couples moving from being kid-centered to marriage centered, the role of prayer in marriage and sex, communication struggles, the impact and danger of pornography, and putting your spouse first.


The Youngs have written a book that is approachable in it's style, easy to read and non-judgmental, one that is sure to benefit your marriage. Although you might scoff at the promise that one week of sex every day will truly make a difference, the authors are clear about this being a starting point, a foundation from which to tackle other issues going on in your marriage, and one that will have clear benefits. In addition to the main material in the book, I appreciated the sections at the back of each chapter, such as the one for couples about to get married entitled "before you do", and the highly useful section "Action Steps" which puts their teaching into practice, for example a recommendation to schedule two date nights that week, or to create a list of seven ways to honor your spouse through affirmation. These sections ensure that you won't just pick up this book, read it, and then walk away unchanged, but that you will take steps to actually impact your marriage! Personal anecdotes and stories, along with guidance from the Bible, enliven and enrich the book and will keep you reading.


I strongly recommend this book and give it 4.5 out of 5 stars.
