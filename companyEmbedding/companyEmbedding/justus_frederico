Regional Vice President - Middle East and North Africa | Weatherford International
Regional Vice President - Middle East and North Africa






					Frederico Justus

					Regional Vice President, Middle East & North Africa





					What attracted you to work in the O&G business?

					When I graduated in 1998 in Brazil, O&G was a promising business environment as Petrobras was growing fast. Also, O&G seemed more adventurous—going offshore rigs and traveling to different places—than a conventional engineering job.

					What do you enjoy most about your job?

					It’s a win-win situation when I help to develop our people and promote prosperity in the various countries where I’ve worked, all while creating value for the shareholders and for the clients. It’s an unbelievable feeling of accomplishment.





					What attracted you to Weatherford, and what has caused you to stay?

					Weatherford has a very entrepreneurial spirit like that of our main leader. Our business focus makes working here less bureaucratic than our peers in the industry. This means that you can make a difference and add more value at Weatherford according to your talents and knowledge. The career possibilities, top management’s views, and the leadership styles are all key to me staying at Weatherford.

					What opportunities has Weatherford provided you, both professionally and personally, that you may not have experienced working elsewhere?

					The exposure to different environments and the ability to start and finish a cycle in a certain management job has been great. I was in Continental Europe when we deployed a high-level strategy that doubled our business between 2010 and 2014. It has been successful because when I left that job in 2013, my very talented successor kept following the strategy and growing the business. Then I became Vice President Sub-Saharan Africa and went to a completely different environment that required a different strategy and approach. Now I am leading the Middle East and North Africa Region.

					How has working with different cultures/in different countries influenced you both professionally and personally?

					My path in the oilfield began in 1998. I’ve lived in 9 countries so far and visited more than 60 countries. I have had great experiences in every single one of them, and the exposure to diverse cultures helped me to mature and to understand and respect different mindsets.

					What has your career progression with Weatherford been like?

					It’s been great so far. I’ve worked in Germany, Central Europe, Continental Europe (including Italy), all of the Northern Mediterranean area, Eastern Europe, then Caspian, UK and Norway. Recently I managed a very promising area with the highest growth rate by far in the world--Sub-Saharan Africa—helping to develop Weatherford in huge markets like Nigeria and Angola. My latest assignment has been in the Middle East & North Africa region where I am now based in Dubai.

					What has been the most challenging or interesting project in your career, and what did you learn from it?

					The most challenging project is always the current one because every single business environment has a unique, optimal recipe for success. My challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa were far greater than the previous ones in Europe because we had to overcome lots of infrastructural problems to be successful. We have a great team with a good mix of experience, knowledge, and willingness to succeed. One of the main principals I have learned is to surround myself with good and competent people. We have high expectations for the Middle East & North Africa region, and I am excited for the challenges and opportunities ahead.

					What has been the highlight of your career with Weatherford so far?

					It’s unfair to rate one project over another, but the main highlights have been the people and team development that achieve results. I’ve been very fortunate to work with great teams since I’ve joined Weatherford, and I remember several success stories. During the Endesa project in Spain, Weatherford successfully integrated 17 product lines in a single project, which provided more value to our customer. Once complex projects like this are completed, the capabilities of the team can be deployed to other environments. Also, Weatherford’s complete turnaround in Romania and Eastern Europe was a fantastic achievement. Recently, in the first half of 2014, Sub-Sahara managed to be the number one region in the World in profitability—up from number six only a year ago.

					What advice would you give to a recent graduate about opportunities working in the O&G industry?

					Join us, but not just for the initial compensation. Join us to know the world, to appreciate diversity, to grow as a person and as a professional, and the compensation will follow.

					Do you have any hobbies or participate in any interesting activities?

					I was a basketball player until I became an adult….then after a long gap….I’ve started to do triathlons. It’s very challenging to prepare for triathlons under an intense work scheme, but I am doing my best.

Bausch named Weatherford EVP, CFO























Justus promoted to Weatherford president, regional operations








HOUSTON, Dec. 16


12/16/2016



By
OGJ editors








































Frederico Justus has been selected as president, regional operations for Weatherford International PLC effective Dec. 13. He succeeds Antony J. Branch, who’s leaving the company.
Justus joined Weatherford in 2010 and, beginning in May 2015, was vice-president of the Middle East and Africa region. He has more than 19 years of oil field experience across the entire services industry, which includes managing multiple environments and product lines spanning several countries
Branch was president, regional operations beginning in February after serving as president, global product lines starting in January 2015. He joined Weatherford UK Ltd. in 2005 after the acquisition of Precision Drilling Corp. by Weatherford.
Bausch will report directly to the chief executive officer. Krishna Shivram was appointed to that role last month on an interim basis following the departure of Bernard J. Duroc-Danner (OGJ Online, Nov. 10, 2016).
Christoph Bausch also has been appointed executive vice-president and chief financial officer effective Dec. 13 (OGJ Online, Dec. 16, 2016).

We will look at areas including planning factors, the impact this equipment will have on a plant, the plant’s power grid, and the potential impact to the motor. We will also look at overall system costs when installing either low- or medium-voltage equipment.

Weatherford International plc announces the appointment of Mr. Christoph Bausch as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective December 13, 2016.  Bringing many years of financial and operational management experience, Mr. Bausch joined the Company in May of 2016 as Vice President and Controller Product Lines.  Previous to his tenure at Weatherford, and since May of 2011, he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial officer of Archer Limited, an oilfield services company publicly traded in Norway on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Before his role at Archer Limited, Mr. Bausch served as a Global Finance Director of Transocean, after having a 20-year international career with Schlumberger, where he held senior financial positions in global and regional capacities in the U.S., the U.A.E., France, Mexico, Venezuela and Germany across a number of business segments covering operations, engineering, manufacturing and supply chain. Mr. Bausch holds an M.B.A.  degree (“Diplom Kaufmann”) from the University of Mannheim, Germany.
Also effective December 13, 2016, Mr. Frederico Justus has been promoted to the position of President – Regional Operations.  Mr. Justus joined Weatherford in 2010 and, since May 2015, was Vice President of the Middle East and Africa region.  He has over 19 years of oilfield experience across the entire services industry, which includes managing multiple environments and product lines spanning several countries.  Mr. Justus is a mechanical and industrial engineer with a degree from the Federal Technical University of Parana, Brazil.  His appointment comes as Weatherford’s current President – Regional Operations, Mr. Antony J. Branch, leaves the Company. Weatherford is grateful for Mr. Branch’s leadership and contributions over the years.
Both Mr. Bausch and Mr. Justus will report directly to the Chief Executive Officer.
Commenting on the management appointments, Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Krishna Shivram stated “Christoph’s previous experience as a public company CFO, his financial expertise, depth of knowledge in the oil and gas industry as well as leadership capabilities will further help strengthen our focus on financial discipline, cash flow generation and improved cost efficiencies.  In addition, we are confident that Frederico, in his new role of President – Regional Operations, with his successful track record and many years of direct hands-on experience will have a positive impact and help us reach our objectives and build a stronger Company.  The future is full of opportunity for Weatherford, and I very much look forward to working with both Christoph and Frederico to take our company to the next level.”
