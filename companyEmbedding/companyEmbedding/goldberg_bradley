Career[edit]
Goldberg started his career in the youth system at Bromley, where he played from every level from under-9 to under-16.[3] In April 2010, he was offered a two-year scholarship at Charlton Athletic.[4] In November 2011, he signed for Conference South side Bromley on work experience terms, making his senior debut in a 2–1 defeat to Boreham Wood.[5] He spent two months with the club, making eight appearances in all competitions.[6] After returning from Bromley, he was sent out on work experience again in February 2012, signing for Isthmian League Premier Division side Hastings United.[3] He went on to make fourteen appearances for the club scoring four times.[7] In the summer of 2012, he failed to earn a professional contract at Charlton after his scholarship had expired and was released by the club.[3]
In June 2012, Goldberg returned to Hastings United permanently before signing dual-registration terms with Bromley in August 2012.[3][8] During his time with Hastings he was part of the side that reached the third round of the FA Cup, eventually losing 4–1 away to Middlesbrough, where he scored a long-distance goal.[9] He finished the season as top goalscorer with seventeen goals, however, he could not save the club from relegation from the Isthmian League Premier Division.[10]
In August 2013, Goldberg signed for Football League Two side Dagenham & Redbridge on a one-year contract having impressed on trial during pre-season, scoring in wins against Whitstable Town and Dover Athletic.[11] He was immediately loaned out to Conference South side Bromley on a season-long loan, re-uniting with his father.[10] After an impressive start to the season he attracted interest from Football League clubs, having scored 14 goals by January.[12] Having battled for the title throughout the season, Bromley eventually missed out on promotion in the play-offs to Ebbsfleet United. He finished the campaign with the Conference South golden boot award having scored 23 goals in 42 league appearances, and was also named the Conference South Player of the Year. The best of his goals was when he netted a screamer and then scoring a hat trick vs Chelmsford.[13]
In May 2014 upon his return to Dagenham, Goldberg signed a new one-year contract with the club having fended off interest from other clubs.[14] In August 2014, he made his professional and Daggers debut in a 3–0 home defeat to Morecambe, replacing Ashley Hemmings as a second-half substitute.[15] However, he struggled to establish himself in the first team and in November 2014 he joined Conference Premier side Bristol Rovers on a one-month loan deal.[16] He made his debut in the 2–2 draw with Chester, replacing Nathan Blissett as a late substitute.[17] In December 2014, his loan was extended for a further month, having made four appearances.[18] He returned to Dagenham in January 2015 having made seven appearances for the club.[19] He immediately re-joined Conference South side Bromley on loan until the end of season.[19] In May 2015, Goldberg was released by Dagenham after two seasons due to the expiry of his contract, he made a total of seven appearances for the club.[20] In June 2015, he signed for newly promoted National League side Bromley on a free transfer.[21]
At the end of the 2016-17 season, Goldberg left Bromley.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Goldberg is the son of former Crystal Palace chairman and former Bromley manager Mark Goldberg.[3]

Career[edit]
Goldberg started his career in the youth system at Bromley, where he played from every level from under-9 to under-16.[3] In April 2010, he was offered a two-year scholarship at Charlton Athletic.[4] In November 2011, he signed for Conference South side Bromley on work experience terms, making his senior debut in a 2–1 defeat to Boreham Wood.[5] He spent two months with the club, making eight appearances in all competitions.[6] After returning from Bromley, he was sent out on work experience again in February 2012, signing for Isthmian League Premier Division side Hastings United.[3] He went on to make fourteen appearances for the club scoring four times.[7] In the summer of 2012, he failed to earn a professional contract at Charlton after his scholarship had expired and was released by the club.[3]
In June 2012, Goldberg returned to Hastings United permanently before signing dual-registration terms with Bromley in August 2012.[3][8] During his time with Hastings he was part of the side that reached the third round of the FA Cup, eventually losing 4–1 away to Middlesbrough, where he scored a long-distance goal.[9] He finished the season as top goalscorer with seventeen goals, however, he could not save the club from relegation from the Isthmian League Premier Division.[10]
In August 2013, Goldberg signed for Football League Two side Dagenham & Redbridge on a one-year contract having impressed on trial during pre-season, scoring in wins against Whitstable Town and Dover Athletic.[11] He was immediately loaned out to Conference South side Bromley on a season-long loan, re-uniting with his father.[10] After an impressive start to the season he attracted interest from Football League clubs, having scored 14 goals by January.[12] Having battled for the title throughout the season, Bromley eventually missed out on promotion in the play-offs to Ebbsfleet United. He finished the campaign with the Conference South golden boot award having scored 23 goals in 42 league appearances, and was also named the Conference South Player of the Year. The best of his goals was when he netted a screamer and then scoring a hat trick vs Chelmsford.[13]
In May 2014 upon his return to Dagenham, Goldberg signed a new one-year contract with the club having fended off interest from other clubs.[14] In August 2014, he made his professional and Daggers debut in a 3–0 home defeat to Morecambe, replacing Ashley Hemmings as a second-half substitute.[15] However, he struggled to establish himself in the first team and in November 2014 he joined Conference Premier side Bristol Rovers on a one-month loan deal.[16] He made his debut in the 2–2 draw with Chester, replacing Nathan Blissett as a late substitute.[17] In December 2014, his loan was extended for a further month, having made four appearances.[18] He returned to Dagenham in January 2015 having made seven appearances for the club.[19] He immediately re-joined Conference South side Bromley on loan until the end of season.[19] In May 2015, Goldberg was released by Dagenham after two seasons due to the expiry of his contract, he made a total of seven appearances for the club.[20] In June 2015, he signed for newly promoted National League side Bromley on a free transfer.[21]
At the end of the 2016-17 season, Goldberg left Bromley.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Goldberg is the son of former Crystal Palace chairman and former Bromley manager Mark Goldberg.[3]

Use the Proxabrush gently to avoid damaging your wires. The Proxabrush will help you to clean your braces while maintaining healthy teeth and gums.OrthodonticsDr. Goldberg joined Dr. Perelmuter in January, 2007. A native of Morehead, KY, Dr. Goldberg completed his orthodontic training at the University of Colorado after two years of private practice and a one-year post-graduate residency at the University of Kentucky. Dr. Goldberg also lectures and trains other dentists and orthodontists in areas of expertise he developed during his orthodontic training, and is a long time friend and collaborator of Dr. Perelmuter’s. His passion, besides orthodontics, is biking and the outdoors.Invisalign OrthodonticsThe scanner, which replaces the gooey teeth molds in most cases, is comprised of a computer, specialized software and a “magic wand” that, when moved around the teeth in a precise manner by our highly trained assistants, captures a 3-dimensional image of the teeth. This image is highly accurate (slightly more accurate than traditional molds) from which physical models of the teeth can be created by ortho labs and used to make orthodontic appliances. All aligners for Invisalign treatment in our practice are now made from these scans as well as most other appliances and diagnostic dental casts. Traditional molds are still required when we need a quick turnaround, such as for orthodontic retainers we make in our lab.PreventiveTeeth CleaningFluoride TreatmentProsthodonticsDenturesFor a deeper clean, you can purchase retainer or denture cleaning tablets from a store that sells toothpaste and similar supplies. Drop these tablets into a cup or bowl of water and let your retainer soak in the solution. DON’T USE HOT WATER! It can melt or deform your retainers.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

They have to stay in waiting room with you and wait for a very very verrry long time.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
