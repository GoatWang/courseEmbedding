HCi VioCare (OTCMKTS:VICA) Battles Resistance as New Product Ships

By Jermaine Farmer -  March 26, 2017 


SHARE

Facebook
Twitter






HCi VioCare (OTCMKTS:VICA) is a penny play that has grabbed hold of the attention of traders during the stock’s recent bounce. While we continue to see price action that connotes heavy-duty supply embedded in the tape, the sharp rise in average daily volume over the past few weeks is reason enough to look a bit deeper.
The company’s most recent release reports that its wholly owned subsidiary, HCi Viocare Technologies (the company behind “the revolutionary sensing technology Flexisense”), has begun to ship its fourth-generation “Athletic Smart” insoles to its potential would-be partner manufacturers in the athletic shoe sector. That release has sparked an as-yet unsuccessful attempt at a so-called “jail-break” bounce move off the lows. However, given the small float involved here, another sharp jump in volume might alter the pattern significantly.
HCi VioCare (OTCMKTS:VICA) trumpets itself as a company that has a dual, complementary business model of 1) creating the first cross-border independent chain of Prosthetics & Orthotics (P&O) and Diabetic Foot clinics in Europe and the Middle East and 2) developing a wide portfolio of proprietary hardware solutions with first in line the Flexisense sensor system, aiming to empower the user by providing on-demand information in the fields of Digital Health, Prosthetics, Orthotics, Diabetes, Assistive Devices, Sports and Wellbeing, and licensing to established industry participants.
HCi Viocare engages in the research, development, and marketing of medical technologies. The company also operates prosthetics and orthotics, and diabetic foot total rehabilitation clinics. In addition, it is involved in the research, development, and commercialization of medical devices, methods, and products in the fields of prosthetics, orthotics, rehabilitation, bioengineering, mobility, diabetes, diabetic foot, tissue mechanics, ultrasonics, medical signal processing and analysis, medical technology, orthopedics, and robotic surgery.
HCi Viocare is listed on the OTC Markets in the USA, has its executive office in Athens, Greece and R&D center in Glasgow, UK.

As noted above, the company has started to ship its new 4th Generation Smart Insole product, which is a network-enabled IoT technologically enhanced athletic shoe component. This in itself is intriguing.
According to the company’s recent release, “the 4th Generation Smart insole is the closest to commercial-ready product due to its significantly higher level of durability and resolution, as well as its improved communication and connectivity capabilities.” The new version embeds the additional feature of temperature monitoring. The key point here is this: “The Flexisense enabled insole” is really an “internet of things” product line, and apparently maintains its uniqueness of measuring direct and shear forces in use.
Dr. Christos Kapatos, HCi Viocare’s co-founder and CTO stated: “We are very happy today. I am proud for our 4th Generation Smart Insole, which is as close to a commercial-ready product as it can get from our side. In the next days, the samples will be delivered to the major sports manufacturers we are in discussions with and we are positive that they will see the insoles for what they are, the future of sports wearable performance measuring devices.” Dr. Kapatos added: “I expect this version to even attract the direct interest of major Athletic Associations.”
Traders will note 54% added to share values of the name over the past month of action, but this action is running counter to the larger bearish trend in the name. That said, as noted above, average volume has been mounting sharply, with transaction levels soaring more than 630% beyond the stock’s 6-month average.
This is particularly important given the stock’s tight float of just 33M shares. One is wise to respect the dynamic this may create — a jump in average daily transaction volume in a stock with a restricted float can unleash fireworks as supply is squeezed.
Now commanding a market cap of $41.4M, VICA has virtually no cash on the books, which is up against a small mountain of current liabilities totaling over $1.6M. VICA is pulling in trailing 12-month revenues of $658K. In addition, the company is seeing major top line growth, with y/y quarterly revenues growing at 2541.8%. This may be a very interesting story and we will look forward to updating it again soon.

It can even highlight if your shoes are no longer providing the support required or are putting you at increased risk of blisters.The Company is seeking an established company in the athletics sector for a licensing agreement. Interested parties should contact Heleen Kist on h.kist@viocare.eu , who will also be present at the Wearable Technologies show in London on 10 March, 2015.On behalf of the Board of Directors of HCi ViocareSotirios Leontaritis,Chief Executive Officer and PresidentAbout HCi ViocareHCi Viocare has a dual, complementary business model of 1) creating the first cross-border independent chain of Prosthetics & Orthotics (P&O) and Diabetic Foot clinics in Europe and the Middle East and 2) developing a portfolio of biomedical technologies to address unmet needs in the diabetic foot, P&O and other health & wellbeing areas, for licensing to established industry participants.The company is listed on the OTC Markets in the USA, has its executive office in Athens, Greece and R&D centre in Glasgow, UK.For further information about HCi Viocare please visit the Company's website at http://www.hciviocare.com.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

When Amazon's earnings missed expectations and its stock fell later that day, Bezos was dethroned by Bill Gates. As of Friday, Bezos holds the not-too-shabby title of second-wealthiest man in the world, with a net worth of $85.9 billion.BusinessCNBCTrump administration ends myRA program that helped people save for retirementThe Obama-era myRA program, which was designed for those who didn't have access to a 401(K) or other retirement plan at work, is being shut down by the Treasury Department, reports the New York Times. According to the Times, "Jovita Carranza, the United States Treasurer, said in a statement that demand for the accounts was not high enough to justify the expense. President Barack Obama first announced myRA, short for my Retirement Account, in 2014 and the plan launched nationwide in November 2015.BusinessMarketWatchAll the companies in Jeff Bezos’s empire, in one (large) chartJeff Bezos was the richest person in the world... for half a day. The Amazon founder’s net worth soared to $91 billion Thursday morning, but an afternoon pullback in Amazon stock meant he ended the day at $88.5 billion (and back below Bill Gates). Is it just a matter of time before he retakes the top spot? Judging by the size of the empire he’s amassed on his way to the top of the billionaires list, that could be a fair guess. Bezos’s empire encompasses not just e-commerce, but also news organizations, robotics companies and coupon sites. Oh, and ever heard of Google, Airbnb or Uber? Bezos is an investor in those companies, too. Here is a snapshot of his empire, as compiled by Visual Capitalist:LifestyleMarketWatch7 real ways for millennials to save money (not by brownbagging and skipping Starbucks)It seems young people get blamed for everything these days. Millennials have been accused of killing marriage, home ownership, chain restaurants, diamonds, department stores, face-to-face interaction and pretty much every long, boring sporting event imaginable. They’re also being accused of killing their own net worth. Here’s a recent survey from Bankrate.com: “In particular, younger millennials (ages 18 to 26) are falling victim to vices that may feel good in the moment, but are far from worth it in the long run: • 54% of people in our age group eat out at least three times per week. • 30% of millennials say we buy coffee at least three times a week. • 51% typically go to a bar at least onceFinanceZacksApple (AAPL) to Report Q3 Earnings: Is a Beat in Store?A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope... It's been a rough year for U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) stockholders. Heck, it's even been a rough week! So far this year, shares of America's eponymous steelmaker have lost 30% of their value. This downward trend almost seemed about to change when a relatively strong performance in Q2 resulted in U.S. Steel beating earnings on Tuesday -- sending the stock up 7% in response. But in the days since, U.S. Steel's stock rally short-circuited. As ofBusinessBGR NewsIf Comcast buys Verizon, we should all give up and go homeAn industry analyst, Jason Bazinet from Citigroup, has penned an opinion saying that Comcast should pull a blockbuster deal and buy Verizon for around $215 billion. Comcast would finally have access to a wireless network (the nation’s biggest, for that matter!), and it could fulfill the capitalist dream of tying customers into wireless, internet, and cable services.Businessbarrons.comBoeing: Capitulation Time AgainYesterday, Boeing (BA) posted its biggest gain since October 2008, pushing it to a new all-time high. Boeing's shares were upgraded by RBC, Credit Suisse, BofA Merrill Lynch, and Goldman Sachs. This was based on our analysis of Boeing historical results that showed it generates its best margins when revenue is weighted towards planes that have been in production for many years, and margins have typically come under pressure when it introduces new models, as we expected with the 737 MAX and, eventually, 777X. While nearly all of the ramp on the MAX is yet to come, Boeing’s smooth transition to the MAX so far shows that this is nothing like the prior derivative programs (737 Classic to 737NG and 747-400 to 747-8) that drove significant operating issues for Boeing in the past.BusinessFortuneApple Just Posted a Bunch of Work-From-Home Job OpportunitiesIf you’ve always wanted to work for , but have ambivalent feelings about pants, you might have just found your dream job.

Exxon's results were overshadowed by rival Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which easily exceeded Wall Street's expectations with a double-digit percentage increase in production. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), Total SA (TOTF.PA) and Statoil ASA (STL.OL) this week delivered profits that topped expectations also.BusinessCNBCA JPMorgan quant may have dropped the whole market with report comparing today's risks to 1987JPMorgan warned its clients to hedge against a market drop because extremely low volatility often precedes a sell-off.
