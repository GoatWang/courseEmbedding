What is TEDx? In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxCLE, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxCLE event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.

Mr. Shah also serves as a Director of multiple privately held biomedical-related companies in which BioMotiv, LLC has investments.
QUALIFICATIONS
The Board concluded that Mr. Shah should serve as a Director of the Company primarily due to his experience in the healthcare and biomedical industry gained through his leadership of BioMotiv and BioEnterprise. The business insight gained through his work at BioMotiv, BioEnterprise and McKinsey & Company, in particular, and his demonstrated abilities in advancing initiatives to help companies grow and expand, provides Mr. Shah with a perspective on healthcare business and growth initiatives that is invaluable to the Board.
