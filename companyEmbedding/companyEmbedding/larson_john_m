He took great pride in his work and put the company first in the execution of Cypress's mission. He is very analytical and did a great job for me in simulation of problems, recommending a solution, and implementing. 

He is very efficient and has great project management skills. Required very little oversight and rarely any follow-up was needed on his work. I have the highest regard for his attitude and John was always was a team player. He took great pride in his presentations and analyzing data. John would routinely delve into details and made sure he understood the problem and thus was very sucessfull in his solutions.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended JohnView John’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact John directlyView John’s Full ProfileNot the John you’re looking for?
