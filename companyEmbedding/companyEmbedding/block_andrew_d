Mr. Irwin is a member of both the Government Contracts and the Government Controversies and Public Policy Litigation Practices. With more than 20 years of experience, Mr. Irwin focuses his practice at the intersection of government procurement and international regulatory law, concentrating primarily on corporate investigations and compliance counseling.  His unique background includes experience on export controls, economic sanctions and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

	Mr. Irwin has a wide-ranging export control practice.  He has handled investigations and voluntary disclosures for companies in a range of industries, including aerospace and defense and high-tech.  Much of his work has involved the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), but he has also managed substantial Export Administration Regulations (EAR) enforcement matters. He also has counseled clients regarding all major economic sanctions regimes administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), conducted a number of FCPA investigations and reviews around the world, and has advised clients on Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) issues.

	Mr. Irwin has handled significant False Claims Act and ethics/compliance matters, including those with related international regulatory concerns.  While in-house early in his career, he supervised major protests and handled issues relating to work with the Department of Defense, Department of Energy and the United States Agency for International Development. 

	A prolific contributor to government contracts publications, Mr. Irwin’s writing often focuses on overlapping issues such as export controls and anti-corruption.  He is a member of the advisory board for Thomson Reuters’ Government Contractor and the conceiver and co-editor of Thomson Reuters’ ITAR Handbook. He speaks at conferences and events worldwide.  His engagements have included, among others, speaking on international compliance issues at Thomson Reuters’ “Government Contracts Year in Review,” the largest national government contracts legal conference.  He conceived and led a year-long series of webcasts hosted by Federal Publications Seminars with foreign law firms regarding contracting in their countries.

Safely graze pastures at high-risk for bloat with the help of STOCKADE® Bloat Guard® Pressed Blocks! These self-fed blocks, spoon feed the active ingredient, Bloat Guard®, throughout the day to break up the froth in the rumen. Once the gas is released from the froth, it is belched out and the cattle continue grazing in comfort. Don't worry about horses in the same pastures, because Bloat Guard® is perfectly safe for horses as well.

CAUTION: USE AS DIRECTED. Consumption of selenium should not exceed 3 mg per head daily. Access to, and intake of blocks may be limited during or directly after heavy rain or dew, and after frost or change of pasture. Variation in cattle routine may change their feeding and watering habits. Relocate blocks immediately as necessary. Special caution should be taken. Water high in salt and alkaline soils limit consumption and performance.
Feeding and Management

To be fed at the rate of 0.8 oz. of block per 100 lb. of body weight per day. Example: 8 oz. (0.5 lb.) of blockfor a 1000 lb. animal daily.
For adequate protection it is essential that each animal consume the total recommended dosage of STOCKADE® Bloat Guard® Block daily.
Omit all salt from feed. Do not feed free choice sources of salt or mineral containing salt in any form. These blocks are an adequate source of salt.
Begin feeding blocks continuously. Feed blocks and full feed dry non-legume hay at least 48 hours prior to legume (alfalfa, clover) consumption. Repeat when block consumption is interrupted to maintain control.
Provide at least 1 block for each 5 head of cattle; add 1 additional block when each block has been halfconsumed.
The location of the block is extremely important for adequate consumption. Place blocks where cattle congregate watering, grazing and loafing areas) in order to limit the distance an animal must travel to have ready access to a block.
Controlled grazing practices (Strip Grazing) are recommended in order to limit the distance an animal must travel to have ready access to a block.
