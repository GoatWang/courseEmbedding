Carla Hargrove McGill



President
“I love the process of creating an event experience and collaborating with our exceptionally creative staff. The exchange of ideas with our clients and employees is an extremely rewarding part of our work. The dedication of our employees has been the key to our success."  

Carla Hargrove McGill’s longevity with the company combined with an extensive understanding of the industry has contributed significantly to the company’s success. Carla started her career at Hargrove in her teens performing varied tasks such as answering telephones, decorating floats and working in the sign shop. 

Her interest in the industry led her to travel nationally, and it was on a project for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the 1984 World’s Fair in New Orleans where she solidified her passion for the industry. This experience led her to work tirelessly over the next two decades to further the family’s business.  

Carla succeeded Earl Hargrove, Jr. the company’s founder after Mr. Hargrove passed the reins of the company in March 2008 to Carla and her husband Tim, a long-time employee of Hargrove and the company’s CEO. As COO and president, Carla focuses on the overall strategic direction of the company and is actively involved with key account acquisition.  

Prior to 2008, Carla last held the position of vice president, special events and led the division through an incredible growth pattern averaging as much as forty percent annual increases in revenues. She developed a new business model for the special events division which included new functions such as estimating, account and production management. Her efforts ensured the company was able to manage the growth successfully. She predicted a seismic shift in the industry and guided the sales and creative focus away from themed events toward what was then referred to as corporate theater, now known as experiential events. The result was a diversification of Hargrove’s client mix which would position the company for continued expansion.

Carla is a board member of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce and The Foundation Schools and an active leadership volunteer with the Arundel Medical Center.  She is also a long-term supporter and an active committee leader of the Leukemia Ball. Carla and her husband Tim reside in Annapolis, Maryland with their daughter Kelsey.

Woman Owned 



Hargrove is a Women’s Business Enterprise as certified by the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC). WBENC is the largest third-party certifier of businesses owned and operated by women in the United States.
WBENC’s standard of certification is a meticulous process including an in-depth review of the business and site inspection. The certification process is designed to confirm the business is at least 51% owned, operated and controlled by a woman or women. By including women-owned businesses among their vendors, corporations and government agencies demonstrate their commitment to fostering diversity and the continued development of their supplier/vendor diversity programs.
Carla Hargrove McGill, president and chief operating officer (COO) leads the company based outside of Washington, DC with her husband Tim McGill (CEO). Carla is a veteran of the industry having overseen Hargrove’s renowned events division to produce numerous presidential inaugurals as well as the company’s work for social, corporate, global, sporting and outdoor events. The company has experienced impressive growth across its three product lines—tradeshows, events and exhibits—since the role of president and COO was passed on to Carla from her father Earl C. Hargrove, Jr. who started the business in 1946.
