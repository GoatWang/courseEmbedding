Ichor Holdings IPO Is A Buy On Valuation And Prospects - Ichor Holdings, Ltd. (NASDAQ:ICHR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Ichor Holdings IPO Is A Buy On Valuation And ProspectsDec. 6.16 | About: Ichor Holdings, (ICHR) Donovan Jones IPOs, tech, alternative investments, CEO VentureDeal.comVentureDealSummaryIchor Holdings intends to raise $75 million in an IPO.The company provides fluid delivery services and equipment to a range of semiconductor manufacturing industries.The proposed valuation appears reasonable and management is growing revenues and gross margin while generating cash flow.My opinion is to BUY the IPO in the proposed range of $12 - $14 per share.

 Quick Take Ichor Holdings (NASDAQ:ICHR) intends to sell 5.75 million shares at a midpoint of $13 per share in an IPO, for expected gross proceeds of $75 million. The company has been growing revenues and gross margin while generating cash flow. While its 'capital efficient' approach may be tested by the need to keep up with ever-shrinking semiconductor demands, I'm positive on the IPO based on its proposed valuation and prospects. Company Fremont, California-based Ichor Holdings was founded in 1999 and re-incorporated in the Cayman Islands in 2012 in connection with its acquisition by private equity firm Francisco Partners. It provides fluid delivery subsystems and turnkey process equipment for the semiconductor, LED/OLED, alternative energy, data storage and flat panel display manufacturing markets. The company is headed by Chairman and CEO Tom Rohrs, who was previously an executive at Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPE) and Silicon Graphics (NASDAQ:SGI), as well as an Executive Committee member of Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) from 1998 to 2002. Technology Ichor is focused on providing fluid delivery subsystems to OEMs producing many types of semiconductors. Fluid delivery entails gas and chemical delivery, monitoring and control of precise amounts of gasses used to etch and deposit chemicals in various semiconductor manufacturing processes.
 The company also manufactures components used for fluid delivery systems and sells those components to customers. So, Ichor has both a service business and a components replacement business, since many OEMs outsource these processes because they don't have the expertise to design and produce the kind of results required for very high precision processes. Market and Competition According to a 2016 report by Gartner, the worldwide semiconductor capital spending and equipment spending for 'wafer-level manufacturing equipment,' which is the segment that Ichor operates in, is expected to grow from $33.25 billion in 2015 to $37.7 billion in 2018, a total growth of 13.4% during the four-year period: 

 (Source: Gartner 2016) Competitors for Ichor include the following firms:  Diversified Fluid Solutions Mega Fluid Systems Talon Innovations GCE Group SilPac Ultra Clean Holdings Matheson Gas Watlow Applied Energy Systems  Ichor says it has competitive advantages because it aims to engage early with customers during the product development stage. It also has longstanding relationships with top tier reference OEMs, including Lam Research and Applied Materials, which together contributed the most to its FY 2015 sales. Financials Ichor's recent financial results can be summarized as follows:  Increasing revenue growth rates Uneven gross margin, but trending upward Uneven CFFO, but positive for the last three reporting periods  Below are the company's operational results for the past two and ¾ years (Audited GAAP for full years): 


 (Source: Ichor S-1 Filing) Revenue  To Q3 2016: $274.3 million, 21.2% increase vs. prior 2015: $290.6 million, 16.7% increase vs. prior 2014: $249 million  Gross Margin  To Q3 2016: 16% 2015: 16.7% 2014: 14.6%  Cash Flow from Operations  To Q3 2016: $4 million 2015: $26.7 million 2014: $8 million  As of September 30, 2016, the company had $51 million in cash (unaudited) and total current assets of $146.7 million. Total liabilities were $203.3 million. IPO Details Ichor intends to raise gross proceeds of $75 million (net proceeds of $67 million) by selling 5.75 million shares at a midpoint price of $13 per share. This share sale will represent 24.3% of total outstanding ordinary shares after the offering of 23.6 million shares, for a proposed company market capitalization of $307 million. The company says it will use the IPO proceeds to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes, as follows: We expect to use approximately $40.0 million of the net proceeds of this offering to repay outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facilities, of which approximately $25.0 million is expected be used to repay borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and approximately $15.0 million is expected be used to repay borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which we expect to include funding working capital, operating expenses and the selective pursuit of business development opportunities in our focus segment areas. Note, part of the debt was incurred to declare a one-time dividend of $22.1 million in August 2015 to its private-equity shareholder Francisco Partners. This type of transaction is not uncommon for private equity-owned companies. Deutsche Bank Securities is the lead left underwriter for the IPO, which includes Stifel, RBC Capital Markets, Cowen and Company and Needham & Company. The underwriters have the option to purchase up to 862,5000 additional shares from majority shareholder Francisco Partners.
 Commentary Assuming it IPOs at the midpoint of $13 per share, Ichor aims to value itself at a Price/Sales multiple of 1.2x. Considering recent valuations for semiconductor equipment firms have been up to 2.0x, Ichor's proposed price appears enticing. The company's financials are a bit uneven, but revenues and gross margins are growing or trending upward, and Ichor is cash flow positive. A concern is the concentration of capital equipment manufacturers that Ichor sells to. Only two customers, Lam Research and Applied Materials, accounted for a majority of Ichor's revenues, indicating significant concentration. In response, Ichor says it provides a range of products to its customers, a total of 14 product lines in 10 unique manufacturing steps, which serves to lessen potential exposure to major customer changes. Ichor also says it has a 'capital efficient model' that requires 'minimum capital outlay.' That's all well and good, but the company may be resting on its technology laurels. Technology moves forward, and in the highly competitive semiconductor industry, companies like Ichor cannot avoid capital expenditures to keep their systems competitive, especially as semiconductor wafers drop in size and increase in density and complexity. Interestingly, on market size, Gartner predicts a slight drop in 2016 vs. 2015, so the industry is cyclical and not immune to down cycles. With these factors in mind, I'm still bullish on Ichor's prospects. Company leadership has managed its growth well, increasing revenues and gross margins at the same time while continuing to generate cash flow from operations. My opinion is to BUY the IPO at the proposed midpoint price of $13 per share based on reasonable valuation, solid management and a medium term growing market environment.

Safe Harbor Statement


      Certain statements in this release are "forward-looking statements" made 
      pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "guidance," "expects," 
      "intends," "projects," "plans," "believes," "estimates," "targets," 
      "anticipates," and similar expressions are used to identify these 
      forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements 
      include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected sales, as 
      well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any 
      historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements are based on 
      current expectations and assumptions, which may not prove to be 
      accurate. These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, 
      uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to 
      predict. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially 
      and adversely from these forward-looking statements, including: 
      (1) dependence on expenditures by manufacturers and cyclical downturns 
      in the semiconductor capital equipment industry, (2) reliance on a very 
      small number of original equipment manufacturers for a significant 
      portion of sales, (3) negotiating leverage held by our customers, 
      (4) competitiveness and rapid evolution of the industries in which we 
      participate, (5) risks associated with weakness in the global economy 
      and geopolitical instability, (6) keeping pace with developments in the 
      industries we serve and with technological innovation generally, 
      (7) designing, developing and introducing new products that are accepted 
      by original equipment manufacturers in order to retain our existing 
      customers and obtain new customers, (8) managing our manufacturing and 
      procurement process effectively, (9) defects in our products that could 
      damage our reputation, decrease market acceptance and result in 
      potentially costly litigation, and (10) dependence on a limited number 
      of suppliers. Additional information concerning these and other factors 
      can be found in Ichor's filings with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission, including other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties 
      identified in the "Risk Factors" section of Ichor's Annual Report on 
      Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any 
      forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or 
      developments, except as required by law.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in Ichor's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in the "Risk Factors" section of Ichor's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Stock To Watch In 2017 - Ichor Holdings, Ltd. (ICHR)


June 26, 2017, 07:00:00 AM EDT
By RTT News

 (RTTNews.com) - We believe this stock is well-positioned for at least 15% upside from current $23 levels. The stock featured on our premium product Short-Term Investor on April 25 at an opening price of $19.5, and on June 9 touched an intra-day high of $29.73, returning a gain of 52.4% to investors. It is now at an attractive price point again.
Ichor Holdings, Ltd. (ICHR) supplies gas panel delivery systems and chemical delivery subsystems for the semiconductor capital equipment industry. The semiconductor supply chain depends on critical subsystems, which is Ichor's domain of expertise.
New semiconductor processes, like Multiple Patterning, FinFET, 3D NAND and Advanced packaging require more fluid delivery. Ichor says its platforms are critical to etch, Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) and deposition steps that support these technology inflections.
Last year, Ichor acquired Ajax Custom Manufacturing of Union City, a plastic component supplier to major customers in the semiconductor capital equipment market. At the time, Ichor said the addition of Ajax will give it a great foundation for continued growth in semiconductor plastics, while opening up the opportunity for pursuing additional opportunities in liquid delivery processes.
Ichor sees the opportunity for market share gain in the chemical delivery systems market with new chemical delivery capabilities. The CMP chemical delivery process is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14% from 2013 to 2018, also outpacing the growth in the WFE market.
The company's revenue growth has surpassed its customers and key competitor Ultra Clean Holdings Inc. (UCTT). From 2013 to 2016, Ichor has grown revenues at a CAGR of 23%, vs. 10% growth for customers and 8% growth for UCTT.
From $249 million in 2014, Ichor has grown revenues to $291 million in 2015 and $406 million in 2016, representing a 28% CAGR. But, during the same period adjusted Net income has grown at a whopping 64% CAGR, from $11.7 million in 2014 to $20.2 million in 2015 and $31.6 million in 2016.
Yet another definite plus is Ichor's ability to scale its business and respond efficiently to increases in demand, as customers expand with acquisitions.
The company says its low capex requirements and variable cost structure constitute a capital efficient, and leveraged earnings business model, respectively. Capex has declined from 1.4% of revenues in 2014 to 0.5% in 2015 and 1.1% in 2016, while GAAP operating expenses have declined from 13.2% of revenues in 2014 to 12.4% in 2015 and 10.2% in 2016.
For the second quarter of 2017, Ichor expects revenue $152 million to $162 million, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 to $0.63. At the time when the company released its guidance, analysts were modeling revenues of $138.8 million and EPS of $0.52. Current Street estimates have been revised up to EPS of $0.6 and revenues of $157.3 million, reflecting the company's guidance.
The stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 11.2X vs. competitor UCTT's 11.9X.
