The Company to Call When You've Got Millions of Dollars in Cash and Marijuana


Colorado's Blue Line Protection Group, which made its bones securing cash and product for legal cannabis companies, is now expanding into financial compliance services so its clients can keep their bank accounts open.

Phil Baca underwent a serious role reversal when he joined Blue Line Protection Group. After spending eight years in the Jefferson County, Colorado, sheriff's department kicking in doors and arresting people, his job now is what police in neighboring states would call a drug mule. But now that the state's recreational marijuana industry is legitimate, he's an "armed transporter" and "a third-party financial compliance officer."placeholder
Founded in 2013 by former Colorado police officers Ted Daniels and Dan Sullivan, Denver-based Blue Line has grown to 80 employees supporting the complex security and financial logistics for companies in the all-cash cannabis business. Blue Line transports millions of dollars in cash and hundreds of pounds of marijuana every week in armored trucks flanked with armed guards for clients all over Colorado. It also sets up security cameras at dispensaries and grow houses, does customer ID checks, takes cannabis samples to be tested in the lab, handles clients' payroll and accounting, and hosts wholesale cannabis sales between businesses.
If you think transporting weed and cash is a fun, relaxing gig, think again. Blue Line has an intense 40-hour training program for new recruits, conducts background checks, and maintains a strict no-tolerance drug policy, ensuring its security operators are serious, sober, and shrewd. "Our guys are 95 percent ex-military and ex-police," says CEO Sean Campbell. "They enjoy what they are doing, but for some it took effort for them to 'switch sides.'"
The enforcers
Blue Line is adding to its current list of 55 clients, which includes big dispensaries and grow houses such as Medicine Man. The company ensures that the cannabis is grown, packaged, and transported according to state regulations, that cash is tracked from customers to the business so no laundering occurs, and that bills and taxes are paid.
"What we're doing is to make each of our clients' businesses as legitimate as possible. By having professionals, former law enforcement, it adds a layer. We are enabling the industry. We are helping it progress," says Campbell, who took over as CEO last year after serving as the managing director of MKM Capital Advisors, a hedge fund that invested in Blue Line and brought it public through an over-the-counter offering. 
Blue Line's security operators are armed with 9 mm handguns, transport cash or product in armored trucks, and have all been trained in surveillance and counter surveillance. Their clients have never been robbed, unlike a significant number of other cannabusinesses. "We get the call the day after--'we just got robbed,'" says Matt Karr, Blue Line's security operations manager. "If your location is not secure, you can lose $200,000 of product in three minutes--or you can pay us."
Although medical and recreational marijuana is legal in Colorado, it is still illegal under federal law. This unique gray area makes banks apprehensive about accepting cash from the state's roughly 500 licensed dispensaries and growers. Typically, dispensary owners have to open multiple bank accounts using fake names or fake businesses and move money from one to another when the bank figures out the source.
In February 2014, however, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network released the Cole Memorandum, which outlines rules and regulations cannabis companies would have to follow in order for banks to accept them as clients. According to the memo, dispensaries need to make sure no customer is under 21 years old; the product must be tracked from the time it is first clipped from a larger plant to when it's sold to a customer; cash must be tracked from the customer to the dispensary to the tax office; and the growing operation must be in Colorado, with no product crossing state lines.
Campbell, who estimates that dispensaries lose 6 to 8 percent of their revenue by dealing in cash--due to extra costs to transport and store it, as well as theft--quickly sensed an opportunity. He decided to broker relationships with banks and expand Blue Line's service to third-party financial compliance to help companies open legitimate bank accounts. "Our guys are the ones delivering the product from the grow house to the dispensary, so we know where it came from. We're the guys picking up the cash and taking it to the tax office," he says. "We can validate that each of our clients are hitting each requirement."
Blue Line is now trying to convince banks to take its clients' business, promising an intense forensic accounting process to ensure all rules are followed. It has made an agreement with one bank in Colorado so far, which the company declined to name.
"Money to us isn't money to us unless we can track it. We dump customers if the records and history doesn't match," Campbell says. "We will only accept money we can track from the consumer to the tax office. If a company has $10 million in their back pocket, we can't take that money and the banks won't take it."
Blue Line will begin beta testing its financial compliance package with four of their larger clients at the end of March. To better track the exchange of money and product, the company has deployed kiosks to the dispensaries, which run seed-to-sale software that will verify a customer's age and identity through biometrics (facial recognition, iris scanning, or fingerprint). After their ages are verified, customers will select the type and amount of cannabis through the kiosk, pay for it with their debit card, and then go to the "budtender" and get their order in exchange for the receipt.  
"The kiosks are there to further prevent criminal enterprise from forming. The customer can only buy something that is in the system. This way, the owner knows what's in the system, the state knows what's in the system, and we know what's in the system because the software tracks everything, seed to sale," Campbell says.
Once the beta testing is over, Blue Line will onboard more of its clients in Colorado toward the end of April. Blue Line is expanding to new cannabis markets as well. In Nevada, the company has made agreements with 14 medical marijuana companies to supply security and financial compliance services. It also will serve companies in Washington State, Illinois, and Florida.  
"This is the future. The Feds like it, the banks will find it very lucrative, and the companies are dying to get their money in the bank," Campbell says. "We are in a unique position of trust with each business owner--they don't trust anyone with their cash and they certainly don't trust everyone with their product. But they trust Blue Line."

Blue Line Protection Group Responds to New Cannabis Legalization With Industry Training Standards

Source: Blue Line Protection Group, Inc. Press Release

DENVER, CO–(Marketwired – Nov 10, 2014) – Blue Line Protection Group, Inc. “Blue Line” (OTCBB: BLPG) (OTCQB: BLPG), a leader in providing regulatory compliance, security consultation and protection services to high-value asset industries, today announced its National Academy for Protection Professionals is now offering its Cannabis Industry Security and Protection Academy (CISPA) to industry professionals across the nation. Blue Line created its CISPA training program to develop and deliver consistent cannabis industry protection training to security and compliance professionals who want to enter the expanding legal cannabis industry.
“With the passage of marijuana legalization measures in Oregon, Alaska and Washington D.C., it’s imperative that we help the industry operate safely by training protection and compliance professionals across the United States,” said Sean Campbell. “We’ve already had our Illinois teams come to train with us, and we have teams placed in Alaska and Oregon, who will be coming for training. The creation of our CISPA training program will also help us accommodate the need for qualified additional professionals as new states come on board.”
Blue Line’s National Academy for Protection Professionals offers security and protections groups from around the country the opportunity to grow their businesses in the expanding legalized cannabis industry. Blue Line’s training standards were designed to help licensed security providers increase their market penetration and offer a standardized, turnkey solution to dispensaries and cultivation facilities who need a complete security and compliance solution to protect their cash and product.
“We help develop and deploy practical, profitable business plans for companies just entering the competitive cannabis security and protection industry,” said Dan Sullivan, Blue Line’s Vice President of Sales and Training. “We help those business owners deploy our proven and tested methods of compliance and protection services, which in turn helps them operate more efficiently and with fewer initial business development expenses. Our training facility provides additional revenue streams for Blue Line, from security professionals coming in from other states for the CISPA training, to individuals seeking their protection industry certification, to all of our in-house and on-site safety seminars.”
Blue Line provides on-site security, transportation and compliance verification services to marijuana businesses to ensure that they are operating according to local, state and federal regulations. Blue Line helps keep the cannabis industry operating lawfully and transparently by acting as an independent, third-party risk mitigation provider to banking institutions looking to provide their services to marijuana businesses.
“We’ve developed the winning formula for building a successful protection and compliance business,” said Grant Whitus, Blue Line’s National Training Director and 26-year law enforcement and SWAT team veteran. “We provide practical, hands-on experience in the cannabis protection industry that no other organization provides. From armored transportation and firearms training to retail security and superior customer relations, our CISPA training helps us share our experience with teams from around the nation.”
Blue Line offers the CISPA training program at its corporate offices in Denver, Colorado. Blue Line also provides on-site training across the nation for industry professionals. For more information about Blue Line Protection Group and its training opportunities, visit www.BlueLineProtectionGroup.com.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Blue Line Protection Group Worth The Risk - Blue Line Protection Group, Inc. (OTCMKTS:BLPG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Blue Line Protection Group Worth The RiskMar.20.15 | About: Blue Line (BLPG) Debra Borchardt Long only, micro-cap, nano-capMarketplaceMarijuana MoneySummaryBlue Line Protection Group is a micro-cap company specializing in cannabis security and compliance.
        Blue Line stock is down 50% for the past six months, but has recently recovered.
        The stock is cheap enough to make the near term risk worthwhile.
        I attended the International Cannabis Association East Coast Business Expo in New York last October and one company that impressed me was Blue Line Protection Group (OTCQB:BLPG). Since this is a microcap stock and I wasn't familiar with them, I decided to sit back and watch the stock and see how things progressed.
I am pretty pleased with that patience as the stock plunged 50% in the past six months. In the past year, the stock dropped 97%, so this wasn't looking too good. However, I liked the company's business plan and have kept it on my radar to see if things might be improving for this early stage company. It does seem like the stock price has bottomed out and now over the past five days has begun to recover.
Blue Line Protection Group falls into the category of ancillary cannabis businesses. These are the companies whose business feeds off their cannabis customers. They don't actually get involved in the cultivating or selling of cannabis. Blue Line provides a variety of services to their customers including security for money transfers and helping their clients stay compliant with laws. Many of the employees of Blue Line are veterans and ex-police officers. Full disclosure - I have a soft spot for companies that hire veterans
If I had piles of cash and I needed to get it to the bank safely, I would probably want these guys to do it. As a thief I would probably think twice about sticking up these special forces looking guys. Blue Line not only gets the money to the bank, they also help customers set up banking relationships. Sean Campbell CEO of Blue Line said that they currently had eight banks that they worked with across various states. Getting a bank is pretty hard for a marijuana business, especially since some of these companies have more money than the banks themselves. Blue Line focuses on state chartered banks for their clients. Blue Line even treats the cash so it isn't so stinky by spraying it to remove the smell.

Blue Line also works with the banks to help them with SARS (suspicious activity) reporting. This company appeals to the marijuana business owner who becomes overwhelmed with the daily problems associated with their line of business. Blue Line basically offers to take over all these aspects for a monthly charge.
Back in October, Blue Line said it was located in four states, had 70 employees and a market cap of $57 million. It isn't a profitable company and has lost money as it has grown. The company has also said it expects to continue losing money as it builds its business. I don't like this, but this isn't unusual for an early stage company.
Another thing I don't like about Blue Line is its tendency to borrow money and repay with the loan with stock. I see this with a lot of cannabis micro-cap companies. Patrick Deparini, CFO of Blue Line said, "BLPG did not force note holders to convert debt to stock due to a lack of cash. On the contrary, BLPG received cash proceeds of over $1,200,000 from sales of its common stock during April 2014." Blue Line as also made loans to unrelated third parties that they will not name. This is worth noting.
They also have 123 million outstanding shares, which is a little high for a company of this size. I'm always a bit uncomfortable when I see these huge amounts of outstanding shares, since they seem to be used like cash when paying bills. Again, when I see these small companies with extremely high levels of outstanding stock it sends up red flags. Hopefully, Blue Line will make efforts to rein in this number in the future as it gets more established.
I think in the near term at this price, the risk is worth taking. Longer term I'll still keep a slant eye on the company. I think the soup to nuts service will appeal to a lot of small business customers. I can imagine many businesses will happily pay a monthly fee to remove some of these daily headaches.
However, as this industry matures and the players become bigger and more corporate will they need to outsource banking and compliance? I can see them needing the security assistance, but I expect these multi-million dollar players will already have resolved their banking relationships and most will know what they need in order to be compliant with the law. Blue Line could really take a large stake in the dispensary trade and in certain states where there are more small business opportunities.

It recently inked a partnership deal with DigiPath in Colorado and seems very focused on its growth. The deal will allow the two companies to share resources and marketing initiatives. I wouldn't be surprised to see Blue Line form more partnerships. I think the near term risk is worth taking in this stock and will keep an eye on this emerging company.
