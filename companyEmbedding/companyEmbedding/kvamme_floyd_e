Partner Emeritus, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers
E. Floyd Kvamme is a Partner Emeritus at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a high-technology venture capital firm that invests in and nurtures cutting-edge startups. He has been responsible for the development of high technology companies in the areas of semiconductors, communications products and displays, magnetic storage, personal computer and large system software, and solar energy components. 
Floyd Kvamme currently serves on the boards of Harmonic, Power Integrations, Silicon Genesis and Gemfire. 
From 2001 to 2008, Mr. Kvamme served as Co-Chairman of President Bush’s President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). In this capacity, he counseled the President on technology issues ranging from homeland defense to federal research-and-development spending to energy generation. George W. Bush said of Kvamme, “He is an entrepreneur; he is a risk-taker, he understands risk and reward. He knows the players, the people that can bring good, sound advice to this administration.” 
He previously served as Chairman of Empower America, a Washington based issue advocacy organization and on the boards of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) and on the Executive Committee of The Technology Network (TechNet). In 1998, Kvamme served as Chairman of the Electronic Commerce Advisory Council for the State of California. 
Kvamme helped found National Semiconductor in 1967, serving as general manager of Semiconductor Operations and building it into a billion-dollar company. In 1982, he became executive vice president of Sales and Marketing for Apple Computer. While at Apple, his responsibilities included worldwide sales, marketing, distribution and support. His efforts were instrumental in the introduction of the Macintosh in one of the most successful technology product introductions. 
Kvamme holds two degrees in Engineering; a BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley (1959) and an MSE specializing in Semiconductor Electronics from Syracuse University (1962). He lives in California with his wife of 49 years, Jean Kvamme. The Kvammes had their first date at the 1958 Billy Graham crusade in San Francisco. 
Jean Kvamme
Jean was born in Sacramento, CA and lived in San Francisco, from the time she was eight years old. She attended public schools graduating from Mission High School in 1954. She worked the 4/4 plan at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (present location of the San Francisco Ritz Carlton Hotel) her senior year of high school to help pay for her dental bills. After graduating from high school she worked at various executive assistant positions helping to support her mother and brother. 
She and Floyd met at a San Francisco church when they were 12 years old and married in June,1959, two weeks after Floyd graduated from UC Berkeley. While Floyd was pursuing his career, Jean was a stay-at-home mom. She was very involved in their son's schools receiving many awards for her service, was a Saratoga Heritage Commissioner and was on various cultural boards. After her youngest son started UC Berkeley, Jean started a home based computer service business with 10 employees. It grew steadily the ten years she owned it from 1987-1997. 
In 1997 Jean and Floyd purchased a ranch in Felton, CA to follow her dream of riding and connecting with horses. She has 5 Peruvian Paso horses. She has hosted many clinics for riders and trainers teaching the skills of natural horsemanship that utilize trust and partnership between riders and their horses rather than fear. She will be hosting another clinic in September 2009. 
Jean's first love are her four grandchildren. She cares for them at least one day per week in their Saratoga home. She loves surprising them at her home with great activities and fun things to do. 
She is President/Director of The Jean and E. Floyd Kvamme Foundation which funds religious organizations (primarily Christian), cultural, educational and medical organizations.

Panel Discussion on Energy Markets and Politics Oct 30



The J. Dennis Hastert Center for Economics, Government and Public Policy invites the community to a Panel Discussion titled “Energy Markets and Politics: Responsible Stewardship of God’s Resources,” at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, October 30.
Panelists include J. Dennis Hastert, former Speaker of the House of Representatives; Floyd Kvamme, government advisor; and Bob Inglis, executive director of the Energy and Enterprise Initiative. The focus of the discussion will be on political, economic, and practical insights into our nation’s energy needs.
J. Dennis Hastert held the longest Republican Speakership in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives. One of his many roles included serving on the Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over energy policy.
 
 
 

Floyd Kvamme served as Co-Chairman of President Bush’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, providing counsel on technology issues including energy generation. Kvamme is also a contributor to the newly released book, The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs – available for purchase at this event.
 
Bob Inglis, former U.S. Representative for South Carolina and currently the Executive Director of the Energy and Enterprise Initiative.
This event is free and open to the public. It will be held in Coray Alumni Gym, located in the 
Todd M. Beamer Student at 421 N. Chase Street in Wheaton. A light reception will follow the presentation. For more information, contact the Hastert Center at 630.752.5975.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
