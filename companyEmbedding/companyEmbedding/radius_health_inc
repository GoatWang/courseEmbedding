Pipeline - Radius




































































 
















Pipeline








Home »   Pipeline 






Radius is a science-driven fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that is committed to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics in the areas of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases.
The Radius clinical pipeline includes an investigational abaloparatide transdermal patch for potential use in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and the investigational drug elacestrant (RAD1901) for potential use in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer and vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. Radius is also developing RAD140, a non-steroidal, selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) under investigation for potential use in hormone receptor positive breast cancer.
Our Investigational Product Candidates
The following table identifies the investigational product candidates in our current product portfolio, their proposed indication and stage of development:

Phase 2






Investigational drug product candidate abaloparatide-TD
We are developing abaloparatide-TD, based on 3M’s patented Microstructured Transdermal System technology, for potential use as a short wear-time transdermal patch for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. We commenced a human replicative clinical evaluation of the optimized abaloparatide-TD patch with the goal of achieving comparability to abaloparatide-SC. The results of this ongoing clinical evaluation will inform the design of a pivotal bioequivalence study that will be initiated following completion of activities related to manufacturing scale-up, production, and other activities required for the initiation of that study.






Learn More about Elacestrant (RAD1901)


Elacestrant (RAD1901)
Being developed for potential treatment of patients with ER+ breast cancer. Oral



Phase 1






Investigational drug product candidate elacestrant
Elacestrant is a selective estrogen receptor down-regulator/degrader, or SERD, that at high doses is being evaluated for potential use as an oral non-steroidal treatment for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. Elacestrant is currently being investigated as a single agent in postmenopausal women with advanced ER+ and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer, the most common form of the disease. Preclinical studies completed to date indicate that the compound also has the potential for use in combination with other therapies for the treatment of breast cancer. 
Clinical Trials
A Phase IB Study to Evaluate the Effect of RAD1901 on the Availability of Estrogen Receptor Binding Sites in Metastatic Breast Cancer
A Phase I, Multicenter, Open-Label, Multi-Part, Dose-escalation Study of RAD1901 in Postmenopausal Women With Advanced Estrogen Receptor Positive and HER2-Negative Breast Cancer






Learn More about Elacestrant (RAD1901)


Elacestrant (RAD1901)
Being developed for potential treatment of postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. Oral



Phase 2






Investigational drug product candidate elacestrant
Elacestrant is also being evaluated at low doses for the potential reduction of the frequency and severity of moderate to severe hot flashes in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. 
Clinical Trial
Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of RAD1901 in Postmenopausal Women With Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms






Learn More about RAD140


RAD140
Being developed for the potential treatment of patients with breast cancer. Oral



Preclinical






Investigational drug product candidate RAD140
RAD140 is a nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator, or SARM, which resulted from an internal discovery program. The androgen receptor, or AR, is highly expressed in many ER-positive, ER-negative, and triple-negative receptor breast cancers. An investigational new drug application, or IND, submitted to the FDA has been accepted. We expect to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer in 2017.

Radius Health anticipates an opinion from the CHMP regarding the MAA for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) before year-end



















July 21, 2017 16:05 ET

 | Source: Radius Health Inc.






WALTHAM, Mass., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radius Health, Inc. (Nasdaq:RDUS), a science-driven fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that is committed to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics in the areas of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases, today announced that on July 21, 2017 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and requested additional data analyses related to the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide-SC in the process of their ongoing regulatory review. Radius expects the CHMP to issue an opinion regarding the MAA for abaloparatide-SC prior to the end of 2017.  “There is a significant unmet medical need among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of a fracture,” said Jesper Høiland, President and Chief Executive Officer of Radius Health, “and we look forward to working with the CHMP to address the additional questions raised in the review.”  If approved, abaloparatide-SC will be marketed in the European Union as Eladynos and would be the first new anabolic approved in Europe in 14 years.  Abaloparatide-SC was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2017 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture and is marketed in the U.S. as TYMLOS™. About TYMLOS (abaloparatide) TYMLOS (abaloparatide) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.  In the European Union abaloparatide-SC is an investigational agent and has not been approved. Radius also is developing abaloparatide-transdermal (abaloparatide-TD) based on 3M's patented Microstructured Transdermal System technology for potential use as a treatment for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FROM THE U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION WARNING: RISK OF OSTEOSARCOMA Abaloparatide caused a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor) in male and female rats. The effect was observed at systemic exposures to abaloparatide ranging from 4 to 28 times the exposure in humans receiving the 80 mcg dose. It is unknown if TYMLOS will cause osteosarcoma in humans.The use of TYMLOS is not recommended in patients at increased risk of osteosarcoma including those with Paget's disease of bone or unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase, open epiphyses, bone metastases or skeletal malignancies, hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma, or prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton.Cumulative use of TYMLOS and parathyroid hormone analogs (e.g., teriparatide) for more than 2 years during a patient’s lifetime is not recommended. Orthostatic Hypotension: Orthostatic hypotension may occur with TYMLOS, typically within 4 hours of injection. Associated symptoms may include dizziness, palpitations, tachycardia or nausea, and may resolve by having the patient lie down. For the first several doses, TYMLOS should be administered where the patient can sit or lie down if necessary. Hypercalcemia: TYMLOS may cause hypercalcemia. TYMLOS is not recommended in patients with pre-existing hypercalcemia or in patients who have an underlying hypercalcemic disorder, such as primary hyperparathyroidism, because of the possibility of exacerbating hypercalcemia. Hypercalciuria and Urolithiasis: TYMLOS may cause hypercalciuria. It is unknown whether TYMLOS may exacerbate urolithiasis in patients with active or a history of urolithiasis. If active urolithiasis or pre-existing hypercalciuria is suspected, measurement of urinary calcium excretion should be considered. Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2%) are hypercalciuria, dizziness, nausea, headache, palpitations, fatigue, upper abdominal pain and vertigo. INDICATIONS AND USAGE TYMLOS is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, TYMLOS reduces the risk of vertebral fractures and nonvertebral fractures. Limitations of UseBecause of the unknown relevance of the rodent osteosarcoma findings to humans, cumulative use of TYMLOS and parathyroid hormone analogs (e.g., teriparatide) for more than 2 years during a patient’s lifetime is not recommended. For complete TYMLOS prescribing information, including Boxed Warning, please visit www.tymlos.com About Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a silent disease, often displaying no signs or symptoms until a fracture occurs, leaving the majority of patients undiagnosed and untreated, representing a high unmet medical need. Osteoporotic fractures create a significant healthcare burden. An estimated two million osteoporotic fractures occur annually in the United States, and this number is projected to grow to three million by 2025. The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) has estimated that eight million women already have osteoporosis, and another approximately 44 million may have low bone mass placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis. The annual incidence of osteoporotic fractures is higher than that of stroke, heart attack and breast cancer combined; osteoporotic fractures also account for more hospitalizations and associated costs than cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. About Radius Radius is a science-driven fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that is committed to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics in the areas of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases. Radius' lead product, TYMLOS (abaloparatide) injection was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture in April 2017. Radius' Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for abaloparatide-SC for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis is under regulatory review in Europe. The Radius clinical pipeline includes an investigational abaloparatide transdermal patch for potential use in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and the investigational drug elacestrant (RAD1901) for potential use in hormone-driven and/or hormone-resistant breast cancer, and vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. Radius' RAD140, a non-steroidal, selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), is under investigation for potential use in hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

Why Radius Health Inc. Dropped 45% in January
Good news from the clinical-stage osteoporosis specialist couldn't overcome January's biotech beat down.











                Brian Feroldi
            

                (TMFTypeoh)



            
            Feb 8, 2016 at 1:05PM
            
            





What: Radius Health (NASDAQ:RDUS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing products that treat osteoporosis and other endocrine-mediated diseases, had a rough January. The company's shares lost 45% of their value during the month, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.

So what: Despite the huge share price swoon, Radius actually had some good news to share with investors during the month. Two news items, in particular, are worth highlighting:

First, Radius Health presented at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference, where it gave investors an update on what they should expect from the company in 2016. Radius confirmed that it has already submitted abaloparatide SC, its compound for treating osteoporosis, for regulatory approval in Europe, and management remains committed to having the drug in the FDA's hands by the end of this quarter. The company also confirmed that it is still actively looking for a partner as it prepares for a commercial launch.
Second, Radius announced that it has entered into a worldwide clinical collaboration with pharma giant Novartis (NYSE:NVS) to evaluate its potential cancer compound RAD1901 for use alongside Novartis' investigational drug LEE011. The companies will study the two compounds' ability to treat breast cancer. The terms of the agreement: Both Radius and Novartis will contribute resources and supply compound material necessary for the studies to be conducted, and they will share third-party out-of-pocket research and development expenses.


Now what: Investors who are bullish on abaloparatide SC's market potential should do their best to ignore the stock's seemingly arbitrary huge price drop and focus on Radius Health's long-term potential. It's estimated that two million osteoporosis-related bone fractures happen each year in the U.S. alone, which is a huge market opportunity. Mixing in the news about its new collaboration deal with Novartis should only add additional upside potential to the company's future, so investors with a strong stomach for risk might want to give this name a closer look.
