CASE STUDY
2PLY CUT AND STACK LABEL
MARKET BACKGROUND
In the lubricants market, print type is having to be reduced as a result of the growing amount of regulatory and safety information required to be printed on the label.
CHALLENGE
Many client production operations are set up to run only certain types of decoration technology. In this case, the client was set up to use only Paper Cut & Stack Labels and was not able to apply Pressure Sensitive Labels without placing additional application equipment or changing the supply chain to redirect the bottles to a contract decorating site at another facility.

INNOVATIONS
Through our commitment to innovation and continuous improvement, we are constantly investing in new technologies, materials and process to ensure we remain at the forefront of our industry, pioneering new standards for premium labels. From raw materials to finished goods, our in-house Research & Development team has a focused effort on new product development and new market innovations that help build brands and drive sales.
SEE ALL MULTI-COLOR INNOVATIONS





INVISIBLE 2D BARCODES
Data matrix codes are essential for certain products due to their tracking and tracing abilities. However, they are often considered a necessary evil to Brand and Design Managers due to the disruption they cause to design aesthetics. This new innovation is printed with UV fluorescent inks that are invisible to the human eye. This solution provides a fully functional data matrix code, but without the aesthetic compromise.


EXTENDED CONTENT LABEL
York is MCC’s Extended Content Label center of excellence. Customers have the option to fit more information into less space with this solution. As regulatory requirements and product complexity evolve, the need to provide more information is critical. Utilize the added space for: additional languages, cross-selling, instructions, regulatory/legal information, safety information, social media presence, marketing copy, branding graphics, ingredients, or security features

CASE STUDY
2PLY CUT AND STACK LABEL 
MARKET BACKGROUND
In the lubricants market, print type is having to be reduced as a result of the growing amount of regulatory and safety information required to be printed on the label.   
CHALLENGE
Many client production operations are set up to run only certain types of decoration technology.  In this case, the client was set up to use only Paper Cut & Stack Labels and was not able to apply Pressure Sensitive Labels without placing additional application equipment or changing the supply chain to redirect the bottles to a contract decorating site at another facility.

CASE STUDY
MONITORING DEVICES FOR INFANTS
SITUATIONIncereb developed a neonatal EEG sensor pad which measures miniscule voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current within an infant’s brain. Incereb required a technical strategic supply partner with expertise and resources in the area of conductive inks, adhesives and foams who could manufacture such a technical device. 
CHALLENGE
Multi-Color Ireland utilized flexible print intelligence combined with carefully selected foams and adhesives to ensure the product was able to form to the infant’s head while also meeting the highest standards set by the medical industry.

CASE STUDY 
MULTI-COLOR IRELAND HELPS CLEAR CHANNEL LAUNCH NFC SMART PANELS 
SITUATIONMulti-Color Ireland and Clear Channel worked together to create an NFC (Near Field Communication) platform which will reach 175 million consumers monthly across 23 countries on 5 continents. Under the project name “Connect”, Multi-Color has facilitated Clear Channel to launch the first global, out-of-home mobile interactive advertising platform.  
CHALLENGE
Initially launched in the UK to 10,000 key sites nationwide, the platform progressively moved into Europe, and most recently, to global sites across five continents. The NFC Connect tags are permanently attached to digital or static panels on pedestrian-accessible sites with heavy footfall and long dwell-time, such as street furniture – including bus shelters and similar street-level advertising structures – shopping malls, airports and at other points-of-sale.
SOLUTION
Equipped with NFC technology, QR barcodes, weather proof and flame retardant materials and an installation-ready adhesive to rival nuts and bolts, over 110,000 fully assembled and encoded units were produced and supplied by Multi-Color to a large number of sites worldwide. This will allow Clear Channel to equip the chosen sites with pedestrian-accessible launch pads, enabling them to access interactive content from advertisers via their smart phones.

CASE STUDY 
MULTI-COLOR IRELAND WORKS WITH AMCS FOR RFID TAGS
SITUATIONAMCS was recently awarded a contract in France to bring cutting edge weighing and RFID technology to 60,000 premises in France. AMCS chose to partner with Multi-Color Ireland for its expertise and knowledge in the area of RFID and labelling solutions. The project combines advanced software and weigh technology on refuse trucks with specialized RFID labelling systems. 
SOLUTION
60,000 unique printed labels equipped with UHF (Ultra High Frequency) RFID tags are destined for the French market. Using state-of-the-art machinery, Multi-Color Ireland is able to raise the label from the liner and insert the RFID tag underneath.
RESULTS
During the collection process, the reader on the refuse truck will scan the RFID transponder chip on the refuse bin. Using weigh technology, the refuse trucks will also weigh the bin. This information is collated, and through the use of the AMCS software, is transmitted and efficiently indicates collections, weight and time. The use of RFID technology is expected to offer savings of 25% from reduced recall rates and increased efficiency.

CASE STUDY
2PLY CUT AND STACK LABEL
MARKET BACKGROUND
In the lubricants market, print type is having to be reduced as a result of the growing amount of regulatory and safety information required to be printed on the label.
CHALLENGE
Many client production operations are set up to run only certain types of decoration technology. In this case, the client was set up to use only Paper Cut & Stack Labels and was not able to apply Pressure Sensitive Labels without placing additional application equipment or changing the supply chain to redirect the bottles to a contract decorating site at another facility.

INVISIBLE 2D BARCODES
Data matrix codes are essential for certain products due to their tracking and tracing abilities. However, they are often considered a necessary evil to Brand and Design Managers due to the disruption they cause to design aesthetics. This new innovation is printed with UV fluorescent inks that are invisible to the human eye. This solution provides a fully functional data matrix code, but without the aesthetic compromise.


EXTENDED CONTENT LABEL
York is MCC’s Extended Content Label center of excellence. Customers have the option to fit more information into less space with this solution. As regulatory requirements and product complexity evolve, the need to provide more information is critical. Utilize the added space for: additional languages, cross-selling, instructions, regulatory/legal information, safety information, social media presence, marketing copy, branding graphics, ingredients, or security features

Multi-Color to acquire Constantia Labels division for about $1.3 billion
Multi-Color Corporation.  said Monday it has signed an agreement to acquire the labels division of Constantia Flexibles for about $1.3 billion in cash and stock. The division is part of Constantia Flexibles GmbH, an Austrian provider of flexible packaging and labels. The combined annual revenue of the two businesses is about $1.6 billion, the companies said in a statement. The deal "brings together Constantia Labels' high performing Food and Beverage business with Multi-Color's strong Wine and Spirit, and Home and Personal Care platforms, and emerging global position in Healthcare," said the statement. Multi-Color is expecting the deal to be "meaningfully accretive" to per-share earnings in fiscal 2019, the first full year of combined results.  It is expected to close in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Multi-Color said it still expects June quarter core EPS of about 80 cents. Multi-Color shares were halted for the news premarket, but have gained 6% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained about 10%.

Multi-Color to acquire Constantia Labels division for about $1.3 billion
Multi-Color Corporation.  said Monday it has signed an agreement to acquire the labels division of Constantia Flexibles for about $1.3 billion in cash and stock. The division is part of Constantia Flexibles GmbH, an Austrian provider of flexible packaging and labels. The combined annual revenue of the two businesses is about $1.6 billion, the companies said in a statement. The deal "brings together Constantia Labels' high performing Food and Beverage business with Multi-Color's strong Wine and Spirit, and Home and Personal Care platforms, and emerging global position in Healthcare," said the statement. Multi-Color is expecting the deal to be "meaningfully accretive" to per-share earnings in fiscal 2019, the first full year of combined results.  It is expected to close in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Multi-Color said it still expects June quarter core EPS of about 80 cents. Multi-Color shares were halted for the news premarket, but have gained 6% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained about 10%.

HR is never here and when they are they do nothing, everything is outsourced. MCC couldn't care any less about you or your personal life, your just an expendable asset to them.Advice to ManagementYou work people to the bone, your short staffed, and you treat people like corporate slaves......and yet you cant figure out why you cant retain or recruit good employees.

It is challanging and rewarding.Lead Maintenance Technician (Current Employee) –  Chesapeake, VA – September 8, 2015The most enjoyable part of my job is the challenge of new projects, with a chance to make a difference for my fellow associates and myself. The management at MCC are caring and helpful yet demanding at the same time. They are always challenging us to excel and do more. They have foster an atmosphere of inclusiveness and respect for everyone, even for those that rarely participate.  We have yearly company picnics and are rewarded for the number of "Accident Free" days each year with a special cook-out prepared and catered by management. The company has grown at a rapid pace and experiences the pains of such.  Policies that are handed down from upper management are expected to be implemented expediently but create unforeseen hardships, everyone has a full plate and change isn't easy.

Just to go in to work. People work against each other here, and if you attempt to "improve" any bad situations, you are punished severely. Yet there are a few employees who flaunt their ability to get away with tardiness, absenteeism, disregard for safety policies and corporate guidelines. Those few are the ones who ruin it for everybody else, and it's created an atmosphere of "Why try at all?" Management is a joke, and the plant manager is absent from any intervention in serious employee friction. He does not correct anyone's behavior, he does not attempt to improve personnel issues. As for the corporate office - they clearly do not care one iota about any worker here. Once Multi-Color purchased York, we lost any semblance of Human Resources helping us with anything. They didn't even send a rep to help us with the Health Benefits annual sign-up. The wages do not match the work load, and advancement is reserved for those who are the most belligerent. There is no sense of "team work" whatsoever.ProsThere is nothing positive about this employerConsNo Human Resources assistance, no management, no leadershipWas this review helpful?Yes 25No 2Report Job Work/Life BalanceCompensation/BenefitsJob Security/AdvancementManagementJob CultureReally negative, depressing work environmentRewind Operator (Former Employee) –  Weaverville, NC – May 10, 2014So much "drama queen" stuff going on, every day, in every department. Employees are harboring deep resentments which fester and just get worse all the time, because employees are simply not treated the same. Some employees are walking around on the production floor chatting on their cell phones, while other employees are disciplined (or even dismissed) for talking to their boyfriend during break or even less. The plant manager exhibits no leadership whatsoever, allowing "bully" employees to essentially run the plant. Any employee who speaks up and tries to right a wrong is run out of town on a rail. It's shameful! And there is no HR presence AT ALL from the corporate level - we are totally on our own. The whole place is dark and depressing, there are people who have been here for years and it hurts me just to look at them. The mantra for this facility is "you better keep your head down and don't rock the boat". This place is mired in a 50s mentality. Oh.. .and also, if the prime customer knew about Quality Department documents being forged, and the plant manager COVERING for the forger (girl in hot pants) the whole plant would be shut down.

Story




				Multi-Color Corporation (NASDAQ:LABL) is a premier global resource of packaging services and decorating solutions. From graphics to product placement on the shelf, Multi-Color Corporation helps consumer product companies, national retailers, and container manufacturers sell their finest packages worldwide. The $222 million (fiscal year 2007) company provides innovative decorating solutions to many of the world’s largest consumer goods companies. Its customers include the leading producers of health and beauty, food and beverage, personal care, automotive and household consumer brands.
 
Multi-Color Corporation has grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions and, consequently, faced the challenges associated with managing five different plants running on disparate and, in some cases, manual systems. In 2004, the organization implemented the PECAS Vision Solution for Packaging, developed by Radius Solutions, a Progress® Application Partner, to standardize operations across all of its plants in order to maximize efficiencies and gain visibility across the entire production process.
 
As part of the company’s continued growth strategy, Multi-Color Corporation acquired NorthStar Print Group, Inc., in 2005. According to Greg Myers, Vice President, Information Technology, for Multi-Color Corporation, for the organization to realize the full potential of its acquisition, it was imperative that they integrate the three NorthStar plants to enable transactions and visibility across all eight plants.
 
“Generally speaking, we were trying to standardize on a single ERP/MIS solution and embrace best practices across all facilities, in order to leverage the skill set and information we already had in place. This included common reporting from all plants in order to gain insight into the acquired plants’ operations and to enable us to better utilize all available capacity for optimized performance,” explains Myers.
 
“We were also driven by the need to mitigate our risk. The existing systems within the NorthStar plants were relatively old and had little support. We needed to eliminate systems where the risk of failure with a difficult recovery process was a real possibility.”
 
“Finally, compliance is very important to our organization,” continues Myers. “We are a publicly traded company and are mandated to meet Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) and other financial requirements. It is crucial that we have control over and visibility into our processes and information.”
PECAS Vision: The Logical Step
Leveraging PECAS Vision to integrate the three additional plants with the existing five was a logical step, according to Myers. Based on the Progress platform, PECAS Vision has been specifically designed to be a fully integrated, industry-leading ERP/MIS solution supporting best practices for packaging: flexibles, labels and folding cartons. Multi-Color Corporation Handling, Production Scheduling, Shop Floor Data Collection, Material Purchasing and Inventory Control, and Job Costing.
“We wanted a fully integrated solution within each plant that allowed us to standardize; gain some efficiencies within our production processes; run things all the way from estimation, through sales order, production scheduling, production, shop floor data collection and shipping; and, of course, provide visibility into the data across all of those processes.”
By leveraging one system across multiple plants the company would benefit from having visibility into capacity and materials at any given plant and gain the agility to modify processes or move materials from plant to plant in order to maximize production efficiencies. “We knew this level of integration would help us to make better use of the capacity available to us, regardless of location. We would also benefit by gaining visibility into some of the critical key performance indicators (KPI) around our production processes at a given plant. These metrics can help drive some of our lean initiatives because we can leverage that knowledge to introduce those best practices and standardize on processes across all plants.”
Smooth and Fast Implementation with a Focus on Business Process
As part of the implementation process, Myers and his team put together a cross-functional group. With a business solutions project approach, the IT group identified business process owners from the business side to take leadership for their particular areas.
“Ultimately they are the ones who make the decisions moving forward,” explains Myers. “They are the ones responsible for ensuring that they can do what they need to do to run the business, using the technology we deliver. At Multi-Color Corporation, technology always follows the business; that is how we run things. We work with the business to prioritize the portfolio of opportunities to use technology to improve operations. Even though we are IT, our first priority is not putting in technology; it is focused on improving the business, adding value, and enabling the business strategy, by delivering appropriate technology solutions.”
Dennis Linnevers, Manager of Production Applications for Multi-Color Corporation, explains that the company completed the successful multi-plant implementation process by taking a phased approach. “We did it one plant at a time, starting with the largest plant, to maximize the gains of integration and minimize the risk of the legacy systems. Overall, it was a smooth process; the third plant had the fastest implementation we have ever done.” Using Technology to Move the Business Forward
Benefits of an Industry-specific ERP Solution
According to Myers and Linnevers, PECAS Vision was able to successfully support their multi-plant rollout initiative due in large part because it was developed specifically for the printing industry. “The terminology that is used, the processes that are supported out-of-the-box, they all fit the nature of our business,” says Myers. “For example, the solution offers modules for estimating and scheduling that fit the business of printing labels. You aren’t trying to force-fit the terminology of a generic industry or another industry onto the business people here. It makes sense to the users, and that is critical for success.”
Flexibility Is a Competitive Advantage
According to Linnevers, the solution also offers the flexibility the business needs to support customer demands and business change.“PECAS Vision is flexible enough to handle several different types of printing technology that we use to produce our labels. For example, there are different ways you can apply ink to a substrate, different types of presses and finishing operations. The system is flexible enough in its design to easily support those differences in production.”
This flexibility has translated into a competitive advantage for Multi-Color Corporation. “We are one of the few companies in our industry that runs the gamut with regards to the technologies of the products we deliver,” explains Linnevers. “That is true on two fronts. One, in regards to the printing technology itself, we make sure we are using the print technology that best fits the customer’s needs, whether it be flexo, litho, rotogravure, digital, and so forth. Two, with regards to the product technology itself and the type of label  that is delivered, we are one of the few in the industry that can offer our customers a solution on in-mold labels, heat transfer labels, cut and stack labels, pressure-sensitive labels, or shrink sleeve labels. So we cover just about every technology across the board. It is imperative that our ERP solution is able to support all of our various production processes, and PECAS Vision does just that. It is a competitive advantage to be able to quickly and easily do what we need to do and provide customers with the kind of service they are looking for. That is what it is all about in the end.”
Improved Efficiencies through Streamlined Business Operations
With PECAS Vision integrated across all eight plants, Multi-Color Corporation has streamlined business operations from estimating and ordering through to delivery. For example, prior to the implementation, scheduling was done manually in the smaller plants. “With PECAS in place, we have been able to realize efficiencies from the online scheduling system. We can react much more quickly in moving jobs around and making the most effective use of our capacity”, says Myers.
Increased Visibility Across the Entire Production Process
Multi-Color Corporation has also achieved visibility across its multiple plants. “Prior to the implementation of PECAS Vision in the additional facilities, we had limited visibility into the NorthStar plants. They were independent, and we were not comparing apples to apples when we looked at some of the metrics across all plants,” says Myers.
“Today we can run standard reports, such as the waste report, for each plant; break things into standard categories; and allow an even comparison of the performance at each facility.”
Myers also notes that they have significantly reduced the use of Excel in tracking and passing data. “Prior to the implementation, there was a lot done offline in Excel that required somebody to do something manually and send it off to the next person to do something manually; you lose control that way. We lacked visibility into the information we needed to make decisions in a timely manner.”
Maintaining a Focus on What Really Matters—Delivering Value to the Customer
Multi-Color Corporation is now able to support PECAS Vision across eight facilities with a minimal number of people. “If you look at it from an IT perspective, the fact we can leverage the skill sets we have on one technology, allows us to be more cost-effective in delivering solutions that really matter to the customer,” says Myers. “This allows us to focus on that value stream rather than numerous different technologies or managing skill sets on different systems.”
Continuing to Optimize Business Operations with PECAS Vision
Multi-Color Corporation’s goal is to continue leveraging existing and new technology to improve the business. “We are about to kick off a project that we call ‘Process Optimization’” explains Myers. “IT will review all of the standard business processes we are supporting in the system today. We are going to work hand-in-hand with the business to identify opportunities to improve our efficiencies or optimize those processes. Because we are on a single, integrated platform, once we identify those areas we want to make changes to, we can immediately push those modifications out to all eight plants versus managing the rollout of those changes eight different times. All of our facilities will simultaneously realize the benefits from those changes and, as a result, they will be in a position to better serve the needs of the business.”

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.
