Implementing the NOW Management System®
For employees to be able to leverage the many NOW Moment℠s they encounter in every day work life, management must provide everything employees need to effectively and efficiently act on the opportunities. The NOW Management System® is a collection of processes and tools that management must engineer to connect every employee to their part of the company’s routine work and initiatives.
The NOW Management System® prioritizes, connects, enables, and drives the execution of all work in an organization ensuring that every resource is focused on mutual goals and that every employee at every level has the maximum authority to act. NOW is an integrated framework that removes waste from all routine work, prioritizes and manages successful completion of breakthrough initiatives, and drives a culture of action at the levels where knowledge is deep and direct.
How does it work?
Managing Business Fundamentals
The routine work of every business consumes the vast majority of resources – typically 90 to 95 percent. Waste (activities that add no customer value to the product or service) commonly abounds in these routine processes with the typical manufacturing business seeing 25 percent, service companies 40 percent and governmental agencies suffering from as much as 50 percent waste.
The way routine work is executed is the result of years of momentum–in contrast to a conscious and purposeful design. Removing the waste is problematic because no one “owns” the process, and it gets more challenging because the effectiveness, efficiency and timeliness of the process is not measured and thus is unknown.
Using a set of proprietary methods and tools, Mass Ingenuity® consultants facilitate creation of the organization’s NOW Fundamentals Map. It is the first step in the process to move the ownership of the routine work to the people who do that work. It is also the foundation for connecting every individual directly to what the business leadership wants to accomplish through a set of interconnected scorecards. This context establishes the order essential to enabling the freedom needed for true fear-free accountability. The foundation of YESability℠ is in place.
This tool and associated set of management processes quickly drive waste out of the organization with material across-the-board gains achieved over the initial 12-24 months. In fact, the ROI is proven to be very high.  This reduces the amount of resources needed to work “in” the business while achieving better results.
Building the Capability to Deliver on Breakthrough Initiatives
Once the Fundamentals are in motion, the focus shifts to identifying the Breakthrough Initiatives the organization needs to successfully achieve its goals.  For most businesses, the success rate of its annual initiatives is less than 35 percent, but in the NOW Management System® that rate improves to over 80 percent.
Through a proprietary strategic planning process and tool set, two types of breakthroughs are identified and prioritized: performance breakthroughs and capability breakthroughs. The three-year plan is laid out on a NOW Breakthrough Map, a single-page strategic plan. Breakthrough Plans are developed for each initiative and workplans flesh out the details. Through a closed-loop monitoring system plans are routinely adjusted to meet the reality of changing circumstances and implementation realities.
As objectives are delivered, an opportunities portfolio management process lines up the next initiative based on resources available. Planning then becomes increasingly responsive to emerging opportunities as the initiatives in queue can be readily re-prioritzed in real time.
Engaging Everyone in Improving the Business
The NOW Fundamentals Map and the NOW Breakthrough Map are used to connect both routine work and initiatives to every individual employee as appropriate. But the key to engaging people in addressing the challenges within the realm of their own accountability is problem solving. NOW 7-Step Problem Solving creates a common language and toolset across to the business to drive collaborative improvement.
Disciplined Business Reviews
Closing the loop on Fundamentals and Breakthroughs is key to establishing the discipline for great execution. Cascading NOW Quarterly Targets Reviews check execution at all levels from the front lines to the top of the organization. Complete transparency speeds the actions needed to fix problems, redirect initiatives and knock down the biggest obstacles to success.
Ownership. Visibility. Action.
Ultimately, the NOW system establishes clear ownership with every manager and employee being able to directly connect the work they do to the organization’s key goals.
With the direction and accountability completely clear, with tools and knowledge to act where the opportunities are, the NOW Moment℠ becomes the NOW win as every opportunity can be acted upon by every employee every time.

On March 11, the Center for […]

Home » Services » Process Improvement Process Improvement and the NOW Management System®
Micro-Level Process Improvement to Drive Out Waste
Many organizations use process improvement to save money, better leverage resources, and improve the customer experience. Process improvement is designed to drive out waste.
Waste is generated from activities that do not add value to the customer. Research shows that in most manufacturing organizations 25-30% of activities are waste, in most service organizations it is 30-40% and in government it is estimated to be at least 40-50%. Unfortunately, these numbers have not declined even in the wake of the many different management techniques that have come along in the past 30 years.
There are three primary reasons that process improvement efforts do not live up to expectations and do not achieve the intended outcomes:
1. Process improvement projects are randomly selected and are not focused on the highest-leverage processes in need of improvement (the primary reason)
2. Employees and managers lack the ability to conduct process improvement projects that permanently drive out waste
3. Employees and managers lack shared process improvement tools, methods and language
Fortunately, these issues can be mitigated by installing the NOW Management System® and then realizing the full promise of process improvement.
Macro-Level Process Improvement for Management
Ironically, few processes display more variation and waste than the “management” process. Our experience has proven that if an organization conducts macro-level process improvement for the “mother of all processes”—actually managing the enterprise—then micro-level process improvement is significantly more powerful.
The chief indicators of management variation are employee confusion and waste. We have identified the “7 Deadly Sins of Management” as the source of tremendous management variation, which prevent the “NOW” response that customers expect:
1. Lack of clear direction
2. No line of sight connection
3. Unclear expectations and accountability
4. Inconsistent language
5. Poor issue transparency
6. Insufficient resources
7. Inadequate tools/skills
Organizations that utilize traditional management methods are out of step with our modern economy, employees’ mindset, and customer expectations. Process improvement is at its strongest when driven by the NOW Management System®.

John is the author of BUSINESS AT THE SPEED OF NOW, published by Wiley in December of 2011. He’s a top-rated speaker for the Conference Board and National Attorney General Association, discussion leader on the Harvard Business Review blog, and his monthly newspaper column is syndicated to 41 Business Journals across the U.S.
For 30 years John has been building and reengineering organizations to enable them to aggressively grow the top and bottom line. As the principal architect of the NOW Management System℠, his passion focuses on leveraging best-practice management with social media INSIDE the organization to engage employees, sharpen focus and accelerate execution.
John’s deep and varied career ranges from serving as an executive team member at multi-billion dollar StanCorp Financial Group to being the founding CEO of a technology start-up, which he led through its sale. He also served in senior positions at Omark Industries, Floating Point Systems and ESI. John has led operations, manufacturing, customer service, product development, human resources, quality, information technology, strategic planning, engineering, shared services, marketing and communications.
He has consulted with senior executives at all levels in high technology, health care, insurance, banking, forest products, distribution, manufacturing, and a wide range of service companies, along with many large government agencies. John loves writing and spending time with his family; he has toddler boy/girl twins in addition to three grown and accomplished daughters.

John’s passion is for the human side of organizations, but his experience has proven employee engagement is not the result of values and beliefs. Employees engage when they work in a system of management that expects and causes them to take effective action.
“Fear is the enemy of efficiency,” says John. “Many leaders value the talents and passions of their people, but most systems of management are designed to prevent employees from taking action not to support and expect action.”

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
