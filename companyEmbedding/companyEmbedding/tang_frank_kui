I have worked on machine learning research for nearly five years. I had the privilege to work with Prof. Tony Jebara while I was an undergrad at Columbia University and then to continue my PhD program there under Prof. David Blei as well. My academic work has included approximate inference in graphical models of both directed and undirected varieties, convex optimization, probabilistic word vector embeddings, and probabilistic models for matchings, permutations, and graph structures. After receiving my M.S., I left in order to focus on real-world applications of machine learning.
Machine learning will grow increasingly fundamental to technology and society as the quantity and complexity of our data, and our ambition to make use thereof, increase without bound. The field requires algorithms that scale to big data, are practical and easy to use outside the academy, and are grounded in firm mathematical principles, so that their accuracy and speed can be depended upon for mission-critical applications.

Invited Talks

Bethe Learning of Conditional Random Fields via MAP Decoding.
(Cambridge University Engineering Department, May 2016) [slides]


Machine Learning: Lesson for Emerging Scholars Program
(Columbia University, November 2015) An introductory lesson to machine learning, covering supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as distributed computation. Interactive discussion and problem-solving prompts included. Designed for first- and second-year undergraduates with no prior background. [slides]


Adaptive Anonymity via b-Matching
(UMass Amherst Machine Learning and Friends Lunch, February 2014) [slides]


Statistical Machine Learning with Bayesian Networks
(Columbia Data Science Society, November 2013; hackNY Masters, New York University, September 2013.) I teach the fundamentals of Bayesian networks, MCMC inference, and probabilistic programming to undergraduates and masters students with little previous exposure to statistics or machine learning. [IPython notebook] [github] 


The Computational Complexity of Probabilistic Inference Using Bayesian Belief Networks
(Machine Learning Reading Group, Columbia University, June 2012.) I walk through the proof by G.F. Cooper that posterior inference in Bayesian networks is NP-hard. The proof reduces from 3SAT using an elegant gadget graph. [slides]

Code
  See also my GitHub page for projects not listed here.
  
mexcpp: Easier MATLAB and C++ Integration
This library makes it easier to write MEX extensions by providing a natural C++ syntax to read and write MATLAB structures with no runtime penalty thanks to template metaprogramming. Arays, cells, and structures are all supported. [github]

Polynomial Time Inference of Bethe Partition Function and Marginals
Code to minimize the Bethe free energy up to additive error via discrete optimization, as well as continuous methods to minimize the Bethe free energy over various polytopes (but with no guarantees). See our UAI 2014 paper. [tarball]


Adaptive Anonymity via b-Matching
Safely release a sensitive database for analysis by censoring selected entries. We compute the censored entries by b-matching, which results in more released data compared to the state of the art, while maintaining the same privacy guarantee. See our NIPS 2013 paper. [tarball] [instructions] [b-match solver documentation]


Harmony
Profile multithreaded programs: measure the number of times each line of code was run and how many threads ran it at the same time. This can be used to detect concurrency bottlenecks and analyze global program efficiency. See our ISCA and Micro papers. [homepage]

Expository
Below are notes on various mathematical topics, course projects, and unpublished manuscripts.


Review Notes
To review for finals, I like to condense the content of a course into 10-20 pages of notes. The following may be useful references:
    
Stochastic Processes, taught by Hongzhong Zhang, Columbia, Spring 2013.
Computational Learning Theory, taught by Rocco Servedio, Columbia, Fall 2012.




Quasi Monte Carlo Inference for Log Gaussian Cox Processes
(With Jessica Forde and Liam Paninski, 2013) We give a self-contained introduction to quasi Monte Carlo, a deterministic substitute to Monte Carlo, and then use it for a Bayesian inference for a computationally difficult problem, including embedding quasi Monte Carlo samples into a Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin algorithm. Encouraging convergence rate speedup results are presented. [paper] [slides]

Inferring Direct and Indirect Functional Connectivity Between Neurons From Multiple Neural Spike Train Data
(With Ben Shababo and Frank Wood, 2012) We aim to model the functional connectivity of neural microcircuits by accounting for (1) unobserved neurons and (2) long-run connections, two problems not yet adequately addressed in the literature. Encouraging simulation and lab-data results are analyzed. [paper]


Personalized Emotion Classification with Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(2012) Work on sentiment analysis of text has focused on scalar values of sentiment. We instead represent emotions multidimensionally as topic vectors and learn a personalized emotion lexicon. We take a semi-supervised approach with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and a derivative, SubjLDA, initializing our model with a psychologically validated seed corpus. We demonstrate significant improvements to the baseline. [paper]

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes.
