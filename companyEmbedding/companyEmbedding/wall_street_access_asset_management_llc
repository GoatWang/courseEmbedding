Wall Street Access and Nu Paradigm Combine to Create $250 Million Asset Management Business | Business Wire


























































Wall Street Access and Nu Paradigm Combine to Create $250 Million 
      Asset Management Business






April 20, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wall Street Access, a diversified financial services firm, and Nu 
      Paradigm Investment Partners, LLC, an investment advisory, asset 
      management and outsourced CIO firm, today announced that they have 
      formed a combined entity. Nu Paradigm—which will continue operations 
      under its current brand—becomes a division of Wall Street Access Asset 
      Management, LLC, a provider of comprehensive investment management, 
      financial planning and fund management solutions.
    


      The combination will transform Wall Street Access Asset Management into 
      a full-service investment firm managing $250 million of assets for 
      family wealth and institutional investors including pension plans, 
      public funds, trusts, estates, foundations and endowments. The members 
      of the senior team average more than 30 years of experience across 
      wealth and asset management, consulting, investment research and 
      execution services.
    

      “We are excited to begin this new partnership with Wall Street Access, 
      combine our strengths and deliver new value to our clients,” said Chris 
      DeMeo Co-Founder of Nu Paradigm. “Wall Street Access has a 35-year 
      pedigree on Wall Street, a robust investment platform, and a strong 
      reputation for world-class investment research and market analysis we 
      will leverage on behalf of Nu Paradigm clients.”
    

      According to Russell O’Brien, Co-Founder of Nu Paradigm, the firms’ 
      shared culture and values were instrumental in creating the combination.
    

      “When we began to explore the idea of partnering, we knew it was 
      critical that we maintain our unique approach to serving clients,” 
      O’Brien said. “There was an immediate affinity with Wall Street Access 
      in terms of our commitment to transparency and client alignment, as well 
      as a culture that emphasizes new and innovative solutions to clients’ 
      challenges.”
    

      “We are thrilled that Nu Paradigm has become part of the Wall Street 
      Access family,” added Sean Kelleher, President of Wall Street Access. 
      “In a very short time frame, Chris and Russell have built an exemplary 
      firm with a strong client focus, and they are the perfect partner for 
      Wall Street Access to expand the services we offer to clients. We are 
      confident their knowledge and relationships can help our existing asset 
      management clients achieve the investment success they deserve.”
    

      The new division will serve clients from offices in New York City at 17 
      Battery Place and in Boston at 60 State Street.

Vision and Leadership

Denis P. Kelleher provides the vision and leadership that enables Wall Street Access to evolve one step ahead of the market. Formerly, he was President of Ruane Cunniff & Co., Inc. and also served as Vice President and Treasurer of the Sequoia Fund.      
Asset Management
We provide comprehensive investment management, financial planning and fund management solutions to an array of clients including private investors, institutions, pension plans, government funds, trusts, estates, foundations and endowments.
Capital Requirements for IBDs
The number of broker dealers is virtually unchanged over the past five years, despite capital and compliance pressures, but that is about to change. With the clearing firms imposing new capital requirements, firms with less than $5 million of capital will be severely challenged to execute for clients.
