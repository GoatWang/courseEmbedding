			            For the most comprehensive selection of collated nails, look for Grip-Rite Collated Fasteners, the most popular brand of fasteners in America.

No matter what the project or what size the job, Grip-Rite Collated Fasteners are the optimal fastening solution, available nationwide from a variety of dealers and retail establishments. There are many sizes and styles of collated nails available. As construction materials and techniques evolve, fastener design keeps pace with the changing technology. Fastener needs vary from project to project and the safety and life expectancy of the project can be extended or compromised based upon the fastener used.
