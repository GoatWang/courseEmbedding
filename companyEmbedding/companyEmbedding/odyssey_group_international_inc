About 


Our Company
Odyssey Group International, Inc. is a Nevada corporation formed in March 2014. We refer to Odyssey Group International, Inc. herein as “OGI,” “Odyssey,” the “company,” “our company,” “we,” “us” and “our”. Our company has no subsidiaries. The Odyssey Group’s business model is to be a research and acquisition hub, focused on building and acquiring cash-flowing assets in areas that have an identified technological advantage and a substantial market opportunity within significant target markets across the globe.
Our Mission
The corporate mission is to create or acquire distinct assets, intellectual property, and technologies. Our mission is to deliver the strongest industry model possible with solid returns to our valued shareholders and partners. To carry forward the lessons learned and further refine the technologies and formulations as we build our distribution capability to leverage the assets from our projects across the globe.
General Development of the Business
The Company is a trans-disciplinary product development enterprise involved in the discovery, development and commercialization of a broad range of products. The Company has developed, and subsequent to July 2014, began marketing a product to provide athletic enhancement products to improve the human body’s function during athletic stress.
Subsequent to February 2016, the Company acquired the right to sell and distribute a new technology, CardioMap, which is an advanced technology for early non-invasive testing for heart disease. As of October 2016 the Company has completed a product formulation (code name: ProjectAlpha) from its research and development that acts as a lubricant and a catalyst for fuel injection.
The Company has incorporated into its business model the application of our technologies to the automotive industry, including assistance in the development of the ability to produce very unique custom built engines and vehicle components for specialized and/or standard usage. In turn, the Company is incorporating into its business model the business to customize new vehicles with pre-designed upgrades and engine tweaks including the development of fuel and engine components and sell the custom upgrades through direct business to consumer or business to business sales.
We eventually intend to further acquire other technologies and assets and apply them to our business model and current technologies to be a trans-disciplinary product development company involved in the discovery, development and commercialization of products over a variety of industries.

With respect to shares of our common stock that may be offered and sold from
time to time by the selling stockholders, we will receive no proceeds from the
sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to this offering.


We believe that the primary competition for our services is from existing
distributors of products similar to our RegeneFit™ product. In our current
market of the United States, we compete with other health and wellness
companies. These companies are larger than we are in terms of revenues, assets
and resources. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of cost.

We do not manufacture RegeneFit™ or its packaging. For example, we use existing
RegeneFit™ that we purchased and that we will sell to our distributors who will
sell to customers. In most cases, we view the manufacturers as suppliers of
product and not as competitors. However, such manufacturers may sell their
products directly to end users who intend to resell the products.

As of August 1, 2014, we entered into a distribution agreement for our
RegeneFit™ product with Well-med Global LLC (“Well-med”), with respect to which
Well-med has purchased inventory of our RegeneFit™ product. Under this
agreement, Well-med has the exclusive right to distribute our RegeneFit™ product
in the United States and its territories and has committed to purchase at least
$50,000 in product each year (the “Minimum Purchase Requirements”). The
agreement has a term of two years, subject to the right of (i) either party to
terminate the agreement upon 15 days notice without cause after the first year
and (ii) a non-breaching party to terminate with cause immediately for certain
breaches, including without limitation failure by Well-med to meet the Minimum
Purchase Requirements and increases in product price made by us after the first
year.

Many manufacturers have the infrastructure to manufacture RegeneFit™ but have
not acquired the license or authorization to manufacture RegeneFit™. We
currently hold all of the rights to make, use and sell the RegeneFit™ formula
and we have only appointed Well-med as a distributor and Ubiquity International,
LLC as a manufacturer. Manufacturers and distributors must obtain licensing and
authorizations from our Company to distribute or manufacturer RegeneFit™.

We believe that there are a few emerging distributors that offer products
similar to our RegeneFit™ product. However, we have not identified any such
distributor that focuses primarily on our market of the United States.


Company Description
Our company distributes a health supplement called “RegeneFit™.” We currently
own or control all proprietary rights in and to the formula called “RegeneFit™,”
as well as the respective rights, titles and interests in and to the formula.
The formula is not patent protected, but is maintained solely


 as a trade secret.
We have applied for a trademark for the name “RegeneFit™,” but have not been
awarded such trademark.

On January 1, 2014 we entered into an agreement with Ubiquity International, LLC
(“UI”) whereby UI will manufacture our RegeneFit™ product without defect in
material or workmanship and oversee the selection of outside product sources to
assure GMP product quality guidelines. The term is an initial two-year term,
renewed by mutual agreement. The agreement states that the orders are payable
50% upon receipt of the purchase order and the remaining 50% is due on delivery
of the product. The pricing provided by UI is fixed for six months, until July
2015, and thereafter will be renegotiated in good faith. The pricing is also
dependent upon us making minimum purchase orders of 10,000 units per order. If
we purchase less than 10,000 units per order, UI may increase the price. The
agreement is for a term of two years, but we may terminate at any time upon
60-days’ notice to UI. We retain all proprietary right to the formula, while UI
retains rights to its proprietary manufacturing and blending procedures, which
does not affect our ability to use other manufacturers. So long as we annually
purchase at least 115% of the prior year’s quantity, then UI agrees not to
manufacture any similar product.

As of August 1, 2014, we entered into a distribution agreement for our
RegeneFit™ product with Well-med Global LLC (“Well-med”), with respect to which
we have purchased inventory of our RegeneFit™ product. Under this agreement,
Well-med has the exclusive right to distribute our RegeneFit™ product in the
United States and its territories and has committed to purchase at least $50,000
in product each year. The agreement has a term of two years, subject to the
right of (i) either party to terminate the agreement upon 15 days notice without
cause after the first year and (ii) a non-breaching party to terminate with
cause immediately for certain breaches, including without limitation failure by
Well-med to meet the Minimum Purchase Requirements and increases in product
price made by us after the first year.

We eventually intend to acquire technologies and assets and plan to be a
trans-disciplinary health and wellness product development company involved in
the discovery, development and commercialization of health and wellness
products. We intend to provide a product to improve the human body’s function
during athletic stress and intend to further develop other athletic enhancement
products.

We have not made any other significant purchase or sale of assets. Our company
has no plans to change its business activities or to combine with another
business, and we are not aware of any event or circumstance that might cause our
company’s plans to change. Our company currently has no revenue or operations
and will rely on the sale of our securities and loans from our officers and
directors to fund our initial operations. Our company is not a blank check
registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the
Securities Act of 1933 because it has a specific business plan or purpose.

We intend to license, improve and/or develop such athletic enhancement products
and identify and select distribution channels. We intend to establish agreements
with existing distributors to get products to market quickly as well as to
undertake and engage in our own direct marketing efforts. We will determine the
most effective method of distribution for each unique product that we include in
our portfolio.

We intend to engage third party research and development firms who specialize in
the creation of athletic enhancement products to assist us in the development of
our own athletic enhancement products from which we intend to obtain royalty
payments. We intend to apply for trademarks and patents once we have developed
proprietary athletic enhancement products.

Currently, our mission statement is the following:

. To become a prominent and reliable source of innovative and commercially 
  acceptable products;                                                           

. To provide future development of better, more efficient and less 
  synthetically-derived products and consumables; and                            

. To enable our partners to obtain a competitive edge by commercializing our     
  superior products at competitive pricing.
