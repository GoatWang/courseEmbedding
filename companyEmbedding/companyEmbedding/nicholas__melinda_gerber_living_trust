Advantages of a living trust



It’s a smart way to avoid probate
Keep more money in the family by avoiding potentially lengthy and expensive court proceedings.



Your personal and financial matters remain private
The public doesn’t get to see what you owned, who you owed, and who’ll inherit your assets. 



Your affairs get handled if you’re incapacitated
Avoid going to court by appointing a trustee to take charge of your finances according to your instructions.

LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Will vs. Living Trust: What's Best for You?

Will vs. Living Trust: What's Best for You?
by Mary S. Yamin-Garone, December 2009





 
 
 
You have worked hard for your money and made every attempt to be a conscientious saver. So it's only natural that you want some control over what happens to your assets after your die. Even if you are a person of modest means, you have an estate—and several strategies to choose from to ensure your assets are distributed according to your wishes and in a timely fashion: your estate plan. The right strategy depends on your individual circumstances. For some, a living trust can be a useful and practical tool. For others, it may be a waste of time and money. What is a living trust anyway? And how does it differ from a last will?
What Is a Will?
A will is a written document—signed and witnessed—that indicates how your property will be distributed at the time of your death. It is revocable and subject to amendment at any time during your lifetime. It also allows you to appoint a guardian for your minor children. More about writing a will.
What Is a Living Trust?
A living trust provides lifetime and after-death property management. If you are serving as your own trustee, the trust instrument will provide for a successor upon your death or incapacity. Court intervention is not required. Livings trusts also are used to manage property. If a person is disabled by accident or illness, the successor trustee can manage the trust property. As a result, the expense, publicity, and inconvenience of court-supervised distribution of your estate can be avoided.
If a living trust is properly written and funded you can:
Avoid probate on your assets
Plan for the possibility of your own incapacity
Control what happens to your property after you are gone
Use it for any size estate; and
Prevent your financial affairs from becoming a matter of public record
While a trust sounds appealing, there are drawbacks. A living trust is more expensive to set up than a typical will because it must be actively managed after it is created. Most importantly, however, a living trust is useless unless it is funded. A living trust only can control those assets that have been placed into it. If your assets have not been transferred or if you die without funding the trust, the trust will be of no benefit as your estate will still be subject to probate and there may be significant estate tax issues.
Will vs. Living Trust Considerations
There are many positive reasons to establish a trust but do not overlook the fact that it will involve more upfront effort and expense. To determine if you should make the extra effort and invest in the expense of a trust, answer these questions:
Is informal probate an available option? Most states have an expedited or simplified form of probate for estates under a certain dollar threshold (that dollar value varies by state). If your estate could pass under an expedited form of probate, or if you live in a state where probate is not a complex or burdensome process, a will could be appropriate.
Do you have minor children? A trust allows you to establish provisions specifying when a child will be entitled to any assets held in trust.
Do you have children, grandchildren, or other dependents with special needs? In those instances the access or control those heirs have over their inherited property may need to be limited. With a standard will your property can be passed on to those heirs but a will alone does not allow you to exercise much control over their use of the property.
Will your estate be subject to estate taxes? If the value of your estate exceeds the current estate tax threshold, you may wish to consider setting up a trust with tax planning provisions. The estate tax threshold frequently changes, so be sure to check with the IRS to determine whether or not estate tax is a concern for you.
Will you actively manage your estate plan? If not, a living trust may not be a suitable solution. Again, a trust will only be beneficial if assets are transferred into it.
So what is best for you? In many respects, a living trust and a will accomplish similar objectives. A trust, however, allows you to realize other objectives that a will cannot. But those advantages don't come without a price. Whether or not a living trust is better for you than a will depends on whether the additional advantages are worth the cost. When choosing, remember that one size does not fit all. What is right for one person may not be right for everyone. Your estate plan should be prepared in a way that best meets the needs of you and your family.
This article does not address all the intricacies associated with last wills and living trusts. Consulting with a competent attorney can help you make the right decision.

Anything you own can be included, but it's usually the big things that come to mind first. You can leave your property or anything else to family and loved ones with an Estate Plan.










Despite its name, Estate Plans aren't just for people with mansions. Here's a simple breakdown:








Last Will & Testament OR Living Trust
You pick one. A Last Will & Testament is where you specify what you want to happen when you're no longer here. A Living Trust allows you to state who receives your things when you pass away, but transfers them to a trust while you're still alive.



Power of Attorney
This allows you to put someone in charge of handling financial and legal matters for you if you're unable to do so (e.g. you're in the hospital and cannot speak for yourself).



Living Will (Advance Healthcare Directive)
This allows you to put someone in charge of making life or death decisions for you if can't (e.g. you don't want to stay on life support if you have a terminal condition, but cannot communicate that yourself).



1 year of attorney advice
This gives you the guidance you need during and after the creation of your Estate Plan. An independent attorney is there to help you update it and answer questions for legal matters such as marriage, personal injury, bankruptcy, home sales, employment agreements, and much more.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common Questions

How do I know if I need a will or a trust?
This is one of the most common questions that comes up when planning your estate. They accomplish many of the same things, but a Last Will often has to go through the probate process, while a fully funded living trust avoids probate.  But a last will is easy to create, while transferring your assets into a trust can be time consuming and require additional paperwork. However, we know that this simplified explanation is often not enough to help make this difficult decision. It's for that reason that our Estate Plan Bundle comes with a full year of our Personal Legal Plan. You can purchase the bundle, and immediately schedule a consultation with an attorney in your state to help you make this decision. Many people have to decide based on their unique personal factors (state laws, family situation, size of estate etc...), and the help of an attorney is invaluable to fully explore those details.


Do I need to speak with an attorney before starting my documents?
No, but we highly recommend it. Based on your needs, where you live and the value of your assets, a Living Trust may be more appropriate than a Last Will. An attorney who knows the laws of your state is in the best position to provide that guidance. We encourage you to make that determination before starting the Last Will questionnaire.


What if I need to make changes to my documents?
When life changes come up, many people do choose to update their Estate Planning documents, and we make that easy. One key benefit of the Estate Plan Bundle is that it comes with one full year of our Personal Legal Plan. And along with getting advice from attorneys, your membership allows you to revise your documents as often as you need to at no additional cost. 


Are LegalZoom Last Wills and Living Trusts state-specific?
Yes. Our team of experienced attorneys have designed these documents to meet the specific laws and requirements of each U.S. state.


What happens after I order my bundle?
Once you order your bundle, you decide how to start building your Estate Plan. If you have the information you need, you can jump right in and begin filling out our simple online questionnaires. If you have legal questions, you can schedule a consultation with an independent attorney in your state for help. If you have questions about our questionnaire or other technical questions, you can contact our customer care team. Once all of your questions are answered and you've submitted your questionnaires to us, we'll review your work and create your documents, sending them to you in the mail. When they arrive, make sure you're happy with them, and then follow our simple instructions for signing. Once signed, they're done! All that's left is to keep them someplace safe, and know that you can always come back to us if you need to make changes in the future.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household

Purpose
of Transaction



(1) On
January 26, 2015, the Reporting Persons entered into a Stock

2,163,433 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

The
purpose of the Reporting Persons’ entry into the Purchase
Agreement was for the Reporting Persons to acquire control of the
Issuer, reorganize the Issuer’s board of directors (the
“Board”) to reduce
outstanding debt, and provide capital to fund the Issuer’s
immediate working capital requirements. Pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement, Mr. Gerber was appointed as Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer.

 

(2) On
September 19, 2016, the Issuer, entered into a conditional Stock
Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”), with Wainwright
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Wainwright”)
and certain shareholders of Wainwright (the “Sellers”),
pursuant to which the Sellers conditionally agreed to sell, and the
Company conditionally agreed to purchase, shares representing
approximately 97% of the total issued and outstanding common stock
of Wainwright (the “Wainwright Shares”). If the Company
acquires 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Wainwright,
based on a valuation of $85 million and a per share price of
Company common stock of $0.085, the Company will issue 818,799,976
shares of Company common stock and 9,354,118.85 shares of Company
preferred stock in exchange for the Wainwright shares. A copy of
the Agreement, as set forth in Item 7 is incorporated herein by

Reporting Persons owned the majority of the Wainwright Shares as
well as the Issuer’s voting shares, and will continue own the
majority of the Company’s voting shares following the
Closing.

 

At
Closing, the Issuer issued to the Reporting Person 286,882,373
shares of Issuers Common Stock and 9,354,119 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock (“Newly Acquired Shares”) in exchange
for the Reporting Person’s pro-rata ownership of the
Wainwright Shares.

Living Trust - Create Living Trust Forms Online | LegalZoom





















(866) 679-2319






Living Trust
Give your family clarity and peace of mind
Make sure your assets are enjoyed by your loved ones—not drained by court and legal costs.
Start My Living Trust










Advantages of a living trust



It’s a smart way to avoid probate
Keep more money in the family by avoiding potentially lengthy and expensive court proceedings.



Your personal and financial matters remain private
The public doesn’t get to see what you owned, who you owed, and who’ll inherit your assets. 



Your affairs get handled if you’re incapacitated
Avoid going to court by appointing a trustee to take charge of your finances according to your instructions.

Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Will vs. Living Trust: What's Best for You?

Will vs. Living Trust: What's Best for You?
by Mary S. Yamin-Garone, December 2009





 
 
 
You have worked hard for your money and made every attempt to be a conscientious saver. So it's only natural that you want some control over what happens to your assets after your die. Even if you are a person of modest means, you have an estate—and several strategies to choose from to ensure your assets are distributed according to your wishes and in a timely fashion: your estate plan. The right strategy depends on your individual circumstances. For some, a living trust can be a useful and practical tool. For others, it may be a waste of time and money. What is a living trust anyway? And how does it differ from a last will?
What Is a Will?
A will is a written document—signed and witnessed—that indicates how your property will be distributed at the time of your death. It is revocable and subject to amendment at any time during your lifetime. It also allows you to appoint a guardian for your minor children. More about writing a will.
What Is a Living Trust?
A living trust provides lifetime and after-death property management. If you are serving as your own trustee, the trust instrument will provide for a successor upon your death or incapacity. Court intervention is not required. Livings trusts also are used to manage property. If a person is disabled by accident or illness, the successor trustee can manage the trust property. As a result, the expense, publicity, and inconvenience of court-supervised distribution of your estate can be avoided.
If a living trust is properly written and funded you can:
Avoid probate on your assets
Plan for the possibility of your own incapacity
Control what happens to your property after you are gone
Use it for any size estate; and
Prevent your financial affairs from becoming a matter of public record
While a trust sounds appealing, there are drawbacks. A living trust is more expensive to set up than a typical will because it must be actively managed after it is created. Most importantly, however, a living trust is useless unless it is funded. A living trust only can control those assets that have been placed into it. If your assets have not been transferred or if you die without funding the trust, the trust will be of no benefit as your estate will still be subject to probate and there may be significant estate tax issues.
Will vs. Living Trust Considerations
There are many positive reasons to establish a trust but do not overlook the fact that it will involve more upfront effort and expense. To determine if you should make the extra effort and invest in the expense of a trust, answer these questions:
Is informal probate an available option? Most states have an expedited or simplified form of probate for estates under a certain dollar threshold (that dollar value varies by state). If your estate could pass under an expedited form of probate, or if you live in a state where probate is not a complex or burdensome process, a will could be appropriate.
Do you have minor children? A trust allows you to establish provisions specifying when a child will be entitled to any assets held in trust.
Do you have children, grandchildren, or other dependents with special needs? In those instances the access or control those heirs have over their inherited property may need to be limited. With a standard will your property can be passed on to those heirs but a will alone does not allow you to exercise much control over their use of the property.
Will your estate be subject to estate taxes? If the value of your estate exceeds the current estate tax threshold, you may wish to consider setting up a trust with tax planning provisions. The estate tax threshold frequently changes, so be sure to check with the IRS to determine whether or not estate tax is a concern for you.
Will you actively manage your estate plan? If not, a living trust may not be a suitable solution. Again, a trust will only be beneficial if assets are transferred into it.
So what is best for you? In many respects, a living trust and a will accomplish similar objectives. A trust, however, allows you to realize other objectives that a will cannot. But those advantages don't come without a price. Whether or not a living trust is better for you than a will depends on whether the additional advantages are worth the cost. When choosing, remember that one size does not fit all. What is right for one person may not be right for everyone. Your estate plan should be prepared in a way that best meets the needs of you and your family.
This article does not address all the intricacies associated with last wills and living trusts. Consulting with a competent attorney can help you make the right decision.
If you are ready to create a last will or living trust, LegalZoom can help. Learn more about our affordable last will and living trust services.

Usually, people start the process when major life changes occur, like:




Loss of loved ones
As much as we don't want to think about it, everyone experiences the painful loss of loved ones. It's important to plan for the unexpected to lessen the stress during these unfortunate times.





Marriage
You've probably talked about who gets what and who would be in charge, but it's good to get it in writing so you both know there would be a plan if something unexpected happened.





Kids
More additions to the family, more people to consider. An Estate Plan allows you to plan for your children's future and choose their legal guardians.





Home
Anything you own can be included, but it's usually the big things that come to mind first. You can leave your property or anything else to family and loved ones with an Estate Plan.










Despite its name, Estate Plans aren't just for people with mansions. Here's a simple breakdown:








Last Will & Testament OR Living Trust
You pick one. A Last Will & Testament is where you specify what you want to happen when you're no longer here. A Living Trust allows you to state who receives your things when you pass away, but transfers them to a trust while you're still alive.



Power of Attorney
This allows you to put someone in charge of handling financial and legal matters for you if you're unable to do so (e.g. you're in the hospital and cannot speak for yourself).



Living Will (Advance Healthcare Directive)
This allows you to put someone in charge of making life or death decisions for you if can't (e.g. you don't want to stay on life support if you have a terminal condition, but cannot communicate that yourself).



1 year of attorney advice
This gives you the guidance you need during and after the creation of your Estate Plan. An independent attorney is there to help you update it and answer questions for legal matters such as marriage, personal injury, bankruptcy, home sales, employment agreements, and much more.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common Questions

How do I know if I need a will or a trust?
This is one of the most common questions that comes up when planning your estate. They accomplish many of the same things, but a Last Will often has to go through the probate process, while a fully funded living trust avoids probate.  But a last will is easy to create, while transferring your assets into a trust can be time consuming and require additional paperwork. However, we know that this simplified explanation is often not enough to help make this difficult decision. It's for that reason that our Estate Plan Bundle comes with a full year of our Personal Legal Plan. You can purchase the bundle, and immediately schedule a consultation with an attorney in your state to help you make this decision. Many people have to decide based on their unique personal factors (state laws, family situation, size of estate etc...), and the help of an attorney is invaluable to fully explore those details.


Do I need to speak with an attorney before starting my documents?
No, but we highly recommend it. Based on your needs, where you live and the value of your assets, a Living Trust may be more appropriate than a Last Will. An attorney who knows the laws of your state is in the best position to provide that guidance. We encourage you to make that determination before starting the Last Will questionnaire.


What if I need to make changes to my documents?
When life changes come up, many people do choose to update their Estate Planning documents, and we make that easy. One key benefit of the Estate Plan Bundle is that it comes with one full year of our Personal Legal Plan. And along with getting advice from attorneys, your membership allows you to revise your documents as often as you need to at no additional cost. 


Are LegalZoom Last Wills and Living Trusts state-specific?
Yes. Our team of experienced attorneys have designed these documents to meet the specific laws and requirements of each U.S. state.


What happens after I order my bundle?
Once you order your bundle, you decide how to start building your Estate Plan. If you have the information you need, you can jump right in and begin filling out our simple online questionnaires. If you have legal questions, you can schedule a consultation with an independent attorney in your state for help. If you have questions about our questionnaire or other technical questions, you can contact our customer care team. Once all of your questions are answered and you've submitted your questionnaires to us, we'll review your work and create your documents, sending them to you in the mail. When they arrive, make sure you're happy with them, and then follow our simple instructions for signing. Once signed, they're done! All that's left is to keep them someplace safe, and know that you can always come back to us if you need to make changes in the future.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
