ADA Carbon Solutions, LLC

In October 2008, Energy Capital announced the formation of ADA Carbon Solutions (“ACS”) to develop and construct an activated carbon (“AC”) production facility in Coushatta, Louisiana.


Environmental Infrastructure


Current








ACS was formed in anticipation of federal and state regulations requiring mercury removal from coal-fired power plant emissions. ACS designed and built what Energy Capital believes is the largest, most automated and most environmentally friendly AC manufacturing plant in North America focused on mitigating mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The facility, which is called Red River, was completed in 2010, can produce 150 million pounds per year of AC and has begun shipping product to utility customers. In addition, ACS developed its own dedicated source of raw material, the Five Forks Mine, located in close proximity to the Red River plant.
 
In December 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) released its final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (“MATS”), which set stringent new federal limits on hazardous emissions from the nation’s coal and oil-fired power plants. After a few delays, the rule went into full effect for all U.S. coal plants in April 2016.
 
For more information about ADA Carbon Solutions, please visit the company’s website at www.ADA-CS.com.






























Alaska Midstream

In July 2014, Energy Capital completed an investment commitment to Furie Operating Alaska, LLC  (“Furie”), a growth-oriented independent oil & gas company, from its Mezzanine Opportunities Fund. This investment funded the build-out of infrastructure for the installation of an offshore natural gas production platform, marine pipeline, and onshore production facilities to bring proven natural gas reserves to market from Furie’s Kitchen Lights Unit in the Cook Inlet (“KLU”).


Midstream Oil & Gas


Current








The offshore platform was the first new Cook Inlet production platform installed since 2000, when the Osprey platform was installed at the Redoubt Shoal field. The KLU infrastructure allows Furie to bring a newly discovered natural gas field online to diversify supply for the Kenai Peninsula, Mat-Su Valley and Anchorage areas. Going forward, Furie plans to continue its exploration and development program in the Kitchen Lights Unit, which is an 83,000-acre lease position.
 
For more information about Furie, please visit the company’s website at http://www.furiealaska.com/.  






























Brayton Point Power, LLC

Energy Capital purchased Brayton Point, a 1,528 MW coal-fired facility in Massachusetts. ECP acquired Brayton Point as part of a larger transaction with Dominion Resources, Inc., which closed in August 2013. The other plants in the transaction, Kincaid and Elwood, were contributed to EquiPower. The plant began commercial operations in 1963 and supplies power to ISO New England. Though Energy Capital announced plans to retire the facility in June 2017 due to a challenging long-term economic outlook for the facility, ECP closed on the sale of Brayton Point to Dynegy Inc. in April 2015.


Power Generation


Realized








Prior to sale, through a management agreement, EquiPower Resources Corp., previously an Energy Capital generation platform, acted as asset manager for Brayton Point and lent its considerable generation expertise to oversee plant activities in the areas of commercial dispatch, operations and maintenance and human resources.
 






























Broad River Power LLC

In December 2012, Energy Capital acquired Broad River, a 847 MW simple cycle, natural gas-fired power plant located in Gaffney, South Carolina. The plant began commercial operations in June 2000 and has had a strong operating history. The plant sells 100% of its output through two long-term power contracts with Carolina Power & Light Co., a subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp. 


Power Generation


Realized








In October 2016, Energy Capital sold the facility to an affiliate of Arroyo Energy Investors.






























Cardinal Gas Storage Partners, LLC

In May 2008, Energy Capital Partners and Redbird Gas Storage LLC formed Cardinal Gas Storage Partners LLC, focusing on the development, construction, operation and management of natural gas storage facilities in North America. In August 2014, Energy Capital sold its interest in Cardinal to Martin Midstream.


Midstream Oil & Gas


Realized

Arcadia
An operating salt cavern natural gas storage facility in Bienville Parish, LA.


Cadeville
An operating depleted reservoir facility in Ouachita Parish, LA.


Perryville
An operating salt cavern facility in Franklin Parish, LA.

Chieftain Sand and Proppant LLC

In July 2012, Energy Capital funded the recapitalization of Chieftain Sand from its Mezzanine Opportunities Fund. Chieftain Sand is a producer of frac sand that meets strict technical specifications for use in the oil and gas industry.


Energy Services


Current








Frac sand is required to permanently prop open factures created by the hydraulic fracturing process to unlock oil and gas from unconventional and conventional formations in North America. The majority of all domestic oil and gas drilling and development utilizes frac sand, and it is also used to improve recoveries in existing producing wells. Chieftain Sand owns and operates two frac sand production plants in Wisconsin and Arkansas.For more information about Chieftain Sand Proppant, please visit the company’s website at www.ChieftainSand.com.






























Empire Gen Holdings, Inc.

Energy Capital purchased Empire, a 635 MW combined cycle natural gas turbine (“CCGT”) power plant in Rensselaer, New York, in July 2007 during its development stage and prior to construction commencement. The plant began commercial operations in September 2010 after a successful 3 year construction period.


Power Generation


Realized








Empire is located 150 miles north of New York City across the Hudson River from Albany. The plant uses General Electric 7FA combustion turbines in a combined-cycle configuration and Alstom Heat Recovery Steam Generators. Empire is one of the largest power plants to come online in the northeast in recent years, and is among the most efficient and lowest cost producers in the region.Through a management agreement, Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., an Energy Capital generation platform, acts as asset manager for the Empire plant and lends its generation expertise to oversee plant activities in the areas of commercial dispatch, operations and maintenance and human resources.
For more information about Empire, please visit the company’s website at www.EmpireGen.com.






























EnergySolutions, Inc.

In May 2013, Energy Capital acquired EnergySolutions, Inc., a leading global provider of low-level radioactive waste management and other nuclear services to government and commercial customers, for approximately $1.2 billion from public shareholders in a take-private transaction. The company’s broad range of service offerings includes plant decommissioning, environmental remediation projects, engineering, in-plant support services, and transportation logistics, processing and disposal of low-level radioactive waste. EnergySolutions also provides the nuclear industry with critical back-end products and technologies.


Environmental Infrastructure

By enabling Sunnova’s channel partners to creatively grow their business and customer base, we believe that Sunnova’s partnering model results in a lower cost and more efficient origination approach.
 
The distributed solar sector has been rapidly expanding, driven by significant declines in solar project installation costs, rising utility rates, greater customer choice and state and federal environmental regulations supporting carbon-free and distributed electricity.
