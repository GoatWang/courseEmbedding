Our Founders



Marcus & Millichap revolutionized the real estate brokerage industry. The firm was designed to go far beyond simply facilitating real estate transactions. It was developed as an entire system dedicated to maximizing value for real estate investors.

In 1971, our founders, George M. Marcus and William A. Millichap, launched a new real estate investment business model based on a unique method of matching each property with the largest pool of pre-qualified investors. This simple premise—coupled with an unfailing drive to measure success by client satisfaction—enabled us to emerge as the industry’s pre-eminent real estate investment services firm.

Our founders’ vision has been realized by a commitment to specialization, our willingness to foster a culture of information sharing and the foresight to pioneer real estate technology. Today, Marcus & Millichap is the industry’s leading firm specializing in real estate investment sales and financing, as well as a leading source of research and advisory services.

Our senior management team, including our founders, remains dedicated to a tradition of reinventing the ultimate platform for marketing real estate.

The Rainmakers: California's top political donors, 2001-2011
Lavishing their largesse on legislators and political committees alike, the largest donors to California politics spent $1.25 billion from 2001 through 2011. The group — 50 special interests and 50 wealthy individuals — spans the Golden State's social order. They are corporate leaders and venture capitalists, real estate developers and Hollywood scions. They are energy and tobacco companies, labor unions and tribal governments. Collectively, they shelled out a third of all the money given to campaigns in the state during the 11-year period. This data includes only contributions to candidates and ballot measure committees, not independent expenditure groups.

George M. Marcus, who was born George Moutsanas in Greece, founded the Marcus & Millichap Co., the parent of a group of real estate and investment services companies, in 1971. He also founded the publicly held real estate investment trust Essex Property Corp., now Essex Property Trust. He has contributed to Democratic campaigns, including those of state Assembly candidates Joe Simitian and Elaine Alquist. The vast majority of his donations, however, have funded traditionally liberal social issues that have put him at odds with conservatives in the Greek Orthodox community ­– mainly, his support of stem cell research and Planned Parenthood.
