					Full Description



Intellipharmaceutics International Inc., incorporated on October 22, 2009, is a pharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in the research, development and manufacture of controlled-release and targeted-release oral solid dosage drugs. Its Hypermatrix technology is a multidimensional controlled-release drug delivery platform that can be applied to the development of a range of existing and new pharmaceuticals. Based on this technology platform, the Company has developed various drug delivery systems and a pipeline of products, and product candidates in various stages of development, including Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) filed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (and one Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) filed with Health Canada) and one new drug application (NDA) filing, in therapeutic areas that include neurology, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal tract (GIT), diabetes and pain. Its pipeline of products includes Rexista Oxycodone, Regabatin XR, Generic Focalin XR, Generic Effexor XR, Generic Protonix, Generic Glucophage XR, Generic Seroquel XR, Generic Lamictal XR, Generic Keppra XR, Generic Pristiq and Generic Ranexa. Its generic product candidates also include Trazodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and Carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules.The Company's technology portfolio includes IntelliFoam, IntelliGITransporter, IntelliMatrix, IntelliOsmotics, IntelliPaste, IntelliShuttle, IntelliPellets and novel Point of Divergence Drug Delivery System (nPODDDS). The IntelliGITransporter technology consists of an active drug immobilized in a homogeneous (uniform) matrix structure. The IntelliMatrix technology is a blend of various polymers. Depending on the constituents of the blend and the manner in which these interact, the use of the blend with a drug allows the drug to be released at predetermined rates, while imparting protective characteristics to both the drug and the GIT. The IntelliOsmotics technology is based upon the inclusion of multiple populations of polymers with distinct chemical bonding characteristics. The IntelliPaste technology consists of blends of multiple polymers, oils, excipients and drug active(s), which result in a paste-in-a-capsule dosage form.The IntelliPellets technology consists of one or more type (population) of granule, bead, pellet, or tablet in a holding chamber or reservoir, such as a hard gelatin capsule. Its IntelliPellets technology is designed to control, prolong, delay or modify the release of drugs. It is useful for the delivery of multiple drugs, for delayed, timed, pulsed or for chronotherapeutic drug delivery, designed to mimic its internal clocks for therapeutic optimization. The IntelliShuttle technology provides for drug release past the stomach, such as for drugs required for action beyond the stomach, for drugs, which could be destroyed by the stomach environment, or for drugs, which could harm the stomach itself. The nPODDDS technology platform is designed to provide for various drug delivery features in a product. These include the release of the active substance to show a divergence in a dissolution and/or bioavailability profile.The Company's Rexista (abuse deterrent oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets) product candidate is intended as an abuse and alcohol-deterrent controlled-release oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride for the relief of pain. Rexista is a drug candidate, with an oral formulation of oxycodone intended to treat moderate-to-severe pain when a continuous, around the clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. Another Intellipharmaceutics non-generic controlled-release product under development is Regabatin XR, pregabalin extended-release capsules. Pregabalin is indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. Its generic product candidate, dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, is a generic version of the marketed drug Focalin XR. Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).The Company's product candidate in its generics pipeline is Venlafaxine Hydrochloride extended-release capsules, a generic version of the marketed drug Effexor XR. Effexor XR is an extended-release capsule for oral administration that contains venlafaxine hydrochloride. It is indicated for the treatment of symptoms of depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Its generic product candidate, pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, is a generic version of the marketed drug Protonix. Protonix is a delayed-release capsule for oral administration that contains pantoprazole sodium. Protonix inhibits gastric acid secretion and is prescribed for the short-term treatment of conditions, such as stomach ulcers associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, as well as the long-term treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions, including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Its generics product candidate, metformin hydrochloride extended-release capsules, is a generic version of the marketed drug Glucophage XR. Glucophage is an oral antihyperglycemia drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes.The Company's product candidate in its generics pipeline is quetiapine fumarate extended-release capsules, which is a generic version of the marketed drug Seroquel XR. Quetiapine fumarate is an oral psychotropic agent indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depressive disorder. Its generic product candidate, lamotrigine extended-release tablets, is a generic version of the marketed drug Lamictal XR. Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant drug used in the treatment of epilepsy. Levetiracetam extended release tablets is a generic version of the marketed drug Keppra XR. Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic drug indicated for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy. Another product candidate in its generics pipeline is desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets, which is a generic version of the marketed drug Pristiq. Desvenlafaxine is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor indicated for the treatment of depressive disorder. Its generic product candidate, ranolazine extended-release tablets, is a generic version of the marketed drug Ranexa. Ranolazine is an anti-anginal medication indicated for the treatment of chronic angina. Its generic product candidate, Trazodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, is used for the treatment of depression. Its generic product candidate, Carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules, is used for the treatment of heart failure and hypertension.

Quote:Especially since every product candidate filed by Odidi while at Biovail and IPCI was approved?    Yep as I've said all along cysonic...people can complain about Dr Odidi not promoting this stock or getting the word out as seasoned NAZ CEO's do...but 1 thing they can never complain about is his science and innate ability to procure novel delivery tech platforms!   Dr Odidi has always had a long term view here and has proven over time that despite the many delays, hurdles and challenges faced that maintaining and preserving shareholder value is always part of his focus...so that when the day comes that IPCI is generating millions in net profits...the institutional money will come.   It's not how long and hard the journey is...it's where it eventually leads that matters to those who stay long glta

wimike- It sounds like the product is going out the doors. That is the important thing. What constitutes an official launch I do not know. Maybe one of the experts that know everything can chime in and enlighten us idiots... Really, they always are here doing us other favors and telling us where not to put our money for some reason.

Intellipharmaceutics International Inc. Announces Update on FDA Review of NDA on Pain Management
Jun 30 17
Intellipharmaceutics International Inc. has announced that a joint meeting of the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the FDA has been scheduled for July 26, 2017 to review the its new drug application for Rexista abuse-deterrent oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. The company's NDA submission for Rexista was accepted for review by the FDA on February 2, 2017. The FDA set a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of September 25, 2017. Rexista is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. The submission is supported by pivotal pharmacokinetic studies that demonstrated that Rexista is bioequivalent to OxyContin. The submission also includes abuse-deterrent studies conducted to support abuse-deterrent label claims, having reference to the FDA's 'Abuse-Deterrent Opioids - Evaluation and Labeling' guidance published in April 2015. If approved, Rexista may be the only abuse-deterrent oxycodone product with properties that may provide early warning of drug abuse if the product is manipulated or abused. The company previously announced the results of a food effect study which showed that Rexista can be administered with or without a meal (i.e., no food effect), providing another point of differentiation from currently marketed oral oxycodone extended release products. There can be no assurance that will not be required to conduct further studies for Rexista, that the FDA will ultimately approve the NDA for the sale of Rexista in the US market, or that it will ever be successfully commercialized. Rexista (abuse deterrent oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets) NDA product candidate is intended as an abuse and alcohol-deterrent controlled-release oral formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride for the relief of pain. The Rexista long-acting formulation of oxycodone is intended to present a significant barrier to tampering when subjected to various forms of physical and chemical manipulation commonly used by abusers. It is also designed to prevent dose dumping when inadvertently co-administered with alcohol. Dose dumping is the rapid release of an active ingredient from a controlled-release drug into the blood stream that can result in increased toxicity, side effects, and a loss of efficacy. Dose dumping can result by consuming the drug through crushing, taking with alcohol, extracting with other beverages, vaporizing or injecting. In addition, when crushed or pulverized and hydrated, the proposed extended release formulation is designed to coagulate instantaneously and entrap the drug in a viscous hydrogel, which is intended to prevent syringing, injecting and snorting. Rexista formulation is difficult to abuse through the application of heat or an open flame, making it difficult to inhale the active ingredient from burning. Rexista formulation contains a blue dye that is emitted once the tablet is tampered with or crushed, and may act as a deterrent to a user who attempts to abuse it orally or via the intra-nasal route.

Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Commences Investigation on Behalf of Intellipharmaceutics International Inc. Investors










[July 28, 2017]


Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Commences Investigation on Behalf of Intellipharmaceutics International Inc. Investors







Glancy 
 Prongay & Murray LLP ("GPM") announces an investigation on 
 behalf Intellipharmaceutics International Inc. ("Intellipharmaceutics" 
 or the "Company") (NASDAQ: IPCI) 
 investors concerning the Company and its officers' possible violations 
 of federal securities laws. To obtain information or aid in the 
 investigation, please visit the Intellipharmaceutics investigation page 
 on our website at glancylaw.com/case/intelipharmaceutics-international-inc.
 




 On July 26, 2017, Intellipharmaceutics disclosed that the Anesthetic and 
 Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk 
 Management Advisory Committee of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
 ("FDA") voted 22 to 1 against approval of the Company's New Drug 
 Application for Rexista, an opioid painkiller. The FDA committees also 
 voted that Rexista had not demonstrated properties that can be expected 
 to deter abuse by the intravenous route, and that there was insufficient 
 data to support inclusion of language regarding abuse-deterrent 
 properties in the product label for the intravenous route of 
 administration.
 

 On this news, the Company's share price fell $1.13 per share, or 45.3% 
 on July 27, 2017, thereby injuring investors.
 

 Follow us for updates on Twitter (News - Alert): twitter.com/GPM_LLP.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Strategic Focus



			We believe that our Hypermatrix™ technology is a novel and robust controlled-release drug delivery platform. This unique technology allows us to provide life-cycle management or new chemical entity delivery system solutions for virtually any small molecule. The flexibility of this technology allows us to quickly develop complex drug delivery solutions.
We operate in the niche market created by the expiration of drug product patents and drug product exclusivity periods. There are two ways that we employ our controlled-release technologies, which represent substantial opportunities for us to license our technologies and products:
NDA Strategy

			For branded immediate-release (multiple-times-per-day) drugs, we formulate improved replacement products, typically by developing a new, patentable, controlled-release once-a-day drug. These drugs can be licensed to and sold by the pharmaceutical company that made the original immediate-release product.  This protects against revenue erosion in the brand by providing a clinically attractive patented product that competes favorably with the generic immediate-release competition which arises on expiry of the original patent(s). The regulatory pathway for this approach requires new drug applications ("NDA") via a 505 (b)(2) pathway.  This accelerates development timelines and reduces costs in comparision to new drug applications for new chemical entities.
			
ANDA Strategy

			For existing controlled-release (once-a-day) products covered by patents about to expire or already expired, we can formulate generic products, which are bioequivalent to the branded products. Such products can be licensed to and sold by distributors of generic products.  Our scientists have previously demonstrated a successful track record with such products, having developed several drugs on a private contract basis. The regulatory pathway for this approach requires an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA").

Generic Focalin XR®



	Our lead generic product candidate dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules is a generic version of the marketed drug Focalin XR®, which is partnered with Par Pharmaceutical, Inc.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted final approval of the Company's, and Par’s ANDAs for  dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules for the 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 mg strengths.  Par has launched the 15 and 30 mg  30 strengths in late 2013.  Par launched the 25 and 35 mg strengths in January 2017.  As the first filer of an ANDA for generic Focalin XR® in the 25 and 35 mg Page 5 strengths, Par has 180 days of U.S. generic marketing exclusivity for these strengths. We believe Par is preparing to launch all the remaining strengths in the first half of 2017. Under a license and commercialization agreement between the Company and Par (as amended, the “Par agreement”), the Company receives quarterly profit-share payments on Par's U.S. sales of generic Focalin XR®.

	 

	Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride, a Schedule II restricted product in the United States, is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). According to Symphony Health Solutions, sales for the 12 months ended January 2017 of Focalin XR® in the U.S. were approximately $787 million (TRx MBS Dollars).

	 

	In 2005, we entered into a license and commercialization arrangement with Par for the development of a generic version of Focalin XR®. On August 18, 2011, we announced that we had added the development and commercialization of additional strengths of generic Focalin XR® to the existing license and commercialization arrangement with Par for the U.S. market. This included the 30 and 40 mg strengths.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Intellipharmaceutics International Inc. (IPCI  -  Free Report)	 announced the launch of a generic version of schizophrenia drug, Seroquel XR by its marketing and distribution partner in the U.S, Mallinckrodt Public Limited Company (MNK  -  Free Report)	.The launch was preceded by FDA approval of the company’s abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) in May 2017.Astrazeneca plc’s (AZN  -  Free Report)	 Seroquel XR is indicated for use in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.The drug was launched as extended-release tablets for all strengths including 50, 150, 200, 300 and 400 mg. Total sales in the U.S. for Seroquel XR, in both branded and generic version, was $842 million for the 12 months ended Apr 2017. We believe that the launch in the U.S. will further boost the performance of Intellipharmaceutics’ generics business.IntelliPharmaCeutics’ shares gained 8.16% following the announcement. However, the stock has underperformed the Zacks classified Medical - Drugs industry so far this year. The company’s shares lost 25.4%, while the industry registered an increase of 4.9%.In Oct 2016, Intellipharmaceutics entered into a license and commercial supply agreement with Mallinckrodt, granting the latter an exclusive license to market, sell and distribute generic Seroquel XR, Pristiq and Lamictal XR in the U.S., for which it had filed abbreviated new drug applications (NDAs). The generic versions of Pristiq and Lamictal are currently under review.Meanwhile, the generic version of Seroquel XR is already marketed by some major pharma companies like Endo International PLC (ENDP  -  Free Report)	, India-based Lupin Ltd., as well as by some smaller companies. Hence, Intellipharmaceutics will face tough competition as far as its commercialization is concerned.Moreover, in May 2017, Intellipharmaceutics had announced that its partner Par Pharmaceutical launched 10 and 20 mg strengths of its marketed generic version of Focalin XR capsules. The generic version was available in 15, 25, 30 and 35 mg strengths prior to the launch.Intellipharmaceutics specializes in the research, development and manufacture of novel and generic controlled-release and targeted-release oral solid dosage drugs. The company has also filed NDA 505(b)(2) for its specialty drug product candidates in development including Rexista, an abuse-deterrent oxycodone product and Regabatin XR, a neuropathic pain management product.Intellipharmaceutics International Inc.
