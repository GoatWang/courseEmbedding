Maheesh Jain, Co-Founder and Vice President of Business Development
 Maheesh Jain
 As Vice President of Business Development, Maheesh Jain directs the company’s corporate and online retail strategies and partnership programs. Previously, Jain led the company’s sales and marketing organization and was responsible for overall performance and execution. 
Since 1999, under Jain’s direction, CafePress.com grew its network from zero to nearly 2 million members. During that time, nearly 1 million online shops were created and over 35 major accounts were signed, including United Media, Electronic Arts and MP3.com. In addition, the product line expanded from four to over 70 products. At a time when most Internet companies were failing, Jain cemented a highly profitable business model that led CafePress.com to profitability in 12 short months. 
Prior to founding CafePress.com, Jain, a self-proclaimed serial entrepreneur, launched several consumer and business technology companies along with business partner, Fred Durham. Together, Jain and Durham focused on developing software applications targeted to the diverse needs of small businesses and the larger broadcast and commercial printing industries. 
Jain and Durham set out to redefine the way business is done by using the power of the Internet to create a new class of entrepreneurs. In 1999, taking the best elements from each of their previous business ventures, Jain and Durham launched CafePress.com, the online Marketplace for self-expression. 
Jain earned a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from Northwestern University.

CafePress co‑founder Maheesh Jain resigns

Jain, the chief marketing officer, will leave CafePress at the end of the year.




Maheesh Jain, the chief marketing officer of customized gift e-retailer CafePress Inc., has resigned and will leave the company he co-founded at the end of the month, according to documents filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.
On Dec. 1, Jain gave notice of his resignation, effective Dec. 31, the company says. Chairman and CEO Fred E. Durham III will assume Jain’s duties starting Jan. 1, according to the SEC filing.
“Maheesh has been a key contributor to CafePress’ evolution since co-founding it in 1999 and returning to his leadership position alongside Fred Durham, co-founder and CEO, in 2014,” CafePress said Wednesday. “Since that time, we have made impressive strides right-sizing the company and we are focusing on reenergizing CafePress for a return to profitable growth. We have consolidated our footprint and streamlined our operations throughout our organization over the past two years. Maheesh is based in California and has decided to step down from his role following the closure of the California operations,” the company said.
Jain could not be reached for comment.
Sales for CafePress in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 were down 1.5% year over year, notably lower than previous declines of 9.2% in Q2 and a 23% decline in Q1. The online-only retailer, No. 249 in the Internet Retailer 2016 Top 500 Guide, in Q3 refreshed CafePress.com with improved navigation and updated its mobile site to ensure a more consistent experience across all devices. It also reported that mobile traffic grew in the high single digits year over year in the third quarter, and mobile sales grew in the low double digits.

Jain, who founded CafePress in 1999 with Durham, was responsible for marketing and business development through 2008 and worked in roles that included social media, mobile and product management through 2011, according to his LinkedIn profile. Jain returned to CafePress in 2014 alongside Durham when the previous CEO, Bob Marino, left the company.
Prior to CafePress, Jain launched “9 companies you’ve never heard of in 4 years,” his LinkedIn profile says. Jain also lists himself as the founder of 3rdRevolution, still active and formed in 2013, which “allows hobbyists and enthusiasts to organize their projects and showcase the awesome things they make,” according to his profile.
