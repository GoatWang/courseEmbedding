Sure, you can buy a carburetor for your John Deere at Tractor Supply, but the cognoscenti know that the chain’s stores are geared less to professional farmers and more toward regular folks looking for home and garden items. Sandfort joined the company in 2007—which has now reaped nearly two decades of relentless increases in annual revenues and profits—as chief merchandising officer. He became CEO in 2013. Sandfort has cultivated a one-stop shopping experience; whether customers need fencing for containing cattle or riding mowers and pet supplies, they can get it all in his store. One analyst says she can’t think of another publicly traded company that focuses so much on the consumer. Sandfort’s success has won him “kind of a cult following on the Street,” according to an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. Indeed, when Gregg Steinhafel resigned as Target’s top executive last year, Sandfort’s name came up as a potential candidate.

Feeding the beast at Tractor Supply







During a recent Goldman Sachs investor conference, analyst Matt Fassler described Tractor Supply as “one of the most unique differentiated growth stories in retail.”
That was the cue for CEO Greg Sandfort to share some of the Brentwood, Tenn.-based company’s insights into its large and growing brand of farm-and-ranch retailing. And he shredded a few myths of rural retailing in the process.

The areas are honed to boost sales per square foot as they host special events and introduce new and seasonal products, Sandfort told investors.

 
 


    February 21, 2013



At Tractor Supply, new chief tells similar story







For the past several years, whenever Tractor Supply's CEO Jim Wright spoke about his company's earnings, he usually described a strong performance in a challenging environment — a 1,000-plus-store little engine that could.
Last month, his replacement, Greg Sandfort, picked up where Wright left off, pointing to a 10.8% fourth-quarter sales increase and a 24% increase in net income. In his first earnings call as CEO, Sandfort ran analysts through the Brentwood, Tenn.-based retailer's challenges and opportunities.

How does one choose a Businessperson of the Year? We think you have to start with the basics: Is the top dog delivering results? To answer that question, Fortune’s data guru, Scott DeCarlo, constructed an exacting screen. It parses and ranks companies by 12- and 36-month increases in profits, revenues, and stock performance, and factors in return on capital and debt. (We give the 12-month results more weight to capture who’s killing it today but also include the 36-month figures to eliminate those who had one lucky year.) Then, of course, come the intangibles: Is the CEO influencing business? Taking bold, visionary steps? The list that follows reveal star executives with wildly varying styles and approaches, but one thing in common: They deliver, big-time. By: Scott Cendrowski, Geoff Colvin, Laura Entis, Adam Lashinsky, Clifton Leaf, Michal Lev-Ram, Leena Rao, Jonathan Vanian, Nicholas Varchaver, Phil Wahba, and Jen Wieczner

Adam Berry—Getty Images


Mark Zuckerberg has willed into being a global phenomenon. Facebook is a nearly 16,000-employee media powerhouse worth $350 billion and also an advertising-technology juggernaut on track for annual revenues of $27 billion in 2016 and gaudy profits of $7 billion. Its core product has almost 1.8 billion users, and Zuckerberg has shrewdly assembled a portfolio of properties to buttress Facebook.
 
Zuckerberg is rightly recognized for his outsize success. Nevertheless, he is surprisingly underappreciated for his business acumen. Yes, he has delegated the commercial aspects of Facebook to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s polished chief operating officer, a Harvard MBA who is 15 years Zuckerberg’s senior. Sandberg’s presence has fostered an “adult supervision” narrative familiar to the Valley. But unlike, say, the Google founders, who turned over the CEO job to Eric Schmidt for a decade before Larry Page stepped back into the position in 2011, Zuckerberg has remained chief executive throughout Facebook’s 12-year sprint to greatness. Despite repeated doubts when Facebook missed the shift to smartphones, when Facebook was thought to have botched its IPO, when Facebook was seen as losing its luster with young people Zuckerberg has remained the company’s chief product visionary and business strategist. Through bold acquisitions and the articulation of a remarkably constant mission, Zuckerberg has kept Facebook on track in the face of full-frontal assaults from the likes of Google, Twitter, Snapchat, and others.
 
What makes him so effective as a businessperson? An examination of Zuckerberg’s management approach reveals that his success rests on three pillars: his unique ability to look into the future, his otherworldly consistency, and the business discipline he has nurtured in an industry quite often enamored with bright, shiny objects.
