History[edit]
The Standard Life Assurance Company was established in 1825 and was reincorporated as a mutual assurance company in 1925.[4] During the 19th century it opened offices in Canada, India, China and Uruguay.[4]
In 2006 demutualisation took place and the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange.[5] The company sold Standard Life Bank plc to Barclays plc in January 2010[6] and then acquired the remaining 75 per cent stake in Threesixty, a financial advisory support business, that it did not already own for an undisclosed sum in March 2010.[7] It sold its healthcare division to Discovery Holdings, a South African business, in May 2010[8] and went on to buy Focus Solutions Group, a financial software company, for £42m in December 2010.[9]

In February 2013, the company announced that it had acquired the private client division of Newton Management Limited, a UK wealth management unit of BNY Mellon, in a deal worth up to £83.5 million.[10] In March 2014, it was announced that Standard Life was in advanced talks to purchase rival Phoenix Group Holdings’ Ignis Asset Management for around £400 million.[11] Towards the end of the month, Standard Life completed the acquisition for a fee of £390 million.[12] In September 2014, Standard Life agreed to sell its Canadian operations to The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation.[13] It completed this sale on 30 January 2015 for a cash consideration of C$4.0bn. The transaction included a Global Collaboration Agreement where Manulife will seek to distribute Standard Life Investments' funds in Canada, the US and Asia.[14] In a round-up of 2014 business, pre-tax profits rose by 19% to £604m, fee-based revenue during the year grew 14% to 1.43bn, and over 340,000 auto-enrolment customers were added. The pay and bonus of Chief Executive, David Nish, rose by 23% to almost £5.5m.[15]
In February 2015, Standard Life announced it was launching a wholly owned, UK-wide, financial advice business saying it was “responding to fundamental changes that were driving unprecedented demand for advice from customers”.[16] In doing so, it confirmed that it had entered into an agreement with Skipton Building Society to purchase Pearson Jones,[17] a firm of financial advisers and paraplanners, and this acquisition was completed in May 2015 when the name of its new financial advice business was announced as “1825” – a reference to the year Standard Life was founded.[18] In July 2016, a property investment fund managed by Standard Life Investments froze withdrawals after experiencing liquidity issues.[19][20]
In March 2017, Standard Life reached an agreement to merge with Aberdeen Asset Management, in an all-share merger, subject to shareholder approval.[21]
Operations[edit]
Standard Life is an investment company, headquartered in Edinburgh, with operations across the globe.[22] It employs around 6,300 people internationally[2] through businesses in the UK, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia. It has around 4.5 million customers and clients across 45 countries and is responsible for the administration of over £360bn of their assets. The company has a further 25 million customers through its Indian and Chinese associate and joint venture businesses - HDFC Life in India and Heng An Standard Life in China.[22]
In the UK, Standard Life also owns three subsidiary businesses: Focus Solutions, a software and consultancy business, threesixty, a services provider and Vebnet, a software and services provider.[23]
Standard Life has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and has around 1.2 million individual shareholders.[24] It is also listed in a number of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), including the DJSI World, which ranks the world's leading sustainability-driven publicly listed companies.[25]
Senior management[edit]
The company’s board of directors is made up of a Chairman, four Executive Directors and seven non-Executive Directors.[26] The board has nine men and three women. Details of the Chairman and Executive Directors include:

Sir Gerry Grimstone (Chairman) appointed in May 2007
Keith Skeoch (Chief Executive) appointed on 5 August 2015, replacing David Nish
Luke Savage (Chief Financial Officer) appointed in August 2014
Colin Clark (Director, Global Client Group) appointed in November 2015
Barry O'Dwyer (CEO, Pensions and Savings) appointed in March 2017

The non-executive directors are:

Pierre Danon, appointed in October 2011
Noel Harwerth, appointed in July 2012
Lynne Peacock, appointed in April 2012
Martin Pike, appointed in September 2013
Kevin Parry, appointed in October 2014
Melanie Gee, appointed in November 2015
John Devine, appointed in July 2016

Controversy[edit]
In January 2006, Standard Life were accused of smearing a policy-holder, Michael Hogan, who was not happy with the way the company was being run. An e-mail sent to Standard Life executives and advisors (which was disclosed under the Data Protection Act) revealed an attempt to discredit him.[27]
In January 2007, the head of Standard Life's life and pensions business, Trevor Matthews, used the racist phrase "nigger in the woodpile" while giving a presentation at one of the company's Edinburgh offices. After issuing an apology, Mr Matthews remained in his job and no disciplinary action was taken.[28]
In March 2007 the company announced it would cut 1,000 jobs in an attempt to save an additional £100 million per year in costs.[29] One month later it was highlighted in the company's annual report that three of Standard Life's top executives (Sandy Crombie, Keith Skeoch and Trevor Matthews) were awarded more than £5 million in pay.[30] A Standard Life spokesman defended the awards, citing the leadership's efforts in turning round the company's fortunes.[30]
In February 2014, Standard Life announced that it may move parts of their operations outside Scotland in the event of Scottish independence, if it was necessary to do so.[31]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

History[edit]
The Standard Life Assurance Company was established in 1825 and was reincorporated as a mutual assurance company in 1925.[4] During the 19th century it opened offices in Canada, India, China and Uruguay.[4]
In 2006 demutualisation took place and the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange.[5] The company sold Standard Life Bank plc to Barclays plc in January 2010[6] and then acquired the remaining 75 per cent stake in Threesixty, a financial advisory support business, that it did not already own for an undisclosed sum in March 2010.[7] It sold its healthcare division to Discovery Holdings, a South African business, in May 2010[8] and went on to buy Focus Solutions Group, a financial software company, for £42m in December 2010.[9]

30 Lothian Road in Edinburgh


In February 2013, the company announced that it had acquired the private client division of Newton Management Limited, a UK wealth management unit of BNY Mellon, in a deal worth up to £83.5 million.[10] In March 2014, it was announced that Standard Life was in advanced talks to purchase rival Phoenix Group Holdings’ Ignis Asset Management for around £400 million.[11] Towards the end of the month, Standard Life completed the acquisition for a fee of £390 million.[12] In September 2014, Standard Life agreed to sell its Canadian operations to The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation.[13] It completed this sale on 30 January 2015 for a cash consideration of C$4.0bn. The transaction included a Global Collaboration Agreement where Manulife will seek to distribute Standard Life Investments' funds in Canada, the US and Asia.[14] In a round-up of 2014 business, pre-tax profits rose by 19% to £604m, fee-based revenue during the year grew 14% to 1.43bn, and over 340,000 auto-enrolment customers were added. The pay and bonus of Chief Executive, David Nish, rose by 23% to almost £5.5m.[15]
In February 2015, Standard Life announced it was launching a wholly owned, UK-wide, financial advice business saying it was “responding to fundamental changes that were driving unprecedented demand for advice from customers”.[16] In doing so, it confirmed that it had entered into an agreement with Skipton Building Society to purchase Pearson Jones,[17] a firm of financial advisers and paraplanners, and this acquisition was completed in May 2015 when the name of its new financial advice business was announced as “1825” – a reference to the year Standard Life was founded.[18] In July 2016, a property investment fund managed by Standard Life Investments froze withdrawals after experiencing liquidity issues.[19][20]
In March 2017, Standard Life reached an agreement to merge with Aberdeen Asset Management, in an all-share merger, subject to shareholder approval.[21]
Operations[edit]
Standard Life is an investment company, headquartered in Edinburgh, with operations across the globe.[22] It employs around 6,300 people internationally[2] through businesses in the UK, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia. It has around 4.5 million customers and clients across 45 countries and is responsible for the administration of over £360bn of their assets. The company has a further 25 million customers through its Indian and Chinese associate and joint venture businesses - HDFC Life in India and Heng An Standard Life in China.[22]
In the UK, Standard Life also owns three subsidiary businesses: Focus Solutions, a software and consultancy business, threesixty, a services provider and Vebnet, a software and services provider.[23]
Standard Life has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and has around 1.2 million individual shareholders.[24] It is also listed in a number of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), including the DJSI World, which ranks the world's leading sustainability-driven publicly listed companies.[25]
Senior management[edit]
The company’s board of directors is made up of a Chairman, four Executive Directors and seven non-Executive Directors.[26] The board has nine men and three women. Details of the Chairman and Executive Directors include:

Sir Gerry Grimstone (Chairman) appointed in May 2007
Keith Skeoch (Chief Executive) appointed on 5 August 2015, replacing David Nish
Luke Savage (Chief Financial Officer) appointed in August 2014
Colin Clark (Director, Global Client Group) appointed in November 2015
Barry O'Dwyer (CEO, Pensions and Savings) appointed in March 2017

The non-executive directors are:

Pierre Danon, appointed in October 2011
Noel Harwerth, appointed in July 2012
Lynne Peacock, appointed in April 2012
Martin Pike, appointed in September 2013
Kevin Parry, appointed in October 2014
Melanie Gee, appointed in November 2015
John Devine, appointed in July 2016

Controversy[edit]
In January 2006, Standard Life were accused of smearing a policy-holder, Michael Hogan, who was not happy with the way the company was being run. An e-mail sent to Standard Life executives and advisors (which was disclosed under the Data Protection Act) revealed an attempt to discredit him.[27]
In January 2007, the head of Standard Life's life and pensions business, Trevor Matthews, used the racist phrase "nigger in the woodpile" while giving a presentation at one of the company's Edinburgh offices. After issuing an apology, Mr Matthews remained in his job and no disciplinary action was taken.[28]
In March 2007 the company announced it would cut 1,000 jobs in an attempt to save an additional £100 million per year in costs.[29] One month later it was highlighted in the company's annual report that three of Standard Life's top executives (Sandy Crombie, Keith Skeoch and Trevor Matthews) were awarded more than £5 million in pay.[30] A Standard Life spokesman defended the awards, citing the leadership's efforts in turning round the company's fortunes.[30]
In February 2014, Standard Life announced that it may move parts of their operations outside Scotland in the event of Scottish independence, if it was necessary to do so.[31]

In 2006 demutualisation took place and the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange.[5] The company sold Standard Life Bank plc to Barclays plc in January 2010[6] and then acquired the remaining 75 per cent stake in Threesixty, a financial advisory support business, that it did not already own for an undisclosed sum in March 2010.[7] It sold its healthcare division to Discovery Holdings, a South African business, in May 2010[8] and went on to buy Focus Solutions Group, a financial software company, for £42m in December 2010.[9]

In February 2013, the company announced that it had acquired the private client division of Newton Management Limited, a UK wealth management unit of BNY Mellon, in a deal worth up to £83.5 million.[10] In March 2014, it was announced that Standard Life was in advanced talks to purchase rival Phoenix Group Holdings’ Ignis Asset Management for around £400 million.[11] Towards the end of the month, Standard Life completed the acquisition for a fee of £390 million.[12] In September 2014, Standard Life agreed to sell its Canadian operations to The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation.[13] It completed this sale on 30 January 2015 for a cash consideration of C$4.0bn. The transaction included a Global Collaboration Agreement where Manulife will seek to distribute Standard Life Investments' funds in Canada, the US and Asia.[14] In a round-up of 2014 business, pre-tax profits rose by 19% to £604m, fee-based revenue during the year grew 14% to 1.43bn, and over 340,000 auto-enrolment customers were added. The pay and bonus of Chief Executive, David Nish, rose by 23% to almost £5.5m.[15]
In February 2015, Standard Life announced it was launching a wholly owned, UK-wide, financial advice business saying it was “responding to fundamental changes that were driving unprecedented demand for advice from customers”.[16] In doing so, it confirmed that it had entered into an agreement with Skipton Building Society to purchase Pearson Jones,[17] a firm of financial advisers and paraplanners, and this acquisition was completed in May 2015 when the name of its new financial advice business was announced as “1825” – a reference to the year Standard Life was founded.[18] In July 2016, a property investment fund managed by Standard Life Investments froze withdrawals after experiencing liquidity issues.[19][20]
In March 2017, Standard Life reached an agreement to merge with Aberdeen Asset Management, in an all-share merger, subject to shareholder approval.[21]
Operations[edit]
Standard Life is an investment company, headquartered in Edinburgh, with operations across the globe.[22] It employs around 6,300 people internationally[2] through businesses in the UK, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia. It has around 4.5 million customers and clients across 45 countries and is responsible for the administration of over £360bn of their assets. The company has a further 25 million customers through its Indian and Chinese associate and joint venture businesses - HDFC Life in India and Heng An Standard Life in China.[22]
In the UK, Standard Life also owns three subsidiary businesses: Focus Solutions, a software and consultancy business, threesixty, a services provider and Vebnet, a software and services provider.[23]
Standard Life has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and has around 1.2 million individual shareholders.[24] It is also listed in a number of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), including the DJSI World, which ranks the world's leading sustainability-driven publicly listed companies.[25]
Senior management[edit]
The company’s board of directors is made up of a Chairman, four Executive Directors and seven non-Executive Directors.[26] The board has nine men and three women. Details of the Chairman and Executive Directors include:

Sir Gerry Grimstone (Chairman) appointed in May 2007
Keith Skeoch (Chief Executive) appointed on 5 August 2015, replacing David Nish
Luke Savage (Chief Financial Officer) appointed in August 2014
Colin Clark (Director, Global Client Group) appointed in November 2015
Barry O'Dwyer (CEO, Pensions and Savings) appointed in March 2017

The non-executive directors are:

Pierre Danon, appointed in October 2011
Noel Harwerth, appointed in July 2012
Lynne Peacock, appointed in April 2012
Martin Pike, appointed in September 2013
Kevin Parry, appointed in October 2014
Melanie Gee, appointed in November 2015
John Devine, appointed in July 2016

Controversy[edit]
In January 2006, Standard Life were accused of smearing a policy-holder, Michael Hogan, who was not happy with the way the company was being run. An e-mail sent to Standard Life executives and advisors (which was disclosed under the Data Protection Act) revealed an attempt to discredit him.[27]
In January 2007, the head of Standard Life's life and pensions business, Trevor Matthews, used the racist phrase "nigger in the woodpile" while giving a presentation at one of the company's Edinburgh offices. After issuing an apology, Mr Matthews remained in his job and no disciplinary action was taken.[28]
In March 2007 the company announced it would cut 1,000 jobs in an attempt to save an additional £100 million per year in costs.[29] One month later it was highlighted in the company's annual report that three of Standard Life's top executives (Sandy Crombie, Keith Skeoch and Trevor Matthews) were awarded more than £5 million in pay.[30] A Standard Life spokesman defended the awards, citing the leadership's efforts in turning round the company's fortunes.[30]
In February 2014, Standard Life announced that it may move parts of their operations outside Scotland in the event of Scottish independence, if it was necessary to do so.[31]

History[edit]
The Standard Life Assurance Company was established in 1825 and was reincorporated as a mutual assurance company in 1925.[4] During the 19th century it opened offices in Canada, India, China and Uruguay.[4]
In 2006 demutualisation took place and the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange.[5] The company sold Standard Life Bank plc to Barclays plc in January 2010[6] and then acquired the remaining 75 per cent stake in Threesixty, a financial advisory support business, that it did not already own for an undisclosed sum in March 2010.[7] It sold its healthcare division to Discovery Holdings, a South African business, in May 2010[8] and went on to buy Focus Solutions Group, a financial software company, for £42m in December 2010.[9]

30 Lothian Road in Edinburgh


In February 2013, the company announced that it had acquired the private client division of Newton Management Limited, a UK wealth management unit of BNY Mellon, in a deal worth up to £83.5 million.[10] In March 2014, it was announced that Standard Life was in advanced talks to purchase rival Phoenix Group Holdings’ Ignis Asset Management for around £400 million.[11] Towards the end of the month, Standard Life completed the acquisition for a fee of £390 million.[12] In September 2014, Standard Life agreed to sell its Canadian operations to The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation.[13] It completed this sale on 30 January 2015 for a cash consideration of C$4.0bn. The transaction included a Global Collaboration Agreement where Manulife will seek to distribute Standard Life Investments' funds in Canada, the US and Asia.[14] In a round-up of 2014 business, pre-tax profits rose by 19% to £604m, fee-based revenue during the year grew 14% to 1.43bn, and over 340,000 auto-enrolment customers were added. The pay and bonus of Chief Executive, David Nish, rose by 23% to almost £5.5m.[15]
In February 2015, Standard Life announced it was launching a wholly owned, UK-wide, financial advice business saying it was “responding to fundamental changes that were driving unprecedented demand for advice from customers”.[16] In doing so, it confirmed that it had entered into an agreement with Skipton Building Society to purchase Pearson Jones,[17] a firm of financial advisers and paraplanners, and this acquisition was completed in May 2015 when the name of its new financial advice business was announced as “1825” – a reference to the year Standard Life was founded.[18] In July 2016, a property investment fund managed by Standard Life Investments froze withdrawals after experiencing liquidity issues.[19][20]
In March 2017, Standard Life reached an agreement to merge with Aberdeen Asset Management, in an all-share merger, subject to shareholder approval.[21]
Operations[edit]
Standard Life is an investment company, headquartered in Edinburgh, with operations across the globe.[22] It employs around 6,300 people internationally[2] through businesses in the UK, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia. It has around 4.5 million customers and clients across 45 countries and is responsible for the administration of over £360bn of their assets. The company has a further 25 million customers through its Indian and Chinese associate and joint venture businesses - HDFC Life in India and Heng An Standard Life in China.[22]
In the UK, Standard Life also owns three subsidiary businesses: Focus Solutions, a software and consultancy business, threesixty, a services provider and Vebnet, a software and services provider.[23]
Standard Life has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and has around 1.2 million individual shareholders.[24] It is also listed in a number of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), including the DJSI World, which ranks the world's leading sustainability-driven publicly listed companies.[25]
Senior management[edit]
The company’s board of directors is made up of a Chairman, four Executive Directors and seven non-Executive Directors.[26] The board has nine men and three women. Details of the Chairman and Executive Directors include:

Sir Gerry Grimstone (Chairman) appointed in May 2007
Keith Skeoch (Chief Executive) appointed on 5 August 2015, replacing David Nish
Luke Savage (Chief Financial Officer) appointed in August 2014
Colin Clark (Director, Global Client Group) appointed in November 2015
Barry O'Dwyer (CEO, Pensions and Savings) appointed in March 2017

The non-executive directors are:

Pierre Danon, appointed in October 2011
Noel Harwerth, appointed in July 2012
Lynne Peacock, appointed in April 2012
Martin Pike, appointed in September 2013
Kevin Parry, appointed in October 2014
Melanie Gee, appointed in November 2015
John Devine, appointed in July 2016

Controversy[edit]
In January 2006, Standard Life were accused of smearing a policy-holder, Michael Hogan, who was not happy with the way the company was being run. An e-mail sent to Standard Life executives and advisors (which was disclosed under the Data Protection Act) revealed an attempt to discredit him.[27]
In January 2007, the head of Standard Life's life and pensions business, Trevor Matthews, used the racist phrase "nigger in the woodpile" while giving a presentation at one of the company's Edinburgh offices. After issuing an apology, Mr Matthews remained in his job and no disciplinary action was taken.[28]
In March 2007 the company announced it would cut 1,000 jobs in an attempt to save an additional £100 million per year in costs.[29] One month later it was highlighted in the company's annual report that three of Standard Life's top executives (Sandy Crombie, Keith Skeoch and Trevor Matthews) were awarded more than £5 million in pay.[30] A Standard Life spokesman defended the awards, citing the leadership's efforts in turning round the company's fortunes.[30]
In February 2014, Standard Life announced that it may move parts of their operations outside Scotland in the event of Scottish independence, if it was necessary to do so.[31]

Standard Life is an investment company, headquartered in Edinburgh, with operations across the globe.[22] It employs around 6,300 people internationally[2] through businesses in the UK, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia. It has around 4.5 million customers and clients across 45 countries and is responsible for the administration of over £360bn of their assets. The company has a further 25 million customers through its Indian and Chinese associate and joint venture businesses - HDFC Life in India and Heng An Standard Life in China.[22]
In the UK, Standard Life also owns three subsidiary businesses: Focus Solutions, a software and consultancy business, threesixty, a services provider and Vebnet, a software and services provider.[23]
Standard Life has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and has around 1.2 million individual shareholders.[24] It is also listed in a number of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), including the DJSI World, which ranks the world's leading sustainability-driven publicly listed companies.[25]
Senior management[edit]
The company’s board of directors is made up of a Chairman, four Executive Directors and seven non-Executive Directors.[26] The board has nine men and three women. Details of the Chairman and Executive Directors include:

Sir Gerry Grimstone (Chairman) appointed in May 2007
Keith Skeoch (Chief Executive) appointed on 5 August 2015, replacing David Nish
Luke Savage (Chief Financial Officer) appointed in August 2014
Colin Clark (Director, Global Client Group) appointed in November 2015
Barry O'Dwyer (CEO, Pensions and Savings) appointed in March 2017

The non-executive directors are:

Pierre Danon, appointed in October 2011
Noel Harwerth, appointed in July 2012
Lynne Peacock, appointed in April 2012
Martin Pike, appointed in September 2013
Kevin Parry, appointed in October 2014
Melanie Gee, appointed in November 2015
John Devine, appointed in July 2016

Controversy[edit]
In January 2006, Standard Life were accused of smearing a policy-holder, Michael Hogan, who was not happy with the way the company was being run. An e-mail sent to Standard Life executives and advisors (which was disclosed under the Data Protection Act) revealed an attempt to discredit him.[27]
In January 2007, the head of Standard Life's life and pensions business, Trevor Matthews, used the racist phrase "nigger in the woodpile" while giving a presentation at one of the company's Edinburgh offices. After issuing an apology, Mr Matthews remained in his job and no disciplinary action was taken.[28]
In March 2007 the company announced it would cut 1,000 jobs in an attempt to save an additional £100 million per year in costs.[29] One month later it was highlighted in the company's annual report that three of Standard Life's top executives (Sandy Crombie, Keith Skeoch and Trevor Matthews) were awarded more than £5 million in pay.[30] A Standard Life spokesman defended the awards, citing the leadership's efforts in turning round the company's fortunes.[30]
In February 2014, Standard Life announced that it may move parts of their operations outside Scotland in the event of Scottish independence, if it was necessary to do so.[31]

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

History[edit]
The Standard Life Assurance Company was established in 1825 and was reincorporated as a mutual assurance company in 1925.[4] During the 19th century it opened offices in Canada, India, China and Uruguay.[4]
In 2006 demutualisation took place and the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange.[5] The company sold Standard Life Bank plc to Barclays plc in January 2010[6] and then acquired the remaining 75 per cent stake in Threesixty, a financial advisory support business, that it did not already own for an undisclosed sum in March 2010.[7] It sold its healthcare division to Discovery Holdings, a South African business, in May 2010[8] and went on to buy Focus Solutions Group, a financial software company, for £42m in December 2010.[9]

In February 2013, the company announced that it had acquired the private client division of Newton Management Limited, a UK wealth management unit of BNY Mellon, in a deal worth up to £83.5 million.[10] In March 2014, it was announced that Standard Life was in advanced talks to purchase rival Phoenix Group Holdings’ Ignis Asset Management for around £400 million.[11] Towards the end of the month, Standard Life completed the acquisition for a fee of £390 million.[12] In September 2014, Standard Life agreed to sell its Canadian operations to The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation.[13] It completed this sale on 30 January 2015 for a cash consideration of C$4.0bn. The transaction included a Global Collaboration Agreement where Manulife will seek to distribute Standard Life Investments' funds in Canada, the US and Asia.[14] In a round-up of 2014 business, pre-tax profits rose by 19% to £604m, fee-based revenue during the year grew 14% to 1.43bn, and over 340,000 auto-enrolment customers were added. The pay and bonus of Chief Executive, David Nish, rose by 23% to almost £5.5m.[15]
In February 2015, Standard Life announced it was launching a wholly owned, UK-wide, financial advice business saying it was “responding to fundamental changes that were driving unprecedented demand for advice from customers”.[16] In doing so, it confirmed that it had entered into an agreement with Skipton Building Society to purchase Pearson Jones,[17] a firm of financial advisers and paraplanners, and this acquisition was completed in May 2015 when the name of its new financial advice business was announced as “1825” – a reference to the year Standard Life was founded.[18] In July 2016, a property investment fund managed by Standard Life Investments froze withdrawals after experiencing liquidity issues.[19][20]
In March 2017, Standard Life reached an agreement to merge with Aberdeen Asset Management, in an all-share merger, subject to shareholder approval.[21]

Standard Life is an investment company, headquartered in Edinburgh, with operations across the globe.[22] It employs around 6,300 people internationally[2] through businesses in the UK, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia. It has around 4.5 million customers and clients across 45 countries and is responsible for the administration of over £360bn of their assets. The company has a further 25 million customers through its Indian and Chinese associate and joint venture businesses - HDFC Life in India and Heng An Standard Life in China.[22]
In the UK, Standard Life also owns three subsidiary businesses: Focus Solutions, a software and consultancy business, threesixty, a services provider and Vebnet, a software and services provider.[23]
Standard Life has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and has around 1.2 million individual shareholders.[24] It is also listed in a number of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), including the DJSI World, which ranks the world's leading sustainability-driven publicly listed companies.[25]

Controversy[edit]
In January 2006, Standard Life were accused of smearing a policy-holder, Michael Hogan, who was not happy with the way the company was being run. An e-mail sent to Standard Life executives and advisors (which was disclosed under the Data Protection Act) revealed an attempt to discredit him.[27]
In January 2007, the head of Standard Life's life and pensions business, Trevor Matthews, used the racist phrase "nigger in the woodpile" while giving a presentation at one of the company's Edinburgh offices. After issuing an apology, Mr Matthews remained in his job and no disciplinary action was taken.[28]
In March 2007 the company announced it would cut 1,000 jobs in an attempt to save an additional £100 million per year in costs.[29] One month later it was highlighted in the company's annual report that three of Standard Life's top executives (Sandy Crombie, Keith Skeoch and Trevor Matthews) were awarded more than £5 million in pay.[30] A Standard Life spokesman defended the awards, citing the leadership's efforts in turning round the company's fortunes.[30]
In February 2014, Standard Life announced that it may move parts of their operations outside Scotland in the event of Scottish independence, if it was necessary to do so.[31]

History[edit]
The Standard Life Assurance Company was established in 1825 and was reincorporated as a mutual assurance company in 1925.[4] During the 19th century it opened offices in Canada, India, China and Uruguay.[4]
In 2006 demutualisation took place and the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange.[5] The company sold Standard Life Bank plc to Barclays plc in January 2010[6] and then acquired the remaining 75 per cent stake in Threesixty, a financial advisory support business, that it did not already own for an undisclosed sum in March 2010.[7] It sold its healthcare division to Discovery Holdings, a South African business, in May 2010[8] and went on to buy Focus Solutions Group, a financial software company, for £42m in December 2010.[9]

30 Lothian Road in Edinburgh


In February 2013, the company announced that it had acquired the private client division of Newton Management Limited, a UK wealth management unit of BNY Mellon, in a deal worth up to £83.5 million.[10] In March 2014, it was announced that Standard Life was in advanced talks to purchase rival Phoenix Group Holdings’ Ignis Asset Management for around £400 million.[11] Towards the end of the month, Standard Life completed the acquisition for a fee of £390 million.[12] In September 2014, Standard Life agreed to sell its Canadian operations to The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation.[13] It completed this sale on 30 January 2015 for a cash consideration of C$4.0bn. The transaction included a Global Collaboration Agreement where Manulife will seek to distribute Standard Life Investments' funds in Canada, the US and Asia.[14] In a round-up of 2014 business, pre-tax profits rose by 19% to £604m, fee-based revenue during the year grew 14% to 1.43bn, and over 340,000 auto-enrolment customers were added. The pay and bonus of Chief Executive, David Nish, rose by 23% to almost £5.5m.[15]
In February 2015, Standard Life announced it was launching a wholly owned, UK-wide, financial advice business saying it was “responding to fundamental changes that were driving unprecedented demand for advice from customers”.[16] In doing so, it confirmed that it had entered into an agreement with Skipton Building Society to purchase Pearson Jones,[17] a firm of financial advisers and paraplanners, and this acquisition was completed in May 2015 when the name of its new financial advice business was announced as “1825” – a reference to the year Standard Life was founded.[18] In July 2016, a property investment fund managed by Standard Life Investments froze withdrawals after experiencing liquidity issues.[19][20]
In March 2017, Standard Life reached an agreement to merge with Aberdeen Asset Management, in an all-share merger, subject to shareholder approval.[21]
Operations[edit]
Standard Life is an investment company, headquartered in Edinburgh, with operations across the globe.[22] It employs around 6,300 people internationally[2] through businesses in the UK, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia. It has around 4.5 million customers and clients across 45 countries and is responsible for the administration of over £360bn of their assets. The company has a further 25 million customers through its Indian and Chinese associate and joint venture businesses - HDFC Life in India and Heng An Standard Life in China.[22]
In the UK, Standard Life also owns three subsidiary businesses: Focus Solutions, a software and consultancy business, threesixty, a services provider and Vebnet, a software and services provider.[23]
Standard Life has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and has around 1.2 million individual shareholders.[24] It is also listed in a number of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), including the DJSI World, which ranks the world's leading sustainability-driven publicly listed companies.[25]
Senior management[edit]
The company’s board of directors is made up of a Chairman, four Executive Directors and seven non-Executive Directors.[26] The board has nine men and three women. Details of the Chairman and Executive Directors include:

Sir Gerry Grimstone (Chairman) appointed in May 2007
Keith Skeoch (Chief Executive) appointed on 5 August 2015, replacing David Nish
Luke Savage (Chief Financial Officer) appointed in August 2014
Colin Clark (Director, Global Client Group) appointed in November 2015
Barry O'Dwyer (CEO, Pensions and Savings) appointed in March 2017

The non-executive directors are:

Pierre Danon, appointed in October 2011
Noel Harwerth, appointed in July 2012
Lynne Peacock, appointed in April 2012
Martin Pike, appointed in September 2013
Kevin Parry, appointed in October 2014
Melanie Gee, appointed in November 2015
John Devine, appointed in July 2016

Controversy[edit]
In January 2006, Standard Life were accused of smearing a policy-holder, Michael Hogan, who was not happy with the way the company was being run. An e-mail sent to Standard Life executives and advisors (which was disclosed under the Data Protection Act) revealed an attempt to discredit him.[27]
In January 2007, the head of Standard Life's life and pensions business, Trevor Matthews, used the racist phrase "nigger in the woodpile" while giving a presentation at one of the company's Edinburgh offices. After issuing an apology, Mr Matthews remained in his job and no disciplinary action was taken.[28]
In March 2007 the company announced it would cut 1,000 jobs in an attempt to save an additional £100 million per year in costs.[29] One month later it was highlighted in the company's annual report that three of Standard Life's top executives (Sandy Crombie, Keith Skeoch and Trevor Matthews) were awarded more than £5 million in pay.[30] A Standard Life spokesman defended the awards, citing the leadership's efforts in turning round the company's fortunes.[30]
In February 2014, Standard Life announced that it may move parts of their operations outside Scotland in the event of Scottish independence, if it was necessary to do so.[31]
