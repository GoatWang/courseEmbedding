WITH DEEP SYMPATHY
ALAN V. LOWENSTEIN1913 - 2007 






Alan V. Lowenstein, NJ Institute of Social Justice Video
LOWENSTEIN SANDLER MOURNS THE LOSS OF ITS FOUNDER, ALAN V. LOWENSTEIN
Alan V. Lowenstein, one of New Jersey’s most prominent and revered attorneys, passed away Tuesday, May 8, 2007 at the age of 93. Mr. Lowenstein has been recognized for his professional excellence, leadership, integrity, and passion for the underprivileged. He set a standard of “meritocracy” for Lowenstein Sandler, one that welcomes lawyers of character and ability regardless of race or creed.“Alan Lowenstein’s vision and leadership helped to create the firm that we are today: one that embraces the ideals of professional excellence, commitment to its clients’ interests, civic duty and diversity,” said managing director Michael L. Rodburg. “While the practice of law and the firm’s leadership continue to evolve, the imprint of Alan’s ideals will forever guide us. He will be deeply missed,” said Rodburg.Mr. Lowenstein founded the firm in 1961 in Newark, New Jersey. Others in the founding group included Richard M. Sandler, Joseph LeVow Steinberg, Benedict M. Kohl and Arnold Fisher. For most of the past forty-six years, Mr. Lowenstein oversaw the firm’s expansion from five attorneys to more than 250, with offices in Roseland, New Jersey and New York City. Today, the firm has top-ranked corporate and litigation departments as well as several nationally ranked practices.During his 60 years of experience in banking and business law, Mr. Lowenstein represented institutions and corporations. After graduating Harvard Law School in 1936, he went to Washington, D.C. to work with William O. Douglas, who was then organizing the Temporary National Economic Committee, the predecessor of the Securities & Exchange Commission. In 1940, he returned to his roots in Newark to begin what became a life-long practice of law. Among his notable professional achievements, Mr. Lowenstein was the principal draftsman of the Banking Act of 1948 and Chair of the New Jersey Corporation Law Revision Commission (1963-1971). He was listed among The Best Lawyers in America, since its inception in 1983 until his retirement in 2001, as one of New Jersey’s top corporate law attorneys.Early on Mr. Lowenstein demonstrated a social conscience. In 1930, at age 16, Mr. Lowenstein boarded a train to North Carolina to report for The Newark Evening News the plight of textile mill workers who were seeking to organize under a labor union. Later he was a leader in Newark’s charter reform movement, helping to change the City’s governmental structure. Recognizing the need for cultural programs in his community, Mr. Lowenstein joined the Board of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra in 1960, and served as its president from 1970 to 1973. Under Mr. Lowenstein’s stewardship, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra was transformed from a suburban orchestra into one of the State’s cultural icons. In 1999, the Alan V. and Amy Lowenstein Foundation founded the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, an organization that works through the legislature and the courts to assure basic human needs, freedom from discrimination, equal educational opportunities, and equal access to all levels of the judicial system.Guided by, and in recognition of, his vision and leadership Lowenstein Sandler:

Founded the Alan V. Lowenstein Public Interest Fellowship at Essex-Newark Legal Services, reflecting the firm’s enthusiasm for the program and commitment to this enduring relationship with Legal Services. Through this Fellowship, attorneys represent indigent clients in a wide array of civil and criminal matters. 
Established (in honor of his 80th birthday) the Alan V. Lowenstein Scholarship for graduates of schools of social work who intend to serve as professionals of Jewish federations in the United States and Canada. 
Sustained a leadership role in providing pro bono legal services, and is the recognized leader among New Jersey law firms in providing these services to a wide array of institutions and individuals. 
Additional biographical informationMr. Lowenstein received many awards, including:

Recipient of the New Jersey State Bar Association’s Professionalism Award in 2002 
Recipient of the Professional Attorney of the Year Award for Essex County in 2001
The United Jewish Federation of MetroWest honored him by establishing the Alan V. Lowenstein Award to recognize pro bono professional services in 1996
Essex County Bar Association Pro Bono Achievement Award in 1994 
Debevoise-Eakeley Award for Contributions to Legal Services in 1988 
Recipient of New Jersey Institute of Technology Trustees’ Award for Distinguished Service in 1984
Mr. Lowenstein was also a published author. In May of 2001, he wrote “Alan V. Lowenstein: New Jersey Lawyer And Community Leader,” an autobiography that spans six decades of public and private service (published by Rutgers University Press and the New Jersey ICLE). He also completed the Rutgers Oral History Project: “Recording The Life And Work of Alan Lowenstein: A History Graduate Project.”Mr. Lowenstein received his LL.B. in 1936 from Harvard Law School. While attending law school, he received a Masters degree in Political Science from the University of Chicago in 1935. Mr. Lowenstein was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Michigan in 1933, where he receive an A.B. Mr. Lowenstein was born in Newark, New Jersey on August 30, 1913.

WITH DEEP SYMPATHY
ALAN V. LOWENSTEIN1913 - 2007 






Alan V. Lowenstein, NJ Institute of Social Justice Video
LOWENSTEIN SANDLER MOURNS THE LOSS OF ITS FOUNDER, ALAN V. LOWENSTEIN
Alan V. Lowenstein, one of New Jersey’s most prominent and revered attorneys, passed away Tuesday, May 8, 2007 at the age of 93. Mr. Lowenstein has been recognized for his professional excellence, leadership, integrity, and passion for the underprivileged. He set a standard of “meritocracy” for Lowenstein Sandler, one that welcomes lawyers of character and ability regardless of race or creed.“Alan Lowenstein’s vision and leadership helped to create the firm that we are today: one that embraces the ideals of professional excellence, commitment to its clients’ interests, civic duty and diversity,” said managing director Michael L. Rodburg. “While the practice of law and the firm’s leadership continue to evolve, the imprint of Alan’s ideals will forever guide us. He will be deeply missed,” said Rodburg.Mr. Lowenstein founded the firm in 1961 in Newark, New Jersey. Others in the founding group included Richard M. Sandler, Joseph LeVow Steinberg, Benedict M. Kohl and Arnold Fisher. For most of the past forty-six years, Mr. Lowenstein oversaw the firm’s expansion from five attorneys to more than 250, with offices in Roseland, New Jersey and New York City. Today, the firm has top-ranked corporate and litigation departments as well as several nationally ranked practices.During his 60 years of experience in banking and business law, Mr. Lowenstein represented institutions and corporations. After graduating Harvard Law School in 1936, he went to Washington, D.C. to work with William O. Douglas, who was then organizing the Temporary National Economic Committee, the predecessor of the Securities & Exchange Commission. In 1940, he returned to his roots in Newark to begin what became a life-long practice of law. Among his notable professional achievements, Mr. Lowenstein was the principal draftsman of the Banking Act of 1948 and Chair of the New Jersey Corporation Law Revision Commission (1963-1971). He was listed among The Best Lawyers in America, since its inception in 1983 until his retirement in 2001, as one of New Jersey’s top corporate law attorneys.Early on Mr. Lowenstein demonstrated a social conscience. In 1930, at age 16, Mr. Lowenstein boarded a train to North Carolina to report for The Newark Evening News the plight of textile mill workers who were seeking to organize under a labor union. Later he was a leader in Newark’s charter reform movement, helping to change the City’s governmental structure. Recognizing the need for cultural programs in his community, Mr. Lowenstein joined the Board of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra in 1960, and served as its president from 1970 to 1973. Under Mr. Lowenstein’s stewardship, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra was transformed from a suburban orchestra into one of the State’s cultural icons. In 1999, the Alan V. and Amy Lowenstein Foundation founded the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, an organization that works through the legislature and the courts to assure basic human needs, freedom from discrimination, equal educational opportunities, and equal access to all levels of the judicial system.Guided by, and in recognition of, his vision and leadership Lowenstein Sandler:

Founded the Alan V. Lowenstein Public Interest Fellowship at Essex-Newark Legal Services, reflecting the firm’s enthusiasm for the program and commitment to this enduring relationship with Legal Services. Through this Fellowship, attorneys represent indigent clients in a wide array of civil and criminal matters. 
Established (in honor of his 80th birthday) the Alan V. Lowenstein Scholarship for graduates of schools of social work who intend to serve as professionals of Jewish federations in the United States and Canada. 
Sustained a leadership role in providing pro bono legal services, and is the recognized leader among New Jersey law firms in providing these services to a wide array of institutions and individuals. 
Additional biographical informationMr. Lowenstein received many awards, including:

Recipient of the New Jersey State Bar Association’s Professionalism Award in 2002 
Recipient of the Professional Attorney of the Year Award for Essex County in 2001
The United Jewish Federation of MetroWest honored him by establishing the Alan V. Lowenstein Award to recognize pro bono professional services in 1996
Essex County Bar Association Pro Bono Achievement Award in 1994 
Debevoise-Eakeley Award for Contributions to Legal Services in 1988 
Recipient of New Jersey Institute of Technology Trustees’ Award for Distinguished Service in 1984
Mr. Lowenstein was also a published author. In May of 2001, he wrote “Alan V. Lowenstein: New Jersey Lawyer And Community Leader,” an autobiography that spans six decades of public and private service (published by Rutgers University Press and the New Jersey ICLE). He also completed the Rutgers Oral History Project: “Recording The Life And Work of Alan Lowenstein: A History Graduate Project.”Mr. Lowenstein received his LL.B. in 1936 from Harvard Law School. While attending law school, he received a Masters degree in Political Science from the University of Chicago in 1935. Mr. Lowenstein was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Michigan in 1933, where he receive an A.B. Mr. Lowenstein was born in Newark, New Jersey on August 30, 1913.

Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Loewenstein has no media or publications listed.Background Check n/a Malpractice Claims not availableHealthgrades does not collect malpractice information for Maryland.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Loewenstein's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Loewenstein's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices. A board-certified doctor is more likely than a non-board-certified doctor to have the most current skills and knowledge about how to treat your medical condition.Dr. Loewenstein is Board Certified in:PsychiatryAccrediting Board: American Board of Medical Specialties ** This information is proprietary data maintained in a copyrighted database compilation owned by the American Board of Medical Specialties.
