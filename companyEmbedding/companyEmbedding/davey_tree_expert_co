    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 05/30/2007
            

                BBB has determined that Davey Tree Expert Co. (The) meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means:

1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

1. Avoid involvement, by the business or its principles, in activities that reflect unfavorably on, or otherwise adversely affect the public image of BBB or its accredited businesses.












BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

 Commercial Tree Care 




 Davey's Commercial Grounds Maintenance professionals understand the importance of maximizing your property investment and maintaining an attractive and professional appearance. Our staff of agronomists, biologists, entomologists and plant pathologists are continually researching the most effective Plant Health Care technologies to ensure superior results. 





 Grounds Maintenance 




 Did you know that trees that are properly pruned live longer and retain a pleasing, natural appearance? Pruning encourages air circulation which reduces disease incidence and the possibility of damage from high winds. It also removes unhealthy or dangerous limbs that can easily fail in severe weather, and lets more sunlight reach your understory plants. While maintenance pruning of most shade trees can be done anytime, certain species should...





 Tree Pruning & Trimming




 In a wooded environment, trees and shrubs naturally thrive in the rich, organic forest soil. In our backyards, trees are forced to compete with our lawns and other plants, and we frequently remove fallen leaves, organic matter and other potential sources of nutrient recycling that would naturally have helped them thrive. Applying a slow-release fertilizer, such as Davey's patented Arbor Green PRO, is one of the most important things...





 Tree Fertilization with Arbor Green PRO




 Professional shrub pruning requires an arborist's ability to accommodate the plant's physiological needs with the desired aesthetic look. One common error is to concentrate solely on the shrub's exterior surface. Depriving the inner structure of sufficient light for photosynthesis can lead to "hollow shrub" syndrome and a much shorter lifespan. Natural pruning promotes healthy growth and dense foliage and provides an...

The Davey Tree Expert Company, also known as Davey Tree, is an American multinational employee-owned corporation that provides tree, utility, lawn care, and environmental consulting services in the green industry throughout the United States and Canada. It is the largest residential tree care company in North America and was founded in 1880 making it the first national tree care company.[2][3][4] John Davey, its founder, is considered the father of the science of tree surgery and arboriculture.[5][6][7] The company's core services include tree, utility services, large tree moving, commercial grounds management and consulting services. It has been employee owned since 1979 and is the largest employee-owned company in the state of Ohio and one of the top 20 largest in the United States.[8] Davey is organized in two segments, Residential and Commercial, and Utility.[9]
The Davey Tree headquarters are in Kent, Ohio and the company was incorporated on February 4, 1909.[10] John Davey was the President, and his son, Martin L. Davey, became the general manager and treasurer.[11] The company, along with its subsidiaries, provides a wide range of arboriculture, horticulture, and environmental and consulting services to private companies, public utilities, local, state, and federal agencies, and various industrial, commercial, and residential customers.[12][13] More than 8,000 people work for the company.[14]

History[edit]
In 1873, John Davey at age 27 traveled from Europe to America and began working at Standing Rock Cemetery in Kent, Ohio. He transformed the cemetery with new plantings of trees, shrubs and flowers.
Davey planted hundreds of trees along the Kent streets and around homes in the community and performed a modest amount of tree work. He became determined to gain acceptance of his methods for the care of trees, and wrote a book.[15]
In 1901, The Tree Doctor was published, a milestone in the career of John Davey and the science of tree preservation.[16]
By 1915, Davey Tree was growing and expanding; during the period from 1915 to 1920, the company expanded more than fivefold.[17] Today, the company has revenues of more than three-quarters of a billion USD.[18]
Employee Ownership[edit]
The Davey Tree Expert Company has been employee owned since 1979[19] and is the 15th largest employee-owned company in the U.S., according to data from the National Center for Employee Ownership.[20] (The 2015 Employee Ownership 100 list includes the nation’s largest companies that are at least 50 percent owned by an employee stock ownership plan or other broad-based employee ownership plan.[21]) The recent list also names Davey as the largest employee-owned company in Ohio.
Environment[edit]
In 2013, Davey Tree published its first corporate social responsibility report in which its chief executive officer, Karl Warnke, states "We are dedicated to being responsible corporate citizens to ensure today’s business practices are not detriments to tomorrow’s landscape. As environmental stewards, we must be accountable for our actions each day."[22] According to data from the report, the company achieved a 95-percent wood waste recycling rate. It also reduced its water use and electricity use, as well as moved its fleet to energy efficient vehicles and GPS monitoring.
The company has been involved in many projects to help care for the environment with initiatives such as i-Tree,[23] software created by Davey and the USDA Forest Service used to quantify the benefit of trees,[24] as well as helping the National Park Service care for the trees at the Flight 93 National Memorial.[25]
Additionally, the company’s emergency storm response crews assist and help clean up from natural disasters, such as Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina.[26][27]
Divisions[edit]
Davey operates in two segments, Residential and Commercial, and Utility. It also maintains research, technical support, and laboratory diagnostic facilities.[28]
The Residential and Commercial segment is involved in the treatment, preservation, maintenance, removal, and planting of trees, shrubs, and other plant life. The segment’s services also include landscaping, grounds maintenance, tree surgery, as well as the application of fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides.[29]
The Utility Services segment engages vegetation management around power lines, rights-of-way, and chemical brush control services; and natural resource management and consulting, forestry research and development, and environmental planning services.[30]
Research and Development[edit]
John Davey was committed to improving the technology and tools needed to advance tree care research. His passion for scientific study led him to develop the Davey Institute of Tree Surgery in 1908.[31] The training facility was staffed by experts and also provided employees with the skills and tools needed to advance tree science. Today, the company still provides basic tree science as the educational foundation for its employees.[32]
Scientists and technical advisors at The Davey Institute guide field service teams in diagnosing and prescribing products, application procedure, and pest and disease cultural practices.[33] The company also assists college students in the green industry through its Arbor Day Grants.[34]
Davey Tree also partners with organizations to advance tree-care science and provide community outreach programs promoting tree maintenance, such as American Forests, International Society of Arboriculture, Tree Care Industry Association, and TREE Fund through programs like the National Register of Big Trees and fundraisers like Tour des Trees.[35][36]

Professional Tree Removal  | Davey Tree






































































Tree Removal 
Every tree is either an asset or liability. When a professional tree risk assessment uncovers a potential issue – perhaps the tree is damaged or diseased beyond repair – tree removal may be required.

Every tree is either an asset or liability. When a professional tree risk assessment uncovers a potential issue – perhaps the tree is damaged or diseased beyond repair – tree removal may be required.
A professional arborist can work with you to safely and efficiently remove your tree. Many tree removals are complex and mistakes are costly – make sure the arborist you choose is qualified.
Here are a few questions to ask when looking for tree removal services:

Are they a TCIA (Tree Care Industry Association) accredited company?
Do they have ISA Certified Arborists on staff?
Are they insured?
Can they explain how they plan to remove the tree? Do they plan to climb it?

Find your local tree removal service near you or browse our arborist advice area for great tree service care tips.

The Davey Tree Expert Company, also known as Davey Tree, is an American multinational employee-owned corporation that provides tree, utility, lawn care, and environmental consulting services in the green industry throughout the United States and Canada. It is the largest residential tree care company in North America and was founded in 1880 making it the first national tree care company.[2][3][4] John Davey, its founder, is considered the father of the science of tree surgery and arboriculture.[5][6][7] The company's core services include tree, utility services, large tree moving, commercial grounds management and consulting services. It has been employee owned since 1979 and is the largest employee-owned company in the state of Ohio and one of the top 20 largest in the United States.[8] Davey is organized in two segments, Residential and Commercial, and Utility.[9]
The Davey Tree headquarters are in Kent, Ohio and the company was incorporated on February 4, 1909.[10] John Davey was the President, and his son, Martin L. Davey, became the general manager and treasurer.[11] The company, along with its subsidiaries, provides a wide range of arboriculture, horticulture, and environmental and consulting services to private companies, public utilities, local, state, and federal agencies, and various industrial, commercial, and residential customers.[12][13] More than 8,000 people work for the company.[14]

History[edit]
In 1873, John Davey at age 27 traveled from Europe to America and began working at Standing Rock Cemetery in Kent, Ohio. He transformed the cemetery with new plantings of trees, shrubs and flowers.
Davey planted hundreds of trees along the Kent streets and around homes in the community and performed a modest amount of tree work. He became determined to gain acceptance of his methods for the care of trees, and wrote a book.[15]
In 1901, The Tree Doctor was published, a milestone in the career of John Davey and the science of tree preservation.[16]
By 1915, Davey Tree was growing and expanding; during the period from 1915 to 1920, the company expanded more than fivefold.[17] Today, the company has revenues of more than three-quarters of a billion USD.[18]
Employee Ownership[edit]
The Davey Tree Expert Company has been employee owned since 1979[19] and is the 15th largest employee-owned company in the U.S., according to data from the National Center for Employee Ownership.[20] (The 2015 Employee Ownership 100 list includes the nation’s largest companies that are at least 50 percent owned by an employee stock ownership plan or other broad-based employee ownership plan.[21]) The recent list also names Davey as the largest employee-owned company in Ohio.
Environment[edit]
In 2013, Davey Tree published its first corporate social responsibility report in which its chief executive officer, Karl Warnke, states "We are dedicated to being responsible corporate citizens to ensure today’s business practices are not detriments to tomorrow’s landscape. As environmental stewards, we must be accountable for our actions each day."[22] According to data from the report, the company achieved a 95-percent wood waste recycling rate. It also reduced its water use and electricity use, as well as moved its fleet to energy efficient vehicles and GPS monitoring.
The company has been involved in many projects to help care for the environment with initiatives such as i-Tree,[23] software created by Davey and the USDA Forest Service used to quantify the benefit of trees,[24] as well as helping the National Park Service care for the trees at the Flight 93 National Memorial.[25]
Additionally, the company’s emergency storm response crews assist and help clean up from natural disasters, such as Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina.[26][27]
Divisions[edit]
Davey operates in two segments, Residential and Commercial, and Utility. It also maintains research, technical support, and laboratory diagnostic facilities.[28]
The Residential and Commercial segment is involved in the treatment, preservation, maintenance, removal, and planting of trees, shrubs, and other plant life. The segment’s services also include landscaping, grounds maintenance, tree surgery, as well as the application of fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides.[29]
The Utility Services segment engages vegetation management around power lines, rights-of-way, and chemical brush control services; and natural resource management and consulting, forestry research and development, and environmental planning services.[30]
Research and Development[edit]
John Davey was committed to improving the technology and tools needed to advance tree care research. His passion for scientific study led him to develop the Davey Institute of Tree Surgery in 1908.[31] The training facility was staffed by experts and also provided employees with the skills and tools needed to advance tree science. Today, the company still provides basic tree science as the educational foundation for its employees.[32]
Scientists and technical advisors at The Davey Institute guide field service teams in diagnosing and prescribing products, application procedure, and pest and disease cultural practices.[33] The company also assists college students in the green industry through its Arbor Day Grants.[34]
Davey Tree also partners with organizations to advance tree-care science and provide community outreach programs promoting tree maintenance, such as American Forests, International Society of Arboriculture, Tree Care Industry Association, and TREE Fund through programs like the National Register of Big Trees and fundraisers like Tour des Trees.[35][36]

Tree Removal



Damage, disease or safety concerns can turn some trees from an asset into a liability. When this occurs, Davey’s certified and bonded arborists can be trusted for safe and efficient tree removal service in Menlo Park.
Look for these signs as an indicator it may be time to remove:

Heaving soil at the base of the trunk and beneath the canopy
Decay-producing fungi, such as mushrooms, growing at the base of the trunk
Chipped or peeling bark and cracks in the trunk
Cavities in the trunk or large scaffold branches
Dead or hanging branches in the upper crown

Davey assesses your tree’s trimming needs from removal of unhealthy limbs to disease reduction. Contact your local Davey arborist today for a free consultation for tree trimming services in Menlo Park, CA. 
These signs can indicate when it’s time for professional tree trimming:

Your tree appears too close to power lines

You would like your tree shaped for a more aesthetic curb appeal

Sudden Oak Death Treatments 



Primarily in California and Oregon, Sudden Oak Death attacks tanoak and oak trees. Look for dead sections of bark on your tree’s trunk or branches, known as cankers, or spots on the leaves. The only way to confirm Sudden Oak Death is to get it tested and treated by a certified arborist.  
Our arborists have been successfully treating sudden oak death for years. Once a case of Sudden Oak Death is confirmed, we will immediately work to create a personalized treatment solution that will work best for your tree. 








Tree Pest & Disease Management 


Our arborists live and work in the Menlo Park area. They know what tree pest infestations and diseases are most common and when they are most likely to occur. Always contact a certified local arborist if you suspect a tree of showing signs of tree pest infestation or disease. Some common ones to look out for in the area include:
 






Aphids
Although aphids are fragile insects, they are not harmless, and can damage your trees and landscape plants.

Lace Bugs
Large populations of lace bugs cause premature leaf drop and weaken plants by removing nutrients from their leaves.

Comprehensive Tree Services in Menlo Park
Our experienced arborists are TCIA Accredited, fully bonded and insured, and provide comprehensive tree services in the Menlo Park, California area that are customized to meet your property needs and goals. 

Tree Services 


Tree Removal



Damage, disease or safety concerns can turn some trees from an asset into a liability. When this occurs, Davey’s certified and bonded arborists can be trusted for safe and efficient tree removal service in Menlo Park.
Look for these signs as an indicator it may be time to remove:

Heaving soil at the base of the trunk and beneath the canopy
Decay-producing fungi, such as mushrooms, growing at the base of the trunk
Chipped or peeling bark and cracks in the trunk
Cavities in the trunk or large scaffold branches
Dead or hanging branches in the upper crown
Fine twigs without living buds near the ends of branches

 





Tree Trimming 



Tree trimming service is an important tool to help sustain a tree’s health and retain its natural appearance. Davey assesses your tree’s trimming needs from removal of unhealthy limbs to disease reduction. Contact your local Davey arborist today for a free consultation for tree trimming services in Menlo Park, CA. 
These signs can indicate when it’s time for professional tree trimming:

Your tree appears too close to power lines
Branches are close or are touching your home
You see dead, unsightly or loose hanging branches
Your trees have not been trimmed or pruned in the last three years
You would like your tree shaped for a more aesthetic curb appeal






Complete Plant Health Care 



PHC is the best solution for maintaining your property’s trees over the long haul; it’s total health care for your trees. Our PHC program is designed for clients who are looking to save time, money and frustration by being proactive in the health of their trees and landscape.
Some of our plant health care solutions include:

Air spade instruments to relieve soil compaction
Soil remediation techniques
Supplemental nutrition
Supplemental irrigation
As well as other tree remediation tools

Contact your local Davey office for more information on how your property goals can benefit from a personalized PHC program.





Sudden Oak Death Treatments 



Primarily in California and Oregon, Sudden Oak Death attacks tanoak and oak trees. Look for dead sections of bark on your tree’s trunk or branches, known as cankers, or spots on the leaves. The only way to confirm Sudden Oak Death is to get it tested and treated by a certified arborist.  
Our arborists have been successfully treating sudden oak death for years. Once a case of Sudden Oak Death is confirmed, we will immediately work to create a personalized treatment solution that will work best for your tree. 








Tree Pest & Disease Management 


Our arborists live and work in the Menlo Park area. They know what tree pest infestations and diseases are most common and when they are most likely to occur. Always contact a certified local arborist if you suspect a tree of showing signs of tree pest infestation or disease. Some common ones to look out for in the area include:
 






Aphids
Although aphids are fragile insects, they are not harmless, and can damage your trees and landscape plants.
Read More





Lace Bugs
Large populations of lace bugs cause premature leaf drop and weaken plants by removing nutrients from their leaves.
Read More





California Oakworm
The young larvae skeletonize the leaves while the more mature larvae eat the entire leaf.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

The trusted choice for tree care services in East Bay, CA
Our certified arborists offer a complete suite of the tree care services in the East Bay area. Whether it’s subsurface watering because of a drought, a tree removal, or just some maintenance trimming, our East Bay tree specialists are here to care for your property.

Tree Services 


Tree Removal



Damage, disease or safety concerns can turn some trees from an asset into a liability. When this occurs, Davey’s certified and bonded arborists can be trusted for safe and efficient tree removal service in the East Bay area.
Look for these signs as an indicator it may be time to remove:

Heaving soil at the base of the trunk and beneath the canopy
Decay-producing fungi, such as mushrooms, growing at the base of the trunk
Chipped or peeling bark and cracks in the trunk
Cavities in the trunk or large scaffold branches
Dead or hanging branches in the upper crown
Fine twigs without living buds near the ends of branches






Tree Trimming



Tree trimming service is an important tool to help sustain a tree’s health and retain its natural appearance. Davey assesses your tree’s trimming needs from removal of unhealthy limbs to disease reduction. Contact your local Davey arborist today for a free consultation for tree trimming services in East Bay, CA. 
These signs can indicate when it’s time for professional tree trimming:

Your tree appears too close to power lines
Branches are close or are touching your home
You see dead, unsightly or loose hanging branches
Your trees have not been trimmed or pruned in the last three years
You would like your tree shaped for a more aesthetic curb appeal






Complete Plant Health Care



PHC is the best solution for maintaining your property’s trees over the long haul; it’s total health care for your trees. Our PHC program is designed for clients who are looking to save time, money and frustration by being proactive in the health of their trees and landscape.
Some of our plant health care solutions include:

Contact your local East Bay arborist for more information on what PHC services will help your trees and landscape thrive.





Subsurface Watering



Our subsurface watering program is designed to improve soil moisture around your trees and shrubs. An injection probe distributes water directly into the root zone, hydrating drought-stressed trees. This technique has proven critical in saving trees and shrubs in drought susceptible areas such as California.  








Tree Insect & Disease Management 


When your once green and lush trees become brown and rotted, it can be alarming. Be on the lookout for these common tree pests and diseases in East Bay and call your local arborist if you’ve encountered one.






Aphids
Also known as plant lice, these insects feed off deciduous trees’ leaves.

Lace Bugs
Infested leaves will have a whitish flecked damage called stippling.
