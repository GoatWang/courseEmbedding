2016 Top Solar Inverter Products

































































































Solar Power World
2016 Top Solar Inverter Products

 
 
What follows are the Top Solar Inverter Products for 2016. Integration is evident within electrical design, and you’ll see power optimzers, microinverters and larger power converters on this list. Take a look at this year’s innovative products within inverters. 
 
 
 
 

Power Optimizers
Alencon Systems SPOT – String Power Optimizer
Alencon’s SPOT will allow you to generate anywhere from 5 to 10% more energy from an existing PV plant by offering more granular maximum power point tracking (MPPT), voltage step-up to minimize conduction losses and fixed voltage to the inverter to improve DC to AC power conversion efficiency.
 
 
Tigo TS4 Power Optimizer
TS4 offers flexibility, allowing installers to pick five levels of functionality: diodes, monitoring, safety, optimization and long strings.

Microinverters
 
APsystems YC500i Microinverter
APsystems offers the YC500i microinverter with EnergyMax power handling, trunk cable and integrated ground. EnergyMax technology allows the dual-module unit to produce 274-Wp output per side (548 W total), an almost 10% increase in peak output over conventional microinverters, to handle the power of today’s high-output PV modules.
 
 
CyboEnergy On/Off-Grid Solar Mini-Inverter
The On/Off-Grid CyboInverter has an on-grid output and an off-grid output port.  Each inverter has four input channels that can connect to solar, wind or battery and produce 1.2 kW AC power. Each channel has its own MPPT to eliminate partial shading. When the grid is down, it will switch to off-grid mode to power critical loads.
 
 
Darfon America Corp. G320 Microinverter
Many of the microinverters on the market today are having trouble supporting new PV modules. Due to the higher power output of new modules, microinverters clip excess power so you lose energy at peak power production. Darfon’s G320 microinverter supports high-powered 60- or 72-cell modules with an output of 350 W.
 
 
Enphase Energy M250 Microinverter
The versatile Enphase M250 Microinverter performs in both residential and commercial solar PV installations and is compatible with both 60-cell and 72-cell modules. With its all-AC approach and integrated grounding, the M250 delivers increased energy harvest and reduces design and installation complexity.
 
 
KACO new energy blueplanet Ultraverter
The Ultraverter is packaged with only three separate SKUs, while competitor products often require larger numbers of different sizes and components, a common cause of high inventory levels. Eliminating costly proprietary balance of system components, KACO’s Ultraverter is customized for compatibility with the most accessible, user-friendly and cost effective components in PV design.
 
Magnum Energy by Sensata Technologies MicroGT 500 Microinverter
The MicroGT is optimized to communicate with a Magnum battery-based inverter system, allowing the addition of battery storage. Each unit supports two 310-W modules per inverter, reducing installation time, and are UL1741 and NEC690.12 compliant. The integrated MagWeb GT online dashboard makes viewing system data easy.
 
 

String Inverters
 
Delta Products Corp. M80U, 3PH 80kW UL String Inverter
With best-in-class 98.8% efficiency, Delta’s M80U is the industry’s only 80-kW inverter with an optimal cost and performance profile. Complete with a ruggedized NEMA4X enclosure and designed for ease-of-installation-and-serviceability, the M80U offers the industry’s lowest LCOE making it the optimal building block for Commercial, industrial and utility scale installations.
 
Ginlong (Ningbo) Technologies Solis-1P(6-10K)-4G-Us
Founded in 2005, Ginlong Technologies manufactures the award winning Solis brand of PV string inverters. The Solis-1P(6-10K)-4G-US product family features industry-leading 3 and 4 MPPT designs and high frequency switching technology to maximize the production, offer great design flexibility with proven reliability and deliver significant long-term ROI for solar stakeholders.
 
Growatt 33000/36000/40000 TL3-US
Growatt’s inverters provide excellent performance, high reliability and a flexible design. Features include 1,000-Vdc input special for large-scale plants, string level monitoring and the ability to place 50 units in parallel per transformer.
 
 
HiQ Solar TrueString Inverter
This NEMA6 three-phase string inverter is a rugged problem-solver. Have a difficult roof layout? Unequal strings are no problem. Harsh conditions? It’s sealed and ready. A retrofit with no mounting space, or a carport with difficult aesthetic restrictions? Tuck it under the array out of sight. Try the award winning 480-V, or new 208-V model.
 
 
Ideal Power SunDial String Inverter
Ideal Power’s SunDial is the first commercial three-phase PV string inverter that is field upgradeable to solar+storage. The optional bi-directional DC port enables “plug-and-play” solar+storage rather than installing a second converter, which would also need additional wiring, mounting, interconnection etc.— all at extra cost.
 
 
Pika Energy Pika Islanding String Inverter X7601
The Pika Islanding inverter is a U.S.-made, battery-ready 7.6-kW grid-tied inverter with islanding performance. As part of the Pika Energy Island, the Pika Islanding inverter offers a simple, single-inverter approach to using smart batteries with solar. The X7601 is listed to UL 1741 and available now.
 
 
SMA America Sunny Boy Series of String Inverters 
Contractors today seek cost-effective, simple solutions that maximize time and deliver high performance. The newest Sunny Boy-US series with Secure Power Supply is the next generation in PV technology. Simple, flexible design and streamlined installation means systems are up and running faster than ever without sacrificing performance, security or reliability.
 
Sungrow SG125HV String Inverter
The SG125HV is a 1,500-Vdc inverter with an output of 125 kW, the highest for any string inverter in the world. Features include: 99% efficiency, 1.5 DC:AC Ratio, UL 1741 and Rule 21 ready, cabinet weighs just 143 lb. The SG125HV’s high output and efficiency makes it ideal for commercial and utility-scale solar projects.
 
 
Yaskawa – Solectria Solar PVI 50/60TL String Inverter
The PVI 50/60TL is equipped with three MPPTs (five inputs per MPPT) and allow for 1.5 DC/AC ratio. These two differentiators alone allow greater design flexibility enabling contractors to utilize varying array orientations, tilt angles, azimuth, string lengths and modules, therefore increasing a system’s production output (and ROI) and decreasing the number of inverters needed.
 

Central Inverters
 
Eaton Power Xpert Solar inverters
Eaton’s 2,000-kW and 2,200-kW Power Xpert Solar inverters provide contractors with some of the highest power ratings for cost effective grid-tied, utility-scale projects. The Eaton inverters yield best in class levelized cost of energy, have an industry-leading 98.5% efficiency, and are tested to meet the UL 1741 standard.
 
 
Ingeteam IS PowerMax B Series Central Inverter
Ingeteam’s PV central inverters are able to supply up to a maximum power of 1,637 kVA in a single unit, making its power density more than 5.34W/in3. This UL174- compliant 1,500-Vdc inverter is totally bankable, as it has been proved on the Black & Veatch’s Bankability and Reliability report.
 
 
Schneider Electric Conext SmartGen Central Inverter


 
volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, higher interest rates, higher loan costs, less desirable loan terms and a reduction in the availability of mortgage loans, all of which could increase costs
and could limit our ability to acquire additional real estate assets;   


 

 
continued high levels of, or increases in, unemployment and general slowdowns in commercial activity;   


 

 
the issuers leverage and ability to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness;   


 



 
the issuers ability to generate a sufficient amount of cash from operations to satisfy working capital requirements and to service their existing and future indebtedness; 
 


 

 
the issuers ability to achieve improvements in operating efficiency;   


 

 
foreign currency fluctuations;   


 

 
adverse changes in the securities markets;   


 

 
the issuers ability to retain their senior management and attract and retain qualified and experienced employees;   


 

 
the issuers ability to retain major clients and renew related contracts;   


 

 
trends in use of large, full-service commercial real estate providers;   


 

 
changes in tax laws in the United States, Europe or Japan that reduce or eliminate deductions or other tax benefits the issuers receive; 
 


 

 
future acquisitions may not be available at favorable prices or upon advantageous terms and conditions; and

costs relating to the acquisition of assets the issuers may acquire could be higher than anticipated.

 The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is calculated by dividing earnings, as defined, by fixed charges, as
defined. For this purpose, earnings consist of pretax income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interest and equity in income of joint ventures plus operating distributions from equity investees, and fixed
charges consists of interest expense, whether capitalized or expensed, amortization related to indebtedness and premiums or discounts of stock issuances and an estimate of interest expense within rental expense. For the year ended December 31,
2011, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges, and the deficiency of earnings was $6.5 million. 
The ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends is calculated by dividing earnings, as defined, by fixed
charges, as defined. For this purpose, earnings and fixed charges have the respective meanings assigned above. Preferred stock dividends refers to preferred dividend requirements of consolidated subsidiaries.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, and the deficiency of earnings was $15.3 million.

Table of Contents
DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us, our
or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation authorizes the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001. As of October 30, 2016, 113,318,152 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. Holders of common stock have exclusive voting rights for the
election of our directors and all other matters requiring stockholder action, except with respect to amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that alter or change the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of any
outstanding preferred stock if the holders of such affected series of preferred stock are entitled to vote on such an amendment. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters to be voted on by stockholders and also are
entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors in its discretion out of funds legally available therefor. The payment of dividends, if ever, on the common stock will be subject to (i) the
prior payment of dividends on any outstanding shares of preferred stock, and (ii) compliance with any applicable limitation in our debt agreements, including debt securities issued pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus supplement. Our
common stock has no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions applicable to the common stock. 
Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors
being elected in each year. A plurality of the votes cast at a stockholders meeting is sufficient to elect any director into office. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us, our
or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  General. Our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation provides that we may issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share, or preferred stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that shares of preferred stock may be
issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors is authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, the designations, powers, and preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications,
limitations and restrictions, applicable to the shares of each series of preferred stock. Our board of directors is able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting
power and other rights of the holders of the common stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
change of control or the removal of existing management by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of the company or remove existing management. As of October 30, 2016, 32,550 shares of our series B
preferred stock were issued and outstanding. Other than the series B preferred stock, no shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding. 
The specific terms of a particular class or series of preferred stock will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to that class or
series, including a prospectus supplement providing that preferred stock may be issuable upon the exercise of warrants, or upon the conversion of any debt securities, that we issue pursuant to this prospectus. The description of preferred stock set
forth below and the description of the terms of a particular class or series of preferred stock set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the articles
supplementary relating to that class or series.  The preferences and other terms of the preferred stock of each class or series will be
fixed by the certificate of designation relating to such class or series. A prospectus supplement, relating to each class or series, will specify the terms of the preferred stock as follows: 
 


 

 
the title and stated value of such preferred stock;   


 

 
the number of shares of such preferred stock offered, the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of such preferred stock; 
 


 

 
the dividend rate(s), period(s), and/or payment date(s) or method(s) of calculation thereof applicable to such preferred stock;   


 

 
whether such preferred stock is cumulative or not and, if cumulative, the date from which dividends on such preferred stock shall accumulate; 
 


 

 
the provision for a sinking fund, if any, for such preferred stock;   


 

 
the provision for redemption, if applicable, of such preferred stock;   


 

 
any listing of such preferred stock on any securities exchange;   


 


Rank. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the preferred stock will, with respect to dividend
rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, rank: (i) senior to all classes or series of our common stock, and to any other class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking junior to the preferred
stock; (ii) on parity with any class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking on parity with the preferred stock; and (iii) junior to any other class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the preferred stock.
 Conversion Rights. The terms and conditions, if any, upon which any shares of any class or series of preferred stock are
convertible into our common stock will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement relating thereto. Such terms will include the number of shares of our common stock into which the shares of preferred stock are convertible, the conversion
price (or manner of calculation thereof), the conversion period, provisions as to whether conversion will be at the option of the holders of such class or series of preferred stock, the events requiring an adjustment of the conversion price and
provisions affecting conversion in the event of the redemption of such class or series of preferred stock.  Power to Increase
Authorized Stock and Issue Additional Shares of Our Preferred Stock. The number of authorized shares of preferred stock may be increased by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding
shares of the capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is
required pursuant to the resolutions adopted by the board of directors for such series. Our board of directors has the power to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of
our preferred stock and thereafter to cause us to issue such classified or reclassified shares of stock. Although our board of directors does not intend to do so, it could authorize us to issue a class or series that could, depending upon the terms
of the particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in their best interest. 
Dividend Limitations. The payment of dividends, if ever, on the preferred stock will be subject to compliance with any
applicable limitations in our debt agreements, including debt securities issued pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus supplement.  6.452%
Convertible Series B Preferred Stock  General. Our board of directors and a duly authorized committee thereof approved
the certificate of designation, a copy of which we have previously filed with the SEC and which we incorporate by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, creating the series B preferred stock as a
class of our preferred stock, designated as the 6.452% convertible series B preferred stock. The outstanding series B preferred stock is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 
Ranking. The series B preferred stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up:   


 

 
senior to all classes or series of our common stock, and to any other class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking junior to the series B preferred stock; 
 


 

 
on parity with any class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking on parity with the series B preferred stock; and 
  13

junior to any other class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the series B preferred stock. 
Dividend Rate and Payment Date. Investors are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends on the series B preferred stock from
and including the date of original issue, payable quarterly in arrears on or about the last calendar day of January, April, July and October of each year, commencing September 30, 2010, at the rate of 6.452% per annum of the $1,000.00 liquidation
preference per share. Dividends on the series B preferred stock will accrue whether or not we have earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends. Our debt agreements, including debt securities issued
pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus supplement, may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends on our preferred stock. 
Liquidation Preference. If we liquidate, dissolve or wind-up, holders of the series B preferred stock will have the right to
receive $1,000.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) up to and including the date of payment, before any payment is made to holders of our common stock and any other class or series of stock ranking
junior to the series B preferred stock as to liquidation rights. The rights of holders of series B preferred stock to receive their liquidation preference will be subject to the proportionate rights of any other class or series of our stock ranking
on parity with the series B preferred stock as to liquidation.  Optional Conversion and Mandatory Conversion. Prior to
November 3, 2018, each share of series B preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holder at any time, into approximately 103 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustments under certain circumstances, or the series B conversion rate.
At any time on or after May 3, 2017 and prior to November 3, 2018, we have the option to convert all or part of the outstanding shares of series B preferred stock into shares of common stock at the series B conversion rate. On November 3, 2018, each
outstanding share of series B preferred stock will automatically be converted into shares of our common stock at the series B conversion rate. 
Voting Rights. Holders of series B preferred stock generally have no voting rights. However, if we are in arrears on dividends
on the series B preferred stock for three or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of the series B preferred stock (voting together as a class with the holders of all other classes or series of parity preferred stock upon which
like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to vote at our next annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders for the election of two additional directors to serve on our board of directors until all unpaid
dividends and the dividend for the then-current period with respect to the series B preferred stock and any other class or series of parity preferred stock have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for
payment. In addition, we may not make certain material and adverse changes to the terms of the series B preferred stock without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of series B preferred stock and the
holders of all other shares of any class or series ranking on parity with the series B preferred stock that are entitled to similar voting rights (voting together as a single class). 
Transfer Agent and Registrar. The transfer agent and registrar for our series B preferred stock is Continental Stock Transfer

Table of Contents


 

 
immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing. 
Notwithstanding the above, any subsidiaries of the applicable issuer may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties to the applicable issuer.  Events of Default 
Event of Default means, with respect to any series of new debt securities, any of the following: 
 


 

 
a default in the payment of any interest upon any new debt security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days (unless the entire amount of the payment is
deposited by the applicable issuer with the trustee or with a paying agent prior to the expiration of the 30-day period);   


 

 
a default in the payment of principal of any security of that series at its maturity;   


 

 
a default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, if, when and as due by the terms of the new debt securities of that series, and the continuance of such default for a period of 60 days; 
 


 

 
a default in the performance or breach of any other covenant or warranty by the applicable issuer (or, in the case the new debt securities of that series are subject to a guarantee, the guarantor of such guarantee) in
the applicable base indenture (other than a covenant or warranty that has been included in the applicable base indenture solely for the benefit of a series of new debt securities other than that series), which default continues uncured for a period
of 60 days after the applicable issuer receives written notice from the trustee or the applicable issuer and the trustee receive written notice from the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that
series as provided in the applicable base indenture;   


 

 
if the new debt securities of such series are subject to a guarantee of a guarantor, such guarantee shall for any reason cease to be, or shall for any reason be asserted in writing by such guarantor or the applicable
issuer not to be, in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent contemplated or permitted by the applicable base indenture or the terms of the new debt securities of that series; 
 


 

 
certain voluntary or involuntary events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the applicable issuer; and   


 

 
any other Event of Default provided with respect to new debt securities of that series that is described in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
No Event of Default with respect to a particular series of new debt securities (except as to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization) necessarily constitutes an Event of Default with respect to any other series of new debt securities. The occurrence of certain Events of Default or an acceleration under the applicable base indenture may constitute an event of
default under certain other indebtedness of the applicable issuer or its subsidiaries outstanding from time to time.  If an Event of
Default with respect to new debt securities of any series at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that series may, by a
notice in writing to the applicable issuer (and to the trustee if given by the holders), declare to be due and payable immediately the principal of (or, if the new debt securities of that series are discount securities, that portion of the principal
amount as may be specified in the terms of that series), and any premium and accrued and unpaid interest on, all new debt securities of that series. In the case of an Event of Default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, the principal (or such specified amount) of, and any premium and accrued and unpaid interest on, all outstanding new debt securities of the 
  21 


Table of Contents

applicable series will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder of outstanding new debt securities. At any time
after a declaration of acceleration with respect to new debt securities of any series has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding new debt securities of that series may rescind and annul the acceleration if all Events of Default (other than the non-payment of accelerated principal, premium and interest, if any, with respect to new debt securities of that series)
have been cured or waived as provided in the applicable base indenture. You are referred to the prospectus supplement relating to any series of new debt securities that are discount securities for the particular provisions relating to acceleration
of a portion of the principal amount of such discount securities upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.  The applicable base
indenture will provide that the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable base indenture unless the trustee receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any cost, liability or expense which
might be incurred by it in exercising such right of power. Subject to certain rights of the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of any series will have the right to direct the time, method
and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee with respect to the new debt securities of that series. 
No holder of any new debt security of any series will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the
applicable base indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy under the applicable base indenture, unless:   


 

 
that holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to new debt securities of that series; and 
 


 

 
the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that series have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity or security, to the trustee to institute the
proceeding as trustee, and the trustee has (x) not received from the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that series a direction inconsistent with that request and (y) failed to institute
the proceeding within 60 days.  Notwithstanding any other provision in the applicable base indenture, the holder of any new
debt security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of, and any premium and interest on, that new debt security on or after the due dates expressed in that new debt security and to institute suit for the
enforcement of payment.  The applicable base indenture will require the applicable issuer to, within 120 days after the end of its fiscal
year, furnish to the trustee a statement as to compliance with the applicable base indenture. If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the securities of any series and is known to a responsible officer of the
trustee, then the trustee must mail to each holder of the securities of that series notice of a Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. The applicable base indenture will provide that the trustee may withhold notice to the
holders of new debt securities of any series of any Default or Event of Default (except in payment on any new debt securities of that series) with respect to new debt securities of that series if the trustee determines in good faith that withholding
notice is in the interest of the holders of those new debt securities.  Modification and Waiver 
The applicable issuer, the applicable guarantors, if any, and the trustee may modify and amend the applicable base indenture or the new debt
securities of any series without the consent of any holder of any new debt security:   


 

 
to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

Defeasance of New Debt Securities and Certain Covenants in Certain Circumstances
 Legal Defeasance. The applicable base indenture will provide that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the
applicable series of new debt securities, the applicable issuer and the guarantors, if any, will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness on all the outstanding new debt securities of any series on the 123rd day after the date
of the deposit referred to below, and the provisions of the applicable base indenture, as it relates to such outstanding new debt securities of such series, will no longer be in effect, except as to certain specified rights, powers, immunities and
provisions. In order to effect such legal defeasance, the following conditions, among others, must be satisfied:   


 

 
subject to certain rights of the applicable issuer and guarantors, if any, the applicable issuer or, if applicable, any guarantor(s), must deposit, or cause to be irrevocably deposited, with the trustee money or U.S.
government obligations or, in the case of new debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest
and principal in accordance with their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank, to pay and discharge each installment of principal of,
premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of all the new debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the applicable base indenture and those new debt
securities; and   


 

 
such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the applicable base indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the applicable issuer is a party or by which it is
bound;   


 

 
no default or Event of Default with respect to the new debt securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or during the period ending on the 123rd day after such date; and
  


 

 
the applicable issuer or guarantor(s) must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that the applicable issuer or guarantor(s), as applicable, have received from, or there has been published by, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service a ruling or, since the date of execution of the applicable base indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall
confirm that, the holders of the new debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and discharge and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit, defeasance and discharge had not occurred. 
Defeasance of Certain Covenants. The applicable base indenture will provide that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the
applicable series of new debt securities, upon compliance with certain conditions:   


 

 
the applicable issuer and, if applicable, may omit to comply with the covenant described under the heading Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets and certain other covenants set forth in the applicable
base indenture, as well as any additional covenants which may be described in the applicable prospectus supplement; and   


 

 
any omission to comply with those covenants, or with certain other Events of Default, will not constitute a default or an Event of Default with respect to the new debt securities of that series (covenant
defeasance).  The conditions include the following, among others: 
 


 

 
 subject to certain rights of the applicable issuer and guarantors, if any, the applicable issuer or, if
applicable, any guarantor(s), must deposit, or cause to be irrevocably deposited, with the trustee money or U.S. government obligations or, in the case of new debt securities denominated in a single currency

  25 


Table of Contents


 
 
other than U.S. Dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest and principal in accordance with their
terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank, to pay and discharge each installment of principal of, premium and interest on and any mandatory
sinking fund payments in respect of all the new debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the applicable base indenture and those new debt securities; and 
 


 

 
the applicable issuer or guarantor(s) must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the new debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and related covenant defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit and related
covenant defeasance had not occurred.  Covenant Defeasance and Events of Default. In the event the
applicable issuer exercises its option to effect covenant defeasance with respect to any series of new debt securities, and the new debt securities of that series are declared due and payable immediately following an acceleration after the
occurrence of any Event of Default, the amount of money or U.S. government obligations or foreign government obligations on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient to pay amounts due on the new debt securities of that series at the time of their
stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the new debt securities of that series at the time of such acceleration. However, the applicable issuer shall remain liable for those payments. 
Governing Law  The
applicable base indenture and the new debt securities, including any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the applicable base indenture or the securities, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the
conflicts of laws provisions thereof, other than Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law).

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION 
The issuers may sell the securities domestically or abroad to one or more underwriters for public offering and sale by them or may sell the
securities to investors directly or through dealers or agents, or through a combination of methods. Any underwriter, dealer or agent involved in the offer and sale of the securities will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
Underwriters may offer and sell the securities at: (i) a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, (ii) market prices prevailing at
the time of sale, (iii) prices related to the prevailing market prices at the time of sale or (iv) negotiated prices. The issuers also may, from time to time, authorize underwriters acting as their agents to offer and sell the securities upon the
terms and conditions as are set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. In connection with the sale of securities, underwriters may be deemed to have received compensation from the applicable issuer in the form of underwriting discounts or
commissions and may also receive commissions from purchasers of securities for whom they may act as agent. Underwriters may sell securities to or through dealers, and the dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or
commissions from the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agent.  Any underwriting compensation
paid by an issuer to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of securities, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to participating dealers, will be set forth in the applicable prospectus
supplement. Dealers and agents participating in the distribution of the securities may be deemed to be underwriters, and any discounts and commissions received by them and any profit realized by them on resale of the securities may be deemed to be
underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. Underwriters, dealers and agents may be entitled, under agreements entered into with any of the issuers, to indemnification against and contribution toward civil liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act. Any indemnification agreement will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement.  Unless
specified otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, any series of securities issued hereunder will be a new issue with no established trading market (other than Kennedy-Wilson Holdings common stock, which is listed on the
NYSE). If Kennedy-Wilson Holdings sells any shares of its common stock pursuant to a prospectus supplement, such shares will be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. The issuers may elect to list any other securities
issued hereunder on any exchange, but the issuers are not obligated to do so. Any underwriters or agents to or through whom such securities are sold for public offering and sale may make a market in such securities, but such underwriters or agents
will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for any such securities. 
If indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the issuers may authorize underwriters or other persons acting as the issuers
agents to solicit offers by institutions or other suitable purchasers to purchase the securities from the issuers at the public offering price set forth in the prospectus supplement, pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and
delivery on the date or dates stated in the prospectus supplement. These purchasers may include, among others, commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions.
Delayed delivery contracts will be subject to the condition that the purchase of the securities covered by the delayed delivery contracts will not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the laws of any jurisdiction in the United States to which
the purchaser is subject. The underwriters and agents will not have any responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of these contracts. 
To facilitate the offering of the securities, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize,
maintain, or otherwise affect the price of the securities. This may include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involves the sale by persons participating in the offering of more securities than the issuers sold to them. In these
circumstances, these persons would cover the over-allotments or 
  28 


Table of Contents

short positions by making purchases in the open market or by exercising their over-allotment option. In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain the price of the securities by bidding
for or purchasing securities in the open market or by imposing penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may be reclaimed if securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization
transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. These transactions may be discontinued at any time. 
The underwriters, dealers and agents and their affiliates may be customers of, engage in transactions with and perform services for the
issuers in the ordinary course of business.  The specific plan of distribution, including any underwriters, dealers, agents or direct
purchasers and their compensation, will be identified in a prospectus supplement.

Item 15. Indemnification of Directors and Officers 
Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. 
Kennedy-Wilson, Inc.s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides as follows: 
SEVENTH.  1. Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other
than by or in the Right of the Corporation.  The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made
a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed
to become a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an Indemnitee), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good
faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Article, except as set forth in Section 6 below, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was
approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.  2. Actions of Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation. 
The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation,

  32 


Table of Contents

or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees) and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of
the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of
Delaware or the court in which such action of suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware of such other court shall deem proper.  3.
Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee
has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections I and 2 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or
proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed
of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to the Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo
contendere by the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal
proceeding, an adjudication that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee shall be considered for the purpose hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto. 
4. Notification and Defense of Claim.  As a
condition precedent to his right to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving him for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect
to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnitee in connection with such claim, other than as provided below in this Section 4. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel in connection with such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after
notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed
counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article. The Corporation shall not be
entitled, without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above.
 5. Advance of Expenses.  Subject to the
provisions of Section 6 below, in the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 4 of this Article of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this Article, any
expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in 
  33 


Table of Contents

defending a civil or criminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter, provided,
however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event
that it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Such undertaking may be accepted without reference to the financial ability of such person to make such
repayment.  6. Procedure for Indemnification. 
In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article, the Indemnitee shall submit to
the Corporation a written request, including in such request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to
requests under Section 1, 2 or 5 the Corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such
determination shall be made in each instance by (i) a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (disinterested directors), even though less than a
quorum, (ii) if there are no such disinterested directors, or if such disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the corporation) in a written opinion, (iii) a majority vote of a quorum of
the outstanding shares of stock of all classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of stockholders who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, or (iv) the Delaware
Court of Chancery.  7. Remedies.  The right
to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the
60-day period referred to above in Section 6. Unless otherwise provided by law, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article shall be on the Corporation. Neither the
failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by
the Corporation pursuant to Section 6 that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The
Indemnitees expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. 
8. Subsequent Amendment.  No amendment,
termination or repeal of this Article or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the
provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal. 
9. Other Rights.  The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, 
  34 


Table of Contents

both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director
or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements
with officers and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time (0 time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification
rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article. 
10. Partial Indemnification.  If an Indemnitee
is entitled under any provision of this Article to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or
on his behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which the Indemnitee is entitled.  11. Insurance. 
The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 
12. Merger or Consolidation.  If the
Corporation is merged into or consolidated with another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation shall assume the obligations of the Corporation under this Article with respect to any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the date of such merger or consolidation. 
13. Savings Clause.  If this Article or any
portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by an applicable portion of this
Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.  14. Definitions. 
Terms used herein and defined in Section l45(h) and Section l45(i) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall have the
respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section l45(h) and Section l45(i).  15. Subsequent Legislation. 
If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended after adoption of this Article to expand further the indemnification
permitted to Indemnitees, then the Corporation shall indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended.

Kennedy-Wilson, Inc.s Amended and Restated By-Laws provides as follows: 
Article VII.Indemnification. 
7.1. Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a Proceeding), by reason of being or having been a director or officer of the Corporation or serving or having served at the request of the Corporation
as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an Indemnitee), whether the basis of
such proceeding is alleged action or failure to act in an official capacity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware GCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto) (as used in this Article 7, the Delaware Law), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
to the benefit of the Indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in §7.2 hereof with respect to Proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article 7
shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an Advancement of Expenses);
provided, however, that, if the Delaware Law so requires, an Advancement of Expenses incurred by an Indemnitee shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (an Undertaking), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (a Final Adjudication) that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses
under this Article 7 or otherwise.  7.2. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under §7.1 hereof is not paid in full by the
Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the Indemnitee may at any time
thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an
Undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee
to enforce a right to an Advancement of Expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such
expenses upon a Final Adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware Law,
nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has
not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an Advancement of Expenses hereunder,
or by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such Advancement of Expenses, under this Article 7 or otherwise
shall be on the Corporation.

7.3. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights to indemnification and to the Advancement of Expenses
conferred in this Article 7 shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.  7.4. Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against
such expense, liability or loss under this Article 7 or under the Delaware Law.  7.5. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the
Corporation. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to the Advancement of Expenses, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the
provisions of this Article 7 with respect to the indemnification and Advancement of Expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action
further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this
paragraph (A) by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to events occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification. 
B. The Corporation, to the full extent permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, as amended from time to time, shall indemnify all persons whom it
may indemnify pursuant thereto. Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which such officer or director may be
entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall

proper.  7.3 To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise

consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or  (b) If such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if

The right to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this ARTICLE VIII shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses

advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount
of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of
prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that,
and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior
to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination
by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable
standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this ARTICLE VIII or otherwise shall be

maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or
not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
Section 6. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation. 
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the

conduct was unlawful.  (c) This Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any

expenses and then only to the extent that the court shall determine; (2) Of amounts paid in settling or otherwise disposing of a pending action without court approval; or (3) Of expenses incurred in defending a pending action which is settled or
otherwise disposed of without court approval.  (d) To the extent that an agent of this Corporation has been successful on the merits in
defense of any proceeding referred to in subdivisions (b) or (c) of this Section 16, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection
therewith.  (e) Except as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or in subdivision (d) of this Section 16, any indemnification under
this Section shall be made by this Corporation only if authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification. of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
subdivisions (b) or ( c) of this Section 16; by any of the following: (1) A majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such proceeding; (2) If such a quorum of directors is not obtainable, by independent legal counsel
in a written opinion; (3) Approval or ratification by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of this Corporation entitled to vote represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present or by written consent of holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. For such purpose, the shares owned by the person to be indemnified shall not be considered outstanding or entitled to vote thereon; or (4) The court in which such proceeding is or was pending,
upon application made by this Corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not such application by the agent, attorney, or person is opposed by this Corporation.

inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of the person. Nothing contained in this Section 16 shall affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than directors and officers of this Corporation or any subsidiary

(h) No indemnification or advance shall be made under this Section 16, except as provided in
subdivisions (d) or (e)(3) of this Section 16, in any circumstance where it appears: (1) That it would be inconsistent with the Certificate of Incorporation, a resolution of the stockholders, or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of
the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or (2) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by

The subsidiary guarantors that are California corporations are subject to the provisions of the California Corporations Code (the
CCC). Section 317 of the CCC authorizes a corporation to indemnify a person who is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any suit (other than a suit by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person
is or was the corporations director or officer, or is or was serving at the corporations request as a director or officer of another entity, for expenses (including attorneys fees) and other liabilities actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with any such suit, provided such person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to criminal actions, had no reasonable cause to
believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Section 317 provides further that a corporation may indemnify a director or officer for expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement
of a suit by or in the right of the corporation, provided such person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders. To the extent a corporations director or officer
is successful on the merits in the defense of any such suit, that person shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred. Under Section 317 of the CCC, expenses incurred in defending any suit may be advanced by the corporation
prior to the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt of any undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay that amount if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification.

 The Bylaws of Kennedy-Wilson Capital provides as follows: 
ARTICLE VI. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER AGENTS. 
Section 1. AGENTS, PROCEEDINGS, AND EXPENSES. For the purposes of this Article, agent means any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee, or other agent of this corporation, or who is or was serving at the request of this corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
enterprise, or who was a director, officer, employee, or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation that was a predecessor corporation of this corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation;
proceeding means any threatened, pending, or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative; and expenses includes, without limitation, attorney fees and any expenses of establishing
a right to indemnification under Section 4 or Section 5( d) of this Article VI.  Section 2. ACTIONS OTHER THAN BY THE CORPORATION. This
corporation will have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of this corporation to procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of the
fact that such person is or was an agent of this corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such proceeding if that person acted in good faith and in a manner
that the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of this corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of that person was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, will not, of itself, create a presumption either that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner that the person reasonably believed to be in the best
interests of this corporation or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the persons conduct was not unlawful.  Section
3. ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION. This corporation will have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending, or completed action by or in the right of this
corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of this corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of that
action, if such person acted in good faith, in a manner such person believed to be in the best interests of this corporation and its shareholders. No indemnification will be made under this Section 3 for the following: 
(a) Any claim, issue, or matter on which such person has been adjudged to be liable to this corporation in the performance of such
persons duty to the corporation and its shareholders, unless and only to the extent that the court in which such proceeding is or was pending will determine on application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for expenses, and then only to the extent that the court will determine;  (b) Amounts paid m
settling or otherwise disposing of a pending action without court approval; or  (c) Expenses incurred in defending a pending action that
is settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval.  Section 4. SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE BY AGENT. To the extent that an agent of this
corporation has been successful on the merits in defense of any proceeding referred to in Sections 2 or 3 of this Article VI, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, the agent will be indemnified against expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by the agent in connection therewith.  Section 5. REQUIRED APPROVAL. Except as provided in Section 4 of this Article
VI, any indemnification under this section will be made by the corporation only if authorized in the specific case, after a 
  52 


Table of Contents

determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 2 or 3 by one of the following:
 (a) A majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such proceeding; 
(b) Independent legal counsel in a written opinion if a quorum of directors who are not parties to such a proceeding is not available. 
(c) (i) The affirmative vote of a majority of shares of this corporation entitled to vote represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum
is present; or  (ii) the written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote (for purposes of this
subsection 5(c), the shares owned by the person to be indemnified will not be considered outstanding or entitled to vote thereon); or  (d)
The court in which the proceeding is or was pending, on application made by this corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not such application by the agent, attorney, or
other person is opposed by this corporation.  Section 6. ADVANCE OF EXPENSES. Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be
advanced by the corporation before the final disposition of such proceeding on receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay such amounts if it will be determined ultimately that the agent is not entitled to be indemnified as
authorized in this Article VI.  Section 7. OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS. The indemnification provided by this Article VI will not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under, e.g., any bylaw, agreement, or vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, both regarding action in an official capacity and regarding action in another
capacity while holding such office, to the extent that such additional rights to indemnification are authorized in the articles of the corporation. Nothing in this section will affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than such
directors and officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise.  Section 8. LIMITATIONS. No indemnification or advance will be made under
this Article VI, except as provided in Section 4 or Section 5(d), in any circumstance if it appears:  (a) That it would be inconsistent
with a provision of the articles or bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders, or an agreement which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or (b) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving
settlement.  Section 9. INSURANCE. This corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of the corporation insuring
against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in that capacity or arising out of the agents status as such, whether or not this corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against that liability under the
provisions of this Article VI. Despite the foregoing, if this corporation owns all or a portion of the shares of the company issuing the policy of insurance, the insuring company or the policy will meet the conditions set forth in Corporations Code
§317(i).  Section 10. FIDUCIARIES OF CORPORATE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN. This Article VI does not apply to any proceeding against any
trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that persons capacity as such, even though that person may also be an agent of the corporation. The corporation will have the power, to the extent permitted by
Corporations Code §207(f), to indemnify, and to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any such trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary of any benefit plan for any or all of the directors, officers, and employees of the
corporation or any of its subsidiary or affiliated corporations. 
  53

Section 11. SURVIVAL OF RIGHTS. The rights provided by this Article VI will continue for a person
who has ceased to be an agent and will inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such person.  Section 12.
EFFECT OF AMENDMENT. Any amendment, repeal, or modification of this Article VI will not adversely affect an agents right or protection existing at the time of such amendment, repeal, or modification. 
Section 13. SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS. The corporation will not be liable to indemnify any agent under this Article VI for (a) any amounts paid in
settlement of any action or claim effected without the corporations written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, or (b) any judicial award, if the corporation was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity
to participate, at its expense, in the defense of such action.  Section 14. SUBROGATION. In the event of payment under this Article
VI, the corporation will be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all of the rights of recovery of the agent, who will execute all papers required and will do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of
such documents as may be necessary to enable the corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.  Section 15. NO DUPLICATION
OF PAYMENTS. The corporation will not be liable under this Article VI to make any payment in connection with any claim made against the agent to the extent the agent has otherwise actually received payment, whether under a policy of insurance, an
agreement, or a vote, or through other means, of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable under this Article.  California Limited Liability Company
Subsidiary Guarantors  The subsidiary guarantors that are California limited liability companies are subject to the provisions of
the California Limited Liability Company Act. Under Section 17153 of the California Limited Liability Company Act, except for a breach of duty, the articles of organization or written operating agreement of a limited liability company may provide
for indemnification of any person, including, without limitation, any manager, member, officer, employee or agent of the limited liability company, against judgments, settlements, penalties, fines or expenses of any kind incurred as a result of
acting in that capacity. A limited liability company shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any manager, member, officer, employee or agent of the limited liability company against any liability asserted against on
incurred by the person in that capacity or arising out of the persons status as a manager, member, officer, employee or agent of the limited liability company. 
The Operating Agreement of Kennedy Wilson Fund Management Group, LLC provides as follows: 
4.5 Indemnification of Member. 
Except as otherwise provided by the Act, the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort or
otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, and the Member shall not be obligated for any such debt, obligation or liability of the Company by reason of being a member of the Company. The Company shall fully
indemnify the Member for any claim against the Member in the Members capacity as a member or a manager.  The Limited Liability
Company Agreement of KW Loan Partners II LLC provides as follows:  The Company shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless
each officer from any claim, damage, loss or liability which he or she may suffer which arises from or relates to the performance or nonperformance of the duties assigned to him or her by the Member, as applicable. Any individual may hold any number
of offices.  Illinois Corporate Subsidiary Guarantor 
The subsidiary guarantor that is an Illinois corporation is subject to the provisions of the Illinois Business Corporation Act of 1983, as
amended (the IBCA). Under Section 8.75 of the IBCA, an Illinois corporation may

Table of Contents

indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.  In addition, an Illinois corporation may
indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is
or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in,
or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, provided that no indemnification shall be made with respect to any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person has been adjudged to have been liable to the corporation, unless, and only
to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses as the court shall deem proper.  Section 8.75 of the IBCA also provides that, to the extent that a present or
former director, officer or employee of a corporation has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in either of the foregoing paragraphs, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter
therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, if the person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to
be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation.  The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Kennedy-Wilson Properties,
Ltd. are silent with respect to indemnification.  SEC Position on Indemnification for Securities Act Liabilities 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons
pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrants have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

 Item 17. Undertakings 
(A) Each undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:   


 
1)
To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:   


 
i.
To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;   


 
ii.
To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a
fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was
registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price
represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and 
  59 


Table of Contents


 
iii.
To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;
 provided, however, that paragraphs (1)(i), (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) shall not apply if the information required to
be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the registrants pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by
reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.   


 
2)
That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and
the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; and   


 
3)
To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. 
 


 
4)
That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:   


 
i.
Each prospectus filed by the registrants pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration
statement; and   


 
ii.
Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x)
for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after
effectiveness or the date of the first contract or sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be
deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide
offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement
or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract or sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part
of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.   


 
5)
That, for the purpose of determining liability of a registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: 
Each undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of such undersigned registrant pursuant to this
registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, such undersigned registrant will be
a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:   


 
i.
Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of such undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; 
 


 
ii.
Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of such undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; 
  60 


Table of Contents


 
iii.
The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about such undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of such undersigned registrant; and
  


 
iv.
Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by such undersigned registrant to the purchaser. 
(B) Each undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of a
registrants annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the
initial bona fide offering thereof.  (C) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to
directors, officers and controlling persons of any registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, each registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by any registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer
or controlling person of any registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, such registrant will, unless in the
opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.  (D) Each undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to file an application for the purpose of
determining the eligibility of the trustee to act under subsection (a) of section 310 of the Trust Indenture Act (Act) in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission under section 305(b)(2) of the Act.
