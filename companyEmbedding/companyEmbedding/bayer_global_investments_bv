Flea bites can hurt your cat—and your cat’s health
Seeing a flea on your clean, well-cared for cat can be a horrifying experience. In addition to the major “ick” factor fleas bring, they can bite your cat, causing pain and leading to health issues.
Examine flea risks ›







Myth: Ticks don’t harm cats
You’ve probably heard of Lyme disease, which can affect dogs. Luckily, it doesn’t affect cats. But there are other diseases caused by ticks that can be deadly to cats. Learn about the risks and how to prevent ticks on cats.
Understand tick disease risk ›







Fleas aren’t just annoying – they can cause health issues
Fleas can be intensely irritating for your dog — and you — and not just in the “annoying” sense of the word. Even a few fleas can pose health risks for your dog.
Discover flea risks›







Tick disease: It only takes one bite
When a tick pierces your dog’s skin to feed on blood, it can transmit dangerous diseases like Lyme disease. Find out more about the threat ticks pose and how you can help prevent ticks on dogs.

Does your flea and tick product require a bite?

									No biting required.

Application & Safety Information

 
















K9 Advantix® II kills through contact, no biting required.













Remember, bites are just the beginning.



Obviously, bites from fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can be very painful to your dog. Worse, those bites may expose your pet to irritation, itching and even deadly diseases. K9 Advantix® II kills those harmful fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. So they don’t have to bite to die. No wonder veterinarians recommend K9 Advantix® II. So why use anything else?SEE PRODUCT DETAILSDo not use on cats.


















Not all flea and tick treatments for dogs work the same.



When it comes to mosquito prevention, Frontline Plus can’t compare to K9 Advantix® II. You won’t find any mention of mosquitoes anywhere on the Frontline Plus package. Even most flea and tick products at your veterinarian don’t kill mosquitoes. And because mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases to your dog, why not kill them while also killing fleas and ticks?What about chewable flea and tick products? They may seem more convenient, but what if we told you that chewable products don’t kill fleas and ticks unless they bite your dog? In other words, fleas and ticks have to bite to die. And no chewable flea and tick product kills mosquitoes.SEE PRODUCT DETAILS

Comprehensive flea, tick and mosquito protection for your dog.



Fleas, ticks and mosquitoes must hate K9 Advantix® II. And why wouldn’t they? K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes on dogs through contact, and they don’t have to bite your dog to die. 
Because fleas, ticks and mosquitoes don’t just bite:Fleas can cause flea allergy dermatitis (FAD), an allergic reaction that can lead to constant scratching, severe itching and hair loss. FAD is one of the most common reasons pet owners take their dogs to the veterinarian. If swallowed, an infected flea can also transmit tapeworms, one of the most common intestinal parasites.Ticks can transmit deadly diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.Mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases, too, including heartworm. Other products may kill fleas and ticks, but that’s just scratching the surface.
And if your dog enjoys a weekly dip, K9 Advantix® II is still a wise choice because it’s waterproof.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS








































The more you know, the better. For both you and your dog.



Learn how fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can have a negative effect on the health of your dog, and much more.Can't seem to get rid of those fleas?Learn More >Tick disease: It only takes one bite. Learn More >Mosquitoes: A little insect that carries big health risks.Learn More >


















We're proud to partner with K9s For Warriors.



Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious issue. An estimated 22 veterans take their own lives every day. That's why K9 Advantix® II has been a longstanding supporter of K9s For Warriors, donating more than $700,000 since 2014.This amazing organization pairs specially trained shelter dogs with military veterans suffering from PTSD or traumatic brain injury.The program has already helped save hundreds of shelter dogs and veterans. 73% of program graduates report improved health and 92% have reduced or eliminated their dependence on medication.

Issuer), which is organized under the laws of Switzerland and has its principal executive offices at Aeschenvorstadt 36, 4051 Basel, Switzerland.  Item 2. Identity and Background.  This statement is being
filed by Bayer Global Investments B.V. (the Company), organized under the laws of the Netherlands, with its principal executive offices located at Energieweg 1, 3641 RT Mijdrecht, the Netherlands. The principal business of the Company is
to hold investments. Information as to the executive officers and directors of the Company is set forth in Exhibit A hereto.  This statement is also being
filed by Bayer AG, the 100% owner (the Owner) through subsidiaries of the Company, with its principal executive offices at KaiserWilhelmAllee, 51368 Leverkusen, Germany. The principal business of the Owner is in the Life
Science fields of health care and agriculture. Information as to the executive officers and directors of the Owner is set forth in Exhibit B hereto.  During the past five years, neither the Company nor the Owner nor, to the Companys or Owners knowledge, any of the persons listed in Exhibits A or
B, respectively, has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and similar misdemeanors). During the past five years, neither the Company nor the Owner nor, to the Companys or Owners knowledge, any of the
persons listed in Exhibits A or B, respectively, has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order
enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.  Item 3.  The Company beneficially owns 5,105,330 shares of
the Common Stock (the Shares). 2,500,000 shares of the Common Stock were acquired in a private placement concurrent with the Issuers initial public offering of the Common Stock (the IPO) in the United States (the
Private Placement Shares). Certain preferred shares of the Issuer were previously acquired by the Company upon conversion on January 29, 2016 of a US $35,000,000 convertible loan from the Company and prior to the IPO were converted
into 2,605,330 shares of Common Stock (the Conversion Shares). In both cases, operating funds of the Company or its Affiliates were used.  Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.  The purpose of the
acquisition of the Shares is to invest in the Issuers business focused in particular on the development and commercialization of CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics (the Business).  The Company intends to review the investment in the Issuer on a continuing basis and, depending on various factors, including the Issuers business,
affairs and financial position, other developments concerning the Issuer, the price level of the Common Stock, conditions in the securities markets and the general economic and industry conditions, may in the future take such actions with respect to
the investment in the Issuer as it deems appropriate in light of the circumstances existing from time to time. Such actions may include the purchase of additional shares of Common Stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or
otherwise, or the sale of all or a portion of the Shares or other shares of Common Stock hereafter acquired by the Company and the Owner to one or more purchasers.  Except as described above, neither the Company nor the Owner has any current plans or proposals that relate to or
would result in any of the events set forth in paragraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of the Special Instructions for Complying with Schedule 13D. The Company and the Owner may, at any time and from time to time, review or reconsider
their position and/or change their purpose and/or formulate plans or proposals with respect thereto.  Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.
 (a) The Company beneficially owns 5,105,330 Shares. As the Company is indirectly wholly-owned by the Owner, the Owner also beneficially owns the same
5,105,330 Shares. This number of shares represents 12.8% of the outstanding shares of the Issuer as calculated under Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. To the knowledge of the Company and the Owner, no director or
executive officer of either the Company or the Owner, respectively, beneficially owns any shares of Common Stock.  (b) As the Company is indirectly
wholly-owned by the Owner, the Company and the Owner share voting and investment power over the 5,105,330 Shares.  (c) Other than the transactions
described in Item 3 above, neither the Company nor the Owner nor, to the knowledge of the Company or the Owner, any director or executive officer of the Company or the Owner, respectively, has effected any transaction in the Common Stock during
the past sixty days.  (d) No person, other than the Company, has the right to receive dividends from the Common Stock and no person other than the Company
has the right to receive the proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock.  Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships With
Respect to Securities of the Issuer.  The Company entered into a Subscription Agreement date December 19, 2015 with the Issuer that has resulted in
the Company acquiring the 2,500,000 Private Placement Shares in a concurrent transaction to the Issuers IPO. As part of the Subscription Agreement, the Company has agreed during the period from the closing of the IPO until the later to occur
of (i) the eighteen month anniversary of the closing of the IPO, or (ii) upon termination of the Joint Venture Agreement, dated December 19, 2015, between the Issuer and an Affiliate of the Company, that neither it nor any of its
Affiliates, shall:  (a) acquire, directly or indirectly, any equity securities of the Issuer if such acquisition would
increase the Companys beneficial ownership percentage of the Issuers equity securities by more than 5% above the Companys beneficial ownership percentage of the Issuers equity securities immediately upon consummation of the
IPO;  (b) propose (i) any merger, consolidation, business combination, tender or exchange offer, sale of all or
substantially all of the Issuers assets or businesses, or similar transactions involving the Issuer (each a Business Combination) or (ii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation or other extraordinary transaction with
respect to the Issuer;  (c) (i) propose or seek, whether alone or in concert with others, any solicitation
of proxies or consents to vote any securities of the Issuer, (ii) nominate any person as a director of the Issuer, (iii) propose any matter to be voted upon by the stockholders of the Issuer, or (iv) act, alone or in concert with
others, to seek to control the management, Board of Directors of the Issuer, policies or affairs of the Issuer;  (d)
directly or indirectly, form, join or in any way participate in a third party group with respect to any securities of the Issuer;  (e) deposit any equity securities of the Issuer in a voting trust or subject any equity securities of the Issuer to any
arrangement or agreement with respect to the voting of such equity securities of the Issuer; or  (f) enter into
discussions, negotiations, arrangements or agreements with any person or entity relating to the foregoing actions referred to in (a) through (e) above.  The foregoing restrictions shall terminate automatically upon (i) the Issuer (X) publicly announcing that it has entered into a definitive agreement
with a third party to effect a Business Combination, (Y) publicly announcing the Issuers or its Board of Directors approval or recommendation of any Business Combination or (Z) filing bankruptcy proceedings, making an
assignment for the benefit of creditors or entering into a receivership, or the Issuer having filed against it bankruptcy proceedings that are not dismissed within sixty (60) days after commencement, (xx) waiving the application of any
provision of a standstill agreement with any other person with respect to the Issuers equity securities; (yy) publicly announcing a possible sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer in one or more transactions, or
(ii) any third party commencing a tender offer or exchange offer to acquire beneficial ownership of more than 25% of the Issuers equity securities. The restrictions shall also terminate and be of no further force or effect immediately
prior to the consummation of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Issuer, or a Business Combination.  The Company has registration rights with respect to the Shares.  The Company has also entered a lock-up agreement (the Lock-up Agreement) with the underwriters of the IPO and agreed to a 180-day
lock-up for all shares of Common Stock it holds, subject to certain exceptions.  The description of each of the Subscription Agreement, the
Lock-Up Agreement and the form of Registration Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement as an Exhibit to this Schedule 13D.  Item 7.

KEYCODE BAYER 605
Press Release; 29 January 2015
BAYER appearing poor to tax authorities
Appropriate Taxes for Multinationals!
The chemical and pharmaceutical company BAYER has systematically moved profits to low-tax countries. The corporation thereby reduces its tax burden at the expense of taxpayers in Germany, the United States or France.
BAYER has 15 subsidiaries in the Netherlands alone. This, however, has little to do with patriotic feelings of the CEO, Marijn Dekkers. The reason is that Holland aggressively advertises its offers for saving business taxes. The use of intellectual property and trademark rights in so-called “patent boxes”, for example, is taxed at only five per cent. Thus the BAYER subsidiaries in Germany or the UK can claim the fees for something such as an Aspirin licence as a reason for tax reduction, while the fees hardly matter in terms of earnings in the Netherlands. The country is also suitable for an intercompany bank that lends money for investments to the divisions. The interest on the credits reduces taxes in Germany, but it hardly lowers the profits in Mijdrecht at BAYER WORLD INVESTMENTS B.V.
In 2012 BAYER therefore transferred shares worth 1.4 billion euros from the United States to BAYER WORLD INVESTMENTS in Holland. The subsidiary BAYER GLOBAL INVESTMENTS received 526 million euros from French divisions. Additionally, the BAYER CAPITAL CORPORATION granted loans of 1.3 billion euros in the Netherlands.
BAYER uses Belgium for tax evasion purposes, too, because the country allows interest on equity. In 2011 the company doubled the funds of its subsidiary in Antwerp, raising them to eight billion euros, and could transfer its profit of 254.8 million euros almost completely to Germany. It only had to leave 10.8 million euros, which is equivalent to a tax quota of 4.3 per cent. In Luxemburg BAYER profits from concessions for insurances; both its INDURISK RUECKVERSICHERUNG AG and its PANDIAS RE AG are located there.
The trick is to make profits where they won’t lead to any costs, and to make losses where there is the threat of tax authorities. BAYER´s Chief Strategy and Portfolio Officer Werner Baumann calls this tactic “a changed regional distribution of results”. Baumann is the head of the Global Tax Projects department. The employees in this department work, amongst other things, on “Tax Planning” and “Transfer Pricing”, that is, calculating the price for intercompany deals of trade mark rights, licences and actual products.
Tax dumping is very harmful for society. This can be seen in the German city of Leverkusen, where BAYER’s headquarters are situated. Even though BAYER is the most valuable German company, Leverkusen has been financially suffering for two decades. During several years the municipality was forced to introduce emergency budgets because BAYER paid hardly any taxes – in some years, such as 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004, none at all.
The latest catastrophic news for Leverkusen came in May 2014 and was connected to BAYER's takeover of MERCK´s division for over-the-counter products. Announcing the deal, the company declared:  “BAYER expects significant tax savings from the first year after completion onwards.” In Leverkusen alone there will be eight-figure losses in tax revenue. This year the municipality will receive only 60 million euros of trade tax from all companies. It should be mentioned for purposes of comparison that BAYER alone paid twice that amount in 1990.
The German corporate tax reform of 2001 already played a significant role in reducing the taxes paid by German corporations. From that time onwards, BAYER paid no trade tax or corporate income tax at all for years. Between 1997 and 2000, the company was paying about 1 billion a year in corporation tax. However, in 2009 tax payments dropped to 511 million and to 411 million in 2010. The “golden law” that made this possible was drafted by Heribert Zitzelsberger, former head of BAYER´s tax department, whom the company dispatched to the German Finance Ministry.
The //Coalition against BAYER Dangers// demands an end to the destructive tax race. Jan Pehrke from the Coalition’s board says: “The fact that BAYER hardly contributes to community financing is unacceptable. The company is steadily abdicating its responsibility towards the general public at the expense of taxpayers, who have to pay the bill through rising taxes and levies.  It is high time to ensure that large companies take an appropriate share of the tax burden!“ The Coalition has been monitoring BAYER since 1978.

Flea bites can hurt your cat—and your cat’s health
Seeing a flea on your clean, well-cared for cat can be a horrifying experience. In addition to the major “ick” factor fleas bring, they can bite your cat, causing pain and leading to health issues.
Examine flea risks ›







Myth: Ticks don’t harm cats
You’ve probably heard of Lyme disease, which can affect dogs. Luckily, it doesn’t affect cats. But there are other diseases caused by ticks that can be deadly to cats. Learn about the risks and how to prevent ticks on cats.
Understand tick disease risk ›







Fleas aren’t just annoying – they can cause health issues
Fleas can be intensely irritating for your dog — and you — and not just in the “annoying” sense of the word. Even a few fleas can pose health risks for your dog.
Discover flea risks›







Tick disease: It only takes one bite
When a tick pierces your dog’s skin to feed on blood, it can transmit dangerous diseases like Lyme disease. Find out more about the threat ticks pose and how you can help prevent ticks on dogs.

Does your flea and tick product require a bite?

When fleas, ticks and mosquitoes bite your dog, they can cause irritation and transmit deadly diseases. But not all products work the same.K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks AND mosquitoes through contact. No biting required. Now that's a wise choice.
Buy near me










									No biting required.
								
Veterinarian-recommended K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks, mosquitoes and lice, and repels biting flies. And because it works through contact, there’s no biting required.

Application & Safety Information

 
















K9 Advantix® II kills through contact, no biting required.













Remember, bites are just the beginning.



Obviously, bites from fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can be very painful to your dog. Worse, those bites may expose your pet to irritation, itching and even deadly diseases. K9 Advantix® II kills those harmful fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. So they don’t have to bite to die. No wonder veterinarians recommend K9 Advantix® II. So why use anything else?SEE PRODUCT DETAILSDo not use on cats.


















Not all flea and tick treatments for dogs work the same.



When it comes to mosquito prevention, Frontline Plus can’t compare to K9 Advantix® II. You won’t find any mention of mosquitoes anywhere on the Frontline Plus package. Even most flea and tick products at your veterinarian don’t kill mosquitoes. And because mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases to your dog, why not kill them while also killing fleas and ticks?What about chewable flea and tick products? They may seem more convenient, but what if we told you that chewable products don’t kill fleas and ticks unless they bite your dog? In other words, fleas and ticks have to bite to die. And no chewable flea and tick product kills mosquitoes.SEE PRODUCT DETAILS

Comprehensive flea, tick and mosquito protection for your dog.



Fleas, ticks and mosquitoes must hate K9 Advantix® II. And why wouldn’t they? K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes on dogs through contact, and they don’t have to bite your dog to die. 
Because fleas, ticks and mosquitoes don’t just bite:Fleas can cause flea allergy dermatitis (FAD), an allergic reaction that can lead to constant scratching, severe itching and hair loss. FAD is one of the most common reasons pet owners take their dogs to the veterinarian. If swallowed, an infected flea can also transmit tapeworms, one of the most common intestinal parasites.Ticks can transmit deadly diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.Mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases, too, including heartworm. Other products may kill fleas and ticks, but that’s just scratching the surface.
And if your dog enjoys a weekly dip, K9 Advantix® II is still a wise choice because it’s waterproof.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS








































The more you know, the better. For both you and your dog.



Learn how fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can have a negative effect on the health of your dog, and much more.Can't seem to get rid of those fleas?Learn More >Tick disease: It only takes one bite. Learn More >Mosquitoes: A little insect that carries big health risks.Learn More >


















We're proud to partner with K9s For Warriors.



Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious issue. An estimated 22 veterans take their own lives every day. That's why K9 Advantix® II has been a longstanding supporter of K9s For Warriors, donating more than $700,000 since 2014.This amazing organization pairs specially trained shelter dogs with military veterans suffering from PTSD or traumatic brain injury.The program has already helped save hundreds of shelter dogs and veterans. 73% of program graduates report improved health and 92% have reduced or eliminated their dependence on medication.
