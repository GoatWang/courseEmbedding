Published on Oct 28, 2015How to add product options to WooCommerce (like different sizes or color variations).In your WordPress admin page (with WooCommerce installed), select Products, Attributes from the left menu. Add a new attribute name, such as "Size."  Click Add attribute.On the right side, you'll see the attribute you just added, click on the gear icon.  Then add a name for a variable (such as "small" "6.5" "blue").  Click the blue, "Add new __" button.  Repeat for each option your product has.  Now add or edit the product you have options for.  In the edit or add screen, there is a box that says "Product Data" In the dropdown menu, where it says Simple Product, select "Variable Product" instead. Then click on Attributes, and select the option you need.  Click "Add," then check the box "Used for variations."  Under values, click "Select All"  Save it. Then click Variations.  Select "Create variations from all attributes" and click "Go."  Say okay to both pop-ups.  Now, for every single variation, click the row to expand your options.  Add a price to the price field for every single variation.  Click Save.  (It will not add your product to your shop unless you add a price to each one.) Now back towards the top of the screen, click either "Publish" or "Update" and your product will now have options!

	This Item 2 shall be deemed to amend and supplement Item 2:


	Certain information required by this Item 2 concerning the executive officers, directors and managers of the Reporting Persons is set
	forth on

	Schedule A

	, attached hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference.



	Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.



	Item 4 is hereby amended and supplemented by the following:


	On November 19, 2013, Memorial Resource, as the selling unitholder, the Issuer, Memorial Production Partners GP LLC and Memorial
	Production Operating LLC, entered into an underwriting agreement attached hereto as Exhibit H with Barclays Capital Inc. (the 


	Underwriter


	), providing for the offer and sale by Memorial Resource (the 


	Secondary
	Offering


	), and purchase by the Underwriter of 7,061,294 Common Units at a price of $19.12 per Common Unit. The Secondary Offering closed on November 22, 2013.





	Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, Memorial Resource has entered into a lock-up agreement
	(the 


	Lock-up Agreement


	) pursuant to which it has agreed with the Underwriter not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be
	expected to, result in the disposition) any Common Units or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Units during the period from November 19, 2013 continuing through and including the date 45 days thereafter, except with the
	prior written consent of the Underwriter.


	The foregoing descriptions of the Underwriting Agreement and the Lock-up Agreement do not
	purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit H hereto, and the form of Lock-up Agreement, which is included as Exhibit A to the Underwriting Agreement, and are
	incorporated herein by reference.


	Except as set forth above in this Item 4, as amended and supplemented, the Reporting Persons have
	no present plans or proposals which would result in or relate to any of the transactions described in subparagraphs (a) through (i) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.



	Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.



	Item 5 is hereby amended and restated by the following:


	(a)-(b)


	 




	 


	(i)


	Memorial Resource does not beneficially own any Common Units. Its beneficial ownership (with respect to both voting and dispositive power) therefore constitutes 0.0% of the outstanding Common Units. Memorial Resource is
	the sole record owner of 5,360,912 subordinated units which are convertible into an equal number of Common Units upon satisfaction of the conditions in the Partnership Agreement. Memorial Resource is the indirect beneficial owner of the 0.1% general
	partner interest in the Issuer and incentive distribution rights in the Issuer by virtue of being the sole member of the General Partner.




	 




	 


	(ii)


	NGP VIII, NGP IX and NGP IX Offshore do not directly own any Common Units. NGP VIII, NGP IX and NGP IX Offshore own an approximate 50.3%, 47.3% and 2.4% interest, respectively, in Memorial Resource. By virtue of owning
	Memorial Resource, each of NGP VIII, NGP IX and NGP IX Offshore may be deemed to possess shared voting and dispositive powers with respect to those units held by Memorial Resource, representing 5,360,912 subordinated units.




	 




	 


	(iii)


	The General Partner does not directly own any Common Units. The General Partner may be deemed to beneficially own (i) the 0.1% general partner interest in the Issuer and (ii) the incentive distribution rights
	in the Issuer.




	 




	 


	(iv)


	Kenneth A. Hersh does not directly own any Common Units. Mr. Hersh is a member of the board of directors of the General Partner. Mr. Hersh is also an Authorized Member of the ultimate general partners of NGP
	VIII, NGP IX and NGP IX Offshore and thus may be deemed to possess shared voting and dispositive powers with respect those units held by Memorial Resource, representing 5,360,912 subordinated units that are attributable to NGP VIII, NGP IX and
	NGP IX Offshore.




	The above Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent
	of their pecuniary interests therein, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that the reporting persons are the beneficial owner of the reported securities for purposes of Section 16 or for any other purpose.


	(c) There have been no reportable transactions with respect to the Common Units within the last 60 days by the Reporting Persons except for the
	disposition of beneficial ownership of Common Units being reported on this Schedule 13D/A.


	(d) The Reporting Persons have the right to receive
	distributions from, and the proceeds from the sale of, the respective Common Units reported by such persons on the cover pages of this Schedule 13D/A and in this Item 5. See

	Schedule A

	for the information applicable to the Listed
	Persons. Except for the foregoing and the cash distribution described in Item 6 below, no other person is known by the Reporting Persons to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of distributions from, or the proceeds from
	the sale of, Common Units beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons or, to the Reporting Persons knowledge, the Listed Persons.


	(e) The
	Reporting Persons are no longer beneficial owners of more than five percent of the outstanding Common Units.






	Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships With Respect to Securities of the
	Issuer.



	Item 6 is hereby amended and supplemented by the following:


	In connection with the sale of 7,061,294 Common Units by Memorial Resource in the Secondary Offering described in Item 4 above, such
	Common Units are no longer pledged under the Credit Agreement.


	Item 4 above summarizes certain provisions of the Underwriting
	Agreement and the Lock-up Agreement and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement, which includes the form of Lock-up Agreement as Exhibit A thereto, is attached as Exhibit H hereto, and is incorporated by reference
	herein.

	will not permit any other Loan Party to, enter into any transaction, including, without limitation, any purchase, sale, lease or exchange of Property or the rendering of any service, with any Affiliate (other than the Guarantors but including the

	Affiliate; provided that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to (a) reasonable and customary fees paid to members of the board of directors (or comparable governing body) of the Borrower or the Loan Parties, (b) compensation

	2.12

	party thereto (other than the Administrative Agent), or shall be repudiated by any of them (other than the Administrative Agent), or cease to create a valid and perfected Lien of the priority required thereby on any material part of the collateral
	purported to be covered thereby, except to the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement, or the Borrower or any other Loan Party or any of their Affiliates or, in the case of the Intercreditor Agreement, any other party thereto (other than
	the Administrative Agent), shall so state in writing;


	2.14

	Amendment to Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement

	.
	Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read in full as follows:

	Secured Party) (by receiving the benefits thereunder and of the collateral pledged pursuant to the Security Instruments) agrees that the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and each such other intercreditor agreement shall be binding on such
	Lender, such Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns, as if it were a party thereto. Each Lender agrees to cause each of its Affiliates that is a Secured Party to acknowledge, confirm and ratify the agreements entered into by such
