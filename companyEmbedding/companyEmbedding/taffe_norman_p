			Norman P. Taffe, 50, has served as one of our directors since May 2013. Mr. Taffe is currently Senior Vice President, Products at SunPower Corporation and started with the company in June 2013 as general manager. Since September 2012, Mr. Taffe has served as a member of the board of directors of Integrated Device Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: IDTI), a mixed-signal semiconductor solutions company. He is also a member of the board of directors of the Second Harvest Food Bank, a non-profit organization, since July 2008. Previously, Mr. Taffe served as the Executive Vice President of Consumer and Computation Division of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: CY) ("Cypress"), a provider of high-performance, mixed-signal, programmable solutions that provide customers with rapid time-to-market and exceptional system value, from May 2007 until May 2012. Prior to that, Mr. Taffe held numerous positions with Cypress, including Marketing Director of the programmable logic and interface products divisions from April 1999 to July 2001, Managing Director of Cypress' mergers and acquisitions and venture funds from July 2001 to September 2002, Managing Director of the wireless business unit from September 2002 to January 2005, and Vice President of the Personal Communications Division from January 2005 to May 2005. He completed the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School and has a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Michigan. We believe Mr. Taffe's qualifications to sit on our board include his 20 plus years in senior executive positions, his extensive experience in the technology industry and directorship on another NASDAQ-listed company.
