Cross Body Collector's Bag




























Click to enlarge












An alternative to the collector's wristlet, this cross body bag is a little larger and has no zipper to fiddle with. Strap is long enough to fit over your head and stay out of the way. Made with waterproof mesh, so the sand and water get left at the beach!
