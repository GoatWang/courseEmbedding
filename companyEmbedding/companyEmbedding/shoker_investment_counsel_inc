Randy Shoker is founder and President of Shoker Investment Counsel, Inc. and the firm's Chief Investment Officer. Starting his career in 1985 as a stockbroker, first with Cowen and Company and then at Prudential-Bache Securities in Cincinnati, Randy learned firsthand that he could not effectively manage his clients’ money as long he worked for a broker-dealer. He founded Shoker Investment Counsel, Inc. in 1990 as a fee-only money management firm to be able to manage his clients’ money without having to sell financial products. Randy's depth of experience comes from guiding clients through everything from the crash of 1987 to today's highly volatile market environment. As Chief Investment Officer, Randy is responsible for the development and implementation of overall investment strategy, including asset allocation, sector weightings, and security selection. Randy  holds a BA from Miami University. He and his wife, Nancy, live in Oxford, Ohio and have four children.

He has been instrumental in helping to guide clients through the market volatility of the last several years.  Prior to joining Shoker Investment Counsel, Inc., Chris was the Operations Manager of a family owned company for more than ten years. He graduated Magna Cum Laude from Northern Kentucky University with a BS in Finance.  While at NKU, Chris worked as a market research analyst for an Investment Advisor who offered both hedge fund and individual asset management services. Chris resides in Norwood, Ohio with his wife, Lee, and their two children.
