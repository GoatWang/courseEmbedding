History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Location in Lexington, Massachusetts, USA


Shire was founded in 1986 in the UK by four entrepreneurs. These four entrepreneurs were Harry Stratford, Dennis Stephens, Peter Moriarty, and Geoff Hall.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. Shire's initial products were calcium supplements (Calcichew-D3) for patients seeking to treat or prevent osteoporosis. In 1997 the company acquired Pharmavene for £105 million in order to access Pharmavene's drug delivery methods.[5] Later in the same year Shire acquired Richwood Pharmaceutical Company, forming Shire-Richwood Inc.[6]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2001 the company acquired Biochem Canada.[7] Shire's next acquisition didn't come until 2005 when it acquired Transkaryotic Therapeutics[8] and two years later - in 2007 - New River Pharmaceuticals Inc, for a then company record of $2.6 billion.[9] With the purchase of New River, Shire gained access and ownership of Vyvanse. A year late the company acquired the German company Jerini, for $521 million. Jerini focused on treating hereditary angioedema.[10]
In 2008, in reaction to new taxation measures announced by the Labour Party in the treatment of royalties on patents, the company moved its tax domicile to Dublin, Ireland.[11]
2010 onwards[edit]
2010 saw a change in company strategy, with the company seeking to expand through mergers and acquisitions - culminating in the company becoming one of the most acquisitive in the industry. In 2010 the company acquired Movetis, a Belgian company focusing on gastrointestinal products for $565 million,[12] a year later it acquired regenerative medicine manufacturer Advanced BioHealing.[13] In 2012 the company acquired FerroKin BioSciences for $325 million along with FerroKins lead iron chelator - FBS0701.[14] 2013 saw the company complete its highest number of acquisitions with Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc. (lead compound, ABH001),[15] SARcode Bioscience Inc.,[16] with the last being ViroPharma. Shire changed the name of ViroPharma to Shire Viropharma Inc. upon acquisition and on their final day of trading the company was valued at $3.3 billion.[17] At $4.2 billion, ViroPharma set a new company record.[18] In 2014 Shire acquired two rare disease drug companies; Fibrotech[19] with its antifibrotic compounds for $75 million and Lumena, a company researching rare gastro-intestinal and hepatic compounds, for $260 million.[20]
In 2015, NPS Pharmaceuticals was acquired for $5.2 billion, bringing along its rare disease drugs Gattex and Natpara.[21] On their final day of trading, NPS had a market capitalisation of $4.99 billion. The company also acquired, later in the same year Meritage Pharma for $245 million, Foresight Biotherapeutics for $300 million[22] and Dyax for $6.5 billion.[23][24] The purchases bolstered Shires Gastro-intestinal and rare disease sectors, with Phase-III ready treatment - Budesonide - for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. As well as expanding the company's pipeline with a late-stage treatment candidate for infectious conjunctivitis with lead candidate FST-100 and increased the companies rare disease catalogue with Dyax’s portfolio of plasma kallikrein inhibitors against hereditary angioedema (led by the approved drug Kalbitor and the Phase III DX-2930). In January 2016, the company made its most significant purchase, with the $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta (Which had been spun-off from Baxter the previous year[25]), creating the largest global biotech company focused solely on rare diseases.[26]
Aborted AbbVie takeover[edit]
On 20 June 2014, Shire rejected a takeover attempt by AbbVie. AbbVie offered £46.11 per share (£27.3 billion or $46.5 billion in total).[27] On 8 July the offer was increased to $51.5 billion.[28] On 18 July, it was announced that AbbVie would acquire Shire for $54.8 billion.[29] On 15 October, news broke suggesting AbbVie was reconsidering their proposed takeover deal due to changes in US "Tax Inversion" law [30] and on 16 October AbbVie's board recommended that shareholders vote against the deal.[31] This news sent Shire's share price down over 27%, however AbbVie will be subject to a $1.6 billion break up fee, payable to Shire.[32] On 21 October the merger was called off.[33]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Location in Lexington, Massachusetts, USA


Shire was founded in 1986 in the UK by four entrepreneurs. These four entrepreneurs were Harry Stratford, Dennis Stephens, Peter Moriarty, and Geoff Hall.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. Shire's initial products were calcium supplements (Calcichew-D3) for patients seeking to treat or prevent osteoporosis. In 1997 the company acquired Pharmavene for £105 million in order to access Pharmavene's drug delivery methods.[5] Later in the same year Shire acquired Richwood Pharmaceutical Company, forming Shire-Richwood Inc.[6]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2001 the company acquired Biochem Canada.[7] Shire's next acquisition didn't come until 2005 when it acquired Transkaryotic Therapeutics[8] and two years later - in 2007 - New River Pharmaceuticals Inc, for a then company record of $2.6 billion.[9] With the purchase of New River, Shire gained access and ownership of Vyvanse. A year late the company acquired the German company Jerini, for $521 million. Jerini focused on treating hereditary angioedema.[10]
In 2008, in reaction to new taxation measures announced by the Labour Party in the treatment of royalties on patents, the company moved its tax domicile to Dublin, Ireland.[11]
2010 onwards[edit]
2010 saw a change in company strategy, with the company seeking to expand through mergers and acquisitions - culminating in the company becoming one of the most acquisitive in the industry. In 2010 the company acquired Movetis, a Belgian company focusing on gastrointestinal products for $565 million,[12] a year later it acquired regenerative medicine manufacturer Advanced BioHealing.[13] In 2012 the company acquired FerroKin BioSciences for $325 million along with FerroKins lead iron chelator - FBS0701.[14] 2013 saw the company complete its highest number of acquisitions with Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc. (lead compound, ABH001),[15] SARcode Bioscience Inc.,[16] with the last being ViroPharma. Shire changed the name of ViroPharma to Shire Viropharma Inc. upon acquisition and on their final day of trading the company was valued at $3.3 billion.[17] At $4.2 billion, ViroPharma set a new company record.[18] In 2014 Shire acquired two rare disease drug companies; Fibrotech[19] with its antifibrotic compounds for $75 million and Lumena, a company researching rare gastro-intestinal and hepatic compounds, for $260 million.[20]
In 2015, NPS Pharmaceuticals was acquired for $5.2 billion, bringing along its rare disease drugs Gattex and Natpara.[21] On their final day of trading, NPS had a market capitalisation of $4.99 billion. The company also acquired, later in the same year Meritage Pharma for $245 million, Foresight Biotherapeutics for $300 million[22] and Dyax for $6.5 billion.[23][24] The purchases bolstered Shires Gastro-intestinal and rare disease sectors, with Phase-III ready treatment - Budesonide - for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. As well as expanding the company's pipeline with a late-stage treatment candidate for infectious conjunctivitis with lead candidate FST-100 and increased the companies rare disease catalogue with Dyax’s portfolio of plasma kallikrein inhibitors against hereditary angioedema (led by the approved drug Kalbitor and the Phase III DX-2930). In January 2016, the company made its most significant purchase, with the $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta (Which had been spun-off from Baxter the previous year[25]), creating the largest global biotech company focused solely on rare diseases.[26]
Aborted AbbVie takeover[edit]
On 20 June 2014, Shire rejected a takeover attempt by AbbVie. AbbVie offered £46.11 per share (£27.3 billion or $46.5 billion in total).[27] On 8 July the offer was increased to $51.5 billion.[28] On 18 July, it was announced that AbbVie would acquire Shire for $54.8 billion.[29] On 15 October, news broke suggesting AbbVie was reconsidering their proposed takeover deal due to changes in US "Tax Inversion" law [30] and on 16 October AbbVie's board recommended that shareholders vote against the deal.[31] This news sent Shire's share price down over 27%, however AbbVie will be subject to a $1.6 billion break up fee, payable to Shire.[32] On 21 October the merger was called off.[33]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Location in Lexington, Massachusetts, USA


Shire was founded in 1986 in the UK by four entrepreneurs. These four entrepreneurs were Harry Stratford, Dennis Stephens, Peter Moriarty, and Geoff Hall.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. Shire's initial products were calcium supplements (Calcichew-D3) for patients seeking to treat or prevent osteoporosis. In 1997 the company acquired Pharmavene for £105 million in order to access Pharmavene's drug delivery methods.[5] Later in the same year Shire acquired Richwood Pharmaceutical Company, forming Shire-Richwood Inc.[6]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2001 the company acquired Biochem Canada.[7] Shire's next acquisition didn't come until 2005 when it acquired Transkaryotic Therapeutics[8] and two years later - in 2007 - New River Pharmaceuticals Inc, for a then company record of $2.6 billion.[9] With the purchase of New River, Shire gained access and ownership of Vyvanse. A year late the company acquired the German company Jerini, for $521 million. Jerini focused on treating hereditary angioedema.[10]
In 2008, in reaction to new taxation measures announced by the Labour Party in the treatment of royalties on patents, the company moved its tax domicile to Dublin, Ireland.[11]
2010 onwards[edit]
2010 saw a change in company strategy, with the company seeking to expand through mergers and acquisitions - culminating in the company becoming one of the most acquisitive in the industry. In 2010 the company acquired Movetis, a Belgian company focusing on gastrointestinal products for $565 million,[12] a year later it acquired regenerative medicine manufacturer Advanced BioHealing.[13] In 2012 the company acquired FerroKin BioSciences for $325 million along with FerroKins lead iron chelator - FBS0701.[14] 2013 saw the company complete its highest number of acquisitions with Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc. (lead compound, ABH001),[15] SARcode Bioscience Inc.,[16] with the last being ViroPharma. Shire changed the name of ViroPharma to Shire Viropharma Inc. upon acquisition and on their final day of trading the company was valued at $3.3 billion.[17] At $4.2 billion, ViroPharma set a new company record.[18] In 2014 Shire acquired two rare disease drug companies; Fibrotech[19] with its antifibrotic compounds for $75 million and Lumena, a company researching rare gastro-intestinal and hepatic compounds, for $260 million.[20]
In 2015, NPS Pharmaceuticals was acquired for $5.2 billion, bringing along its rare disease drugs Gattex and Natpara.[21] On their final day of trading, NPS had a market capitalisation of $4.99 billion. The company also acquired, later in the same year Meritage Pharma for $245 million, Foresight Biotherapeutics for $300 million[22] and Dyax for $6.5 billion.[23][24] The purchases bolstered Shires Gastro-intestinal and rare disease sectors, with Phase-III ready treatment - Budesonide - for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. As well as expanding the company's pipeline with a late-stage treatment candidate for infectious conjunctivitis with lead candidate FST-100 and increased the companies rare disease catalogue with Dyax’s portfolio of plasma kallikrein inhibitors against hereditary angioedema (led by the approved drug Kalbitor and the Phase III DX-2930). In January 2016, the company made its most significant purchase, with the $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta (Which had been spun-off from Baxter the previous year[25]), creating the largest global biotech company focused solely on rare diseases.[26]
Aborted AbbVie takeover[edit]
On 20 June 2014, Shire rejected a takeover attempt by AbbVie. AbbVie offered £46.11 per share (£27.3 billion or $46.5 billion in total).[27] On 8 July the offer was increased to $51.5 billion.[28] On 18 July, it was announced that AbbVie would acquire Shire for $54.8 billion.[29] On 15 October, news broke suggesting AbbVie was reconsidering their proposed takeover deal due to changes in US "Tax Inversion" law [30] and on 16 October AbbVie's board recommended that shareholders vote against the deal.[31] This news sent Shire's share price down over 27%, however AbbVie will be subject to a $1.6 billion break up fee, payable to Shire.[32] On 21 October the merger was called off.[33]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Location in Lexington, Massachusetts, USA


Shire was founded in 1986 in the UK by four entrepreneurs. These four entrepreneurs were Harry Stratford, Dennis Stephens, Peter Moriarty, and Geoff Hall.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. Shire's initial products were calcium supplements (Calcichew-D3) for patients seeking to treat or prevent osteoporosis. In 1997 the company acquired Pharmavene for £105 million in order to access Pharmavene's drug delivery methods.[5] Later in the same year Shire acquired Richwood Pharmaceutical Company, forming Shire-Richwood Inc.[6]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2001 the company acquired Biochem Canada.[7] Shire's next acquisition didn't come until 2005 when it acquired Transkaryotic Therapeutics[8] and two years later - in 2007 - New River Pharmaceuticals Inc, for a then company record of $2.6 billion.[9] With the purchase of New River, Shire gained access and ownership of Vyvanse. A year late the company acquired the German company Jerini, for $521 million. Jerini focused on treating hereditary angioedema.[10]
In 2008, in reaction to new taxation measures announced by the Labour Party in the treatment of royalties on patents, the company moved its tax domicile to Dublin, Ireland.[11]
2010 onwards[edit]
2010 saw a change in company strategy, with the company seeking to expand through mergers and acquisitions - culminating in the company becoming one of the most acquisitive in the industry. In 2010 the company acquired Movetis, a Belgian company focusing on gastrointestinal products for $565 million,[12] a year later it acquired regenerative medicine manufacturer Advanced BioHealing.[13] In 2012 the company acquired FerroKin BioSciences for $325 million along with FerroKins lead iron chelator - FBS0701.[14] 2013 saw the company complete its highest number of acquisitions with Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc. (lead compound, ABH001),[15] SARcode Bioscience Inc.,[16] with the last being ViroPharma. Shire changed the name of ViroPharma to Shire Viropharma Inc. upon acquisition and on their final day of trading the company was valued at $3.3 billion.[17] At $4.2 billion, ViroPharma set a new company record.[18] In 2014 Shire acquired two rare disease drug companies; Fibrotech[19] with its antifibrotic compounds for $75 million and Lumena, a company researching rare gastro-intestinal and hepatic compounds, for $260 million.[20]
In 2015, NPS Pharmaceuticals was acquired for $5.2 billion, bringing along its rare disease drugs Gattex and Natpara.[21] On their final day of trading, NPS had a market capitalisation of $4.99 billion. The company also acquired, later in the same year Meritage Pharma for $245 million, Foresight Biotherapeutics for $300 million[22] and Dyax for $6.5 billion.[23][24] The purchases bolstered Shires Gastro-intestinal and rare disease sectors, with Phase-III ready treatment - Budesonide - for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. As well as expanding the company's pipeline with a late-stage treatment candidate for infectious conjunctivitis with lead candidate FST-100 and increased the companies rare disease catalogue with Dyax’s portfolio of plasma kallikrein inhibitors against hereditary angioedema (led by the approved drug Kalbitor and the Phase III DX-2930). In January 2016, the company made its most significant purchase, with the $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta (Which had been spun-off from Baxter the previous year[25]), creating the largest global biotech company focused solely on rare diseases.[26]
Aborted AbbVie takeover[edit]
On 20 June 2014, Shire rejected a takeover attempt by AbbVie. AbbVie offered £46.11 per share (£27.3 billion or $46.5 billion in total).[27] On 8 July the offer was increased to $51.5 billion.[28] On 18 July, it was announced that AbbVie would acquire Shire for $54.8 billion.[29] On 15 October, news broke suggesting AbbVie was reconsidering their proposed takeover deal due to changes in US "Tax Inversion" law [30] and on 16 October AbbVie's board recommended that shareholders vote against the deal.[31] This news sent Shire's share price down over 27%, however AbbVie will be subject to a $1.6 billion break up fee, payable to Shire.[32] On 21 October the merger was called off.[33]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Location in Lexington, Massachusetts, USA


Shire was founded in 1986 in the UK by four entrepreneurs. These four entrepreneurs were Harry Stratford, Dennis Stephens, Peter Moriarty, and Geoff Hall.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. Shire's initial products were calcium supplements (Calcichew-D3) for patients seeking to treat or prevent osteoporosis. In 1997 the company acquired Pharmavene for £105 million in order to access Pharmavene's drug delivery methods.[5] Later in the same year Shire acquired Richwood Pharmaceutical Company, forming Shire-Richwood Inc.[6]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2001 the company acquired Biochem Canada.[7] Shire's next acquisition didn't come until 2005 when it acquired Transkaryotic Therapeutics[8] and two years later - in 2007 - New River Pharmaceuticals Inc, for a then company record of $2.6 billion.[9] With the purchase of New River, Shire gained access and ownership of Vyvanse. A year late the company acquired the German company Jerini, for $521 million. Jerini focused on treating hereditary angioedema.[10]
In 2008, in reaction to new taxation measures announced by the Labour Party in the treatment of royalties on patents, the company moved its tax domicile to Dublin, Ireland.[11]
2010 onwards[edit]
2010 saw a change in company strategy, with the company seeking to expand through mergers and acquisitions - culminating in the company becoming one of the most acquisitive in the industry. In 2010 the company acquired Movetis, a Belgian company focusing on gastrointestinal products for $565 million,[12] a year later it acquired regenerative medicine manufacturer Advanced BioHealing.[13] In 2012 the company acquired FerroKin BioSciences for $325 million along with FerroKins lead iron chelator - FBS0701.[14] 2013 saw the company complete its highest number of acquisitions with Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc. (lead compound, ABH001),[15] SARcode Bioscience Inc.,[16] with the last being ViroPharma. Shire changed the name of ViroPharma to Shire Viropharma Inc. upon acquisition and on their final day of trading the company was valued at $3.3 billion.[17] At $4.2 billion, ViroPharma set a new company record.[18] In 2014 Shire acquired two rare disease drug companies; Fibrotech[19] with its antifibrotic compounds for $75 million and Lumena, a company researching rare gastro-intestinal and hepatic compounds, for $260 million.[20]
In 2015, NPS Pharmaceuticals was acquired for $5.2 billion, bringing along its rare disease drugs Gattex and Natpara.[21] On their final day of trading, NPS had a market capitalisation of $4.99 billion. The company also acquired, later in the same year Meritage Pharma for $245 million, Foresight Biotherapeutics for $300 million[22] and Dyax for $6.5 billion.[23][24] The purchases bolstered Shires Gastro-intestinal and rare disease sectors, with Phase-III ready treatment - Budesonide - for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. As well as expanding the company's pipeline with a late-stage treatment candidate for infectious conjunctivitis with lead candidate FST-100 and increased the companies rare disease catalogue with Dyax’s portfolio of plasma kallikrein inhibitors against hereditary angioedema (led by the approved drug Kalbitor and the Phase III DX-2930). In January 2016, the company made its most significant purchase, with the $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta (Which had been spun-off from Baxter the previous year[25]), creating the largest global biotech company focused solely on rare diseases.[26]
Aborted AbbVie takeover[edit]
On 20 June 2014, Shire rejected a takeover attempt by AbbVie. AbbVie offered £46.11 per share (£27.3 billion or $46.5 billion in total).[27] On 8 July the offer was increased to $51.5 billion.[28] On 18 July, it was announced that AbbVie would acquire Shire for $54.8 billion.[29] On 15 October, news broke suggesting AbbVie was reconsidering their proposed takeover deal due to changes in US "Tax Inversion" law [30] and on 16 October AbbVie's board recommended that shareholders vote against the deal.[31] This news sent Shire's share price down over 27%, however AbbVie will be subject to a $1.6 billion break up fee, payable to Shire.[32] On 21 October the merger was called off.[33]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Location in Lexington, Massachusetts, USA


Shire was founded in 1986 in the UK by four entrepreneurs. These four entrepreneurs were Harry Stratford, Dennis Stephens, Peter Moriarty, and Geoff Hall.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. Shire's initial products were calcium supplements (Calcichew-D3) for patients seeking to treat or prevent osteoporosis. In 1997 the company acquired Pharmavene for £105 million in order to access Pharmavene's drug delivery methods.[5] Later in the same year Shire acquired Richwood Pharmaceutical Company, forming Shire-Richwood Inc.[6]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2001 the company acquired Biochem Canada.[7] Shire's next acquisition didn't come until 2005 when it acquired Transkaryotic Therapeutics[8] and two years later - in 2007 - New River Pharmaceuticals Inc, for a then company record of $2.6 billion.[9] With the purchase of New River, Shire gained access and ownership of Vyvanse. A year late the company acquired the German company Jerini, for $521 million. Jerini focused on treating hereditary angioedema.[10]
In 2008, in reaction to new taxation measures announced by the Labour Party in the treatment of royalties on patents, the company moved its tax domicile to Dublin, Ireland.[11]
2010 onwards[edit]
2010 saw a change in company strategy, with the company seeking to expand through mergers and acquisitions - culminating in the company becoming one of the most acquisitive in the industry. In 2010 the company acquired Movetis, a Belgian company focusing on gastrointestinal products for $565 million,[12] a year later it acquired regenerative medicine manufacturer Advanced BioHealing.[13] In 2012 the company acquired FerroKin BioSciences for $325 million along with FerroKins lead iron chelator - FBS0701.[14] 2013 saw the company complete its highest number of acquisitions with Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc. (lead compound, ABH001),[15] SARcode Bioscience Inc.,[16] with the last being ViroPharma. Shire changed the name of ViroPharma to Shire Viropharma Inc. upon acquisition and on their final day of trading the company was valued at $3.3 billion.[17] At $4.2 billion, ViroPharma set a new company record.[18] In 2014 Shire acquired two rare disease drug companies; Fibrotech[19] with its antifibrotic compounds for $75 million and Lumena, a company researching rare gastro-intestinal and hepatic compounds, for $260 million.[20]
In 2015, NPS Pharmaceuticals was acquired for $5.2 billion, bringing along its rare disease drugs Gattex and Natpara.[21] On their final day of trading, NPS had a market capitalisation of $4.99 billion. The company also acquired, later in the same year Meritage Pharma for $245 million, Foresight Biotherapeutics for $300 million[22] and Dyax for $6.5 billion.[23][24] The purchases bolstered Shires Gastro-intestinal and rare disease sectors, with Phase-III ready treatment - Budesonide - for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. As well as expanding the company's pipeline with a late-stage treatment candidate for infectious conjunctivitis with lead candidate FST-100 and increased the companies rare disease catalogue with Dyax’s portfolio of plasma kallikrein inhibitors against hereditary angioedema (led by the approved drug Kalbitor and the Phase III DX-2930). In January 2016, the company made its most significant purchase, with the $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta (Which had been spun-off from Baxter the previous year[25]), creating the largest global biotech company focused solely on rare diseases.[26]
Aborted AbbVie takeover[edit]
On 20 June 2014, Shire rejected a takeover attempt by AbbVie. AbbVie offered £46.11 per share (£27.3 billion or $46.5 billion in total).[27] On 8 July the offer was increased to $51.5 billion.[28] On 18 July, it was announced that AbbVie would acquire Shire for $54.8 billion.[29] On 15 October, news broke suggesting AbbVie was reconsidering their proposed takeover deal due to changes in US "Tax Inversion" law [30] and on 16 October AbbVie's board recommended that shareholders vote against the deal.[31] This news sent Shire's share price down over 27%, however AbbVie will be subject to a $1.6 billion break up fee, payable to Shire.[32] On 21 October the merger was called off.[33]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Location in Lexington, Massachusetts, USA


Shire was founded in 1986 in the UK by four entrepreneurs. These four entrepreneurs were Harry Stratford, Dennis Stephens, Peter Moriarty, and Geoff Hall.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. Shire's initial products were calcium supplements (Calcichew-D3) for patients seeking to treat or prevent osteoporosis. In 1997 the company acquired Pharmavene for £105 million in order to access Pharmavene's drug delivery methods.[5] Later in the same year Shire acquired Richwood Pharmaceutical Company, forming Shire-Richwood Inc.[6]
2000 to 2009[edit]
In 2001 the company acquired Biochem Canada.[7] Shire's next acquisition didn't come until 2005 when it acquired Transkaryotic Therapeutics[8] and two years later - in 2007 - New River Pharmaceuticals Inc, for a then company record of $2.6 billion.[9] With the purchase of New River, Shire gained access and ownership of Vyvanse. A year late the company acquired the German company Jerini, for $521 million. Jerini focused on treating hereditary angioedema.[10]
In 2008, in reaction to new taxation measures announced by the Labour Party in the treatment of royalties on patents, the company moved its tax domicile to Dublin, Ireland.[11]
2010 onwards[edit]
2010 saw a change in company strategy, with the company seeking to expand through mergers and acquisitions - culminating in the company becoming one of the most acquisitive in the industry. In 2010 the company acquired Movetis, a Belgian company focusing on gastrointestinal products for $565 million,[12] a year later it acquired regenerative medicine manufacturer Advanced BioHealing.[13] In 2012 the company acquired FerroKin BioSciences for $325 million along with FerroKins lead iron chelator - FBS0701.[14] 2013 saw the company complete its highest number of acquisitions with Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc. (lead compound, ABH001),[15] SARcode Bioscience Inc.,[16] with the last being ViroPharma. Shire changed the name of ViroPharma to Shire Viropharma Inc. upon acquisition and on their final day of trading the company was valued at $3.3 billion.[17] At $4.2 billion, ViroPharma set a new company record.[18] In 2014 Shire acquired two rare disease drug companies; Fibrotech[19] with its antifibrotic compounds for $75 million and Lumena, a company researching rare gastro-intestinal and hepatic compounds, for $260 million.[20]
In 2015, NPS Pharmaceuticals was acquired for $5.2 billion, bringing along its rare disease drugs Gattex and Natpara.[21] On their final day of trading, NPS had a market capitalisation of $4.99 billion. The company also acquired, later in the same year Meritage Pharma for $245 million, Foresight Biotherapeutics for $300 million[22] and Dyax for $6.5 billion.[23][24] The purchases bolstered Shires Gastro-intestinal and rare disease sectors, with Phase-III ready treatment - Budesonide - for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. As well as expanding the company's pipeline with a late-stage treatment candidate for infectious conjunctivitis with lead candidate FST-100 and increased the companies rare disease catalogue with Dyax’s portfolio of plasma kallikrein inhibitors against hereditary angioedema (led by the approved drug Kalbitor and the Phase III DX-2930). In January 2016, the company made its most significant purchase, with the $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta (Which had been spun-off from Baxter the previous year[25]), creating the largest global biotech company focused solely on rare diseases.[26]
Aborted AbbVie takeover[edit]
On 20 June 2014, Shire rejected a takeover attempt by AbbVie. AbbVie offered £46.11 per share (£27.3 billion or $46.5 billion in total).[27] On 8 July the offer was increased to $51.5 billion.[28] On 18 July, it was announced that AbbVie would acquire Shire for $54.8 billion.[29] On 15 October, news broke suggesting AbbVie was reconsidering their proposed takeover deal due to changes in US "Tax Inversion" law [30] and on 16 October AbbVie's board recommended that shareholders vote against the deal.[31] This news sent Shire's share price down over 27%, however AbbVie will be subject to a $1.6 billion break up fee, payable to Shire.[32] On 21 October the merger was called off.[33]

        Our Strategy
      


OUR STRATEGYOur strategy is to grow and create long-term value by being the leading global biotech company focused on developing and delivering high impact medicines for rare diseases. To this end, we work together to excel across four key strategic drivers: growth, innovation, efficiency and people.


Growth
We seek to drive performance from our marketed products to optimize revenue growth and cash generation.
Progress in 2016

Completed acquisitions of Dyax and Baxalta, adding rare disease assets to Shire’s Genetic Diseases franchise and establishing franchises in Hematology, Immunology, and Oncology
Enhanced size and value of our portfolio of commercial products to drive Shire revenue to $11.4 billion (+78 percent compared to 2015). Global sales footprint expanded to 109 countries, with commercial operations in 68 countries
Received approvals and launched XIIDRA (U.S.; Dry Eye Disease), CUVITRU (U.S., Europe; primary immunodeficiency), ONIVYDE (Europe; 2nd line metastatic pancreatic cancer), and VONVENDI (U.S., von Willebrand Disease)
New indications, geographies, and patient populations for ADYNOVATE/ADYNOVI, LIALDA, and VYVANSE
Expansion of Cambridge, MA operations as a rare disease innovation hub

Priorities for 2017

Expand therapeutic area leadership by enhancing commercial capabilities, increasing our global footprint and broadening our portfolio of best-in-class products
Focus on commercial execution and new product launches, including geographical expansions to continue the building of global brands across our seven franchises
Effectively execute our late stage clinical development pipeline to support future growth

Key Performance Indicators

Net product sales, Non GAAP cash generation





Innovation
We build our future assets through both R&D and business development to deliver innovation and value for future growth.
Progress in 2016

Expanded pipeline to roughly 40 programs in the clinic, the largest in Shire’s history, with about 20 in the later stages of development (in registration, in Phase 3 or ready to enter Phase 3)
Resubmitted SHP465 (U.S.; ADHD) to FDA, decision expected on or around June 2017
Achieved 2 Breakthrough Therapies designations (SHP621 for eosinophilic esophagitis; SHP625 for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2), 1 Fast Track designation (SHP626; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis)
Strengthened gastrointestinal disease pipeline via in-licensing of SHP647, a Phase 3-ready asset for inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”)

Priorities for 2017

Submit regulatory filings for VONVENDI (EU; von Willibrand disease), FIRAZYR (Japan; hereditary angioedema), VYVANSE (ADHD; Japan), and XIIDRA (EU; dry eye disease)
Drive execution excellence on our late stage clinical development portfolio to support future growth, including Phase 3 readouts for SHP643 (hereditary angioedema/HAE), SHP609 (Intrathecal delivery for Hunter’s Disease), and topline data supporting ONIVYDE submission in Japan
Supplement our early-stage pipeline to support sustained future growth

Key Performance Indicators

Number and potential value of products in clinical development pipeline





Efficiency
We operate a lean and agile integrated organization and reinvest for growth.
Progress in 2016

Exceeded goals and benchmarks related to speed and synergy capture in the Baxalta integration. Mid-year, increased initial estimates on total synergy capture to $700 million+ by Year 3
Aligned on combined approach for commercial operations, market access, and patient services, while beginning international commercial site consolidations and initiating a manufacturing network optimization program
Decisions taken to exit Biosimilars and streamline Oncology portfolio obtained in the Baxalta acquisition, to maintain focus on high value rare and specialty conditions

Priorities for 2017

Drive synergies and profitability through global scale and lean general and administrative (“G&A”) model
Build on progress of Baxalta integration to date
Continue optimization of portfolio
Reduce leverage

Key Performance Indicators

Non GAAP EBITDA margin, Non GAAP ROIC, Non GAAP net debt/Non GAAP EBITDA ratio




People
We foster a high-performance, patient-focused culture where we attract, retain and promote the best talent practices.
Progress in 2016

Grew organization to approximately 24,000 employees globally, following integrations of Dyax and Baxalta, while maintaining favorable metrics on employee retention and morale
Rolled out new organizational structure, incorporating top talent from Shire, Baxalta, and Dyax
Served our patients and communities through events such as Shire’s Global Day of Service, in which more than 6,500 Shire employees volunteered over 25,000 hours in 150 locations around the world
Announced a multi-year partnership with SeriousFun Children’s Network, supporting 16 camps around the world for children and their families living with serious illnesses. The partnership allows for a variety of engagement opportunities, strengthening our deep commitment to the patients and families who are affected by rare diseases. In 2016, Shire employees donated over 5,000 hours of volunteer time with SeriousFun camps, globally

Priorities for 2017

Continue to support and enhance an entrepreneurial, patient-focused culture
Retain the best talent and practices.

                  Business Model
                
Our way of leading in rare diseases
We maintain a sharp focus on rare diseases to deliver high impact for patients, sustained corporate growth and increased value for society.
We are focused on developing and delivering life-changing medicines for underserved patients with rare diseases
We are sharply focused on patient populations with extraordinarily high unmet needs — often, their conditions are not well understood, even within the healthcare community, and there may be few or no effective therapies. We bring unique expertise and innovative technologies to select therapeutic areas where we see tremendous opportunity to enhance patients’ lives and establish a durable leadership position in the industry. While rare conditions form the core area of highest emphasis, we often see additional opportunities to apply our expertise and therapeutic area leadership to certain highly specialized, non-rare indications where we see the opportunity to bring innovation to enable patients to live fuller lives.



We build a portfolio of products through a combination of focused internal research and development, collaborations with leading institutions, and strong business development capabilities
We begin by identifying gaps in current medical care where patients with serious illnesses are significantly impacted by either the lack of effective therapies or shortcomings in the available treatments. We listen carefully to patients, advocacy groups, and our network of leading clinicians to deeply understand patient needs. We seek to match these opportunities with promising scientific innovations which offer the potential to deliver a meaningful therapeutic advance. We are agnostic to the specific technologies involved and where they originate — we are exclusively focused on identifying the most promising ways to address patient needs. Frequently, this mindset leads us to collaborate and partner with leading research institutions and emerging “start-up” companies with novel therapeutic approaches. We employ a sophisticated business development capability that enables us to continually survey the landscape, identify promising approaches, and rapidly strike agreements to advance these potential next-generation therapies. We then apply our specialized, world-class development and commercialization resources to rapidly deliver these innovations to patients
As the leader in rare diseases, we invest in and develop the unique capabilities required for successful development and commercialization of high-impact products
We have built a broad constellation of unique, industry leading capabilities that allows us to maintain our leadership in rare diseases, and that positions us as the partner of choice in this area. For example, within our R&D organization we have specialized expertise that enables us to address the challenges of developing new medicines in rare disease indications, such as recruiting hard-to-find patients, navigating ill-defined current standards of treatment, and pioneering unprecedented regulatory pathways. Similarly, once new therapies are approved, we then apply sophisticated approaches to increase diagnosis rates, support patients as they initiate therapy, and productively engage with patients, leading treatment centers and advocacy organizations. Our nimble global supply network is also tailored to the unique challenges of reliably delivering potentially life-saving rare disease therapies to often diffuse global patient populations. 
Our scale and focus specifically on rare diseases enables us to invest deeply in these capabilities, with high impact. We apply our expertise and skills to the task of bringing new, cutting-edge therapies for conditions where, in many cases, no therapy has existed. Combined with our sharp focus on execution, we ensure that the most underserved patients around the world have access to the critical therapies they need.

					Simulators



					Simulate Inputs to aid development!

 

					2 Reasons to Use Simulators

					1) Work on software before connecting to your Sensors and Actuators.

					Don’t have all your sensors and actuators yet?

					Can’t afford to take system offline for long?

					Prove it works before connecting to the real thing.

					Want to connect sensors and actuators one piece at a time?

					With the External Port option, connect as many Digital IO sensors and actuators as you’d like
					and simulate all the rest.  
					Switches let you select pin-by-pin which Analog Inputs you want to simulate using knobs
					and which you want to use real signals from input ports.

					2) Learn to use PLCs.

					They’re a great training tool.  All IO can be simulated.

					Compatible with most Embedded PLC we sell

					With a Simulator, an Embedded Branch Main and Embedded Expansions,
					you can simulate an entire Branch System.

					Simulators can be set up to work with 5volt and 10volt analog ranges. 

 

					Simulator - top and side views

 

*Picture Shows an Embedded PLC plugged into Simulator.  Embedded PLCs sold separately

 

 

					Knobs simulate Analog Inputs
					(port f is optional)

 

					Switches simulate Digital Inputs

 

					LEDs display Digital Output state

 

					Jumper sets whether GND to +5V 
					or AV- to AV+ is used for Analog Inputs

 

					Analog Input Port Connector (optional)

 

					Switches let you pin-by-pin to use 
					Knob or signal from Analog 
					Input Port (optional)

 

					Digital Input Port Connector (optional)
					decide pin-by-pin to use Switch or wire 
					plugged into this port for Digital Input

 

					Digital Output Port Connector (optional)
					connect outputs to real hardware


 

 

					Our Embedded PLCs use 0.1” spaced headers 
					that extend from the underside of the PLCs. 
					They’re designed to mate with these Simulators,
					as well as your custom hardware
(click to read more about Embedded PLCs)

					View without Embedded PLC plugged in.

					want in another. They can share an object, so you don’t have to pass data between the two.

					Terminal Boards




					Ace PLCs come with small, high quality spring-cage capture connectors.
					They’re made for 20-26 AWG wire.

					These connectors along with built in protected inputs and transistor outputs work great 
					for many cases, but sometime you need something more.  We’ve got you covered.




					Larger Screw-Type

					Relay

					Opto-Coupled

					Using a Cable we’ll provide you, wire these Terminal boards to Ace or Branch’s IO ports.
					All Terminal Boards have a built in mount for 15mm DIN Rail or #8 Bolts.
					All Terminal Boards connect to IO with screw-type terminals (30-16 AWG stranded or solid wire.)

					Programming cable




					All Ace and Branch PLCs use a standard USB to Mini-USB cable 
					for programming (like the one in the picture to the left).
					If you’ve already got one, great, it’ll work fine.
					Be careful, this isn't the USB to Micro-USB that comes with many cell phones.
					If not, be sure to add one to your cart.

					DIN Rail Mount

					All Ace and Branch PLCs come standard with a super-strong, 2-sided adhesive strip.
					It bonds well with painted metals, plastics and glass. 
					This stuff is used to attach Sky-Scraper windows to their frames.  We've been impressed with it's strength.




					Adhesive

					(Underside of Ace and Branch PLCs)

					But, what if I want to attach it to a DIN rail, screws, or bolts? You’re in Luck!  

					We’ve got a great add-on that helps you attach your PLC to a 35mm Din rail, or #8 screws or bolts.  




					vMount  

					same thing, just upside down  

					it's got these 2 hooks  

					Ace or Branch underside  

					notice these slots 

					Ace and Branch have four of the slots shown in the image above, to the right. (two aren’t visible). 
					Twist vMount onto your Ace or Branch to attach.  Pick which of the 4 orientations works best for your project.  




					Once attached to your Ace or Branch, rest the topside on your DIN rail. 
					Then press the bottom side down.  It'll snap in place, providing a secure mount.  

					If you'd prefer to mount using #8 screws or bolts, just place you holes 1" apart.

Mydayis is not for use in children 12 years and younger. Shire expects to make Mydayis commercially available in the United States in the third quarter of 2017.The U.S. FDA approval of Mydayis is based on results from 16 clinical studies evaluating Mydayis in more than 1,600 subjects, including adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years) and adults with ADHD. In pivotal, placebo-controlled clinical studies, Mydayis significantly improved symptoms of ADHD, as measured by the ADHD-RS-IV and the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP), in adults and adolescents. Improvement on the PERMP, an objective, validated, skill-adjusted math test that measures attention in ADHD patients, reached statistical significance beginning at 2 or 4 hours post-dose and lasting up to 16 hours post-dose."Mydayis is the latest innovation in Shire's 20-year legacy of helping to support the treatment of ADHD. It's a testament to Shire's commitment to helping support the evolving needs of appropriate patients with ADHD," said Flemming Ornskov, M.D., MPH, CEO of Shire. "With this approval, we hope to help patients who need a once-daily treatment option. Mydayis has shown efficacy lasting up to 16 hours after taking one capsule, beginning at 2 or 4 hours post-dose."Andrew J. Cutler, M.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Meridien Research and an investigator in the Mydayis clinical trials said: "Many of my patients living with ADHD are trying to manage symptoms that impact them in different settings - often across home life, school or work, and in social settings. Patients have individual needs and may respond differently to treatments, so it is important for healthcare professionals to have multiple options. It's rewarding to work with Shire to provide a new treatment option that may help appropriate patients with ADHD."Mydayis, other amphetamine containing medicines, and methylphenidate have a high chance for abuse and can cause physical and psychological dependence. Your healthcare provider should check you or your child for signs of abuse and dependence before and during treatment with Mydayis.  In pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies where efficacy was the primary endpoint, a morning dose of Mydayis demonstrated superiority to placebo based on the change from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV total score for adult and adolescent patients, respectively. The most common adverse reactions associated with Mydayis (incidence ≥5% and at a rate at least twice placebo) in adults are insomnia, decreased appetite, decreased weight, dry mouth, increased heart rate, and anxiety. For pediatric patients (13 years and older), the most common adverse reactions were insomnia, decreased appetite, decreased weight, irritability, and nausea.In Phase 2 studies (two studies in adults and one in adolescents), patients treated with Mydayis demonstrated improved attention compared to placebo, as assessed by the total PERMP score, with results reaching statistical significance beginning at 2 or 4 hours post-dose and lasting up to 16 hours post-dose. Across all clinical studies, adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and similar to those observed with other amphetamine compounds.ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests as a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. An estimated 4.4% of adults have ADHD in the U.S. When applied to the full U.S. adult population aged 18 and over, approximately 10.5 million adults are estimated to have ADHD in the U.S. Approximately 50 to 66% of children with ADHD may continue to have ADHD symptoms as adults. Medication is not appropriate for all individuals diagnosed with ADHD.Read More"Being diagnosed with ADHD as an adult helped me understand my symptoms," said Gina D'Angelo, an adult patient with ADHD. "Living with my ADHD symptoms is an ongoing process, and how I navigate my daily responsibilities with ADHD changes as I learn more about it. It is encouraging to see new options that may help adults manage their ADHD symptoms."Mydayis (mixed salts of a single-entity amphetamine product) Important Safety Information  What is MYDAYIS[TM]?Mydayis is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients 13 years and older.

The diagnosis is made utilizing criteria specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5®). Only a trained healthcare professional can evaluate and diagnose ADHD.Although there is no cure for ADHD, there are accepted treatments that have demonstrated improvement in ADHD symptoms. A comprehensive approach is often advised, which may include a combination of medication, psychotherapy and educational approaches. Ongoing assessment of ADHD management plans is recommended.About the Mydayis Phase 3 Studies  Efficacy of Mydayis in adults (aged 18-55 years) was evaluated in a pivotal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Mydayis 12.5 mg or 37.5 mg in 275 adult patients (Study 1) who met the DSM-5® criteria for ADHD. The primary endpoint was defined as the change from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV with prompts total score compared to placebo. When administered as a daily morning dose, Mydayis was superior compared to placebo for both the 12.5 mg and 37.5 mg doses, respectively. In addition, patients treated with either 12.5 mg or 37.5 mg of Mydayis also showed significantly greater improvement compared to placebo on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) score, a key secondary endpoint.In a pooled analysis of three Phase 3 clinical trials conducted in 626 adult ADHD patients, the most commonly reported TEAEs (reported in >5% of Mydayis-treated patients) were insomnia, decreased appetite, dry mouth, decreased weight, increased heart rate, and anxiety. Nine percent of Mydayis-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 2% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (i.e., leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of Mydayis-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (2%), increased blood pressure (2%), decreased appetite (1%), and headache (1%).The efficacy of Mydayis was further assessed in a study that included 157 adolescent (13 to 17 years old) patients (Study 4). This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study of Mydayis in patients who met the DSM-IV-TR® criteria for ADHD. Subjects were titrated from a dose of 12.5 mg/day until an optimal dose was reached (up to a maximum dose of 25 mg/day). The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the change from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV total score when compared to placebo. The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated that Mydayis, administered as a daily morning dose, was superior to placebo with respect to the change from baseline on the     ADHD-RS-IV total score. In addition, Mydayis also showed significantly greater improvement on the CGI-I score at Week 4, the key secondary endpoint in this study.Among adolescent patients in Study 4, the most commonly reported TEAEs (reported in >5% of Mydayis-treated patients) were decreased appetite, nausea, insomnia, irritability, and decreased weight. Five percent of Mydayis-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to zero percent of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation (i.e., leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of Mydayis-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were dizziness, depression, upper abdominal pain, and viral infection (all 1%). Safety and effectiveness of Mydayis have not been established in pediatric patients ages 12 years and younger.About the Mydayis Phase 2 Studies  The efficacy of Mydayis in adults (aged 18-55 years) was also evaluated in two workplace analog studies. These were multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies in adult patients that evaluated 50 mg (Study 2, N=86, 42 of whom were treated with 50 mg) or 25 mg (Study 3, N=79, 76 of whom were treated with 25 mg) of Mydayis who met DSM-IV-TR® criteria for ADHD. Efficacy was assessed by the PERMP total score, calculated as the sum of the number of math problems attempted plus the number of math problems answered correctly. The PERMP was administered at 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, and 16 hours post-dose. Mydayis treatment reached statistical significance compared to placebo at either 2 hours (Study 2) or 4 hours (Study 3) post-dose and lasting up to 16 hours post-dose in both studies.In Study 2, no patients in the Mydayis 50 mg treatment group experienced a serious TEAE. The most commonly reported TEAEs (reported in >5% of patients) in the Mydayis 50 mg treatment group included fatigue, insomnia, anorexia, decreased appetite, headache, dry mouth, hypertension.  In Study 3, no patients experienced a serious TEAE. Two patients reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that led to study discontinuation. The most commonly reported TEAEs (reported in >5% of patients) in the Mydayis 25 mg treatment group were insomnia, decreased appetite, dry mouth, headache, and anorexia.The efficacy of Mydayis in adolescents was also evaluated in a classroom analog study (Study 5, 13 to 17 years, N=84 adolescents). The study was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of Mydayis 12.5 mg or 25 mg who met DSM-IV-TR® criteria for ADHD. Efficacy was assessed using the PERMP which was administered at 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, and 16 hours post-dose. Mydayis treatment, compared to placebo, resulted in a statistically significant treatment effect compared with placebo, beginning at 2 hours and continued for up to 16 hours post-dose. In Study 5, TEAEs that were more common in the Mydayis treatment arms (i.e., frequency >5% in either Mydayis treatment arm) were upper abdominal pain, dry mouth, nausea, anorexia, decreased appetite, dizziness, headache, insomnia, irritability, and dysmenorrhea. There were no reported serious TEAEs and no TEAEs led to study discontinuation.DSM-5 and DSM-IV-TR are registered trademarks of the American Psychiatric Association.About Mydayis  Mydayis is a once-daily treatment comprised of three different types of drug-releasing beads for patients 13 years and older with ADHD.

Such forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are subject to change at any time. In the event such risks or uncertainties materialize, Shire's results could be materially adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:Shire's products may not be a commercial success;increased pricing pressures and limits on patient access as a result of governmental regulations and market developments may affect Shire's future revenues, financial condition and results of operations;Shire conducts its own manufacturing operations for certain of its products and is reliant on third party contract manufacturers to manufacture other products and to provide goods and services. Some of Shire's products or ingredients are only available from a single approved source for manufacture. Any disruption to the supply chain for any of Shire's products may result in Shire being unable to continue marketing or developing a product or may result in Shire being unable to do so on a commercially viable basis for some period of time;the manufacture of Shire's products is subject to extensive oversight by various regulatory agencies. Regulatory approvals or interventions associated with changes to manufacturing sites, ingredients or manufacturing processes could lead to, among other things, significant delays, an increase in operating costs, lost product sales, an interruption of research activities or the delay of new product launches;certain of Shire's therapies involve lengthy and complex processes, which may prevent Shire from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing its production capacity;Shire has a portfolio of products in various stages of research and development. The successful development of these products is highly uncertain and requires significant expenditures and time, and there is no guarantee that these products will receive regulatory approval;the actions of certain customers could affect Shire's ability to sell or market products profitably. Fluctuations in buying or distribution patterns by such customers can adversely affect Shire's revenues, financial conditions or results of operations;Shire's products and product candidates face substantial competition in the product markets in which it operates, including competition from generics;adverse outcomes in legal matters, tax audits and other disputes, including Shire's ability to enforce and defend patents and other intellectual property rights required for its business, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's revenues, financial condition or results of operations;inability to successfully compete for highly qualified personnel from other companies and organizations;failure to achieve the strategic objectives, including expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits at the time anticipated or at all with respect to Shire's acquisitions, including NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc., Dyax Corp. or Baxalta Incorporated may adversely affect Shire's financial condition and results of operations;Shire's growth strategy depends in part upon its ability to expand its product portfolio through external collaborations, which, if unsuccessful, may adversely affect the development and sale of its products;a slowdown of global economic growth, or economic instability of countries in which Shire does business, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, that adversely impact the availability and cost of credit and customer purchasing and payment patterns, including the collectability of customer accounts receivable;failure of a marketed product to work effectively or if such a product is the cause of adverse side effects could result in damage to Shire's reputation, the withdrawal of the product and legal action against Shire;investigations or enforcement action by regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies relating to Shire's activities in the highly regulated markets in which it operates may result in significant legal costs and the payment of substantial compensation or fines;Shire is dependent on information technology and its systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from service disruptions, the loss of sensitive or confidential information, cyber-attacks and other security breaches or data leakages that could have a material adverse effect on Shire's revenues, financial condition or results of operations;Shire incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the Baxalta acquisition, which may decrease its business flexibility and increase borrowing costs; anda further list and description of risks, uncertainties and other matters can be found in Shire's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Shire's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, in each case including those risks outlined in "ITEM 1A: Risk Factors", and in Shire's subsequent reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, all of which are available on Shire's website.All forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
