Universal Announces Appointment of David A. Tutas to General Counsel






September 26, 2011 04:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Universal Forest Products, Inc. (Nasdaq: UFPI), announced that David A. 
      Tutas has been named general counsel of the corporation. He succeeds 
      Matthew J. Missad, who was appointed chief executive officer of the 
      Company earlier this year.
    


      Tutas joined Universal full-time as an attorney in 2003. In 2007, he was 
      named director of the legal department at Universal. He is a 1991 
      graduate of Xavier University, in Ohio, and a 1996 graduate of the 
      University of Minnesota Law School. Before he joined Universal, he was 
      an attorney with the Grand Rapids, Michigan-based firm of Nantz, 
      Litowich, Smith & Girard.
    

      “Dave Tutas’ legal expertise, his knowledge of our company and business, 
      his work ethic and unquestionable character and integrity make him the 
      perfect person for this important position,” Missad said. “He will 
      provide sound legal counsel to our company and board as we grow and 
      develop in the coming years, and in many markets and industries.”
    

      “I look forward to contributing to the growth and success of Universal 
      Forest Products in new ways,” Tutas said. “I’m honored by the 
      opportunity and will work hard to provide the company with legal advice 
      to protect our interests and to help us grow in all areas of our 
      business and operations.”

			Prior to his tenure with Universal Forest Products, he was an attorney with Nantz, Litowich, Smith & Girard, a firm based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Tutas holds a JD from the University of Minnesota Law School and completed his undergraduate studies at Xavier University in Ohio. 

In serving as the company's general counsel, Tutas steps into the position held by Matthew J. Missad prior to his promotion to the position of chief executive officer, earlier in the year.   

“David Tutas' legal expertise, his knowledge of our company and business, his work ethic and unquestionable character and integrity make him the perfect person for this important position. He will provide sound legal counsel to our company and board as we grow and develop in the coming years, and in many markets and industries,” said Missad.

Tutas remarked that he is honored to have the chance to work with the company and looks “forward to contributing to the growth and success of Universal Forest Products in new ways.”

Universal Forest Products, Inc. is a leading US producer and distributor of wood and wood-substitute products. The Michigan-based company has operations throughout North America and serves the “retail/dealer, site built construction, manufactured housing, and industrial markets.”
