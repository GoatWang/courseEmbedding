Picture a patient





Chances are, you imagined someone in an exam room with a runny nose, a broken arm, or an itchy rash. Sure, that’s a part of it. 




But we’re patients well before we put on a paper gown
when we’re checking insurance benefits, finding a doctor, submitting claims, filling prescriptions… We need someone to look after us then, too.





Zocdoc is for patients
We created Zocdoc to solve patient problems, beginning with online appointment-booking – and we haven’t stopped building since. With Zocdoc, you can see doctors’ open appointment times and book instantly online, make informed choices with verified reviews, and stay on top of important checkups with tailored reminders. And those pesky waiting room forms? Fill them out online, just once, and keep them forever.





We’ll keep dreaming up solutions
Of course, your healthcare experience probably isn’t perfect yet. But no matter what, we’ll continue to put the patient’s needs first. We simply believe there’s no better way to deliver the great healthcare experience we all deserve.











The team behind Zocdoc

My family has a 300 year old tradition of being doctors and I believe old fashioned values can be combined with modern medicine and technology. I work at Zocdoc because I want to build a service that puts patients first.










I've been into computers since I was young and I like creating new products that make people's lives better. I work at Zocdoc because it's a great use of technology to improve healthcare.










I don't believe that business and social change have to be mutually exclusive. Our healthcare system needs improvement and I believe in working to do that.










Zocdoc is working to transform healthcare, a lofty goal we will accomplish if we do the best by, and bring the best out of, our great people. I'm thrilled to focus on growing our business in new ways and on Zocdoc's greatest asset: our team.

Company — PatientPing






















































Our company



Our Story







 We believe that all patients should experience seamless care. We are building a movement of providers across the country who are transforming how healthcare is delivered by working together to put patients at the center of their care.Every year, a patient visits an average of seven providers across four facilities. These providers rarely have the ability to coordinate beyond their own facilities, and often don’t know where else their patients are receiving care. As a result, providers cannot share critical medical information, patient safety is compromised, and transitions from hospital to home are disjointed and drawn out.Our real-time Pings allow providers to easily communicate across facilities ensuring that all care revolves around the patient.Our Values







  We deliver simple, bold solutions.
We believe that simple innovations can solve big problems. We strive to create intuitive experiences that address critical needs.
Our strength is in our community.
We take immense pride in the work of our community. We find that people united by a common purpose can achieve great things.
We are driven by passion and curiosity.
Our goal is to transform how care is delivered by putting patients at the center of their care. We are motivated by deeply understanding the needs of providers and patients alike.
We do well only if we do good.
We only charge for the value you receive. Period.
Our customers’ trust is core.
We handle each patient record as if it were our own, we act with the highest integrity, and we always keep our word.Join Our TeamWe are building a team of passionate, supportive, and energetic people who feel urgency to transform the healthcare delivery system. Interested?

	Companies that are applying for new trademarks are likely to be investing in R&D and marketing, attempting to expand more rapidly or pivoting to reach strategic markets.

Picture a patient





Chances are, you imagined someone in an exam room with a runny nose, a broken arm, or an itchy rash. Sure, that’s a part of it. 




But we’re patients well before we put on a paper gown
when we’re checking insurance benefits, finding a doctor, submitting claims, filling prescriptions… We need someone to look after us then, too.





Zocdoc is for patients
We created Zocdoc to solve patient problems, beginning with online appointment-booking – and we haven’t stopped building since. With Zocdoc, you can see doctors’ open appointment times and book instantly online, make informed choices with verified reviews, and stay on top of important checkups with tailored reminders. And those pesky waiting room forms? Fill them out online, just once, and keep them forever.





We’ll keep dreaming up solutions
Of course, your healthcare experience probably isn’t perfect yet. But no matter what, we’ll continue to put the patient’s needs first. We simply believe there’s no better way to deliver the great healthcare experience we all deserve.











The team behind Zocdoc
See everyone







My family has a 300 year old tradition of being doctors and I believe old fashioned values can be combined with modern medicine and technology. I work at Zocdoc because I want to build a service that puts patients first.










I've been into computers since I was young and I like creating new products that make people's lives better. I work at Zocdoc because it's a great use of technology to improve healthcare.










I don't believe that business and social change have to be mutually exclusive. Our healthcare system needs improvement and I believe in working to do that.










Zocdoc is working to transform healthcare, a lofty goal we will accomplish if we do the best by, and bring the best out of, our great people. I'm thrilled to focus on growing our business in new ways and on Zocdoc's greatest asset: our team.










What we have seen from Zocdoc so far is just the tip of the iceberg. I am excited to use the power of technology to reshape healthcare into the experience we all deserve.
