      THIS TERM SHEET (“TERM SHEET”) CONTAINS THE 
      PRINCIPAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A POTENTIAL RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTION 
      (THE “RESTRUCTURING”) AMONG (A) EB 
      HOLDINGS II, INC., A NEVADA CORPORATION (THE “COMPANY”), 
      (B) HOWARD M. MEYERS (“MEYERS” OR “SPONSOR”) 
      AND (C) EACH OF THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS (OR INVESTMENT MANAGERS OR 
      ADVISORS FOR THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS) OF THE COMPANY’S PIK LOAN FACILITY 
      (THE “PIK LOAN”) IN THE ORIGINAL PRINCIPAL 
      AMOUNT OF 600,000,000 EUROS WHO BECOME A PARTY TO A RESTRUCTURING 
      SUPPORT AGREEMENT (THE “RSA”), AS DESCRIBED 
      BELOW (COLLECTIVELY, THE “CONSENTING PIK HOLDERS”).
    

      THIS TERM SHEET HAS BEEN PRODUCED FOR DISCUSSION AND SETTLEMENT PURPOSES 
      ONLY. THIS TERM SHEET IS NOT AN OFFER OR A SOLICITATION WITH RESPECT TO 
      ANY LOAN INSTRUMENTS OR SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY. ANY SUCH OFFER OR 
      SOLICITATION SHALL COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS.
    



Parties:


           
        


            The parties to this Term Sheet (the “Parties”) 
            are (i) the Company, (ii) Meyers, and (iii) certain holders of the 
            PIK Loan who are managed accounts and/or affiliates of GoldenTree 
            Asset Management LP, Alcentra Limited, Fortress Investment 
            Group/Mount Kellet Capital Management, HIG Capital International 
            Advisors LLP/Bayside Capital, Sound Point Capital Management, LP, 
            and Värde Partners Europe Limited (such holders, collectively, the 
            “PIK Holder Committee”). The PIK 
            Holder Committee represents that it collectively holds 
            approximately 77% of the PIK Loan. As used in this Term Sheet, “PIK 
            Holders” means all holders of the PIK Loan, including those 
            who are Parties.
          








           
        



The Restructuring:
        




The Loan Settlement: In the 
            Restructuring, the PIK Loan will be retired in its entirety in 
            exchange for the PIK Holders receiving majority interest of the 
            equity (common shares and preferred shares if issued) of the 
            Company and in addition Company debt not exceeding 525 million 
            euros of a five-year secured Note or the cash proceeds resulting 
            from the sale of such securities (the “Loan Settlement Amount”). 
            The interest rate on the Note will be at market, reflecting the 
            average ratings of Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.
          

             
          

            Sponsor will contribute 10 million euros cash to be paid to the 
            Company upon the effective date of the Chapter 11 Plan and will 
            cause to be made the “RSR Contribution” (as defined below). In 
            consideration the Sponsor (and its affiliates) will receive a 
            minority interest of the equity (common shares and preferred 
            shares if issued) of the Company.
          

             
          

            For the avoidance of doubt, 100% of the Loan Settlement Amount 
            would be provided to the PIK Holders on account of their interests 
            in the PIK Loan, and no portion of the Loan Settlement Amount 
            would be provided to any non-PIK Holder.
          

             
          

Funding: On the RSA Effective Date 
            (defined below), the Sponsor will provide into an escrow account, 
            10 million euros for payment (the “Deposit”) for the benefit of 
            the Company. The Deposit will be considered the Sponsor’s 
            contribution in connection with the Loan Settlement Amount. The 
            Deposit will only be refunded to the Sponsor should the Pre-Pack 
            Chapter 11 Plan not be effectuated as a result of actions not 
            caused by Sponsor.
          

             
          

RSR Contribution: On or before the 
            effective date of the Plan, Sponsor will cause RSR Corporation to 
            transfer to the Company all agreements relevant to Eco-Bat 
            Technologies, including but not limited to necessary contracts, 
            permits, IT, IP and technology systems.
          

             
          

            The RSR Services Management Agreement including the entitlement to 
            receive 5% of the pre-tax earnings of Eco-Bat Technologies and the 
            New York, Indiana and California Plant Facilities Management 
            Agreements (along with their incentive entitlements) will be 
            transferred to the Company. Included in the transfers will be all 
            employees, pensions and various fringe benefit programs currently 
            being utilized to operate Eco-Bat America.
          

             
          

            It is expected that the Company’s board and presumably the board 
            members they elect to be nominees on the Eco-Bat Technologies 
            board, will continue current personnel globally and will institute 
            the necessary commitments and incentive programs.
          

             
          

            Regarding Meyers position with the Company, he is amenable to 
            serving the remainder of his employment contract as Chairman of 
            Eco-Bat Technologies or an Executive Position mutually agreeable. 
            Should the Consenting PIK Holders direct the Company to conduct a 
            sale in bankruptcy pursuant to section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code 
            rather than take the Loan Settlement Amount, Meyers commits to 
            assisting.
          








           
        



RSA





RSA: As soon as practicable, but not 
            later than 30 days from the date of this Term Sheet (unless 
            extended with the express written consent of the Parties), the 
            Company, Sponsor, and the Consenting PIK Holders would enter into 
            the RSA, which would incorporate the terms set forth in this Term 
            Sheet and such other terms and conditions as are customary for 
            restructuring transactions of this type.
          

             
          

            The RSA must be (i) in form and substance satisfactory to the 
            Company, the Sponsor, and the Consenting PIK Holders and (ii) 
            signed by Consenting PIK Holders constituting at least the holders 
            of 95% in principal amount of the PIK Loan, which Consenting PIK 
            Holders must include all PIK Holder Committee members (and their 
            affiliates) and all other PIK Holders (and their affiliates) that 
            are parties to the Nevada Litigation, and provided that the 
            Company and Meyers may reduce the 95% threshold in their sole 
            discretion. The RSA will become effective on a date (the “RSA 
            Effective Date”) that is not later than five business days 
            prior to the filing of a Bankruptcy petition.
          








           
        



Implementation





            The Restructuring will be implemented through a pre-packaged plan 
            of reorganization (“Plan”) under 
            Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (a “Chapter 
            11 Case”) in which the Company is the debtor. The form of 
            the Plan will be an exhibit to the RSA, and the Consenting PIK 
            Holders, the Company and the Sponsor will agree to support the 
            Plan in the RSA.
          

             
          

Mutual Release: Upon the RSA 
            Effective Date, (i) all litigation among the Parties (the 
            “Litigation”) would be dismissed with prejudice, and (ii) the 
            Consenting PIK Holders, the Company, Meyers and each of their 
            respective employees, directors, partners, advisors, 
            representatives and affiliates would be granted full, 
            unconditional and irrevocable mutual releases ((i) and (ii), 
            together, the “Mutual Release”). The Mutual Release would require 
            the release by (x) all parties to the Litigation and (y) PIK 
            Holders representing at least 95% of the principal amount then 
            outstanding of the PIK Loan: provided, however, that Sponsor and 
            the Company would have the right, in their discretion, to reduce 
            such 95% requirement.
          








           
        



Transaction Documents:
        




            In addition to the RSA, the transaction documents would include, 
            among others, an acquisition agreement, a loan 
            modification/exchange agreement and such other agreements as are 
            necessary to implement the Restructuring.
          

             
          

            The transaction documents would contain representations, 
            covenants, closing conditions and such other terms as are 
            customary for transactions of this type.
          








           
        



Miscellaneous:
        




Fees/Expenses: After exiting Chapter 
            11 and the Company’s new board has been nominated by the 
            Shareholders, the said new board will determine the Company’s 
            reimbursement policy relating to the reasonable and documented 
            fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the professionals in 
            this said matter.
          

             
          

Structuring: It is understood that 
            this Term Sheet does not represent all of the material terms of 
            the Restructuring and requires continued development by the 
            Parties.
          

             
          

Nature of this Term Sheet: This Term 
            Sheet is non-binding and may be withdrawn at any time. No Party is 
            obligated to enter into or consummate any agreement. It is 
            expressly understood that any restructuring or modification of 
            existing agreements will require definitive written agreements 
            executed by the Parties. No continued discussions, letters of 
            intent, or other communications shall be deemed to create any such 
            obligation. In no event shall this Term Sheet, the proposed terms 
            of the Restructuring, the discussions with respect to this Term 
            Sheet or any subsequent communications, letters of intent, draft 
            documents or work product of the Parties or their respective 
            employees, directors, affiliates or advisors or other 
            representatives be used in any litigation, bankruptcy or other 
            proceedings or constitute an admission of any kind.
          








           
        



Upon agreement and filing of a Pre-Pack Chapter 11 Plan and its 
      acceptance by the Court, in accordance with the above terms and 
      conditions, then after such filing and acceptance by the Court, and 
      prior to the Effective Date of the Chapter 11 Plan, should the 
      Consenting PIK Holders request, Sponsor is prepared to undertake an all 
      cash transaction. Subsequent to successfully arranging the 
      alternative all cash transaction, the original Pre-Pack Chapter 11 Plan 
      submitted to the Court would be amended as defined in the terms and 
      conditions enumerated below.


Should the Consenting PIK Holders request the all cash option and 
      should Sponsor not successfully complete the transaction, the original 
      restructuring filed under the Pre-Pack Chapter 11 Plan as enumerated 
      above would continue to remain in effect.


EB HOLDINGS II, INC.


Summary of Key Alternative Restructuring Terms


      THIS TERM SHEET (“TERM SHEET”) CONTAINS THE 
      PRINCIPAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A POTENTIAL RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTION 
      (THE “ALTERNATIVE RESTRUCTURING”) 
      AMONG (A) EB HOLDINGS II, INC., A NEVADA CORPORATION (THE “COMPANY”), 
      (B) HOWARD M. MEYERS (“MEYERS” OR “SPONSOR”) 
      AND (C) EACH OF THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS (OR INVESTMENT MANAGERS OR 
      ADVISORS FOR THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS) OF THE COMPANY’S PIK LOAN FACILITY 
      (THE “PIK LOAN”) IN THE ORIGINAL PRINCIPAL 
      AMOUNT OF 600,000,000 EUROS WHO BECOME A PARTY TO A RESTRUCTURING 
      SUPPORT AGREEMENT (THE “RSA”), AS DESCRIBED 
      BELOW (COLLECTIVELY, THE “CONSENTING PIK HOLDERS”).
    

      THIS TERM SHEET HAS BEEN PRODUCED FOR DISCUSSION AND SETTLEMENT PURPOSES 
      ONLY. THIS TERM SHEET IS NOT AN OFFER OR A SOLICITATION WITH RESPECT TO 
      ANY LOAN INSTRUMENTS OR SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY. ANY SUCH OFFER OR 
      SOLICITATION SHALL COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS.
    



Parties:


           
        


            The parties to this Term Sheet (the “Parties”) 
            are (i) the Company, (ii) Meyers, and (iii) certain holders of the 
            PIK Loan who are managed accounts and/or affiliates of GoldenTree 
            Asset Management LP, Alcentra Limited, Fortress Investment 
            Group/Mount Kellet Capital Management, HIG Capital International 
            Advisors LLP/Bayside Capital, Sound Point Capital Management, LP, 
            and Värde Partners Europe Limited (such holders, collectively, the 
            “PIK Holder Committee”). The PIK 
            Holder Committee represents that it collectively holds 
            approximately 77% of the PIK Loan. As used in this Term Sheet, “PIK 
            Holders” means all holders of the PIK Loan, including those 
            who are Parties.
          








           
        



The Restructuring:
        




            In the Alternative Restructuring, the PIK Loan would be retired in 
            its entirety in exchange for cash (the “Alternative 
            Loan Settlement”). The Alternative Loan 
            Settlement would be accomplished through a revised pre-arranged 
            plan (the “Revised Plan”) in the case 
            previously commenced by the Company under Chapter 11 of the United 
            States Bankruptcy Code (the “Chapter 11 Case”).
          

             
          

The Alternative Loan Settlement: The 
            Alternative Loan Settlement would be in an amount (the “Alternative 
            Loan Settlement Amount”) equal to 625 million euros, 
            consisting of all cash (the “Plan Funding”), 
            which represents the final and maximum consideration the Sponsor 
            and affiliates will consider. For the avoidance of doubt, this 
            structure envisions the PIK Holders receiving all cash free of 
            liability encumbrances. 100% of the Alternative Loan Settlement 
            Amount would be paid to all the holders of the PIK Loan (the “PIK 
            Holders”) on account of their interests in the PIK Loan and 
            no portion of the Alternative Loan Settlement Amount would be paid 
            to any non-PIK Holder.
          

             
          

            For avoidance of doubt, upon the Alternative Transaction being 
            consummated, 100% of the equity of the Company will be owned by 
            the Sponsor (and affiliates).
          

             
          

Consensual Transfer: If Sponsor does 
            not complete the Plan Funding, the original Pre-Pack Chapter 11 
            Plan above would continue to be in effect.
          

             
          

Mutual Release: For avoidance of 
            doubt, the Alternative Restructuring contemplates as referenced 
            above, upon the RSA Effective Date, (i) all litigation among the 
            Parties (the “Litigation”) would be 
            dismissed with prejudice, and (ii) the PIK Holders, the Company, 
            Meyers and each of their respective employees, directors, 
            partners, advisors, representatives and affiliates would be 
            granted full, unconditional and irrevocable mutual releases ((i) 
            and (ii), together, the “Mutual Release”). 
            The Mutual Release would require the release by (x) all parties to 
            the Litigation and (y) PIK Holders representing at least 95% of 
            the principal amount then outstanding of the PIK Loan; provided, 
            however, that Meyers and the Company 
            would have the right, in their discretion, to reduce such 95% 
            requirement.
          








           
        



Conditions to the Plan:
        




            The Alternative Restructuring contemplated in this Term Sheet 
            would be expressly conditioned upon confirmation of the Revised 
            Plan (“Confirmation”) as referred to 
            above.
          








           
        



Transaction Documents:
        




            The transaction documents would include an acquisition agreement, 
            a loan modification/exchange agreement and such other agreements 
            as are necessary to implement the Revised Plan.
          

             
          

            The transaction documents would contain representations, 
            covenants, closing conditions and such other terms as are 
            customary for transactions of this type.
          

             
          

            There would be no adjustments in respect of the Alternative Loan 
            Settlement Amount.
          

             
          

Structuring: It is understood that 
            this Term Sheet does not represent all of the material terms of 
            the Restructuring and requires continued development by the 
            Parties.
          








           
        



Miscellaneous:
        




Fees/Expenses: The Company would 
            reimburse the Consenting PIK Holders for the reasonable and 
            documented fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Consenting PIK 
            Holders and their advisors relating to the negotiation, 
            documentation, and consummation of the Restructuring and the 
            Alternative Restructuring. Payments of such fees and expenses will 
            be made immediately upon the Plan Effective Date, up to a cap for 
            all such reimbursements of $8.5 million. For the avoidance of 
            doubt, the amounts to be paid on account of such fees and expenses 
            would be separate from the Alternative Loan Settlement Amount.
          

             
          

Nature of this Term Sheet: This Term 
            Sheet is non-binding and may be withdrawn at any time. No Party is 
            obligated to enter into or consummate any agreement. It is 
            expressly understood that any restructuring or modification of 
            existing agreements will require definitive written agreements 
            executed by the Parties. No continued discussions, letters of 
            intent, or other communications shall be deemed to create any such 
            obligation. In no event shall this Term Sheet, the proposed terms 
            of the Alternative Restructuring, the discussions with respect to 
            this Term Sheet or any subsequent communications, letters of 
            intent, draft documents or work product of the Parties or their 
            respective employees, directors, affiliates or advisors or other 
            representatives be used in any litigation, bankruptcy or other 
            proceedings or constitute an admission of any kind.

      2. It should be noted that certain U.S. tax liabilities may arise if 
      EBH II restructures the Loan.


      In connection with any potential restructuring of EBH II’s indebtedness 
      (whether out of court or in bankruptcy), there is a possibility that EBH 
      II may realize material taxable income under certain U.S. federal income 
      tax rules related to the treatment of foreign currency gains. Any such 
      taxable income would arise because EBH II’s functional currency is the 
      U.S. dollar and the Loan is denominated in Euros. Although not free from 
      doubt, it is possible that such income may be partially or fully offset

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.                
                
                NetDania expressly disclaims any liability for any lost principal or profits which without limitation may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on information on our website or the use of our software with broker integration.
