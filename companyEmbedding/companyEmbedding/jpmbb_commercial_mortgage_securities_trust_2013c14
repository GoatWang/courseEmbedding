      Fitch Affirms 13 Classes of JPMBB 2013-C14
    





June 22, 2016 04:22 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 13 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMBB) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2013-C14. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are the result of stable performance of the underlying 
      pool since issuance. As of the June 2016 distribution date, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 3.6% to $1.11 billion 
      from $1.15 billion at issuance. The pool has experienced no realized 
      losses to date. One loan (0.7%) is defeased. Fitch has designated three 
      loans (8.6%) as Fitch Loans of Concern (FLOC), which includes one 
      specially serviced loan (0.8%). Interest shortfalls are currently 
      affecting class NR.
    

      The largest loan of concern is the Plaza La Cienega loan (5.5% of the 
      pool), which is secured by a 308,143 square foot (sf) mixed use center 
      (83% retail; 17% office) located in Los Angeles, CA. Retail tenants 
      include LA Fitness (21% net rentable are [NRA]), Toys R' Us (20% NRA), 
      and Ross Dress for Less (8.8% NRA). The loan has been identified as a 
      FLOC due to the recent vacancy of Staples (previously 7.8% NRA), which 
      vacated the property upon its lease expiration in November 2015. Current 
      occupancy is 89%, compared to 99% at issuance. According to REIS, market 
      fundamentals remain strong with vacancy for the Los Angeles 
      Westside/Downtown submarket reporting at 4%. The year-end (YE) 2015 net 
      operating income (NOI) debt service coverage (DSCR) reported at 1.70x, 
      compared to 1.65x at YE 2014 and 1.38x at issuance. The loan remains 
      current as of the June 2016 remittance.
    

      The second largest loan of concern is the 575 Maryville Centre Drive 
      (2.3%), which is secured by a 258,441 sf class B office tower in St. 
      Louis, MO. The loan has been identified as a FLOC due to significant 
      tenant vacancies. At issuance the largest tenant, Solutia, had subleased 
      45,000 sf of its total 121,000 sf (46.6% NRA) leased space to Cequel 
      concurrent with Solutia's original lease which expires in June 2018. The 
      servicer reported that Solutia had vacated the remaining 76,000 sf in 
      November 2015 but continues to remit rental payments. In addition, the 
      second largest tenant, Saavis Communication Corp. (98,640 sf, or 35.6% 
      NRA) recently amended its lease to only extend 46,000 sf of its current 
      space through June 2022 and will vacate the remaining 52,640 sf upon its 
      June 2017 lease expiration. As of December 2015 the servicer reports the 
      property as 100% leased with an NOI DSCR of 2.42x. The loan remains 
      current as of the June 2016 remittance.
    

      The specially serviced loan (0.8%) is secured by a 225-room full 
      service, Sheraton Four Points Hotel located in San Diego, CA. The loan 
      had transferred to special servicing in February 2016 due to payment 
      default in December 2015. Property performance has declined since 
      issuance with net operating income (NOI) debt service coverage (DSCR) 
      reporting at 1.16x for year-end (YE) 2015, which is an improvement from 
      YE 2014 at 0.53x but remains significantly below issuance at 1.76x. The 
      property had become several months past due on payables owed to numerous 
      vendors and for utility bills, which triggered a cash flow sweep and 
      emergency funds remitted by the servicer to the property manager to keep 
      the property operational. The servicer inspected the property in 
      February 2016 where the property was found to be in fair condition with 
      numerous instances of deferred maintenance. A pre-negotiation agreement 
      was executed and a receiver was put in place in April 2016. The borrower 
      filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2016, and the servicer is 
      currently navigating the bankruptcy process.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook remains Stable for all classes. Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics. 
      Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 
      'J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2013-C14' (May 
      2, 2014), available at www.fitchratings.com.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the eleven P&I Classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges.




The ratings on IO Class X-A was affirmed based on the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of its referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 4.0% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.9% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 3.7% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 2.8% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion 
CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Cl. X-A 
was "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only 
Securities" published in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies 
page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.




Please note that on February 27, 2017, Moody's released a 
"Request for Comment" in which it has requested market feedback on proposed 
changes to its methodology for rating structured finance interest-only 
(IO) securities called "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only Securities," dated October 20, 2015. 
If Moody's adopts the new methodology as proposed, the changes could 
affect the ratings of JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust, 
Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C14. 
Please see "Moody's Proposes Revised Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only (IO) Securities", which is available at www.moodys.com, 
for more information about the implications of the proposed changes to 
the methodology on Moody's ratings.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is . The pool has a Herf of 20, 
compared to 21 at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the March 17, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 7.0% to $1.07 
billion from $1.15 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 45 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 9% of the pool, with the top ten loans 
constituting 60.5% of the pool. Two loans, 
constituting 2.1% of the pool, have defeased and are 
secured by US government securities.




Three loans, constituting 1.3% of the pool, 
are on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance. 




No loans have been liquidated from the pool since securitization. 
One loan, the Four Points Sheraton -- San Diego ($8.98 
million -- 0.8% of the pool), is in special servicing. 
The loan is secured by a 225-room full service hotel built in 1987 
and located in Kearny Mesa, approximately 10 miles north of the 
San Diego CBD. The loan transferred to special servicing in February 
2016 due to imminent default followed by a monetary default. The 
Borrower filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2016.




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 98% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 73%. 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 99%, compared 
to 90% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 21% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.7%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.61X and 1.09X, 
respectively, compared to 1.84X and 1.24X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's 
actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 26.7% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the Meadows Mall Loan ($100 
million -- 9.4% of the pool), which represents 
a pari passu portion of a $150 million mortgage loan. The 
loan is secured by the borrower's interest in a 945,000 square foot 
(SF) regional mall located five miles west of the Strip in Las Vegas, 
Nevada. The mall is anchored by Dillard's, JC Penney, 
Sears and Macy's. In-line tenant sales for tenants less 
than 10,000 SF were approximately $379 per square foot (PSF) 
in December 2016 compared to $383 PSF a year earlier in December 
2015. The total mall was 97.6% leased as of December 
2016, slightly down from 98.4% in December 2015. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 97% and 1.06X, respectively, 
compared to 97.7% and 1.05X at last review.




The second largest loan is the Spirit Portfolio Loan ($97.1 
million -- 9.1% of the pool), which is secured 
by a portfolio of 26 properties including retail, industrial, 
office, and mixed-use. The collateral is located in 
13 different states. The top five states by allocated loan balance 
are Illinois (19%), New Hampshire (13%), Texas 
(12%), North Carolina (11%), and Indiana (11%). 
Twenty-five of the 26 properties are leased to single tenants. 
The portfolio was fully leased as of June 2016, the same as at last 
review. Several tenants have leases at more than one property: 
LA Fitness leases two properties; CVS leases four properties; 
Walgreens leases two properties; Ferguson Enterprises leases three 
properties; and Tractor Supply leases two properties. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 81.5% and 1.29X, 
respectively.




The third largest loan is the 589 Fifth Avenue Loan ($87.5 
million -- 8.2% of the pool), which represents 
a pari passu interest in a $175 million mortgage loan. The 
collateral is a 17-story, 173,000 SF office and retail 
property located near the Diamond District in New York City. The 
entire retail portion is leased to H&M through July 2033. The 
office portion is mostly leased to jeweler tenants. No office tenant 
accounts for more than 5% of the net rentable area. The 
property was 100% leased as of June 2016, and the same as 
at last review. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 99.8% 
and 0.88X, respectively, the same as at last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation

are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to

This news came on the heels of a report from the Commerce Department stating that retail sales declined 0.3%... 
US REITs Feeling Effects from Turmoil in Greece and ChinaInternational economic forces have taken center stage this week, affecting both US stock markets and REITs.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
