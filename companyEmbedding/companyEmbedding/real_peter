4.0 out of 5 starsInformative but be cautiousBySatyrman63on August 11, 2014I am only about 15 months late getting this review posted but I must say that in the meantime my opinion has not changed. Several parts of this book were very interesting and make perfect sense (the part on education, for example) and there are parts that if one had followed the investment advice would have been deleterious to your financial health.I have followed Mr. Schiff's work for years as well as that of his former business associate, Mr. Pento. While much of what they write I believe, it may not happen for another 20 years and following their advice would have cost an investor quite a bit of money during the period 2009-2014. Again, I have read many other books by Mr. Schiff along with his articles that used to appear on a regular basis on the Financial Sense website.The biggest problem with Peter's work, ultimately, is that he is a zealot on and adheres to a certain way of investing no matter what the current circumstances may be. Have I bought shares in companies he recommended? Yes. Do I believe the US dollar is being devalued? Yes. Do I believe one should own stocks/currency not denominated in US Dollars? Yes, but to a certain extent.One has to be flexible when investing and sometimes leave your dogma at the door, for a while anyway, to make money. I understand one of the motivating factors that drives Mr. Schiff so against the Federales  but hey, it happened a long time ago.The last point I will make is that reading many of Schiff's and Pento's works one comes away with just a feeling that they are waiting to take particular glee when the average citizen falls into the abyss just so they can say "I told you so".  There just seems to be a "nasty" quality that percolates throughout their books under the surface.

3.0 out of 5 starsGood overall readByScott Bon April 3, 2014Overall, this is an interesting read and perspective - a not very optimistic but, at least according to Mr. Schiff, predictable near-term erosion of America's preeminent positioning based on currently unsustainable entitlements and big government.When Mr. Schiff deviates from his subject matter expertise and makes larger generalizations based on speculation (as opposed to data), empirically driven readers may believe he looses some of his credibility in what is otherwise a book predominately driven by numbers.There is also clearly an agenda of Mr. Schiff to educate the reader with an objective of having the audience consider investing assets in his financial management companies. There is nothing inappropriate about this; the informed reader should just recognize that ultimate objective, but it doesn't distract from the overall relevance of much of what Mr. Schiff cites as fundamental (and somewhat intractable) challenges. His proposed remedies, while intriguing, are predominately unrealistic.

Will he be correct again? Before I read the book, my view was aligned with what I now know is his view.As a contrarian view, he gets blasted on MSM sites, but in this book and today in the MSM, he's spot on. Worth the currency spent to hear his (and others) point of view. Then you decide. He's one of the few I read to get fact based unvarnished data to make decisions.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsExcellent book about the reality and reality to comeByHui Wangon March 10, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis book has been an eye opener for me. Although I have worked in investment banks for more than 12 years, I have never looked at US economy on a grand scale. My gut feeling has been warning me that something really bad happened and is about to happen in US, and this book finally said them out loud and showed me what to do. The only reason I didn't give a five star is simply because I think the author is too optimistic about Chinese economy and downplayed the burden of bad Chinese political system's weight on the economy, probably because I grew up in China while the author did not. Overall, it's excellent book, very practical and prophetic. I would recommend it to anyone who's willing to be open-minded.0Comment|

Schiff is one of the few economists involved in politics who tells the complete and unbiased truth about the U.S. economy and it's leaders.  Both the Democrats and the Republicans are bought and paid for by corporations, special interests, and government dependents (not just "welfare" recipients, but the much larger percentage of Medicare, social security, and government paycheck recipients).  Neither party is willing to prevent a Greece-like outcome (actually it will be much worse) because it would require them to relinquish votes, and therefore, power.  Only when there is massive unemployment and rioting in the streets will we get serious about real reform.  By then it may be too late.  With no one to bail us out, we will be in danger of losing the standard of living that has set us apart form the rest of the world for the last 60 years.  Schiff's book serves as a warning about the impending crisis, and gives recommendations about how individuals can save themselves, if not their country.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsVery well written book and an entertaining readByCinquainon February 14, 2013Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchasePeter Schiff is an incredibly smart individual (although he might try to be humble and claim that he is not) and his brilliance shows in this book. It took me roughly five days to read this book and I have a full time job and off work projects but even with my tight schedule, I still found the book easy to read and addictive. In summary, this book is very educational and entertaining. Schiff educates the reader in the realms of economics, employment regulations, banking, taxes, investments, and even history. The insights and understandings I gained from this book are enormous. It was equivalent to a brain massage. As I was reading this book, I could hear Peter's voice speaking in my head because his style of writing is very similar to how he speaks. I have to admit, this book only spends one chapter covering method of investments. However, it is important to keep in mind that when it comes to investment advices, Schiff is limited due to regulations from big government (as he ironically mentions in his book as well). I highly recommend this book to anyone who is concerned about the economy and deeply interested in understanding how we got there, how can we fix it, and most importantly what can you do to avoid it and prosper. I also hope that Schiff continues to fight the good fight and producing good work such as this one.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsBe afraidByBerl Kaufmanon August 19, 2012Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseBe afraid, be very afraid.This is not a book to "enjoy," as others have put itIt is a book to heed, as with all of Mr. Schiff's books.Every politician needs to read this book.  And every investor should read this book.Indeed, anyone who is concerned about the welfare of their family or their community needs to heed the warnings that Schiff writes about here.I have been listening to Schiff on his radio program since he began broadcasting.  I have read all his books.  In fact, I read his father's books when they first came out back in the seventies.  The younger Schiff had a phenomonal mentor in Irwin.  Irwin gave him a solid grounding in what I call "common sense" economics.  There is no hocus-pocus "we can spend our way out of this mess" economic theory, as propounded by the likes of Paul Krugman.  Everything Peter says is well thought out and grounded in reality.  And he always returns to base principles and values whenever confronted with sticky situations.  While he certainly promotes his company on the air and in his books, what he promotes politically and economically actually would counter his investment advice if those ideas would be followed.  I haven't a bit of a problem with this self-promotion, as it represents the essence of the free-market.  A truly free market, as presented by Schiff, enriches everyone, as opposed to socialist theories that makes everyone equal, but equally destitute.Schiff has three broad themes in this book:(1) Review of what is realy wrong with the world and US economy today(2) How we can fix these problems by returning to common sense base principles, even it requires a little bit of compromise to make it acceptable to the masses(3) How to protect yourself financial when the inevitable crash occurs - Schiff assumes that no one in power is likely to follow his adviceThis is an important book for our time.  I liken Peter Schiff to a modern day Nathan Hale: one of the great patriots of our time.  We need more books like this, and we need more Peter Schiffs if our economy is to survive.So be afraid for our economy and for your financial health, but don't be afraid to buy this book as soon as possible.0Comment|

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsGood Book on Policy, but Underestimates Government CorruptionByMichael Madisonon September 6, 2012Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseI enjoy all of Peter Schiff's books, and love to listen to his blogs and the one voice of reason on a panel.Peter Schiff and his father have done a great service to our country. Both warned us of the devastating effects of a monetary policy not based on sound money.The example of health care prices applied to a grocery store made it very easy to see why health care is so messed up and was an example of how Peter outlines these issues so clearly.But I think in this book Peter Schiff is way too gracious to the government. For example, most of his policies are based on the premise that the government would like to do the right thing but simply implements incorrect and illogical policies. I tend to think that there is a more sinister centralization of power going on that is very deliberate.One sentence in the book speaks to this, he says on p. 248 "Today's government may be bad, and reasonably corrupt, but I doubt it represents the type of threat that would require armed rebellion."This is a government that passed the NDAA, staged Fast and Furious, assassinates Americans, repealed habeas corpus, and disappears people. What other laws will they pass quietly in the night? How long will people do nothing while their fourth amendment is trashed at the airport, and now elsewhere? I don't know how much more it takes for people to see that we are already in the early stages of tyranny, and disarming the public will be a logical next step in this police state.Most of the Bill of Rights have already been repealed either through Executive Order or just ignoring them, and the Second Amendment will certainly not be exempt from this process, so I am not sure where this faith in our government to do the right thing if they just knew what it was comes from. The policies he outlines are deliberately ignored by this govt because they want centralized power. Maybe we can apply Peter's book when we reinstate the Constitution.The only other thing I take issue with is that our economy, if ran correctly and competently, has plenty of money to help those in poverty. Instead, the banks received trillions of dollars and then Congress debates whether unemployment benefits should be extended. It is quite sad really, but another example of centralized power that is deliberate.Some people remain unemployed because they are educated and qualified and refuse to take crap jobs. As one example, I have noticed that companies hire outside of cities, going nuts with H1B visas while the locally unemployed who are more than qualified for these positions are left out in the cold. I have seen this policy transform entire cultures and cities, and it also acclimates workers to longer hours, worse working conditions, and the constant threat of being replaced. It is not that they cannot find qualified workers locally, it is that companies want these conditions in place and work with the government to put them in place.Is this the new global economy that we want? A properly working government would say no thanks; we would like to employ our people already here. Instead, our government actively offshores jobs and replaces local workers with H1B visa workers, and then cuts off unemployment insurance. What exactly are these folks supposed to do? I guess they could start a business, but we need to be more realistic with what is happening in this economy and how the government actively works AGAINST the interests of U.S. taxpayers and workers.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsDeserves consideration.Byross bob mullins, jron February 13, 2014Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseWhile Peter Schiff is obviously taking advantage of his reputation for accuracy in predicting the Housing Market crash of 2008, his expertise in predicting a crash of the currency market is somewhat in question. His solution is obviously an advertisement for his own commercial interests and brings some degree of suspicion to his analysis. He does, however, raise the significant concern of how far can we go as a nation with a national debt approaching $20 Trillion and remain fiscally sound and trustworthy. Can the American public trust Washington to make the hard decisions to bring us back to fiscal responsibility and what will be the consequences if the government fails to do so?0Comment|

Who is the Real Peter Parker? A Nerdy Analysis of the Spider-Man Films

In modern cinematic history, there have been three big screen Spider-Mans. Spider-Men? Fine. Three big screen Peter Parkers. All three actors have their merits and flaws, but which one is the best? So, to answer the question, I watched Spider-Man (2002) and The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) back to back to refresh my memory on Tobey Maguire’s and Andrew Garfield’s performances. I’ve watched Captain America: Civil War a few times, so Tom Holland’s is already fresh in my mind.
 
My first big revelation: Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man are the same movie. Not just similar, but point for point and beat for beat, the same. You can rename Green Goblin as The Lizard all you want, but they’re still both green. Uncle Ben still dies. Peter still has momentary passive-aggressive revenge. Aunt May is still tragic. The girl is still out of Peter’s league. The CGI is still primitive.
 
Setting that aside, Tobey Maguire’s Peter Parker (as directed by powerhouse Sam Raimi) is a social outcast (check), enduring unrequited love (check), and has to cope with loss (check). He is a tearful, introspective boy-man who is suddenly bestowed with exceptional powers, but who is so buried in angst that he becomes largely uninteresting. Maguire has the “cute thing” down pat as well – a quality that I really never ascribed to Peter Parker, especially as a fringer – but seemed too old to be portraying a high school student.
 
Andrew Garfield’s Peter Parker (as directed by Marc Webb [ha ha ha] has some backbone, where Maguire’s really did not. While he is a social outcast (check), enduring unrequited love (check), and has to cope with loss (check), he at least has some moral character to stand up to the bullies before he becomes a mutant. Garfield is lithe and angular, with a killer smile, but miles away from “cute.” He was more convincing as the class dork than Maguire was, but still seemed too old for the role.
 
With Spider-Man’s entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it was time to upgrade the actor again. Enter Tom Holland as Peter Parker. He is a social outcast (sort of check), dealing with unrequited love (uncheck, insert sexy Aunty May instead), and coping with loss (uncheck, no Martin Sheen or Cliff Robertson Uncle Ben trope to be found). Spider-Man’s entire origin story is told in a couple of quippy paragraphs. Holland has the “cute thing,” rocks the Spider-Man angularity, and actually seems the right age for high school. He also comes with a backbone strong enough to issue a stern warning to self-centered smart-aleck Tony Stark.
 
While Holland has yet to be the featured character in a full film (until now that is, in Spider-Man: Homecoming), I have little doubt that he is the best Spider-Man the theaters have yet seen. He’s a technological whiz kid (like Garfield, but unlike Maguire whose mutations were entirely biological and therefore laughable) who believes that he has the power to do good and is therefore obligated (something the prior Peter Parkers did not adequately demonstrate). I have high hopes for Spider-Man: Homecoming and am looking forward to catching a matinee on my next day off.
 
Speaking of the “cute thing,” the Funko POP! Spider-Man beats out Maguire in cuteness hands down.

For many of us, our garage is used for far more than just a place to store our car (along with all those boxes you haven't unpacked since your last move). It's a place where we work on a range of do-it-yourself tasks, like auto maintenance, woodworking projects, bicycle repairs, and more. Fortunately, Best Buy has a range of products that can help you get the most of that garage space.

If 10 years ago someone had told me that Sony would be competitive in the professional photography world, directly competing with the likes of Canon and Nikon, I would not have believed them. I think the most surprising thing is how they are doing this; not with the traditional DSLR, but instead with full-frame mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras.

Have you ever wondered when the future would arrive? Well, the answer is now. Ever since I was a kid watching The Jetsons, I’ve been waiting for the day where we would have flying cars, hologram video games and food prepared and delivered at the push of a button. It’s safe to say we’re almost there.

Way back in the day I purchased one of the very first windows “smart” phones, and boy did I feel like I had the best phone. Compared to today’s phones I might as well have been using smoke signals. The first real smartphone I ever owned was an Android HTC (can’t remember the exact model), and I immediately loved how customizable the Android platform was.

Wi-Fi networks are the best thing ever. Except when they don't work everywhere you need them. With the increasing number of wireless devices in your home, you may have discovered "Wi-Fi dead spots". Areas where the WiFi signal is weak, spotty or non-existent. The solution may be a whole home Wi-Fi system.

Do I sit at my desk and work on my computer, or do I browse cat photos online from the tablet on the couch? The age old question finally has a good answer, or multiple answers in this case, in the form of some great “convertible” laptops. Also known as “2-in-1s”, these computers can effectively function as either a laptop or a tablet depending on your needs. Perfect for the home office, couch browsing, working on the go and everything in between; we’ve got some of the hottest convertibles to pick up. Summer might be over, but it’s still a great time to buy yourself a new convertible.

All of these indicate the start of the football season (formally called Fall)! When football is on pretty much every day of the week it’s important to ensure you have best tools to watch at home.

As college students prepare to say goodbye to their parents, and high schoolers dread the upcoming coursework, I figured that some students may be a little nervous about what awaits them in and out of the classroom. I know that I am!

Independence Day Resurges

In 1996, Earth was invaded by extraterrestrials whose chief weapons were the cliches and tried-and-true tropes of science fiction. Gigantic spaceships positioned themselves over Earth’s major cities (Childhood’s End, Arthur C. Clarke’s seminal novel of 1953). The aliens were discovered by the detection of a seemingly interstellar broadcast (John Varley’s superior 1977 novel The Ophiuchi Hotline and Carl Sagan’s brilliant Contact). They were biomechanical in nature (Ridley Scott’s classic Alien). They had a gazillion fighters (every Star Wars movie) and impenetrable electromagnetic shields (Star Trek, but only here and there, really). They did not come in peace (every invasion movie in human history, except Steven Spielberg’s amazing Close Encounters of the Third Kind). They were defeated by a computer genius with a Macbook that greeted him with “Hello Dave” (Arthur C. Clarke again in Stanley Kubrick’s singular 2001: A Space Odyssey). In short, way back when Independence Day came out and I saw it for the first time, I left the theater feeling like I’d seen it before.

If you’re a gamer in any regard, you’re probably used to the feeling of looking forward to... something; be it the release of a game, a large event of sorts, or possibly even a simple gathering of friends to talk about what games you’re currently playing. One thing is for certain, though. We all look forward to E3 every year. This year was particularly exciting for me, as I'm a long-time Zelda fan.

Then maybe finding time to cook long and tedious breakfast meals would be as hard as finding the time to make them.  However, if you’re still a passionate health enthusiast, some of the latest and greatest kitchen gadgets may help you compliment your busy lifestyle. A single-serve blender for example would be just what you need - as you rush out for your morning commute.

If you’re a PC builder or hardware enthusiast like I am, chances are high that you have heard the word “Pascal” over the past year a lot and up until now, it was simply what we knew as the name for the next generation of Nvidia’s graphics card architecture. All the waiting and anticipation paid off on May 6th, when Nvidia unveiled details for the upcoming GTX 1080 and 1070 graphics card, and they are very worth the wait indeed.

Have you been in your car and wanted to take a video of something before it happened, or without you being there? I’m hoping by now you are curious and asking yourself, “How do you capture video without being there, or record before an event happens?” Simply put, get yourself a dash camera to capture moments that occur when you are not around and for times when seconds matter making a picture impossible to take.

How many times a day do you pull out your phone to search the web for information you need, or to change the song you’re listening to on Spotify? There is so much we use the internet for now it’s become a necessity, and it’s really how we connect to the web that matters. The Amazon Echo is one way to connect to the internet, and I have to say it is one of the best ways.  It not only changed how we connect to the internet, but also changed how we interact with our own homes.

I remember purchasing my first SLR and how much I loved all the bells and whistles it had. Growing up I have always loved tech, and collecting new equipment. I guess collecting is part of photography, and in a way capturing a moment in time is collecting that moment. I know I picked a very expensive thing to collect. Because of this one of my favorite times of the year are when the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and when Camera & Photo Imaging Show (CP+) are happening. I love seeing all the great new gear, and this year shows did not disappoint.

It is that time of year again where we find ourselves preparing to shower our loved ones with a little extra love for Valentine’s Day. Nothing says you love someone like a song and I find myself going back to the days where a mix tape could say it all.

Many things have been said in the numerous Tech Blogs about this year’s recent Consumer Electronics Show.  But among all the headlines, the phrase “The Year of VR” has caught my eye the most. For years, consumer Virtual Reality has just been a curiosity with the faint promise of being available for the masses one day soon. With the recent opening of pre-orders for what is considered the genesis of this movement, the Oculus Rift, as well as the strong showing of competing VR hardware at CES like the HTC Vive, maybe this is the year computing changes again.

Today is the day we honor those special forecasters who help us prepare for the adverse conditions that precipitate living in an atmosphere such as ours. In other words- we thank the guy who says it’s gonna rain. If it weren’t for the weather people out there, many of us would be in rough shape when big storms come along- like the huge blizzard that hit the east coast. So to help you get ready for when the forecast calls for another big one, Best Buy has a few items that might come in handy.

I don’t know about you, but I have had a great time this holiday. Be it Christmas with my family or New Years with my friends, I feel grateful for the time I have had with all the people in my life. Speaking of being grateful for the time I’ve spent with people, I am grateful for the time I have spent as the editor of the Latest & Greatest blog. Unfortunately, this is going to be my last post as the man in charge- Moderator Allan-BBY will be taking the reins from here on out. To commemorate this changing of the guard, I thought I would share a few of my favorite blogs that I’ve published over the last year. Enjoy!

Halloween is nearly upon us and all the little ghouls and goblins – and the big ones too – are making plans for costume parties and Trick-or-Treating. It’s a festive time of year to be sure. The trees are bedecked in the blazing colors of autumn or bare as a skeleton’s bones, scraping the turbulent sky with their gnarly fingers. It’s a time of year that fires the imagination and captures the essence of our nightmares and fears, all in a single chilling night.

It’s October, which for me means an obsession with anything and everything Halloween related. Horror movies, costumes, haunted houses - all sorts of spooky things! Recently, I made a visit to The Stanley Hotel. Yes, the hotel that inspired Stephen King’s The Shining. As an avid Stephen King fan, I was extremely excited but quite unprepared as I only had my smartphone on hand to do any ghost hunting (which only led to some pretty terrible photos). I can think of several devices that would have come in handy while I was there, as they do encourage and welcome ghost hunting.

Just because it’s getting cooler outside, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t think about how cool the components inside your computer are. Adding extra cooling to your system is not only a great way to increase your computers longevity, but can also positively impact its performance.

When it comes to your Halloween get-togethers, it is never too early to start your preparations. I look forward to this time of year above all others- even Christmas. I have been known to put months into my Halloween getup (I have been growing out my beard for my costume for the last 3 months). So in order to help you get a jump start on your party prep- I have a movie recommendation that should fit right in. Sharknado 3 is available now!

With all the super hero blockbusters coming out these days, I think it’s safe to say that the love of comic books has gone mainstream. While it may not be the actual comics that people are celebrating, their influence on our culture is hard to ignore. It has gotten to the point where people who have never even read a comic book are celebrating the newest releases. Well it's only days away from the release of Avengers: Age of Ultron- so why don’t you celebrate Comic Book Day with a preorder at Best Buy!

September 22nd is the Birthday of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, two Hobbits from Hobbiton in the Shire. Both of these “Halflings” set out on great adventures through the lands of Middle Earth as they fought the forces of evil- saving the world in the process. After a multitude of books, comics, games, and movies, both of these characters have earned a place in the hearts of millions of fans worldwide. For this special day, I thought I would tell my history with Bilbo, Frodo, and their creator- J.R.R. Tolkien.

Every Thanksgiving after we’ve gorged our faces with delicious food, my family likes to go see the latest blockbuster hit. I wasn’t all that thrilled at first, because when we started this recent tradition, we decided to go see Pitch Perfect. To be honest, I thought it looked a little gimmicky and I didn’t want to see it, but since spending time with my family outweighed this concern, I went along with it. To my surprise, I fell in love with the acapella world and the witty, quirky humor of the Barden Bellas (Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson). You can imagine then when Pitch Perfect 2 was announced, I was ecstatic!

Taking a family photo was always an adventure for us. It began by rushing around trying to find everybody and gather them together in one room. The next step was finding an area that everybody could fit in and not look too crammed, perhaps the big couch or in front of the big tree in the front yard if the weather was nice. Once everyone was gathered, the real chore began. We would stand still as my father hunched over the camera set up a few feet away. Every few seconds he would spin a knob or flip a lever with the look of a mad scientist, calculating all the factors to get perfect exposure. After what seemed like an eternity he would push a button and sprint towards us. If we were lucky enough for him to make it back to his spot before the camera picked up his movement, we would only have to repeat the process 4 or 5 more times. If not, the agony of the family photo would continue until we got it right.

 I haven’t been out to the family cabin this year, but I have some fond memories of going out on the lake and grilling with the family. I remember one year where we ended up having so much fun that we made the decision to stay outside all night around the campfire and tell those stereotypical ghost stories. My sister was absolutely terrified the entire night, but it was so much fun just being out with friends and family without the pressures of real life getting in the way.

I’ve always loved to travel. I think it’s because when I was a little girl my parents would pack us up in what I now call the “truckster” and we would embark a on a 3 day road trip to Mexico to see my family. I didn’t mind the long hours because I always had my Sony Walkman with me to listen to my favorite tunes, and a good book. Nowadays I’m not as patient sitting for so many hours, so I enjoy flying a lot more.  I’ve been on short flights, for example to Chicago, and long ones like Sweden and Argentina. While short flights are over before you can even finish the drink you are given, I dread the long 15+ hour flights; therefore, I always make sure to take some gadgets along with me to keep me busy. Here are my favorites.

Road trips can be some of the greatest times of your life! With more sights to see across the country than one may be able to fit into a lifetime, it’s amazing to take the opportunities when you can. When sitting in a car for several hours, it’s always best to make sure you’ve got the best gear to keep you safe and enjoying the ride!

You probably have a friend, family member, or coworker that has been given the opportunity to work remotely from home full-time with their company. With today’s technology, it’s becoming increasingly more possible for companies to provide such an opportunity. Of course, there are some things that are needed to work remotely as an integrated part of the company, and a few others that would make your tasks far easier.

It’s June 29th- Happy National Waffle Day!!

Waffles have been a breakfast favorite for me since I was a child. Apparently they are not just my favorite as waffles are eaten throughout the world, particularly in Belgium, France, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Scandinavia, United States, with over a dozen regional varieties in Belgium alone. I was also surprised to discover that they have been around since the 14th century! People used waffle irons to cook them, and the waffle iron plates were made in different shapes/designs . Nowadays you can find waffle makers everywhere, and they still come in many sizes and shapes. Let’s explore the different waffle makers we offer!

It may come as some surprise to the younger generations, but the world was once in black and white. Well, not literally- but for those who owned the first models of TV it was. Some have argued that the color TV was the biggest advancement in home entertainment since the TV was first introduced, but there have been much bigger advancements over the years.

About this time every year, I always struggle to find something for my dad on Father’s Day. If you’re like me, there are always the good old standbys of grilling toys, hardware tools, or even TV series boxsets. This Father’s Day I’m determined to find something for my dad that doesn’t scream, “I didn’t know what to get you!”. Of course, this is easier said than done, as my dad is a little harder to shop for than most, so I really have to think outside of the box to find something he’ll like.

Each year Father’s Day rolls around, and you’re debating between new socks or a new tie. If your budget is a little more significant, you may be considering a new grill or perhaps a new home theater device. But what if your dad is just a little sportier and not so much of a movie buff?  You can help him improve his game with the Zepp Smart Sports Equipment!

As is customary for Minnesota, spring did not arrive until later in the season, and May has brought more showers than April, so it looks like June will bring the flowers this year. Besides looking forward to spring and summer weather, I look forward to the new colors introduced for the seasons. Designers did not disappoint this year, and I absolutely love the mix of understated brights, pale pastels and nature-like neutrals that you see in clothing and accessories. They chose colors like aquamarine, scuba blue, toasted almond, strawberry ice, and marsala to name a few. These tones invoke thoughts of oceans, sand, and nature. They give us that little escape from our busy schedules and help soothe our senses.
