Creative Capital Solutions



The combination of our long-term investment strategy and flexible capital base allows us to tailor each investment structure to meet the needs of our partners.
Traditional Royalty Monetization
Royalty monetizations allow royalty owners to receive upfront capital in exchange for their expected future royalty payments. These financings can entail either the sale of all or a portion of the royalty stream, or can take the form of a non-recourse loan if the royalty owner wants to maintain the future cash flows after the loan is repaid. In either case, the royalty owner receives liquidity today and reduces or eliminates entirely the commercial risk of the product.

Synthetic Royalties / Revenue Interests
In a synthetic royalty transaction, SWK purchases a new royalty interest in an existing revenue stream from the marketer.  

Structured Debt Financings
Structured debt financings are recourse obligations of the issuer. For growth companies with commercialized products, structured debt provides a more flexible source of credit capital than traditional lending institutions will typically offer.

Hybrid Transaction
A hybrid transaction combines elements of a royalty monetization, synthetic royalty and structured debt, tailored to achieve the issuer’s financing goals.

Rights Plan - SWK Holdings











































 



Rights Plan



SWK Holdings’s Stockholder Rights Plan Structured to Preserve Net Operating Losses by Limiting Ownership in SWK Holdings Common Stock
On April 8, 2016, SWK Holdings announced that its Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan. The primary purpose of the plan is to preserve SWK Holdings’s net operating losses, or “NOLs,” for tax purposes as the company believes that its NOLs constitute a substantial asset. Under the Internal Revenue Code and rules promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, SWK Holdings can carry forward its NOLs to offset current and future earnings, and thus reduce its federal income tax liability (subject to certain requirements and restrictions). However, SWK Holdings’s future use of these NOLs could be substantially limited in the event of an “ownership change,” as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, a company would experience an ownership change for this purpose if holders of at least 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock, or “5% holders,” increase their aggregate ownership interest in the company over a three-year testing period by more than 50%, measured in terms of the market value of the company’s capital stock.
The new Rights Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change for federal income tax purposes, by discouraging these shareholders of 4.9% or more of common stock from acquiring additional shares. After giving careful consideration to SWK Holdings’s NOLs and past transactions in the company’s common stock, the Board of Directors concluded that, because the plan would serve to protect the NOLs and therefore stockholder value, the plan would be in the best interest of SWK Holdings and its stockholders.
For more information regarding the Rights Plan, please refer to the company’s SEC filings.

Our Strategy - SWK Holdings











































 



Our Strategy



We work with healthcare product companies, academia and inventors to structure investments that create long-term value for both our business partners and our investors. We can invest at any point in the life cycle of a marketed product, from launch to mature, post-IP expiration.  Our transactions enable our counterparties to invest in higher return activities such as acquiring new technologies, financing development projects and funding additional working capital needs.
We seek to fill a void in the capital markets. We believe traditional equity sources of capital are oftentimes too expensive for owners of proven intellectual property, requiring substantial dilution to a product’s future potential. In many cases, bank financing, which traditionally requires pledged collateral to fit within many constraints, is also not a practical capital solution due to its many restrictive conditions.
Our healthcare focus affords us a deep understanding of the value of life science business models and intellectual property, allowing us to see value where others cannot. We tailor our financing solutions to each situation with the goal of preserving our partners’ ownership interests. In addition, our structures provide liquidity today, leveraging a product’s future potential while also reducing its future commercial risk.
Though we have the capability to execute transactions of all sizes, we specialize in sub-$50 million opportunities that other structured finance investors traditionally consider “too small”.

Investment Process - SWK Holdings











































 



Investment Process



SWK recognizes that the process of raising capital can be exhausting and frequently frustrating, and we are here to streamline it as much as possible. We endeavor to quickly evaluate opportunities in order to rapidly provide feedback to those seeking capital.

We also understand that certain circumstances are time sensitive—we are committed to and capable of meeting aggressive timeframes. The transaction process typically lasts 4 to 8 weeks.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for SWK Holdings Corp. (OTCMKTS:SWKH) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

1. SWK Holdings serves a niche by providing long term, royalty-related financing options in the life sciences sector in the sub-$50M transaction market and therefore faces significantly less competition than its peers.
2. The company is heavily underfollowed with analyst coverage by two minor firms beginning in September 2015. Since the time of purchase, SWK Holdings has continued to quietly increase and diversify its investments. These two factors signal undervaluation and allow for a low-cost basis at the time of purchase.
3. As of December 31, 2014, SWK Holdings had $421M of federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards (with most beginning to expire in 2021 and the last expiring by 2032). The large value and expiration period of these NOL carryforwards make SWKH an excellent long-term investment.
Company Overview:
SWK Holdings (OTCQB:SWKH) was incorporated in July 1996 as KANA Software and created customer communications software products. In December 2009, KANA sold all of its substantial assets, was purchased as an NOL shell company, and changed its name to SWK Holdings. In July 2012, the company began to carry out a new corporate strategy of serving as a specialty finance and asset management firm. This strategy is carried out by offering customized finance solutions to life sciences companies, institutions, and inventors. Hence, SWK Holdings generates income through three sources:
1. The primary ownership or the debt financing of royalties generated by the sales of life science products and related intellectual property
2. Interest and other income received by advancing capital in the form of secured debt to life science companies

3. Realized capital appreciation from equity-related investments in the life science sector (makes up a very small portion of income)
The majority of the company's transactions follow a structure where SWK provides capital in exchange for interest in an existing revenue stream. SWK does not anticipate providing capital prior to the commercialization of the product from which the revenue stream originates. This existing revenue stream typically takes one of two forms, through a royalty for the sales of a life sciences product:
(1) with a third party marketing the product, such as when an inventor receives royalties from the sales of a drug or device
(2) with a partner company marketing the product, such as a medical device or drug company that sells its own products
SWK typically funds full amounts of transactions up to $20 million. SWK provides structured debt with warrants and other features. Generally, the borrower may use the capital for the purposes of growth and general working capital, acquisitions or recapitalizations (in select cases).
Industry Analysis:
SWK Holdings is part of the alternative investments industry, and within that industry, fills a niche targeting healthcare royalties in transaction amounts below $50 million. Alternative investment as an industry is rapidly changing. This seems to be driven by three key issues, (1) Globalization, (2) Monetization, and (3) Risk Management.
(1) Globalization is causing companies of all industries and sizes to be influenced by international events, macroeconomic trends, and new ideas from around the world. As a result, alternative investment firms have a tremendous number of opportunities for new capital that can be sourced from wealth in foreign countries, but are also faced with the task of analyzing investments in a truly global context.
(2) Despite the opportunities for new capital provided by globalization, alternative investment firms are increasingly finding difficulties in raising capital for continued or expanded operations. Consequently, many have turned to "monetizing" their businesses (raising capital by selling minority interest in the firm to an outside institution).

(3) Non-investment risk management is becoming increasingly important to alternative investment firms since any damage to reputation can significantly impact the firm's AUM total or its ability to close transactions. Accordingly, firms are paying greater attention to minimizing operational (ex. valuation error), technology (ex. data breach), and regulatory risk (ex. conflict of interest).

Due to the smaller size of the firm and its transactions, SWK Holdings is not affected by these high-level changes as deeply as many of its larger peers. (1) The company is not seeking any international investments at this time, nor any capital from international sources. However, it does need to analyze investments through a worldly lens due to some of its revenue streams being dependent on international sales. (2) SWK Holdings has already monetized by selling a minority stake in its firm to Carlson Capital, a Dallas-based alternative asset management firm. (3) SWK does not seem to be taking interest in minimizing non-investment risk, but, due to the small nature of the firm, doing so could be an unnecessary expense at this time.
SWK's small size and specialized nature allow it to escape many of the negative consequences of industry trends (increased competition for investment opportunities, unforeseen business risks etc.), while capitalizing on the positive ones (new sources of global income for royalties, increased capital). The following Porter's Five Forces Analysis further describes the industry:



Risk Analysis:
There seem to be three main risks associated with investing in SWK Holdings at this time: (1) Carlson Capital and its affiliates have a 69 percent voting ownership interest in the company, (2) A lender affiliated with Carlson, Double Black Diamond, L.P., provided a $30 million credit facility to SWK Holdings in exchange for common stock warrants and first offer rights on future share issuances, and (3) the firm's investments are relatively concentrated in a sector where default risk can lead to permanent losses.
(1) Carlson Capital directly holds 68.7 percent of voting common stock. Additionally, SWK Holdings' chairman of the board, Michael Weinberg, and one its directors, Christopher W. Haga, are employees of Carlson. These factors demonstrate that Carlson has significant control over the investment objectives of SWK Holdings, and this could be seen as a threat to shareholders' interests.
Despite Carlson's significant controlling interest, its interests and those of shareholders are significantly aligned. The Carlson employees that also work for SWK Holdings have significant compensation interests in SWK's performance. Carlson will also receive a greater return on its investment in SWKH if SWK Holdings continues to perform well.
(2) While the risk of SWK Holdings defaulting on this credit facility is very low due to its steady stream of income from its investments, the first offer rights that were given to Double Black Diamond will probably lead to Carlson Capital and its affiliates further increasing their control over SWK Holdings. This credit facility also has the contractual ability to prevent SWK Holdings from pursuing additional financing or stock issues if the firm defaults.
The mitigants for this risk are similar to those stated for (1). SWK Holdings is expected to easily be able to make its interest and principal payments on this credit facility. Additionally, SWK Holdings has a rights agreement that allows it to protect itself from one entity buying more than 5 percent of its shares over a three-year span (lest the transaction be considered a "change in ownership" and the company lose its NOL carryforwards)

(3) All of SWK Holdings' investments are concentrated within the healthcare industry, and this is an industry that has a relatively high rate of defaulting debt agreements. Since SWK Holdings may not be able to recoup its initial investment if this occurs, this may lead to permanent losses for the firm.
SWK Holdings has experienced management that is excellent in identifying prudent debt investments in this sector and performing adequate due diligence. Additionally, the investments team has had a four year track record of managing over $200 million in pharmaceutical royalty assets with no defaults to date.
Intrinsic Valuation:
The following intrinsic valuation was created by projecting out the growth in revenue for each of the revenue streams in each category of financing provided by SWK Holdings. This was then used to arrive at a growth rate for the projected fiscal year, and this growth rate was then applied towards the growth for that year in the discounted cash flow analysis that follows.
SWK is unique in that it can leverage its NOL carryforwards to enjoy tax benefits. These carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021, so we expect SWK to begin ramping up its usage of these carryforwards as their expiry dates approach. This is reflected in the model by the tax benefit that SWK receives in 2015 and 2016, as well as the vastly lowered tax expense in 2017, 2018, and 2019. We used a conservative exit multiple of 4.2x, despite comparable firms having an average forward P/E multiple of 11.0x. We believe the firm's eventual maturity warrants this lower multiple. Through this exit multiple and a calculated WACC of 4.2%, we arrived at an implied share price of $19.09 - an implied discount of 63.2%.
