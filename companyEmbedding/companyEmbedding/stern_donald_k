The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Within the Department of Justice, he was the chair of the U.S. Attorney General’s Advisory Committee. In state government, Mr. Stern served as the chief legal counsel to Governor Michael S. Dukakis. He also spent seven years as an assistant attorney general in the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office, where he held several positions, including Chief of the Government Bureau.
Mr. Stern was a partner at three major law firms, Cooley, Bingham McCutchen, and Hale & Dorr (now WilmerHale), where his law practice focused on internal investigations, white collar defense and business litigation. He has a wealth of experience representing companies and individuals in complex civil, criminal and regulatory matters with clients across the spectrum of industries, including health care, pharmaceutical, and financial services. He has conducted numerous internal investigations on behalf of public companies and their audit committees. In addition, he has often been called on to advise companies on compliance and monitoring issues.
Mr. Stern is involved in a number of public and community activities. He frequently speaks and writes on subjects related to white collar crime, criminal justice, compliance and business ethics. He has chaired several special commissions to investigate matters of public concern, such as the deaths of two sports fans during post-game police interactions at the request of two police commissioners, and allegations of misfeasance by the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department, at the governor’s request.
Mr. Stern was an Advisor to President Barack Obama’s Justice Department Transition Team. He currently co-chairs the American Bar Association/DOJ White Collar Liaison Committee, and is a past President of the National Association of Former U.S. Attorneys. He was a liaison to the American Bar Association Task Force on Corporate Monitors.
Mr. Stern has been on the faculty of Boston College Law School and Harvard Law School.
