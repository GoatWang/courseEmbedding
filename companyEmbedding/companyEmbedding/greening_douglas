Green Douglas Fir Lumber




The Douglas fir is the official state tree of Oregon, and Doug Fir timber is regarded as one of the world’s premier building products for a wide range of applications. As one of the strongest and hardest of all softwood species, Douglas fir provides excellent strength-to-weigh ratios and dimensional stability. And although all green lumber is subject to a certain amount of shrinkage and warp, green Doug Fir is more dimensionally stable than most other wood species.
Since the early 1950s, South Coast Lumber Co. has established a solid reputation among distributors and contractors as one of the nation’s most consistent and reliable resources for high-quality green Doug Fir (GDF) lumber. Our state-of-the-art sawmill in Brookings, Oregon, manufactures lumber products in sizes from 2" x 4" through 2" X 12", 3" x 4" through 3" X 12" and 4" X 4" through 4" X 12".  All dimensions are manufactured in 8’ to 20’ lengths. Virtually any size can be sawn within these parameters. Most grades are available, as are customer requested proprietary grades.
Talk about a great natural resource!

Quality Products

WFP is the leader for quality appearance and structural wood products that come from sustainably managed forests on the coast of British Columbia, Canada.  We are unique in our ability to source quality wood from five coastal tree species in British Columbia. While all are renowned for their performance and durability, each species has its own unique properties.
Our 8 facilities produce a multitude of products from varying grades of framing material to timbers, decking and siding, high value kiln dried squares, specialty custom cut, components for doors, windows and mouldings and niche products for customers around the world.  The beauty, dimensional stability, strength, workability and finishing attributes of WFP products make them ideal for decorative and structural applications, delivering performance and versatility that customers have trusted for over 100 years. All this is backed by experienced service agents in more than 15 locations around the world who can help source exactly what is needed, delivered on time and on specification.
Our product line is continually changing and growing.  We are working with research partners on developing new products, like our sound abatement walls made of hemlock.  We are partnered with companies researching the development of specialized engineered wood solutions, and exploring alternative markets, such as biofuels; building our business to continually improve and remain one of the world’s preferred suppliers of wood products.

Coastal Products

WFP offers a “forest” of products in a variety of sizes and standards — including products for remanufacture and custom applications. Quality fibre from five coastal BC tree species is used for product lines of Western Red Cedar, Douglas Fir, Hem-Fir, Yellow Cedar and Sitka Spruce. While all are renowned for their performance and durability, each species has its own unique properties, but all are characterized by the distinctive straight- and fine-grained fibre unique to WFP’s timberlands.
The need to tread more lightly on our planet makes it easy for our customers to choose wood products from Western Forest Products. All WFP wood products are from forests harvested and reforested in a sustainable manner.
Western Red Cedar
Western Red Cedar from Western Forest Products is one of the world’s finest building materials.
Its exceptional warmth, character, natural durability, dimensional stability and beauty make it ideal for a variety of exterior and interior uses. Both professionals and do-it-yourself-ers find it lightweight and easy to handle and install.

Hem-Fir
WFP Hem-Fir — a mixture of two species, Western Hemlock and Amabilis Fir — can be used for a wide variety of end uses. Its superior strength and nail-holding capabilities make it suitable for all types of construction.
Hem-Fir is also a perfect option for joinery and millwork such as doors, windows, mouldings and other appearance products because of its durability, light colour, and freedom from pitch.

This slow-growing, long-lived species produces exceptional wood valued for its strength, extreme durability and outstanding beauty.
