Altairnano is the first company to replace traditional graphite materials used in conventional lithium-ion batteries with a proprietary, nanostructured lithium-titanate.
Establishing a research program in 2000 to develop lithium-ion cell technology for power-dependent applications, Altairnano set about to solve the limitations associated with conventional lithium-ion technologies, including cycle and calendar life, safety, recharge time, power delivery and ability to operate in extreme temperatures.
Altairnano’s research into the electrochemistry of battery materials discovered that nanostructured lithium-titanate, when used to replace graphite in conventional lithium-ion batteries, results in distinctive performance attributes required by power-dependent energy storage applications.
This fundamental breakthrough in battery technology was announced by Altairnano in February 2005 and has since been used as the core technology in the development of the company’s advanced energy storage and battery systems.
Altairnano’s advanced energy storage systems provide fundamental advantages over existing, traditional lithium-ion battery designs.
Performance
The use of nanostructured lithium-titanate in Altairnano’s cell technology produces distinctive performance attributes, including extremely fast charge and discharge rates, the industry’s highest round-trip efficiencies, long cycle life, safety and the ability to operate under diverse environmental and extreme temperature conditions.
Safety
Altairnano has achieved a high-powered energy storage and battery system that has significantly greater thermal stability than any other lithium-ion battery in the market. By removing the highly reactive graphite from the system design, and instead using nanostructured lithium-titanate materials as the negative electrode material, no significant interaction takes place with the electrolyte.
Operating Range
The wide thermal operating range of Altairnano’s energy storage and battery systems is ideal for applications in remote, severe or unusually challenging environments where physical movement, corrosion, temperature extremes or electrical circuit complexity make the use of traditional lithium-ion batteries nearly impossible.
Long Cycle Life
Conventional lithium-ion batteries can typically be charged about 1,000 times before they are considered no longer useful. In laboratory testing, the Altairnano energy storage and battery systems have achieved over 16,000 charge and discharge cycles at rates up to 40 times greater than common batteries and still retained up to 80 percent of initial charge capacity.
Power
Altairnano’s energy storage and battery systems deliver power per unit weight and unit volume several times greater than conventional lithium-ion batteries. Cell measurements performed with high-powered cell designs indicate specific power as high as 4000 W/kg and power density over 7,500 W/litre. By using nano-structured lithium-titanate as the negative electrode material, the formation of a Solid-Electrolyte Interphase – an electrochemical property that impedes the removal of lithium, which is the first step in power production – is eliminated.

ALTAIRNANO
 
         
 

Altairnano is a 40 year-old company that entered into the battery industry roughly ten years ago when our material scientists identified novel ways to use nanoscale technologies to process lithium titanate oxide (LTO) materials. Our R&D work led to the commercialization of a unique, large format, nano lithium titanate (nLTO) battery cell, which had key advantages over other lithium ion battery (LiB) technologies, even those that used LTO materials. We leveraged these benefits to create a portfolio of products that could be used in the electric grid, transportation, and industrial sectors.

Battery technology[edit]
Altairnano's best-known product are their lithium-ion batteries, produced by Altair's Power and Energy division. The batteries have an anode made of a lithium titanate oxide formed into a spinel structure. The titanate replaces the graphite anodes of typical lithium ion batteries. The batteries are not the only batteries to use nanomaterials, but other batteries, like those from A123 Systems generally replace the cathode rather than the anode.
The primary advantage of their batteries is that they can be charged very quickly. In testing, a 35 kW·h battery pack was charged in ten minutes.[4] Other advantages include longer life with up to 25,000 deep cycles, higher power density than other nanostructured cells, wider operating temperatures, and greater stability under electrical and mechanical stress (i.e. the cells cannot catch fire). On the other hand, a disadvantage is that they have lower specific energy than other lithium ion cells, 100 versus 120 Wh/kg.[5] They have also been more expensive to produce, at US$2 per Wh, due to low manufacturing volumes.
The chemistry imposes, on the battery industry, a new methodology for evaluating batteries. Traditionally batteries have been evaluated on a nominal dollars/Wh basis. The battery's increased life expectancy and depth of discharge (usable energy) add more scope to the formula changing it from a nominal valuation to a practical, or useful, evaluation. For example, a typical lithium ion battery might have about 160 Wh/kg where Altair's is about half of that, at 80 Wh/kg. However, to optimize the life of a typical lithium ion system it can only be run between about a 30% state of charge and an 80% state of charge, leaving about 80 Wh/kg of useful energy. Altair's system can be run optimally between 10% and 90% state of charge, leaving around 64 Wh/kg or only 20% less than a typical lithium ion. Taking into account Altairnano's increased life expectancy, operational temperature range, and power density the battery relates well to other energy storage technologies.[6]
Today Altairnano has three cell chemistries; An 11Ah energy cell, a 50Ah energy cell, and a new 3.5Ah power cell. The new 3.5Ah power cell has specific energy of 40wh/kg, specific power of 4 kW/kg, and a maximum charge rate of 50C. In transportation it can be used for light and heavy hybrid electric vehicles and large diesel starters, in electric grid ancillary services it can be used as a super capacitor alternative, and in the military it can be used for weapons pulse power, as an aircraft starter, and for communications.
Altairnano will have a second generation 11Ah cell that will be available around the fall of 2009. The performance of this second generation cell will be different due to a new cathode. The nature of the new cathode is proprietary at this time. The performance will differ in that the specific power will decrease from 2200w/kg to 1000w/kg which is still more than twice the minimum PHEV requirement of 400w/kg. A presumed benefit to this chemistry will be that the observed cell voltage (OCV) vs the state of charge (SOC) will be a smooth curve. This simplifies challenges for battery control systems on electric vehicles and makes them easier to control. .[7][8]
Partnerships[edit]
AltairNano shares its battery technology with battery electric vehicle manufacturers. Phoenix Motorcars of Ontario, California is planning to use Altair's batteries in its sport-utility vehicles, currently slated to ship in 2010.[9] The Lightning Car Company in the UK has a license for using their cells in its upcoming sports cars.[10] Proterra, a battery dominant hybrid, and battery-electric, drive solutions designer, developer and manufacturer, is using Altairnano batteries in its all-electric EcoRide BE35 vehicle, a lightweight 35-foot bus.[11]
In July 2007, AltairNano entered into a joint development and purchase agreement for a suite of energy storage products with AES Corporation, an electrical power distribution company.[12] These are for three distinct market applications:

Frequency Regulation
Renewables Integration
Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) applications.[13]

As a first step Altairnano has produced for AES an independently tested,[14] one megawatt, grid-scale, battery energy storage system currently in use in the PJM Interconnection Regional Transmission Organization control area[15] in Norristown, PA. The agreement with AES is not exclusive leaving Altair free to negotiate with any other utility, Independent System Operator (ISO), merchant operator, municipality or rural electric cooperative.
Altair Nanotechnologies also has relationships with the United States Department of Defense (DOD) and the Ministry of Defense (United Kingdom) (MoD). The DOD relationships include providing a battery backup system to replace the otherwise continuously running diesel turbine generators on United States Navy vessels,[16] such as the Arleigh Burke class destroyer,[17] and United States Army batteries for the M119 howitzer.[18] The U.K. MoD relationship is via BAE Systems Marine Limited for which Altair is producing a battery system for submarine power and propulsion.[19][20]
Altairnano has joined a number of other companies in a consortium called the National Alliance for Advanced Transportation Batteries (NAATB).[21] The objective of this alliance is to build a single production facility where member companies would be able to purchase line time to build their own battery cells while keeping safe their proprietary information.[22] Altairnano is also a member of the Defense Advanced Battery Manufacturing Coalition (DABMC).[23]
Notwithstanding this partnership activity, as of March 2009, Altairnano has shipped little more than prototypes and relatively small numbers of battery packs. This company has, in various incarnations, a 36-year history of varied partnerships without ever making a profit.[24] Altairnano has a dependency on the success of third parties products.
Life Sciences[edit]
Altainano has created the RenaZorb product line intended for people afflicted with Chronic Kidney Disease, hyperphosphatemia and a range of other kidney disorders. Altair has given Spectrum Pharmaceuticals exclusive worldwide rights to this product[25] which is currently still in the testing phase. Altair also has a similar product, Renalin, for companion animals which combats kidney disease, the number one killer of cats and dogs.
Additional information[edit]
Dennis “Kilowatt” Berube set the National Hot Rod Association’s (NHRA) Super Pro class world speed record for electric dragsters driving a vehicle powered by Altair's battery packs. Berube's electric dragster, named the Current Eliminator V, accelerated to a speed of 247.2 km/h (153.6 mph) at the Speedworld Motorplex drag strip on December 15, 2007 covering a quarter-mile in 8.10 seconds.[26]
The Autovolantor, a proposed model of flying car (aircraft) by Moller Skycar, has an all-electric version powered by Altairnano batteries.[27]
In February 2008, Argonne National Laboratory reported that Advanced Battery Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABAT) has developed, and shipped its first batch of nano-lithium-ion batteries, to a U.S. customer, which incorporated Altair Nanotechnologies' lithium titanate spinel nanomaterials with its own polymer battery chemistry.[28]
In March 2009, Altair along with ten other companies was dropped from NASDAQ's Clean Edge Green Energy Index (CELS).[29] To be on the index, companies must meet eligibility criteria including minimum requirements for market value, average daily share volume and price.[30]

Phoenix Motorcars of Ontario, California is planning to use Altair's batteries in its sport-utility vehicles, currently slated to ship in 2010.[9] The Lightning Car Company in the UK has a license for using their cells in its upcoming sports cars.[10] Proterra, a battery dominant hybrid, and battery-electric, drive solutions designer, developer and manufacturer, is using Altairnano batteries in its all-electric EcoRide BE35 vehicle, a lightweight 35-foot bus.[11]
In July 2007, AltairNano entered into a joint development and purchase agreement for a suite of energy storage products with AES Corporation, an electrical power distribution company.[12] These are for three distinct market applications:

Frequency Regulation
Renewables Integration
Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) applications.[13]

As a first step Altairnano has produced for AES an independently tested,[14] one megawatt, grid-scale, battery energy storage system currently in use in the PJM Interconnection Regional Transmission Organization control area[15] in Norristown, PA. The agreement with AES is not exclusive leaving Altair free to negotiate with any other utility, Independent System Operator (ISO), merchant operator, municipality or rural electric cooperative.
Altair Nanotechnologies also has relationships with the United States Department of Defense (DOD) and the Ministry of Defense (United Kingdom) (MoD). The DOD relationships include providing a battery backup system to replace the otherwise continuously running diesel turbine generators on United States Navy vessels,[16] such as the Arleigh Burke class destroyer,[17] and United States Army batteries for the M119 howitzer.[18] The U.K. MoD relationship is via BAE Systems Marine Limited for which Altair is producing a battery system for submarine power and propulsion.[19][20]
Altairnano has joined a number of other companies in a consortium called the National Alliance for Advanced Transportation Batteries (NAATB).[21] The objective of this alliance is to build a single production facility where member companies would be able to purchase line time to build their own battery cells while keeping safe their proprietary information.[22] Altairnano is also a member of the Defense Advanced Battery Manufacturing Coalition (DABMC).[23]
Notwithstanding this partnership activity, as of March 2009, Altairnano has shipped little more than prototypes and relatively small numbers of battery packs. This company has, in various incarnations, a 36-year history of varied partnerships without ever making a profit.[24] Altairnano has a dependency on the success of third parties products.
Life Sciences[edit]
Altainano has created the RenaZorb product line intended for people afflicted with Chronic Kidney Disease, hyperphosphatemia and a range of other kidney disorders. Altair has given Spectrum Pharmaceuticals exclusive worldwide rights to this product[25] which is currently still in the testing phase. Altair also has a similar product, Renalin, for companion animals which combats kidney disease, the number one killer of cats and dogs.
Additional information[edit]
Dennis “Kilowatt” Berube set the National Hot Rod Association’s (NHRA) Super Pro class world speed record for electric dragsters driving a vehicle powered by Altair's battery packs. Berube's electric dragster, named the Current Eliminator V, accelerated to a speed of 247.2 km/h (153.6 mph) at the Speedworld Motorplex drag strip on December 15, 2007 covering a quarter-mile in 8.10 seconds.[26]
The Autovolantor, a proposed model of flying car (aircraft) by Moller Skycar, has an all-electric version powered by Altairnano batteries.[27]
In February 2008, Argonne National Laboratory reported that Advanced Battery Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABAT) has developed, and shipped its first batch of nano-lithium-ion batteries, to a U.S. customer, which incorporated Altair Nanotechnologies' lithium titanate spinel nanomaterials with its own polymer battery chemistry.[28]
In March 2009, Altair along with ten other companies was dropped from NASDAQ's Clean Edge Green Energy Index (CELS).[29] To be on the index, companies must meet eligibility criteria including minimum requirements for market value, average daily share volume and price.[30]

Battery technology[edit]
Altairnano's best-known product are their lithium-ion batteries, produced by Altair's Power and Energy division. The batteries have an anode made of a lithium titanate oxide formed into a spinel structure. The titanate replaces the graphite anodes of typical lithium ion batteries. The batteries are not the only batteries to use nanomaterials, but other batteries, like those from A123 Systems generally replace the cathode rather than the anode.
The primary advantage of their batteries is that they can be charged very quickly. In testing, a 35 kW·h battery pack was charged in ten minutes.[4] Other advantages include longer life with up to 25,000 deep cycles, higher power density than other nanostructured cells, wider operating temperatures, and greater stability under electrical and mechanical stress (i.e. the cells cannot catch fire). On the other hand, a disadvantage is that they have lower specific energy than other lithium ion cells, 100 versus 120 Wh/kg.[5] They have also been more expensive to produce, at US$2 per Wh, due to low manufacturing volumes.
The chemistry imposes, on the battery industry, a new methodology for evaluating batteries. Traditionally batteries have been evaluated on a nominal dollars/Wh basis. The battery's increased life expectancy and depth of discharge (usable energy) add more scope to the formula changing it from a nominal valuation to a practical, or useful, evaluation. For example, a typical lithium ion battery might have about 160 Wh/kg where Altair's is about half of that, at 80 Wh/kg. However, to optimize the life of a typical lithium ion system it can only be run between about a 30% state of charge and an 80% state of charge, leaving about 80 Wh/kg of useful energy. Altair's system can be run optimally between 10% and 90% state of charge, leaving around 64 Wh/kg or only 20% less than a typical lithium ion. Taking into account Altairnano's increased life expectancy, operational temperature range, and power density the battery relates well to other energy storage technologies.[6]
Today Altairnano has three cell chemistries; An 11Ah energy cell, a 50Ah energy cell, and a new 3.5Ah power cell. The new 3.5Ah power cell has specific energy of 40wh/kg, specific power of 4 kW/kg, and a maximum charge rate of 50C. In transportation it can be used for light and heavy hybrid electric vehicles and large diesel starters, in electric grid ancillary services it can be used as a super capacitor alternative, and in the military it can be used for weapons pulse power, as an aircraft starter, and for communications.
Altairnano will have a second generation 11Ah cell that will be available around the fall of 2009. The performance of this second generation cell will be different due to a new cathode. The nature of the new cathode is proprietary at this time. The performance will differ in that the specific power will decrease from 2200w/kg to 1000w/kg which is still more than twice the minimum PHEV requirement of 400w/kg. A presumed benefit to this chemistry will be that the observed cell voltage (OCV) vs the state of charge (SOC) will be a smooth curve. This simplifies challenges for battery control systems on electric vehicles and makes them easier to control. .[7][8]

Altairnano is a 40 year-old company that entered into the battery industry roughly ten years ago when our material scientists identified novel ways to use nanoscale technologies to process lithium titanate oxide (LTO) materials. Our R&D work led to the commercialization of a unique, large format, nano lithium titanate (nLTO) battery cell, which had key advantages over other lithium ion battery (LiB) technologies, even those that used LTO materials. We leveraged these benefits to create a portfolio of products that could be used in the electric grid, transportation, and industrial sectors.

COMPANY OVERVIEW  Founded: 1973  Headquarters: Reno, NV  Ownership: Public  Employees: 110 http://www.altairnano.com  STATISTICS  NASDAQ: ALTI  Fiscal Year: Dec. 31  Common Stock: 69,452,000 A/O May 12, 2012  INTELLECTUAL PORTFOLIO  U.S. Patents 10  Foreign Patents 23  Altairnano is a component in the following indices:   • Merrill Lynch Nanotech Index,(AMEX:NNZ)  • Punk Ziegel Nanotech Index  • Innovest Strategic Value Advisors Nanotech Index  • Global Crown Capital Nanotechnology Index  • PowerShares Lux Nanotech ETF (Exchange Traded Fund, AMEX:PXN)  • Nasdaq Clean Edge Index (CLEN)  • Nasdaq Clean Edge US Liquid Series (CELS)   Altair Nanotechnologies Inc. pioneers the discovery, development and manufacture of ceramic nanomaterials, which are used in products that exhibit ground-breaking performance. Altair scientists and product development specialists have produced a diverse range of novel products for power and energy systems, life sciences, and advanced materials applications in Altairnano's 100,000 square-foot facility in Reno, NV and its 30,000 square-foot facility in Anderson, IN. Working with leading marketing partners in their respective industries, Altairnano manufactures and licenses superior product technologies.  TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM  Altairnano has developed a leading, proprietary technological platform for the commercial manufacture of a wide variety of advanced ceramic materials, including metal oxides, metal titanates and combination crystals, all of which can range in structure from hollow to porous. This patented platform, scaleable across all industries, is unique in the marketplace as it provides precision control of composition, chemical purity and particle size.  MARKET FOCUS  Altairnano has applied its nanotechnology to develop new materials in four key markets: power and energy systems, life sciences, performance materials and, through AlSher, a joint venture with Sherwin-Williams, the process for the manufacture of white pigment and other nanomaterials.  Altairnano Power and Energy Systems   Power and energy systems are major growth drivers for the company and will produce long-term value for its shareholders. Altairnano currently has product lines for three markets: transportation, stationary power, and military applications.   For a number of years Altairnano has been developing groundbreaking materials to solve the issues plaguing conventional batteries: high power and energy density, cycle life, weight, cost, and the ability to perform in extreme temperatures.   Battery systems manufactured with Altairnano's LTO electrodes are environmentally safe, will not display thermal runaway (no graphite), exhibit three times the power of conventional batteries, can recharge in minutes, last 10 to 15 years, and operate in extreme temperatures - from -22° to 480° Fahrenheit.   At conferences and automotive shows throughout the U.S., attendees are riding or driving "freeway ready" PMI SUTs and SUVs powered by Altairnano's 35kWh battery system. The battery system provides full-size vehicles with a standard range of 100 to 130 miles, a charge time of less than 10 minutes, and the capability of freeway speeds exceeding 100 mph. PMI plans to ship 500 vehicles utilizing Altairnano's battery packs during 2008.   Altairnano is collaborating with Alcoa's AFL Automotive unit for the development of an HEV battery pack system integrated with AFL's Active Power Management System for use in medium-duty, hybrid trucks.   Internationally, Altair and Micro-Vett have teamed up and the Micro-Vett Fiat Doblò five-seat station wagon, powered by an 18 kWh NanoSafe battery pack is cruising around a urban delivery circuit in Oslo, Norway. The Doblò will be driven an estimated total of 7,500 kilometers during the demonstration period and will be charged with AeroVironment's high voltage, 125kW rated rapid charging system. With a successful demonstration, there is a potential for shipment of 250 vehicles during 2008.   Altairnano is leveraging its product technology in new areas of power and energy storage, which include stationary power and battery systems for heavy-duty electric and HEV vehicle markets. In a joint development with AES, who made a $3 million equity investment in the company, Altairnano is developing and will supply AES with large-scale energy storage systems for use in the storage, conditioning and delivery of power. The first $1 million pilot system, scheduled for shipment in early 2008, will be installed in a major East Coast city. The 2MW system will provide 600 kWh of energy. There is a significant market for the storage and delivery of clean power to the grid during peak usage patterns. Altairnano Materials   Altairnano Materials business has four product lines based on unique nano-materials for advanced coatings that deliver distinctive, proprietary product performance. The product lines are titanium dioxide pigment, nano-titanium products for thermal barrier coatings, nano-titanium products for air and water treatment and nano-material products for corrosion protection. Altairnano has entered into a development agreement with Sulzer Metco, the world's largest provider of thermal sprays and equipment. The agreement has resulted in the launch of Metco 9012, a nano-structured titanium oxide ceramic coating providing extremely high wear resistance for use on bearing sleeves, pumps and sputtering targets in the automotive, aerospace and power generation markets.   Altairnano and PPG Industries have entered into an agreement to develop dispersions for use in aerospace primer coatings, which will provide corrosion protections without the use of unsafe hexavalent chromium compounds. Early indications show Altairnano's nano metal oxide technology provides similar corrosion protection and is safe for the environment. There is a letter of intent to commercialize the technology in early 2008, if not before.   Altairnano's patented technology platform provides for the first new, viable pigment production process (AHP) in 50 years. Industry analysts forecast the white pigment market to exceed $9 billion with increased growth from third world countries.   Altairnano has formed a joint venture with The Sherwin-Williams Company, a leading global manufacturer of paint and durable coatings. The new company, AlSher Titania, will combine the AHP process and the Sherwin-Williams Hychlor Pigment process to develop and produce high quality titanium dioxide pigment for use in paint and coatings. Additionally, AlSher Titania will develop nano titanium dioxide materials for use in a variety of applications, including those related to removing contaminants from air and water. The pilot plant, initially based in Reno, NV, will be demonstrating the AlSher process with further scale-up and production capacity planned for 2008 and 2009.  Altair Life Sciences   Altairnano's nanomaterials have been used in the development of a phosphate binding drug candidate, RenaZorb™, for treatment of elevated phosphate levels in patients with kidney disease. With a cost effective drug presenting improved patient compliance, the market for phosphate binders is expected to reach $1 billion. The drug has been licensed to Spectrum Pharmaceuticals.   Altairnano has applied similar technology to develop Renalan™, a drug for the treatment of elevated phosphate levels in dogs and cats. Renalan, which can be used as a liquid, powder, or pill, is in the process of being licensed to Elanco Animal Health, a division of Eli Lilly. Elanco is expected to use Altairnano's nanomaterial-based products for the development of multiple products for animal health care.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS. Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online and the information providers herein make no claims concerning the validity of the information provided hereby and will not be held liable for any use of this information.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please   
    click here.

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.
    Motif makes no representation regarding the suitability of a particular investment or investment strategy.  You are responsible for all investment decisions you make including understanding the risks involved with your
    investment strategy.

ALTAIRNANO
 
         
 

Altairnano is a 40 year-old company that entered into the battery industry roughly ten years ago when our material scientists identified novel ways to use nanoscale technologies to process lithium titanate oxide (LTO) materials. Our R&D work led to the commercialization of a unique, large format, nano lithium titanate (nLTO) battery cell, which had key advantages over other lithium ion battery (LiB) technologies, even those that used LTO materials. We leveraged these benefits to create a portfolio of products that could be used in the electric grid, transportation, and industrial sectors.
