History[edit]
Impinj was founded in 2000 based on the research of Carver Mead and his student Chris Diorio. The name Impinj stands for "Impact-ionized Hot-electron Injection".[3] In 2006, Impinj became the first company to introduce products based on the EPCglobal UHF Gen 2 standard.[4][5] Bear Stearns reported in 2006 that Wal-Mart issued contracts to Impinj and Alien Technology, including them as significant suppliers for a total 15,000 RFID readers needed for Wal-Mart stores and distribution centers. The report invited speculation but was not confirmed.[6]
In the same year, Impinj created new partnerships in Asia. In February, Impinj signed an Original Equipment Manufacturer agreement with the Hong Kong based company Convergence Systems Limited (subsidiary of the Chung Nam Group of Companies).[7] In December, Impinj partnered with Korean company LS Industrial Systems (part of LS Group) to create RFID solutions targeting the Korean market.[8]
In June 2008, Impinj sold its non-volatile memory business to Virage Logic.[9] Also in 2008, Impinj acquired the Intel RFID division, including an Intel-developed RFID reader chip. Impinj renamed the chip Indy R1000.[10][11] In 2009, Coca-Cola unveiled their Freestyle soda machine that gives users one hundred different possible drink combinations. The Freestyle soda machine uses Impinj Monza tag chips and Indy reader chips to determine user preferences and to monitor the dispensers.[12][13] Mexico has certified the Impinj Speedway reader to be used by state agencies in the electronic vehicle registration initiative beginning in Mexico in July 2010.[14] In 2005, Impinj began working with Intel to develop RFID chips that would allow for “Processor Secured Storage.”[15] Impinj created two new chips for the project: Monza X-2K Dura and Monza X-8K Dura,[15] which allow for increased theft deterrence and wireless configuration of electronic devices. The chips will be used in Intel's Microsoft Windows 8-based processors for tablet computers, which will be released in the second half of 2012.[16]
RFID products[edit]
Monza RFID tag chips[edit]
Introduced in April 2005, Monza tag chips were the first UHF Gen 2 RFID tag chips.[17] Upon their introduction, it was announced that Impinj would be selling 50 million Monza tag chips that year. These 50 million chips were sold to nine different companies, including competitors Alien Technology and Texas Instruments.[10][17][18] In 2010, Impinj introduced its Monza 4 tag chips with increased read and write capabilities and more memory options.[19] In April 2011, Impinj released their new Monza 5 chips which are designed to speed item-level encoding, with fewer errors. The Monza 5 can boost encoding speeds by up to 220 percent compared with other RFID technology on the market.[20] Announced in April 2012,[16] Impinj's Monza X tag chips are intended for such applications as theft deterrence and wireless device configuration. When embedded in an electronic device (such as a laptop PC), the device processor or an RFID reader can write to or read data from that device through a Monza X chip, even when the device is powered off.[21] Impinj developed the Monza X chips through a partnership with Intel that began in 2005.[21] Impinj created the Monza X-2K and Monza X-8K Dura chips[15] with lockable memory blocks and two independent antennas, which allow the chips to be read by both near field and long range readers.[21] Intel will be using the Monza X chips in Microsoft Windows 8-based processors for tablet computers, to be released in the second half of 2012.[16]
Speedway RFID readers[edit]
Speedway is a registered trademark of Impinj. Speedway products include Speedway Revolution RFID Reader and Speedway xPortal RFID reader.
The Speedway RFID reader was first introduced in 2005 as the first RFID reader sold by Impinj. Designed to meet the RFID Gen 2 standards, Speedway was one of Impinj's GrandPrix products alongside Monza.[4]
The Speedway Revolution RFID reader was introduced in 2009. The Speedway Revolution is 80% smaller than the original Speedway RFID reader, measuring 6.75 x 5.5 x 1 inches.[22][23] The Speedway Revolution introduced Autopilot technology, which enables the reader to reconfigure itself as the environment shifts.[24]
Introduced in 2010, the Speedway xPortal is a RFID fixed reader that combined the Speedway Revolution with Dual-Linear Phased Array technology, with a smaller design than previous reader portals.[4][25] Whereas previous portal readers weighed about 150 lbs, the Speedway xPortal weighs 6.5 lbs and measures 40.5 x 8.72 x 2 inches.[26]
Indy RFID reader chips[edit]
In 2008, Impinj acquired the Intel RFID division, including an Intel-developed RFID reader chip which Impinj renamed Indy R1000.[10][11] By combining many electrical components on one microchip, RFID reader chips can minimize size and costs of RFID readers.[27] As of 2008, 40 to 50 manufacturers had developed readers using the R1000 chip.[27] In 2009, Impinj unveiled the Indy R2000 reader chip, with increased performance designed for use in high-end readers for more challenging applications.[28] In 2010, Impinj further expander their reader chip portfolio by introducing the Indy R500 reader chip, a lower cost chip for applications that don't require high performance.[29]
STP Source Tagging Platform[edit]
In 2011, Impinj announced its STP Source Tagging Platform, a combination of a reader and firmware designed for mass encoding of RFID tags.[30] The platform consists of two systems: bulk encoding for tags already attached to items, or in-line encoding before tags are applied to products. The STP platform is capable of encoding 1100 tags per minute in the bulk system, and up to 1750 tags per minute using the in-line system.[30] In 2012, Impinj announced a version 2 release of the STP platform that will enable brand owners and service bureaus to achieve encoding speeds up to 7,500 tags per minute.[31]
Store Performance Simulator[edit]
Impinj's Store Performance Simulator (SPS), released in June 2012, is a “Web-based analysis tool”[32] designed to show retailers how RFID can increase the accuracy of their inventory and positively impact profitability.[32] A retailer can use SPS's 25 inputs to reflect their particular store and simulate various “what-if” scenarios,[33] rather than running unfeasible real-world tests.

History[edit]
Impinj was founded in 2000 based on the research of Carver Mead and his student Chris Diorio. The name Impinj stands for "Impact-ionized Hot-electron Injection".[3] In 2006, Impinj became the first company to introduce products based on the EPCglobal UHF Gen 2 standard.[4][5] Bear Stearns reported in 2006 that Wal-Mart issued contracts to Impinj and Alien Technology, including them as significant suppliers for a total 15,000 RFID readers needed for Wal-Mart stores and distribution centers. The report invited speculation but was not confirmed.[6]
In the same year, Impinj created new partnerships in Asia. In February, Impinj signed an Original Equipment Manufacturer agreement with the Hong Kong based company Convergence Systems Limited (subsidiary of the Chung Nam Group of Companies).[7] In December, Impinj partnered with Korean company LS Industrial Systems (part of LS Group) to create RFID solutions targeting the Korean market.[8]
In June 2008, Impinj sold its non-volatile memory business to Virage Logic.[9] Also in 2008, Impinj acquired the Intel RFID division, including an Intel-developed RFID reader chip. Impinj renamed the chip Indy R1000.[10][11] In 2009, Coca-Cola unveiled their Freestyle soda machine that gives users one hundred different possible drink combinations. The Freestyle soda machine uses Impinj Monza tag chips and Indy reader chips to determine user preferences and to monitor the dispensers.[12][13] Mexico has certified the Impinj Speedway reader to be used by state agencies in the electronic vehicle registration initiative beginning in Mexico in July 2010.[14] In 2005, Impinj began working with Intel to develop RFID chips that would allow for “Processor Secured Storage.”[15] Impinj created two new chips for the project: Monza X-2K Dura and Monza X-8K Dura,[15] which allow for increased theft deterrence and wireless configuration of electronic devices. The chips will be used in Intel's Microsoft Windows 8-based processors for tablet computers, which will be released in the second half of 2012.[16]
RFID products[edit]
Monza RFID tag chips[edit]
Introduced in April 2005, Monza tag chips were the first UHF Gen 2 RFID tag chips.[17] Upon their introduction, it was announced that Impinj would be selling 50 million Monza tag chips that year. These 50 million chips were sold to nine different companies, including competitors Alien Technology and Texas Instruments.[10][17][18] In 2010, Impinj introduced its Monza 4 tag chips with increased read and write capabilities and more memory options.[19] In April 2011, Impinj released their new Monza 5 chips which are designed to speed item-level encoding, with fewer errors. The Monza 5 can boost encoding speeds by up to 220 percent compared with other RFID technology on the market.[20] Announced in April 2012,[16] Impinj's Monza X tag chips are intended for such applications as theft deterrence and wireless device configuration. When embedded in an electronic device (such as a laptop PC), the device processor or an RFID reader can write to or read data from that device through a Monza X chip, even when the device is powered off.[21] Impinj developed the Monza X chips through a partnership with Intel that began in 2005.[21] Impinj created the Monza X-2K and Monza X-8K Dura chips[15] with lockable memory blocks and two independent antennas, which allow the chips to be read by both near field and long range readers.[21] Intel will be using the Monza X chips in Microsoft Windows 8-based processors for tablet computers, to be released in the second half of 2012.[16]
Speedway RFID readers[edit]
Speedway is a registered trademark of Impinj. Speedway products include Speedway Revolution RFID Reader and Speedway xPortal RFID reader.
The Speedway RFID reader was first introduced in 2005 as the first RFID reader sold by Impinj. Designed to meet the RFID Gen 2 standards, Speedway was one of Impinj's GrandPrix products alongside Monza.[4]
The Speedway Revolution RFID reader was introduced in 2009. The Speedway Revolution is 80% smaller than the original Speedway RFID reader, measuring 6.75 x 5.5 x 1 inches.[22][23] The Speedway Revolution introduced Autopilot technology, which enables the reader to reconfigure itself as the environment shifts.[24]
Introduced in 2010, the Speedway xPortal is a RFID fixed reader that combined the Speedway Revolution with Dual-Linear Phased Array technology, with a smaller design than previous reader portals.[4][25] Whereas previous portal readers weighed about 150 lbs, the Speedway xPortal weighs 6.5 lbs and measures 40.5 x 8.72 x 2 inches.[26]
Indy RFID reader chips[edit]
In 2008, Impinj acquired the Intel RFID division, including an Intel-developed RFID reader chip which Impinj renamed Indy R1000.[10][11] By combining many electrical components on one microchip, RFID reader chips can minimize size and costs of RFID readers.[27] As of 2008, 40 to 50 manufacturers had developed readers using the R1000 chip.[27] In 2009, Impinj unveiled the Indy R2000 reader chip, with increased performance designed for use in high-end readers for more challenging applications.[28] In 2010, Impinj further expander their reader chip portfolio by introducing the Indy R500 reader chip, a lower cost chip for applications that don't require high performance.[29]
STP Source Tagging Platform[edit]
In 2011, Impinj announced its STP Source Tagging Platform, a combination of a reader and firmware designed for mass encoding of RFID tags.[30] The platform consists of two systems: bulk encoding for tags already attached to items, or in-line encoding before tags are applied to products. The STP platform is capable of encoding 1100 tags per minute in the bulk system, and up to 1750 tags per minute using the in-line system.[30] In 2012, Impinj announced a version 2 release of the STP platform that will enable brand owners and service bureaus to achieve encoding speeds up to 7,500 tags per minute.[31]
Store Performance Simulator[edit]
Impinj's Store Performance Simulator (SPS), released in June 2012, is a “Web-based analysis tool”[32] designed to show retailers how RFID can increase the accuracy of their inventory and positively impact profitability.[32] A retailer can use SPS's 25 inputs to reflect their particular store and simulate various “what-if” scenarios,[33] rather than running unfeasible real-world tests.

Revolution Investing review: When I’d buy more of my stock picks

Impinj's stock pulls back sharply from record close after analyst downgrade
Shares of Impinj Inc.  slumped 4.8% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the company, which makes retail ID tags and uses high-frequency waves to deliver information about the tagged items, was downgraded at Pacific Crest primarily because of valuation concerns. The stock has more than doubled the past three months to a record close Monday, and has more than tripled since its first-day of trade on July 21, 2016. In comparison, the S&P 500  is up 4.2% over the past three months. Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson cut his rating to sector weight, after being at overweight since he started covering the company on Aug. 15, 2016. He said that while recent conversations with management leads him to believe the pipeline of potential customers "is as strong as ever," but the risk-versus-reward profile for the stock is "no long favorable" after the recent price gains. "If the party gets much louder, someone may call the cops; downgrading to sector weight," Erickson wrote in a note to clients.

Impinj Likely The Real Winner From Amazon's Acquisition Of Whole Foods - Impinj, Inc. (NASDAQ:PI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Impinj Likely The Real Winner From Amazon's Acquisition Of Whole FoodsJun.21.17 | About: Impinj, Inc. (PI) Shark Traders Long/short equity, momentum, short-term horizon, bondssharktraders.comSummaryPI has been experiencing solid growth momentum over the last year and the acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon would likely accelerate their growth story.PI’s 2017 endpoint IC volumes would be between 7.8 billion and 8 billion units, which means a 32% growth compared to 2016’s endpoint.PI has a price target of $59 per share, and it still offers over 5% upside potential after the stock went up over 200% since July 21, 2016.We believe PI has a strong product portfolio and the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods would translate into a much higher stock price in the coming quarters than their current price.Over the last year, Impinj Inc. (NASDAQ:PI) has been experiencing solid growth momentum and their management was able to improve the company's efficiency. Although Impinj Inc. is still losing money, as a high growth company, we believe they have a strong possibility of becoming profitable if they can scale their operation, which seems more likely amid latest developments. 

Since July 21, 2016, Impinj Inc.'s Stock Price Has Gone Up by 210.8% Since July 21, 2016, Impinj Inc.'s stock price has gone up from $17.97 per share and it is currently trading at $55.85 per share, representing an increase of 210.8% within the last year. The bullish momentum was one again accelerated last week after e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced to acquire Whole Foods Market Inc. (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion. How Amazon Buying Whole Foods Can Help IMPINJ Impinj Inc.'s radio-frequency identification technology is widely used in various applications, including retail sectors and in the health care industry to track inventory and plan deliveries. There were already rumors in the market that Amazon's Go concept stores were using Impinj Inc.'s technology. With the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, several analysts, including RBC Capital's Mitch Steves predicted that the deal could help Impinj Inc.'s RFID systems find a new growth area.
 However, investors should not directly link the acquisition as a certainty that Amazon.com Inc. will start using Impinj Inc.'s products. We need to keep in mind that they can decide to use radio-frequency identification technology, but end up picking a different company's product. Nonetheless, the fact remains that Amazon.com Inc. is a member of Impinj Inc. led RAIN Alliance, which was created to study and encourage the radio-frequency identification technology. Hence, there is a strong possibility that Impinj Inc. might get a bump in their sales because of this acquisition by Amazon.com, Inc. IMPINJ Has Been Experiencing Solid Growth Over the Last Year Compared to only $21.63 million revenue in Q1 2016, Impinj Inc.'s Q1 2017 revenue came out at $31.73 million, which represented a 49.69% increase. Impinj Inc.'s management was able to translate this top line growth into a solid increase gross profit as well. During the last four quarters, Impinj Inc.'s gross profit increased from only $11.1 million in Q1 2016 to $16.77 million in Q1 2017, representing a 51.08% growth. It is worth noting that Impinj Inc.'s management was able to increase their gross profit rate compared to their overall quarterly revenue growth rate, which indicates that besides growth, their management has also focused on increasing the overall efficiency of the company as well. Consequently, Impinj Inc. posted a -$2.16 million net loss in Q1 compared to a -$2.33 million net loss in the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, in Q4 2016 they actually managed to maintain breakeven by posting a $100,000 net profit! Conclusion During Q1 2017 earnings call, Chris Diorio, the cofounder & chief executive officer of Impinj Inc., mentioned that 2017 endpoint IC volumes would be between 7.8 billion and 8 billion units, which would represent a 32% growth over 2016's midpoint. If you take a minute and step back from the commercial aspects of this information, you would realize that Impinj Inc. is selling one IC unit for each person in the world alive today! Now, from a commercial perspective, the good news is that on average, each person got more than one gadget that can be connected and that offers huge growth potential.
 Impinj Inc. currently has a high price target of $59 per share. Based on the current market price of $55.85 per share, this price target offers an additional 5.64% upside potential. However, we believe if Amazon.com, Inc. indeed decides to buy their radio-frequency identification technology products from Impinj Inc., this secular growth story would likely to continue in the near future and their stock price would go much higher in the coming quarters. Moreover, if the Whole Foods Market acquisition does not play well for Impinj Inc., they still got a killer product portfolio to gradually improve their sales, which would safeguard future growth momentum.

History[edit]
Impinj was founded in 2000 based on the research of Carver Mead and his student Chris Diorio. The name Impinj stands for "Impact-ionized Hot-electron Injection".[3] In 2006, Impinj became the first company to introduce products based on the EPCglobal UHF Gen 2 standard.[4][5] Bear Stearns reported in 2006 that Wal-Mart issued contracts to Impinj and Alien Technology, including them as significant suppliers for a total 15,000 RFID readers needed for Wal-Mart stores and distribution centers. The report invited speculation but was not confirmed.[6]
In the same year, Impinj created new partnerships in Asia. In February, Impinj signed an Original Equipment Manufacturer agreement with the Hong Kong based company Convergence Systems Limited (subsidiary of the Chung Nam Group of Companies).[7] In December, Impinj partnered with Korean company LS Industrial Systems (part of LS Group) to create RFID solutions targeting the Korean market.[8]
In June 2008, Impinj sold its non-volatile memory business to Virage Logic.[9] Also in 2008, Impinj acquired the Intel RFID division, including an Intel-developed RFID reader chip. Impinj renamed the chip Indy R1000.[10][11] In 2009, Coca-Cola unveiled their Freestyle soda machine that gives users one hundred different possible drink combinations. The Freestyle soda machine uses Impinj Monza tag chips and Indy reader chips to determine user preferences and to monitor the dispensers.[12][13] Mexico has certified the Impinj Speedway reader to be used by state agencies in the electronic vehicle registration initiative beginning in Mexico in July 2010.[14] In 2005, Impinj began working with Intel to develop RFID chips that would allow for “Processor Secured Storage.”[15] Impinj created two new chips for the project: Monza X-2K Dura and Monza X-8K Dura,[15] which allow for increased theft deterrence and wireless configuration of electronic devices. The chips will be used in Intel's Microsoft Windows 8-based processors for tablet computers, which will be released in the second half of 2012.[16]
RFID products[edit]
Monza RFID tag chips[edit]
Introduced in April 2005, Monza tag chips were the first UHF Gen 2 RFID tag chips.[17] Upon their introduction, it was announced that Impinj would be selling 50 million Monza tag chips that year. These 50 million chips were sold to nine different companies, including competitors Alien Technology and Texas Instruments.[10][17][18] In 2010, Impinj introduced its Monza 4 tag chips with increased read and write capabilities and more memory options.[19] In April 2011, Impinj released their new Monza 5 chips which are designed to speed item-level encoding, with fewer errors. The Monza 5 can boost encoding speeds by up to 220 percent compared with other RFID technology on the market.[20] Announced in April 2012,[16] Impinj's Monza X tag chips are intended for such applications as theft deterrence and wireless device configuration. When embedded in an electronic device (such as a laptop PC), the device processor or an RFID reader can write to or read data from that device through a Monza X chip, even when the device is powered off.[21] Impinj developed the Monza X chips through a partnership with Intel that began in 2005.[21] Impinj created the Monza X-2K and Monza X-8K Dura chips[15] with lockable memory blocks and two independent antennas, which allow the chips to be read by both near field and long range readers.[21] Intel will be using the Monza X chips in Microsoft Windows 8-based processors for tablet computers, to be released in the second half of 2012.[16]
Speedway RFID readers[edit]
Speedway is a registered trademark of Impinj. Speedway products include Speedway Revolution RFID Reader and Speedway xPortal RFID reader.
The Speedway RFID reader was first introduced in 2005 as the first RFID reader sold by Impinj. Designed to meet the RFID Gen 2 standards, Speedway was one of Impinj's GrandPrix products alongside Monza.[4]
The Speedway Revolution RFID reader was introduced in 2009. The Speedway Revolution is 80% smaller than the original Speedway RFID reader, measuring 6.75 x 5.5 x 1 inches.[22][23] The Speedway Revolution introduced Autopilot technology, which enables the reader to reconfigure itself as the environment shifts.[24]
Introduced in 2010, the Speedway xPortal is a RFID fixed reader that combined the Speedway Revolution with Dual-Linear Phased Array technology, with a smaller design than previous reader portals.[4][25] Whereas previous portal readers weighed about 150 lbs, the Speedway xPortal weighs 6.5 lbs and measures 40.5 x 8.72 x 2 inches.[26]
Indy RFID reader chips[edit]
In 2008, Impinj acquired the Intel RFID division, including an Intel-developed RFID reader chip which Impinj renamed Indy R1000.[10][11] By combining many electrical components on one microchip, RFID reader chips can minimize size and costs of RFID readers.[27] As of 2008, 40 to 50 manufacturers had developed readers using the R1000 chip.[27] In 2009, Impinj unveiled the Indy R2000 reader chip, with increased performance designed for use in high-end readers for more challenging applications.[28] In 2010, Impinj further expander their reader chip portfolio by introducing the Indy R500 reader chip, a lower cost chip for applications that don't require high performance.[29]
STP Source Tagging Platform[edit]
In 2011, Impinj announced its STP Source Tagging Platform, a combination of a reader and firmware designed for mass encoding of RFID tags.[30] The platform consists of two systems: bulk encoding for tags already attached to items, or in-line encoding before tags are applied to products. The STP platform is capable of encoding 1100 tags per minute in the bulk system, and up to 1750 tags per minute using the in-line system.[30] In 2012, Impinj announced a version 2 release of the STP platform that will enable brand owners and service bureaus to achieve encoding speeds up to 7,500 tags per minute.[31]
Store Performance Simulator[edit]
Impinj's Store Performance Simulator (SPS), released in June 2012, is a “Web-based analysis tool”[32] designed to show retailers how RFID can increase the accuracy of their inventory and positively impact profitability.[32] A retailer can use SPS's 25 inputs to reflect their particular store and simulate various “what-if” scenarios,[33] rather than running unfeasible real-world tests.

History[edit]
Impinj was founded in 2000 based on the research of Carver Mead and his student Chris Diorio. The name Impinj stands for "Impact-ionized Hot-electron Injection".[3] In 2006, Impinj became the first company to introduce products based on the EPCglobal UHF Gen 2 standard.[4][5] Bear Stearns reported in 2006 that Wal-Mart issued contracts to Impinj and Alien Technology, including them as significant suppliers for a total 15,000 RFID readers needed for Wal-Mart stores and distribution centers. The report invited speculation but was not confirmed.[6]
In the same year, Impinj created new partnerships in Asia. In February, Impinj signed an Original Equipment Manufacturer agreement with the Hong Kong based company Convergence Systems Limited (subsidiary of the Chung Nam Group of Companies).[7] In December, Impinj partnered with Korean company LS Industrial Systems (part of LS Group) to create RFID solutions targeting the Korean market.[8]
In June 2008, Impinj sold its non-volatile memory business to Virage Logic.[9] Also in 2008, Impinj acquired the Intel RFID division, including an Intel-developed RFID reader chip. Impinj renamed the chip Indy R1000.[10][11] In 2009, Coca-Cola unveiled their Freestyle soda machine that gives users one hundred different possible drink combinations. The Freestyle soda machine uses Impinj Monza tag chips and Indy reader chips to determine user preferences and to monitor the dispensers.[12][13] Mexico has certified the Impinj Speedway reader to be used by state agencies in the electronic vehicle registration initiative beginning in Mexico in July 2010.[14] In 2005, Impinj began working with Intel to develop RFID chips that would allow for “Processor Secured Storage.”[15] Impinj created two new chips for the project: Monza X-2K Dura and Monza X-8K Dura,[15] which allow for increased theft deterrence and wireless configuration of electronic devices. The chips will be used in Intel's Microsoft Windows 8-based processors for tablet computers, which will be released in the second half of 2012.[16]
RFID products[edit]
Monza RFID tag chips[edit]
Introduced in April 2005, Monza tag chips were the first UHF Gen 2 RFID tag chips.[17] Upon their introduction, it was announced that Impinj would be selling 50 million Monza tag chips that year. These 50 million chips were sold to nine different companies, including competitors Alien Technology and Texas Instruments.[10][17][18] In 2010, Impinj introduced its Monza 4 tag chips with increased read and write capabilities and more memory options.[19] In April 2011, Impinj released their new Monza 5 chips which are designed to speed item-level encoding, with fewer errors. The Monza 5 can boost encoding speeds by up to 220 percent compared with other RFID technology on the market.[20] Announced in April 2012,[16] Impinj's Monza X tag chips are intended for such applications as theft deterrence and wireless device configuration. When embedded in an electronic device (such as a laptop PC), the device processor or an RFID reader can write to or read data from that device through a Monza X chip, even when the device is powered off.[21] Impinj developed the Monza X chips through a partnership with Intel that began in 2005.[21] Impinj created the Monza X-2K and Monza X-8K Dura chips[15] with lockable memory blocks and two independent antennas, which allow the chips to be read by both near field and long range readers.[21] Intel will be using the Monza X chips in Microsoft Windows 8-based processors for tablet computers, to be released in the second half of 2012.[16]
Speedway RFID readers[edit]
Speedway is a registered trademark of Impinj. Speedway products include Speedway Revolution RFID Reader and Speedway xPortal RFID reader.
The Speedway RFID reader was first introduced in 2005 as the first RFID reader sold by Impinj. Designed to meet the RFID Gen 2 standards, Speedway was one of Impinj's GrandPrix products alongside Monza.[4]
The Speedway Revolution RFID reader was introduced in 2009. The Speedway Revolution is 80% smaller than the original Speedway RFID reader, measuring 6.75 x 5.5 x 1 inches.[22][23] The Speedway Revolution introduced Autopilot technology, which enables the reader to reconfigure itself as the environment shifts.[24]
Introduced in 2010, the Speedway xPortal is a RFID fixed reader that combined the Speedway Revolution with Dual-Linear Phased Array technology, with a smaller design than previous reader portals.[4][25] Whereas previous portal readers weighed about 150 lbs, the Speedway xPortal weighs 6.5 lbs and measures 40.5 x 8.72 x 2 inches.[26]
Indy RFID reader chips[edit]
In 2008, Impinj acquired the Intel RFID division, including an Intel-developed RFID reader chip which Impinj renamed Indy R1000.[10][11] By combining many electrical components on one microchip, RFID reader chips can minimize size and costs of RFID readers.[27] As of 2008, 40 to 50 manufacturers had developed readers using the R1000 chip.[27] In 2009, Impinj unveiled the Indy R2000 reader chip, with increased performance designed for use in high-end readers for more challenging applications.[28] In 2010, Impinj further expander their reader chip portfolio by introducing the Indy R500 reader chip, a lower cost chip for applications that don't require high performance.[29]
STP Source Tagging Platform[edit]
In 2011, Impinj announced its STP Source Tagging Platform, a combination of a reader and firmware designed for mass encoding of RFID tags.[30] The platform consists of two systems: bulk encoding for tags already attached to items, or in-line encoding before tags are applied to products. The STP platform is capable of encoding 1100 tags per minute in the bulk system, and up to 1750 tags per minute using the in-line system.[30] In 2012, Impinj announced a version 2 release of the STP platform that will enable brand owners and service bureaus to achieve encoding speeds up to 7,500 tags per minute.[31]
Store Performance Simulator[edit]
Impinj's Store Performance Simulator (SPS), released in June 2012, is a “Web-based analysis tool”[32] designed to show retailers how RFID can increase the accuracy of their inventory and positively impact profitability.[32] A retailer can use SPS's 25 inputs to reflect their particular store and simulate various “what-if” scenarios,[33] rather than running unfeasible real-world tests.

History[edit]
Impinj was founded in 2000 based on the research of Carver Mead and his student Chris Diorio. The name Impinj stands for "Impact-ionized Hot-electron Injection".[3] In 2006, Impinj became the first company to introduce products based on the EPCglobal UHF Gen 2 standard.[4][5] Bear Stearns reported in 2006 that Wal-Mart issued contracts to Impinj and Alien Technology, including them as significant suppliers for a total 15,000 RFID readers needed for Wal-Mart stores and distribution centers. The report invited speculation but was not confirmed.[6]
In the same year, Impinj created new partnerships in Asia. In February, Impinj signed an Original Equipment Manufacturer agreement with the Hong Kong based company Convergence Systems Limited (subsidiary of the Chung Nam Group of Companies).[7] In December, Impinj partnered with Korean company LS Industrial Systems (part of LS Group) to create RFID solutions targeting the Korean market.[8]
In June 2008, Impinj sold its non-volatile memory business to Virage Logic.[9] Also in 2008, Impinj acquired the Intel RFID division, including an Intel-developed RFID reader chip. Impinj renamed the chip Indy R1000.[10][11] In 2009, Coca-Cola unveiled their Freestyle soda machine that gives users one hundred different possible drink combinations. The Freestyle soda machine uses Impinj Monza tag chips and Indy reader chips to determine user preferences and to monitor the dispensers.[12][13] Mexico has certified the Impinj Speedway reader to be used by state agencies in the electronic vehicle registration initiative beginning in Mexico in July 2010.[14] In 2005, Impinj began working with Intel to develop RFID chips that would allow for “Processor Secured Storage.”[15] Impinj created two new chips for the project: Monza X-2K Dura and Monza X-8K Dura,[15] which allow for increased theft deterrence and wireless configuration of electronic devices. The chips will be used in Intel's Microsoft Windows 8-based processors for tablet computers, which will be released in the second half of 2012.[16]
RFID products[edit]
Monza RFID tag chips[edit]
Introduced in April 2005, Monza tag chips were the first UHF Gen 2 RFID tag chips.[17] Upon their introduction, it was announced that Impinj would be selling 50 million Monza tag chips that year. These 50 million chips were sold to nine different companies, including competitors Alien Technology and Texas Instruments.[10][17][18] In 2010, Impinj introduced its Monza 4 tag chips with increased read and write capabilities and more memory options.[19] In April 2011, Impinj released their new Monza 5 chips which are designed to speed item-level encoding, with fewer errors. The Monza 5 can boost encoding speeds by up to 220 percent compared with other RFID technology on the market.[20] Announced in April 2012,[16] Impinj's Monza X tag chips are intended for such applications as theft deterrence and wireless device configuration. When embedded in an electronic device (such as a laptop PC), the device processor or an RFID reader can write to or read data from that device through a Monza X chip, even when the device is powered off.[21] Impinj developed the Monza X chips through a partnership with Intel that began in 2005.[21] Impinj created the Monza X-2K and Monza X-8K Dura chips[15] with lockable memory blocks and two independent antennas, which allow the chips to be read by both near field and long range readers.[21] Intel will be using the Monza X chips in Microsoft Windows 8-based processors for tablet computers, to be released in the second half of 2012.[16]
Speedway RFID readers[edit]
Speedway is a registered trademark of Impinj. Speedway products include Speedway Revolution RFID Reader and Speedway xPortal RFID reader.
The Speedway RFID reader was first introduced in 2005 as the first RFID reader sold by Impinj. Designed to meet the RFID Gen 2 standards, Speedway was one of Impinj's GrandPrix products alongside Monza.[4]
The Speedway Revolution RFID reader was introduced in 2009. The Speedway Revolution is 80% smaller than the original Speedway RFID reader, measuring 6.75 x 5.5 x 1 inches.[22][23] The Speedway Revolution introduced Autopilot technology, which enables the reader to reconfigure itself as the environment shifts.[24]
Introduced in 2010, the Speedway xPortal is a RFID fixed reader that combined the Speedway Revolution with Dual-Linear Phased Array technology, with a smaller design than previous reader portals.[4][25] Whereas previous portal readers weighed about 150 lbs, the Speedway xPortal weighs 6.5 lbs and measures 40.5 x 8.72 x 2 inches.[26]
Indy RFID reader chips[edit]
In 2008, Impinj acquired the Intel RFID division, including an Intel-developed RFID reader chip which Impinj renamed Indy R1000.[10][11] By combining many electrical components on one microchip, RFID reader chips can minimize size and costs of RFID readers.[27] As of 2008, 40 to 50 manufacturers had developed readers using the R1000 chip.[27] In 2009, Impinj unveiled the Indy R2000 reader chip, with increased performance designed for use in high-end readers for more challenging applications.[28] In 2010, Impinj further expander their reader chip portfolio by introducing the Indy R500 reader chip, a lower cost chip for applications that don't require high performance.[29]
STP Source Tagging Platform[edit]
In 2011, Impinj announced its STP Source Tagging Platform, a combination of a reader and firmware designed for mass encoding of RFID tags.[30] The platform consists of two systems: bulk encoding for tags already attached to items, or in-line encoding before tags are applied to products. The STP platform is capable of encoding 1100 tags per minute in the bulk system, and up to 1750 tags per minute using the in-line system.[30] In 2012, Impinj announced a version 2 release of the STP platform that will enable brand owners and service bureaus to achieve encoding speeds up to 7,500 tags per minute.[31]
Store Performance Simulator[edit]
Impinj's Store Performance Simulator (SPS), released in June 2012, is a “Web-based analysis tool”[32] designed to show retailers how RFID can increase the accuracy of their inventory and positively impact profitability.[32] A retailer can use SPS's 25 inputs to reflect their particular store and simulate various “what-if” scenarios,[33] rather than running unfeasible real-world tests.
