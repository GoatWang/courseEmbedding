The “Star Trek” film franchise is going on tour with a live concert series in May that will dock at San Diego Comic-Con in July.
The concert will feature the score composed by Michael Giacchino for J.J. Abrams’ “Star Trek” and “Star Trek Into Darkness” films, with a live orchestra performing the music as the films unspool on screen.
CBS Consumer Products, Paramount Pictures, 21st Century Symphony and Orchestra, the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency, and IMG Entertainment are producing the tour.
The six-city tour will kick off May 24 in Europe (with performances in the U.K. and Switzerland) before the U.S. premiere in Houston on July 18.
The Philadelphia Orchestra also will perform “Star Trek Into Darkness” at that city’s Mann Center in late July. Performances are also planned for Canada in March 2015 from the Sony Centre in Toronto.







The Comic-Con performance will take place July 26, with the San Diego Symphony performing at the Embarcadero Marina Park South in San Diego.

So will they also be showing the whole films of both 2009’s Star Trek and the Into Darkness sequel?  It seems like none of the articles reporting on this mention that.

Oh boy, 12 Movies and 5 series composed by the likes of James Horner, Jerry Goldsmith, Dennis McCarthy, Cliff Eidelman, I can’t wait!
….Wait, we’re doing a concert but only of the two most recent movies in a franchise that is almost 50 years old?
