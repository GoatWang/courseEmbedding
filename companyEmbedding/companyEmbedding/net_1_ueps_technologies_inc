and who we are.








The U.E.P.S. Technology

We developed our core U.E.P.S. technology to
enable the affordable delivery of financial products and services
to the world's unbanked and under-banked populations.
Our native U.E.P.S. technology is designed to
provide the secure delivery of these products and services in the
most under-developed or rural environments, even in those that have
little or no communications infrastructure.
Unlike a traditional credit or debit card
where the operation of the account occurs on a centralized
computer, each of our smart cards effectively operates as an
individual bank account for all types of transactions.
All transactions that take place through our
system occur between two smart cards at the POS as all of the
relevant information necessary to perform and record transactions
reside on the smart cards.
The transfer of money or other information
can take place without any communication with a centralized
computer since all validation, creation of audit records,
encryption, decryption and authorization take place on, or are
generated between, the smart cards themselves.
Importantly, the cards are protected through
the use of biometric fingerprint identification, which is designed
to ensure the security of funds and card holder
information.
Transactions are generally settled by
merchants and other commercial participants in the system by
sending transaction data to a mainframe computer on a batch basis.
Settlements can be performed online or offline.
The mainframe computer provides a central
database of transactions, creating a complete audit trail that
enables us to replace lost smart cards while preserving the
notional account balance, and to identify fraud.
Our U.E.P.S. technology includes functionality that allows the
following:



Transparent and automatic recovery of
transactions
Multiple wallets


Transaction cancellation
"Morphing" of other common payment systems, such as the
EuroPay, Mastercard and Visa global standard, or EMV


Refunds
Automatic credit


Multiple audit trails
Automatic debit


Offline loading and spending
Interest calculations


Biometric identification
"Milking" / batching of large transaction volumes in an
off-line environment.


Continuous debit
 



 
Our U.E.P.S. technology
incorporates the software, smart cards, payment terminals,
back-end infrastructure and transaction security to provide a
complete payment and transaction processing solution.
Within industry verticals, our U.E.P.S.
technology is applied to electronic commerce transactions in the
fields of social security, wage distribution, banking, medical and
patient management, money transfers, voting and identification
systems.
Market sectors include government and NGOs,
healthcare, telecoms, financial institutions, retailers, petroleum
and utilities.
U.E.P.S./EMV
Our latest version of the U.E.P.S. technology is interoperable
with the global EMV standard, allowing the cards to be used
wherever EMV cards are accepted, while also providing all the
additional functionality offered by U.E.P.S.
This U.E.P.S./EMV functionality is especially relevant in areas
where there is an established payment system and provides
flexibility to our customers to be serviced at any point of
service.

Retailers

Key to any retailer's growth strategy are its payment systems,
systems that have the ability to enable convenience, ease the lives
of consumers, make purchases less costly and ensure that
transactions are handled with the correct levels of security.
  
 A general lack of communications infrastructure in underdeveloped
areas has led to a situation where conventional financial
institutions, along with their products and services, are
unavailable to consumers and merchants alike.
Additionally, merchants in these areas may not meet the
selection criteria imposed by formal financial institutions or the
worldwide brands they promote because they can't meet or adhere to
the rules and regulations imposed. 
  
 For merchants who service individuals with no or limited access to
traditional banking facilities, Net1's system provides a cashless
payment system that is secure, affordable and accessible.
Net1's Retail Acquiring application
manages the flow of funds between consumers, retailers, wholesalers
and financial service providers in underdeveloped areas. Retail
Acquiring effects payments made for goods, services or cash
dispensing, from a client smart card to a merchant smart card in a
secure offline manner.
U.E.P.S. cardholders receiving social grants or wages as a
source of income can load their smart cards at U.E.P.S. enabled POS
devices located in merchant stores. Cardholders have the
flexibility to purchase goods, perform cash withdrawals, initiate
money transfers, request automatic loans, effect third party
payments and invoke automatic credits and debit orders offline at
any participating merchant store once funds are loaded.
Secure transaction solutions and services for enhancing
retail payment systems and value-added options at retail
Point-Of-Sale.
Developments in payment technology over the years have
revolutionized the way in which retailers operate, yet
sophisticated retail payment system implementations have become so
ubiquitous they are barely noticed by consumers. Whilst secure
transaction technology may go all but unnoticed by consumers, many
retailers regard the cost of complying with security requirements
for payment systems a "grudge" investment which places increasing
pressure on retail IT budgets.
Retailers are aware that their Point-Of-Sale (POS) systems can
be used for far more than simply accepting payment for goods or
services, they recognize that their systems can add value to their
business and generate additional income.
Having played an integral role in the development of Southern
Africa's earliest electronic banking and electronic payment
transaction network, Net1 has over 20 years of experience in secure
end-to-end transactions, retail payment systems and solutions.
Net1's retail payment systems incorporate chip card products and
standards, payment terminals, infrastructure and transaction
security aimed at making retailers and ultimately consumers lives
easier and more convenient. These solutions mean that retailers can
offer customers a variety of payment options including credit
cards, debit cards, U.E.P.S. smart cards, cash, loyalty cards,
checks, linked cards etc. Retailers can provide third party
services such as the ability for consumers to purchase pre-paid
airtime, pre-paid electricity, gift vouchers, effect cash
withdrawals and pay utility bills via the retail infrastructure all
the POS.
Net1 has patented an "emergency finger" methodology that allows
a U.E.P.S. cardholder to minimize the amount of money lost when
performing transactions under duress.
  
 Through our biometrically enabled payment terminals, we can
provide additional security to any debit or credit card holder by
eliminating the risks associated with traditional signature or
PIN-based card systems, through a patented fingerprint validation
procedure.
Net1 has developed and implemented a number of integrated POS
payment systems for leading retailers in South Africa.
EasyPay, Net1's Transaction Services Division, controls the
largest bank-independent financial switch in Southern Africa. In
2007 the company processed more than xxx million transactions on
behalf of the country's leading Petroleum companies, Retailers,
Bill Issuers and Financial Institutions. EasyPay is the leading
provider of electronic funds transfer (EFT) and bill payment
processing services to South Africa's retail and financial
sectors.
EasyPay focuses on the provision of high-volume, secure and
convenient payment, pre-payment and value-added services to the
South African market. The company's infrastructure connects into
all major South African banks and switches both debit and credit
card EFT transactions for some of the country's leading retailers
and petroleum companies.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

(NASDAQ:UEPS) is a provider of payment and transaction processing services, as well as other financial technology solutions. The company primarily serves the unbanked and under-banked populations in emerging markets. UEPS operates in a unique market environment. The company's primary business is to help connect the billions of people globally who are under-served or ignored by the traditional banking ecosystem. UEPS has technology that connects these people with bank accounts, government programs and mobile banking. It's a unique business with limited competition. To try and quantify the profitability of serving those outside the traditional banking system, I want to look at the financial results of UEPS. In particular, I prefer to examine longer-term trends in the historical data. This really helps put some context around the more recent numbers. It makes it easier to determine if there's a serious problem or just a bump in the road. After all, despite significant volatility, shares of UEPS have not appreciated and price is currently below the 2008 highs. 

 UEPS Business Overview: UEPS is headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa. The company was founded in 1997. In 2001, it acquired a public company on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, and in 2005, UEPS listed on the NASDAQ. Today, UEPS faces a large market opportunity. The company reports a total addressable market of over 2 billion adults that are currently excluded from the financial system. By providing smart cards, mobile payments and offline solutions, the company is able to provide valuable services to these segments of the population. UEPS is also attempting to develop and commercialize its technology and applications on a worldwide basis.
 The company currently has three reportable segments: South African transaction processing, International transaction processing and Financial inclusion and applied technologies. The South African transaction-processing segment makes money based on the number of recipients paid, while merchants and utilities are charged processing fees. This segment depends heavily on government contracts and a few other concentrated customers. The International segment generates revenue primarily from transaction processing services in South Korea and Botswana. This segment also contains the startup costs related to the commercialization of UEPS payment technology internationally. The Financial inclusion and applied technologies segment sells financial products to the UEPS customers. Revenue in this segment primarily comes from short-term loans and associated account fees. The segment also operates a life-insurance business. To be honest, I'm not sure how I feel about all these different operating segments. On one hand, I appreciate that financial services are pretty entangled and it's easy to up-sell and cross-sell. I also understand UEPS is operating in some pretty remote areas where there isn't anyone else providing these services. But on the other hand, I'm skeptical the company hasn't quite hit its stride yet. It is trying to diversify away from government contracts. And although it's been working, I'm still skeptical management is zeroed-in on its circle of competence. Unfortunately, for shareholders, these kinds of operating results can be expensive. To get a better idea, let's look at some data. UEPS Financial History: In order to get a better handle on the supposed competitive strength of UEPS, I like to look for trends in the financial results. By looking at the last 10 years, the trailing-12-month numbers have a lot more context. Using data from Morningstar, I've constructed a few charts to try and illustrate a more longitudinal view of performance by UEPS. The first place I like to start is revenue.
 

 Revenue is always a good starting point because it gives a clear look at how well the company is doing in getting products to market. And in the case of UEPS, it looks like the revenue trend has been quite strong over the long term. While sales numbers have pulled back a little from all-time highs, it is still performing quite well. However, one concern I have is that companies in emerging industries with new technology have to spend a lot of money to get their revenue. In the case of UEPS, I'm going to look at the gross margin trend to try and get a feel for how profitable this revenue growth has been. 

 Unfortunately, this trend is down, the opposite of what I like to see. While gross margins are still high at 50%, they've come down significantly from where they were. Going forward, I will be keeping a close eye on this trend. Given the ever-depressing margins, I imagine that earnings results won't be anything to write home about. Usually, I love to see consistent earnings per share growth year after year. But in the case of UEPS, it's a different picture. 

 Unfortunately, these inconsistent results don't exactly speak to a steady business. The reason this bothers me as an investor is because it's more difficult to forecast future results without a consistent baseline. It makes me less confident in analyst projections and management promises too.
 However, all hope is not lost. Despite the bumpy earnings, UEPS has still been able to grow revenue with a consistently positive return on equity. This has resulted in a compounding of book value over time on a per-share basis. 

 This is a trend that I love to see. I prefer to invest in companies that can growth their equity value over time on a per-share basis. It provides a bit of a cushion in that it implies intrinsic value is edging up. And accordingly, stock price should follow. Unfortunately, UEPS doesn't pay dividends and it's unlikely to in the near-term future. So this book value per share growth is the only increase in equity you'll get. Of course, this company is, therefore, inappropriate for income-oriented investors. Another highlight for UEPS is the strong and consistent working capital position. The reason I find this appealing is because even though earnings have been inconsistent, management has been able to manage the balance sheet effectively. I appreciate this responsibility. And personally, I prefer to stay away from overly leveraged companies, and UEPS seems to pass that test. 

 On a market cap of just over $500 million, this working capital position provides a nice cushion. And when you start to back some of it out from P/E ratios and other such metrics, UEPS looks quite cheap. So as you can see, there are some pros to investing in UEPS as well as some inconsistencies. And before wrapping this up, there are some other risks I'd like to discuss as well.
 Potential Risks to Investing in UEPS: Like any potential investment opportunity, shares of UEPS come with downside and risk. For this emerging market business, there are lots of unique risks that may be difficult to quantify. First, UEPS faces a ton of uncertainty. It navigates ongoing negotiations and investigations related to government contracts, which are compounded by the fact that these contracts make up a large percentage of revenue. Regulatory changes or investigations are a constant threat. If that weren't enough, UEPS also faces significant execution risk. It is operating in frontier markets with all kinds of new technologies. While management has done a good job to date growing revenues, it hasn't been profitable at a consistent level. I'll remain cautious until I see more steady results in earnings. Finally, UEPS investors also have to deal with ongoing currency risks. Its revenue is primarily earned in South African Rand. And this makes it potentially difficult for investors buying their American-listed stock. However, the good news may be that UEPS shares are currently pricing in most of the risk. As you can see in the chart below from Morningstar, UEPS shares are currently trading at a large discount to the S&P 500. 

 Notably, this relative discount hasn't always been the case. The valuation is also reasonable on a forward-looking basis with a Forward P/E of 9.8. And remember, that doesn't account for the working capital. Conclusion: Watching and Waiting on UEPS UEPS is a very interesting investment opportunity. The business has a positive social impact, and it has been able to grow revenue consistently. Unfortunately, that growth has come at a cost and the diverse business operations might indicate management is still finding its focus.
 Therefore, I'm going to take a pass on UEPS for now. Until the company can start to show some margin stabilization and consistent earnings I think it will be too bumpy of a ride for me. But what do you think? Is UEPS an appealing opportunity from your perspective?
