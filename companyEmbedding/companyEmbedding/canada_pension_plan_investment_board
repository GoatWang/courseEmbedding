Investing involves risks. Since no one investment program is suitable for all types of investors you need to review your  investment objectives, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs before selecting an investment program. It is possible to lose money. You should periodically review your investment allocations particularly if your circumstances change. There is no assurance that an investment will achieve their objectives. Asset allocation does not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.

Save a little more today, 


	  

	  for the things you’ll love forever.

	  
Think about the things you love to do the most. Would you ever want to give them up? That’s the tough financial choice a lot of us could face when we retire. But if we start saving a little more today – even 1% more of our annual income – we could keep doing all the things we love.
It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

There are two steps you can take to help
            make sure your money lasts.




 1. Create a retirement income strategy 
 2. Maximize 
                  social security 




 Learn how annuities can help keep your money growing in

                    lasts for as long as you live. See more →

Disclaimers: The 1983 Social Security Amendments included a provision to raise the full retirement age gradually to 67, beginning with people born in 1938 or later. The FRA for those born prior to 1943 is 65 and are past the mandated distribution age. For those between 1955 and 1959 the FRA goes up in increments of 2 months beyond age 66. For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html

Unexpected
LOSS OF
INCOME


You're already challenged to generate retirement income that could last 20 or 30 years. But if you're a surviving spouse or partner, you may also have to replace the loss of expected income, which could include Social Security and pension benefits.

The Impact of
INCOME
TAXES


The higher your tax rate in retirement, the more you'll have to withdraw from your investments to meet your retirement income target.

You should consult with your tax advisors regarding your personal circumstances.




Medicare Premiums
AND HEALTH
EXPENSES


At age 65, Social Security payments are reduced to cover premiums for Medicare Parts B and D and Medigap insurance. Then there are health-care costs not covered by Medicare — which could average $220,000 for a 65-year-old couple.

Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: October 23, 2012

 The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) is one of the largest and fastest-growing pools of investment capital in the world and follows an unusually active program of investment management. In October of 2012, Mark Wiseman was just 12 weeks into his role as chief executive officer, and he must decide how to lead the organization to outperform the market as it grows larger and more geographically disperse. After seven years of eschewing the use of intermediaries and successfully practicing its "do-it-yourself mega-investing" approach, CPPIB had garnered admiration from institutions on Bay Street and Wall Street alike. It had even been heralded as a "Maple Revolutionary" by The Economist. With assets under management projected to grow to C$275 billion by 2020, however, Wiseman faced the challenge of how to scale the organization's investment strategy for the future. As Wiseman settled into the chief executive's role, would he be able to lead CPPIB to meet its goals?

History[edit]
See also: Canada Pension Plan § History
The Canada Pension Plan was first established in 1966. For much of its history, the plan relied on contributions to pay benefits. By 1996, the federal government had determined that the CPP as then constituted was unsustainable.[4] Changes were made to the plan, gradually increasing the contribution rate to its current 9.9% and creating the CPP Investment Board.[4]
Under the direction of then Minister of Finance Paul Martin, the CPP Investment Board was created by an Act of Parliament in 1997 as an independent, but accountable, body to monitor the funds held by the Canada Pension Plan. The CPP Investment Board began its investing program in 1999, establishing the CPP Reserve Fund to hold investment earnings and CPP contributions not needed to pay current pensions.[5] It reports quarterly to the public on its performance, has a professional board of directors to oversee the operations of the CPP reserve fund, and also to plan changes in direction. As a Crown corporation, the CPP Investment Board is accountable to Parliament and reports annually through the Minister of Finance. While accountable to Parliament, the CPP Investment Board is not controlled by the government or subject to government appointments, its employees and directors are not part of the Public Service of Canada.
Mandate[edit]
The CPP Investment Board's mandate is laid out in its founding legislation, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act (S.C. 1997, c. 40). Its sole investing mandate is to achieve a "maximum rate of return, without undue risk of loss."[6]
Investments[edit]
The CPP Investment Board invests in private equity, public companies, and real estate. The CPPIB invests in real estate and made their first direct office investment in Seattle in 2016.[7] Notable investments include 50% of the American pet store chain Petco,[8] 50% of American luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus, 50% of Australian office tower development International Towers Sydney, 40% of the Ontario Highway 407 toll highway, 21.5% of South Korean discount store chain Homeplus, and 19.8% of multinational media corporation Entertainment One.[9]
As outlined in its Policy on Responsible Investing, first adopted in 2005, the Board considers environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues/factors from a risk/return point of view and encourages companies to adopt policies and practices that enhance long-term financial performance.[citation needed]
Future and direction[edit]
Mark Machin is the current Chief Executive Officer of the CPPIB, replacing Mark Wiseman on June 13, 2016.
According to the 2013 Annual Report, about 63% of the fund's assets are now invested outside Canada, largely in the United States, Europe and Asia. In addition, the CPPIB has been broadening the scope of its investments to include emerging markets, although David Denison, CEO at the time, would not pinpoint a specific country or area. "Canada as a single market cannot accommodate the future growth of our organization," said Denison.
In recent years, the CPPIB changed direction in its investment philosophy. It evolved from investing exclusively in non-marketable government bonds to passive index-fund strategies and, in 2006, to active investment strategies.
Growth and strategy[edit]
According to the Office of the Chief Actuary of Canada, the CPP Fund needs a real rate of return of 4.0%, over the 75-year projection period in his report, to help sustain the plan at the current contribution rate.[citation needed]
In December 2013, the Chief Actuary reaffirmed that the CPP is sustainable throughout the 75-year timeframe of his 2012 report. Over this long timeframe it is expected that there will be periods where returns are above or below this threshold.
Consistent with the CPPIB's mandate to maximize investment returns without undue risk of loss, they pursue a value-added strategy that seeks to deliver returns over and above a market-based benchmark over the long term. That benchmark is called the CPP Reference Portfolio and under reasonable capital market assumptions, it can generate the long-term 4.0% real rate of return required to help sustain the CPP.
The CPPIB reserve fund receives its funds from the CPP and invests them like a typical large fund manager would. The CPP reserve fund seeks to achieve at least the projected return (inflation-adjusted) needed to help sustain the CPP[citation needed], a rate set at 4.0% by 2017 in the CPP actuary's report, starting from 3.2% in 2011. As indicated in its Financial Highlights for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, the CPP reserve fund averaged 4.2% return in the past 5 years, and a 7.4% return in the past 10 years, above the sum of projected Canadian inflation rates and the 4.0% target identified by the CPP Actuary report, or 6.3% in nominal basis, that is required for CPP contribution sustainability.
The CPP total assets are projected to reach the following levels according to the 2012 actuarial report: (in assets):[10]

$175 billion by 2013.
$300 billion by 2020.
$518 billion by 2030.

The strategies used to achieve these targets are:

Diversification. In 1997, the CPP fund was 100% invested in government bonds, but it has since diversified not only by asset class, but also internationally.
Employing basic asset allocation theories, with diversification of investments as one of the objectives. The asset mix has evolved over the years as follows:[11]




Asset
2008 mix
2013 mix


Public Equity
51.8%
32.1%


Fixed Income
25.6%
33.3%


Private Equity
10.9%
18.1%


Inflation Sensitive Assets
11.7%
16.5%




Using equity firms to assist in achieving targets for each asset class. The CPP reserve fund allocates certain amounts to various pre-qualified equity firms to be managed and used towards reaching the growth targets. For example, the CPP Investment Board hires private equity firms to help it invest in private companies, fund managers to help it invest in public equities, bond managers to assist in investing in bonds (within Canada and foreign bonds), and so forth.

Significant transactions[edit]
CPPIB, as part of a consortium, first invested US$300 million in Skype in September 2009. In May 2011 CPPIB sold its stake in Skype to Microsoft for US$1.1 Bn before debt repayment,[12] or US$933 million.[citation needed]
In 2009 CPPIB also invested in the $5.2-billion purchase of IMS Health with Texas Pacific Group and the $2.1-billion purchase of Macquarie Communications Group.[12]
In May 2015, Unibail-Rodamco revealed it had signed an agreement with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to sell its 46.1 percent stake in German shopping mall operator MFI AG for €394 million.[13]
In May 2015, the sale of a joint 70% investment with BC Partners in U.S. cable television operator Suddenlink for over US$9 Bn to Altice was also announced. The interest had been acquired in a 2012 LBO.[14]
In June 2015, CPPIB announced it would acquire GE Capital's private equity lending portfolio for $12 billion.[15]
In November 2015, CPPIB and CVC Capital Partners acquired American pet supplier Petco in a deal worth $4.6 billion.[8]
In July 2016, CPPIB and Calgary-based Wolf Midstream Inc. purchased a 50% stake in Devon Energy's Access Pipeline located in Alberta.[16]
Performance[edit]
The performance and the market value of the CPP Fund is reported on a quarterly basis.
Investments held by the CPP Fund include equities, fixed income (primarily government bonds), and inflation-sensitive assets (real estate, inflation-linked bonds and infrastructure). The CPPIB is making a major push into real estate, especially real estate in India.[17]
Historical information on the performance of assets available to the Canada Pension Plan, and financial statements of the CPP Investment Board, can be found under the Quarterly Reports and Annual Reports section of the CPPIB's website.
The total growth of the CPP Reserve Fund is derived from the CPP contributions of working Canadians, and the return on investment of the contributions.[18] The portion of CPP Reserve Fund growth due to CPP contributions varies from year to year, but have shown a slight decrease in the past 3 years. The CPP Reserve Fund has consistently under-performed the S&P 500 by several percentage points.[citation needed] The historical growth with the investment performance is tabulated as follows:

²Commencing in fiscal 2007, the rate of return reflects the performance of the CPP Fund which excludes the short-term cash required to pay current benefits.
³Increased fund value due to worker and employer CPP contributions not needed to pay current benefits. The negative investment return amounted to $303 million CAD.[21]

History[edit]
See also: Canada Pension Plan § History
The Canada Pension Plan was first established in 1966. For much of its history, the plan relied on contributions to pay benefits. By 1996, the federal government had determined that the CPP as then constituted was unsustainable.[4] Changes were made to the plan, gradually increasing the contribution rate to its current 9.9% and creating the CPP Investment Board.[4]
Under the direction of then Minister of Finance Paul Martin, the CPP Investment Board was created by an Act of Parliament in 1997 as an independent, but accountable, body to monitor the funds held by the Canada Pension Plan. The CPP Investment Board began its investing program in 1999, establishing the CPP Reserve Fund to hold investment earnings and CPP contributions not needed to pay current pensions.[5] It reports quarterly to the public on its performance, has a professional board of directors to oversee the operations of the CPP reserve fund, and also to plan changes in direction. As a Crown corporation, the CPP Investment Board is accountable to Parliament and reports annually through the Minister of Finance. While accountable to Parliament, the CPP Investment Board is not controlled by the government or subject to government appointments, its employees and directors are not part of the Public Service of Canada.
Mandate[edit]
The CPP Investment Board's mandate is laid out in its founding legislation, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act (S.C. 1997, c. 40). Its sole investing mandate is to achieve a "maximum rate of return, without undue risk of loss."[6]
Investments[edit]
The CPP Investment Board invests in private equity, public companies, and real estate. The CPPIB invests in real estate and made their first direct office investment in Seattle in 2016.[7] Notable investments include 50% of the American pet store chain Petco,[8] 50% of American luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus, 50% of Australian office tower development International Towers Sydney, 40% of the Ontario Highway 407 toll highway, 21.5% of South Korean discount store chain Homeplus, and 19.8% of multinational media corporation Entertainment One.[9]
As outlined in its Policy on Responsible Investing, first adopted in 2005, the Board considers environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues/factors from a risk/return point of view and encourages companies to adopt policies and practices that enhance long-term financial performance.[citation needed]
Future and direction[edit]
Mark Machin is the current Chief Executive Officer of the CPPIB, replacing Mark Wiseman on June 13, 2016.
According to the 2013 Annual Report, about 63% of the fund's assets are now invested outside Canada, largely in the United States, Europe and Asia. In addition, the CPPIB has been broadening the scope of its investments to include emerging markets, although David Denison, CEO at the time, would not pinpoint a specific country or area. "Canada as a single market cannot accommodate the future growth of our organization," said Denison.
In recent years, the CPPIB changed direction in its investment philosophy. It evolved from investing exclusively in non-marketable government bonds to passive index-fund strategies and, in 2006, to active investment strategies.
Growth and strategy[edit]
According to the Office of the Chief Actuary of Canada, the CPP Fund needs a real rate of return of 4.0%, over the 75-year projection period in his report, to help sustain the plan at the current contribution rate.[citation needed]
In December 2013, the Chief Actuary reaffirmed that the CPP is sustainable throughout the 75-year timeframe of his 2012 report. Over this long timeframe it is expected that there will be periods where returns are above or below this threshold.
Consistent with the CPPIB's mandate to maximize investment returns without undue risk of loss, they pursue a value-added strategy that seeks to deliver returns over and above a market-based benchmark over the long term. That benchmark is called the CPP Reference Portfolio and under reasonable capital market assumptions, it can generate the long-term 4.0% real rate of return required to help sustain the CPP.
The CPPIB reserve fund receives its funds from the CPP and invests them like a typical large fund manager would. The CPP reserve fund seeks to achieve at least the projected return (inflation-adjusted) needed to help sustain the CPP[citation needed], a rate set at 4.0% by 2017 in the CPP actuary's report, starting from 3.2% in 2011. As indicated in its Financial Highlights for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, the CPP reserve fund averaged 4.2% return in the past 5 years, and a 7.4% return in the past 10 years, above the sum of projected Canadian inflation rates and the 4.0% target identified by the CPP Actuary report, or 6.3% in nominal basis, that is required for CPP contribution sustainability.
The CPP total assets are projected to reach the following levels according to the 2012 actuarial report: (in assets):[10]

$175 billion by 2013.
$300 billion by 2020.
$518 billion by 2030.

The strategies used to achieve these targets are:

Diversification. In 1997, the CPP fund was 100% invested in government bonds, but it has since diversified not only by asset class, but also internationally.
Employing basic asset allocation theories, with diversification of investments as one of the objectives. The asset mix has evolved over the years as follows:[11]




Asset
2008 mix
2013 mix


Public Equity
51.8%
32.1%


Fixed Income
25.6%
33.3%


Private Equity
10.9%
18.1%


Inflation Sensitive Assets
11.7%
16.5%




Using equity firms to assist in achieving targets for each asset class. The CPP reserve fund allocates certain amounts to various pre-qualified equity firms to be managed and used towards reaching the growth targets. For example, the CPP Investment Board hires private equity firms to help it invest in private companies, fund managers to help it invest in public equities, bond managers to assist in investing in bonds (within Canada and foreign bonds), and so forth.

Significant transactions[edit]
CPPIB, as part of a consortium, first invested US$300 million in Skype in September 2009. In May 2011 CPPIB sold its stake in Skype to Microsoft for US$1.1 Bn before debt repayment,[12] or US$933 million.[citation needed]
In 2009 CPPIB also invested in the $5.2-billion purchase of IMS Health with Texas Pacific Group and the $2.1-billion purchase of Macquarie Communications Group.[12]
In May 2015, Unibail-Rodamco revealed it had signed an agreement with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to sell its 46.1 percent stake in German shopping mall operator MFI AG for €394 million.[13]
In May 2015, the sale of a joint 70% investment with BC Partners in U.S. cable television operator Suddenlink for over US$9 Bn to Altice was also announced. The interest had been acquired in a 2012 LBO.[14]
In June 2015, CPPIB announced it would acquire GE Capital's private equity lending portfolio for $12 billion.[15]
In November 2015, CPPIB and CVC Capital Partners acquired American pet supplier Petco in a deal worth $4.6 billion.[8]
In July 2016, CPPIB and Calgary-based Wolf Midstream Inc. purchased a 50% stake in Devon Energy's Access Pipeline located in Alberta.[16]
Performance[edit]
The performance and the market value of the CPP Fund is reported on a quarterly basis.
Investments held by the CPP Fund include equities, fixed income (primarily government bonds), and inflation-sensitive assets (real estate, inflation-linked bonds and infrastructure). The CPPIB is making a major push into real estate, especially real estate in India.[17]
Historical information on the performance of assets available to the Canada Pension Plan, and financial statements of the CPP Investment Board, can be found under the Quarterly Reports and Annual Reports section of the CPPIB's website.
The total growth of the CPP Reserve Fund is derived from the CPP contributions of working Canadians, and the return on investment of the contributions.[18] The portion of CPP Reserve Fund growth due to CPP contributions varies from year to year, but have shown a slight decrease in the past 3 years. The CPP Reserve Fund has consistently under-performed the S&P 500 by several percentage points.[citation needed] The historical growth with the investment performance is tabulated as follows:

History[edit]
See also: Canada Pension Plan § History
The Canada Pension Plan was first established in 1966. For much of its history, the plan relied on contributions to pay benefits. By 1996, the federal government had determined that the CPP as then constituted was unsustainable.[4] Changes were made to the plan, gradually increasing the contribution rate to its current 9.9% and creating the CPP Investment Board.[4]
Under the direction of then Minister of Finance Paul Martin, the CPP Investment Board was created by an Act of Parliament in 1997 as an independent, but accountable, body to monitor the funds held by the Canada Pension Plan. The CPP Investment Board began its investing program in 1999, establishing the CPP Reserve Fund to hold investment earnings and CPP contributions not needed to pay current pensions.[5] It reports quarterly to the public on its performance, has a professional board of directors to oversee the operations of the CPP reserve fund, and also to plan changes in direction. As a Crown corporation, the CPP Investment Board is accountable to Parliament and reports annually through the Minister of Finance. While accountable to Parliament, the CPP Investment Board is not controlled by the government or subject to government appointments, its employees and directors are not part of the Public Service of Canada.
Mandate[edit]
The CPP Investment Board's mandate is laid out in its founding legislation, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act (S.C. 1997, c. 40). Its sole investing mandate is to achieve a "maximum rate of return, without undue risk of loss."[6]
Investments[edit]
The CPP Investment Board invests in private equity, public companies, and real estate. The CPPIB invests in real estate and made their first direct office investment in Seattle in 2016.[7] Notable investments include 50% of the American pet store chain Petco,[8] 50% of American luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus, 50% of Australian office tower development International Towers Sydney, 40% of the Ontario Highway 407 toll highway, 21.5% of South Korean discount store chain Homeplus, and 19.8% of multinational media corporation Entertainment One.[9]
As outlined in its Policy on Responsible Investing, first adopted in 2005, the Board considers environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues/factors from a risk/return point of view and encourages companies to adopt policies and practices that enhance long-term financial performance.[citation needed]
Future and direction[edit]
Mark Machin is the current Chief Executive Officer of the CPPIB, replacing Mark Wiseman on June 13, 2016.
According to the 2013 Annual Report, about 63% of the fund's assets are now invested outside Canada, largely in the United States, Europe and Asia. In addition, the CPPIB has been broadening the scope of its investments to include emerging markets, although David Denison, CEO at the time, would not pinpoint a specific country or area. "Canada as a single market cannot accommodate the future growth of our organization," said Denison.
In recent years, the CPPIB changed direction in its investment philosophy. It evolved from investing exclusively in non-marketable government bonds to passive index-fund strategies and, in 2006, to active investment strategies.
Growth and strategy[edit]
According to the Office of the Chief Actuary of Canada, the CPP Fund needs a real rate of return of 4.0%, over the 75-year projection period in his report, to help sustain the plan at the current contribution rate.[citation needed]
In December 2013, the Chief Actuary reaffirmed that the CPP is sustainable throughout the 75-year timeframe of his 2012 report. Over this long timeframe it is expected that there will be periods where returns are above or below this threshold.
Consistent with the CPPIB's mandate to maximize investment returns without undue risk of loss, they pursue a value-added strategy that seeks to deliver returns over and above a market-based benchmark over the long term. That benchmark is called the CPP Reference Portfolio and under reasonable capital market assumptions, it can generate the long-term 4.0% real rate of return required to help sustain the CPP.
The CPPIB reserve fund receives its funds from the CPP and invests them like a typical large fund manager would. The CPP reserve fund seeks to achieve at least the projected return (inflation-adjusted) needed to help sustain the CPP[citation needed], a rate set at 4.0% by 2017 in the CPP actuary's report, starting from 3.2% in 2011. As indicated in its Financial Highlights for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, the CPP reserve fund averaged 4.2% return in the past 5 years, and a 7.4% return in the past 10 years, above the sum of projected Canadian inflation rates and the 4.0% target identified by the CPP Actuary report, or 6.3% in nominal basis, that is required for CPP contribution sustainability.
The CPP total assets are projected to reach the following levels according to the 2012 actuarial report: (in assets):[10]

$175 billion by 2013.
$300 billion by 2020.
$518 billion by 2030.

The strategies used to achieve these targets are:

Diversification. In 1997, the CPP fund was 100% invested in government bonds, but it has since diversified not only by asset class, but also internationally.
Employing basic asset allocation theories, with diversification of investments as one of the objectives. The asset mix has evolved over the years as follows:[11]




Asset
2008 mix
2013 mix


Public Equity
51.8%
32.1%


Fixed Income
25.6%
33.3%


Private Equity
10.9%
18.1%


Inflation Sensitive Assets
11.7%
16.5%




Using equity firms to assist in achieving targets for each asset class. The CPP reserve fund allocates certain amounts to various pre-qualified equity firms to be managed and used towards reaching the growth targets. For example, the CPP Investment Board hires private equity firms to help it invest in private companies, fund managers to help it invest in public equities, bond managers to assist in investing in bonds (within Canada and foreign bonds), and so forth.

Significant transactions[edit]
CPPIB, as part of a consortium, first invested US$300 million in Skype in September 2009. In May 2011 CPPIB sold its stake in Skype to Microsoft for US$1.1 Bn before debt repayment,[12] or US$933 million.[citation needed]
In 2009 CPPIB also invested in the $5.2-billion purchase of IMS Health with Texas Pacific Group and the $2.1-billion purchase of Macquarie Communications Group.[12]
In May 2015, Unibail-Rodamco revealed it had signed an agreement with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to sell its 46.1 percent stake in German shopping mall operator MFI AG for €394 million.[13]
In May 2015, the sale of a joint 70% investment with BC Partners in U.S. cable television operator Suddenlink for over US$9 Bn to Altice was also announced. The interest had been acquired in a 2012 LBO.[14]
In June 2015, CPPIB announced it would acquire GE Capital's private equity lending portfolio for $12 billion.[15]
In November 2015, CPPIB and CVC Capital Partners acquired American pet supplier Petco in a deal worth $4.6 billion.[8]
In July 2016, CPPIB and Calgary-based Wolf Midstream Inc. purchased a 50% stake in Devon Energy's Access Pipeline located in Alberta.[16]
Performance[edit]
The performance and the market value of the CPP Fund is reported on a quarterly basis.
Investments held by the CPP Fund include equities, fixed income (primarily government bonds), and inflation-sensitive assets (real estate, inflation-linked bonds and infrastructure). The CPPIB is making a major push into real estate, especially real estate in India.[17]
Historical information on the performance of assets available to the Canada Pension Plan, and financial statements of the CPP Investment Board, can be found under the Quarterly Reports and Annual Reports section of the CPPIB's website.
The total growth of the CPP Reserve Fund is derived from the CPP contributions of working Canadians, and the return on investment of the contributions.[18] The portion of CPP Reserve Fund growth due to CPP contributions varies from year to year, but have shown a slight decrease in the past 3 years. The CPP Reserve Fund has consistently under-performed the S&P 500 by several percentage points.[citation needed] The historical growth with the investment performance is tabulated as follows:

According to the Office of the Chief Actuary of Canada, the CPP Fund needs a real rate of return of 4.0%, over the 75-year projection period in his report, to help sustain the plan at the current contribution rate.[citation needed]
In December 2013, the Chief Actuary reaffirmed that the CPP is sustainable throughout the 75-year timeframe of his 2012 report. Over this long timeframe it is expected that there will be periods where returns are above or below this threshold.
Consistent with the CPPIB's mandate to maximize investment returns without undue risk of loss, they pursue a value-added strategy that seeks to deliver returns over and above a market-based benchmark over the long term. That benchmark is called the CPP Reference Portfolio and under reasonable capital market assumptions, it can generate the long-term 4.0% real rate of return required to help sustain the CPP.
The CPPIB reserve fund receives its funds from the CPP and invests them like a typical large fund manager would. The CPP reserve fund seeks to achieve at least the projected return (inflation-adjusted) needed to help sustain the CPP[citation needed], a rate set at 4.0% by 2017 in the CPP actuary's report, starting from 3.2% in 2011. As indicated in its Financial Highlights for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, the CPP reserve fund averaged 4.2% return in the past 5 years, and a 7.4% return in the past 10 years, above the sum of projected Canadian inflation rates and the 4.0% target identified by the CPP Actuary report, or 6.3% in nominal basis, that is required for CPP contribution sustainability.
The CPP total assets are projected to reach the following levels according to the 2012 actuarial report: (in assets):[10]

$175 billion by 2013.
$300 billion by 2020.
$518 billion by 2030.

The strategies used to achieve these targets are:

Diversification. In 1997, the CPP fund was 100% invested in government bonds, but it has since diversified not only by asset class, but also internationally.
Employing basic asset allocation theories, with diversification of investments as one of the objectives. The asset mix has evolved over the years as follows:[11]




Asset
2008 mix
2013 mix


Public Equity
51.8%
32.1%


Fixed Income
25.6%
33.3%


Private Equity
10.9%
18.1%


Inflation Sensitive Assets
11.7%
16.5%




Using equity firms to assist in achieving targets for each asset class. The CPP reserve fund allocates certain amounts to various pre-qualified equity firms to be managed and used towards reaching the growth targets. For example, the CPP Investment Board hires private equity firms to help it invest in private companies, fund managers to help it invest in public equities, bond managers to assist in investing in bonds (within Canada and foreign bonds), and so forth.

Significant transactions[edit]
CPPIB, as part of a consortium, first invested US$300 million in Skype in September 2009. In May 2011 CPPIB sold its stake in Skype to Microsoft for US$1.1 Bn before debt repayment,[12] or US$933 million.[citation needed]
In 2009 CPPIB also invested in the $5.2-billion purchase of IMS Health with Texas Pacific Group and the $2.1-billion purchase of Macquarie Communications Group.[12]
In May 2015, Unibail-Rodamco revealed it had signed an agreement with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to sell its 46.1 percent stake in German shopping mall operator MFI AG for €394 million.[13]
In May 2015, the sale of a joint 70% investment with BC Partners in U.S. cable television operator Suddenlink for over US$9 Bn to Altice was also announced. The interest had been acquired in a 2012 LBO.[14]
In June 2015, CPPIB announced it would acquire GE Capital's private equity lending portfolio for $12 billion.[15]
In November 2015, CPPIB and CVC Capital Partners acquired American pet supplier Petco in a deal worth $4.6 billion.[8]
In July 2016, CPPIB and Calgary-based Wolf Midstream Inc. purchased a 50% stake in Devon Energy's Access Pipeline located in Alberta.[16]
Performance[edit]
The performance and the market value of the CPP Fund is reported on a quarterly basis.
Investments held by the CPP Fund include equities, fixed income (primarily government bonds), and inflation-sensitive assets (real estate, inflation-linked bonds and infrastructure). The CPPIB is making a major push into real estate, especially real estate in India.[17]
Historical information on the performance of assets available to the Canada Pension Plan, and financial statements of the CPP Investment Board, can be found under the Quarterly Reports and Annual Reports section of the CPPIB's website.
The total growth of the CPP Reserve Fund is derived from the CPP contributions of working Canadians, and the return on investment of the contributions.[18] The portion of CPP Reserve Fund growth due to CPP contributions varies from year to year, but have shown a slight decrease in the past 3 years. The CPP Reserve Fund has consistently under-performed the S&P 500 by several percentage points.[citation needed] The historical growth with the investment performance is tabulated as follows:

History[edit]
See also: Canada Pension Plan § History
The Canada Pension Plan was first established in 1966. For much of its history, the plan relied on contributions to pay benefits. By 1996, the federal government had determined that the CPP as then constituted was unsustainable.[4] Changes were made to the plan, gradually increasing the contribution rate to its current 9.9% and creating the CPP Investment Board.[4]
Under the direction of then Minister of Finance Paul Martin, the CPP Investment Board was created by an Act of Parliament in 1997 as an independent, but accountable, body to monitor the funds held by the Canada Pension Plan. The CPP Investment Board began its investing program in 1999, establishing the CPP Reserve Fund to hold investment earnings and CPP contributions not needed to pay current pensions.[5] It reports quarterly to the public on its performance, has a professional board of directors to oversee the operations of the CPP reserve fund, and also to plan changes in direction. As a Crown corporation, the CPP Investment Board is accountable to Parliament and reports annually through the Minister of Finance. While accountable to Parliament, the CPP Investment Board is not controlled by the government or subject to government appointments, its employees and directors are not part of the Public Service of Canada.
Mandate[edit]
The CPP Investment Board's mandate is laid out in its founding legislation, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act (S.C. 1997, c. 40). Its sole investing mandate is to achieve a "maximum rate of return, without undue risk of loss."[6]
Investments[edit]
The CPP Investment Board invests in private equity, public companies, and real estate. The CPPIB invests in real estate and made their first direct office investment in Seattle in 2016.[7] Notable investments include 50% of the American pet store chain Petco,[8] 50% of American luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus, 50% of Australian office tower development International Towers Sydney, 40% of the Ontario Highway 407 toll highway, 21.5% of South Korean discount store chain Homeplus, and 19.8% of multinational media corporation Entertainment One.[9]
As outlined in its Policy on Responsible Investing, first adopted in 2005, the Board considers environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues/factors from a risk/return point of view and encourages companies to adopt policies and practices that enhance long-term financial performance.[citation needed]
Future and direction[edit]
Mark Machin is the current Chief Executive Officer of the CPPIB, replacing Mark Wiseman on June 13, 2016.
According to the 2013 Annual Report, about 63% of the fund's assets are now invested outside Canada, largely in the United States, Europe and Asia. In addition, the CPPIB has been broadening the scope of its investments to include emerging markets, although David Denison, CEO at the time, would not pinpoint a specific country or area. "Canada as a single market cannot accommodate the future growth of our organization," said Denison.
In recent years, the CPPIB changed direction in its investment philosophy. It evolved from investing exclusively in non-marketable government bonds to passive index-fund strategies and, in 2006, to active investment strategies.
Growth and strategy[edit]
According to the Office of the Chief Actuary of Canada, the CPP Fund needs a real rate of return of 4.0%, over the 75-year projection period in his report, to help sustain the plan at the current contribution rate.[citation needed]
In December 2013, the Chief Actuary reaffirmed that the CPP is sustainable throughout the 75-year timeframe of his 2012 report. Over this long timeframe it is expected that there will be periods where returns are above or below this threshold.
Consistent with the CPPIB's mandate to maximize investment returns without undue risk of loss, they pursue a value-added strategy that seeks to deliver returns over and above a market-based benchmark over the long term. That benchmark is called the CPP Reference Portfolio and under reasonable capital market assumptions, it can generate the long-term 4.0% real rate of return required to help sustain the CPP.
The CPPIB reserve fund receives its funds from the CPP and invests them like a typical large fund manager would. The CPP reserve fund seeks to achieve at least the projected return (inflation-adjusted) needed to help sustain the CPP[citation needed], a rate set at 4.0% by 2017 in the CPP actuary's report, starting from 3.2% in 2011. As indicated in its Financial Highlights for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, the CPP reserve fund averaged 4.2% return in the past 5 years, and a 7.4% return in the past 10 years, above the sum of projected Canadian inflation rates and the 4.0% target identified by the CPP Actuary report, or 6.3% in nominal basis, that is required for CPP contribution sustainability.
The CPP total assets are projected to reach the following levels according to the 2012 actuarial report: (in assets):[10]

$175 billion by 2013.
$300 billion by 2020.
$518 billion by 2030.

The strategies used to achieve these targets are:

Diversification. In 1997, the CPP fund was 100% invested in government bonds, but it has since diversified not only by asset class, but also internationally.
Employing basic asset allocation theories, with diversification of investments as one of the objectives. The asset mix has evolved over the years as follows:[11]




Asset

Public Equity

Fixed Income
25.6%
33.3%


Private Equity
10.9%
18.1%


Inflation Sensitive Assets
11.7%
16.5%




Using equity firms to assist in achieving targets for each asset class. The CPP reserve fund allocates certain amounts to various pre-qualified equity firms to be managed and used towards reaching the growth targets. For example, the CPP Investment Board hires private equity firms to help it invest in private companies, fund managers to help it invest in public equities, bond managers to assist in investing in bonds (within Canada and foreign bonds), and so forth.

TORONTO & SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPPIB”) and Apax Partners LLP 
      (“Apax”) announced today that CPPIB has signed a definitive agreement to 
      acquire an approximate 48 percent stake in GlobalLogic Inc., a global 
      leader in digital product development services, from funds advised by 
      Apax. Apax funds will retain an equal stake to CPPIB in the company.
    


      Founded in 2000, GlobalLogic is a San Jose, California-based product 
      engineering services company with over 11,000 employees worldwide. The 
      company helps clients build innovative digital products to enhance 
      customer engagement, user experience and service capabilities. 
      GlobalLogic’s clients represent well-known global brands across multiple 
      industry verticals and the company has experienced significant revenue 
      growth over the past three years.
    

      “This is a compelling opportunity for CPPIB to back a highly successful 
      management team in what is a rapidly growing and evolving software 
      engineering services sector,” said Ryan Selwood, Managing Director, Head 
      of Direct Private Equity, CPPIB. “GlobalLogic’s market-leading position, 
      exceptional track record and deep customer relationships will enable it 
      to continue capitalizing on technology megatrends. We look forward to 
      working with the GlobalLogic management team and Apax, a longstanding 
      partner of ours, on the company’s next phase of growth.”
    

      GlobalLogic is instrumental to helping brands design and build the 
      software and digital applications that are critical to their customers’ 
      continued innovation and competitive differentiation. Demand for these 
      services has grown significantly in the past five years and is expected 
      to continue to do so as next-generation cloud-based software platforms, 
      mobile and web applications, and Internet of Things (IoT) have amplified 
      the urgent need for design-led software development expertise. Creating 
      these types of products requires advanced skill-sets, as well as large 
      development teams to build and support these solutions that truly 
      accelerate digital innovation for customers.
    

      “GlobalLogic performed strongly in the first three years of our 
      collaboration thanks to its management team successfully executing on an 
      ambitious global growth plan. GlobalLogic has seen significant returns 
      from early investments in customer focus and in building differentiated 
      capabilities to drive digital transformation for a number of large 
      customers,” said Rohan Haldea, Partner, Apax Partners. “We are thrilled 
      to have CPPIB come on board as a long-term investor to help take 
      GlobalLogic to a new level.”
    

      Through this investment, CPPIB gains a foothold in a dynamic market 
      segment. In turn, GlobalLogic and funds advised by Apax now have a 
      long-term capital partner to continue supporting GlobalLogic’s growth 
      strategy.
    

      “In the past three years with Apax, we’ve enjoyed a 20%+ compound annual 
      growth rate (CAGR), consistently outperforming the broader product 
      engineering services (PES) market,” said Shashank Samant, CEO, 
      GlobalLogic. “We look forward to leveraging the combined resources of 
      Apax and CPPIB, a well-capitalized partner, to help us continue our 
      strategy and execute our growth agenda for years to come.”

6 April 2016
Sale of 40% stake in Glencore Agricultural Products and creation of long-term partnership with CPPIB
Glencore plc (“Glencore”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPPIB”) for the purchase by a wholly owned subsidiary of CPPIB of a 40% equity interest in Glencore Agricultural Products (“Glencore Agri”), for an aggregate consideration of US$2.5 billion payable in cash upon closing, subject to customary working capital closing adjustments (‘’the Transaction’’).
The Transaction values 100% of the equity in Glencore Agri at US$6.25 billion. As at 31 December 2015, the business had long-term debt of US$0.6 billion and working capital (net of cash) of US$3.0 billion (including readily marketable inventories of US$2.5 billion) which it intends to finance with short term debt on closing.
The Transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions and is expected to close during the second half of 2016. The proceeds from the Transaction will be used by Glencore to reduce net indebtedness.
Glencore Agri is a differentiated and vertically-integrated business focused on the global agricultural products value chain. Built around a network of high-quality origination and logistics assets, comprising over 200 storage facilities, 31 processing facilities and 23 ports in strategic locations around the world, Glencore Agri is well-positioned in key export regions and in the trade of major agricultural commodities including grains, oilseeds products, rice, sugar, pulses and cotton. In the year to 31 December 2015, Glencore Agri reported earnings before interest and tax of US$524 million, and at 31 December 2015 had gross assets of US$10,187 million.
Upon closing, Glencore Agri will be governed by its own board of directors. CPPIB shall have the right to appoint two directors to the Board of Glencore Agri alongside two Glencore-appointed directors and the CEO, Chris Mahoney. At shareholder meetings Glencore and CPPIB representatives shall vote in proportion to their shareholdings, subject to certain reserved matters.
In addition, and consistent with the mutual commitment to a successful long-term partnership, Glencore and CPPIB have agreed to an initial four year lock-up period subject to a carve-out for Glencore to sell up to a further 20% stake. As well as customary exit provisions, including a right of first refusal, each of Glencore and CPPIB may call for an initial public offering of Glencore Agri after eight years from the date of closing.
Commenting on the Transaction, Ivan Glasenberg, CEO of Glencore, said:
“We are pleased to be partnering with CPPIB as we embark on the next stage of the development of Glencore Agri. Under Glencore’s ownership the business has been successfully rebased, particularly following the Viterra acquisition in 2012 and is well-positioned to benefit from long-term global macro and sector trends. CPPIB have a proven track record in the sector and share our vision for the future growth of the business through value-creating organic and inorganic growth opportunities for the benefit of all stakeholders. We welcome them aboard and look forward to continuing our good relationship as we work together.”
Commenting on the Transaction, Chris Mahoney, CEO of Glencore Agri, said:
“This is an important day in the evolution of Glencore Agri, and we look forward to working with CPPIB to continue to build the Glencore Agri business over the long-term. With the investment potential created by this partnership, and given the existing network of high-quality origination, logistics and port assets in key export regions, the business is now well-placed to take advantage of the significant opportunities that are expected to emerge across the sector in the coming years.”
Commenting on the Transaction, Mark Jenkins, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Private Investments at CPPIB, said:
“As an asset class, agriculture is an excellent fit for a long-term investor like CPPIB, and we are excited about the opportunity to acquire a significant stake in Glencore Agri, a leading agricultural business. Glencore Agri complements our existing portfolio of agriculture assets, bringing global exposure, scale and diversification. In addition, Glencore Agri’s experienced management team has a proven track record of growth, and combined with a successful business model, we see this as a compelling opportunity that aligns with CPPIB’s long-term investment horizon.
Barclays, Citi and Credit Suisse acted as joint financial advisers to Glencore. Linklaters LLP provided legal advice to Glencore.

This material is designed to provide general information regarding the subject matter covered. No guarantee of future results or outcomes either expressed or implied, is being made.  Investing involves risks. Since no one investment program is suitable for all types of investors you need to review your  investment objectives, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs before selecting an investment program. It is possible to lose money. You should periodically review your investment allocations particularly if your circumstances change. There is no assurance that an investment will achieve their objectives. Asset allocation does not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.

Save a little more today, 


	  

	  for the things you’ll love forever.

	  
Think about the things you love to do the most. Would you ever want to give them up? That’s the tough financial choice a lot of us could face when we retire. But if we start saving a little more today – even 1% more of our annual income – we could keep doing all the things we love.
It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey.

Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

Disclaimers: The 1983 Social Security Amendments included a provision to raise the full retirement age gradually to 67, beginning with people born in 1938 or later. The FRA for those born prior to 1943 is 65 and are past the mandated distribution age. For those between 1955 and 1959 the FRA goes up in increments of 2 months beyond age 66. For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html
