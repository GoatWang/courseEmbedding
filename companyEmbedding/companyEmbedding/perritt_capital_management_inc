 Our Firm

 


With thirty years of experience in the micro-cap space, not only does Perritt have a commitment to small companies—we operate as a small company.
Sharing a boots-to-the-ground mentality with the micro-cap companies we invest in, our commitment and knowledge of the micro-cap space is consistent across all of our investment strategies. Other firms may offer investments in micro-cap securities as part of a larger whole philosophy. We only invest in fundamentally and financially sound micro-cap companies and do not stray from this focus.

Fund Strategy
Investment Criteria The Fund invests in companies that are listed in the bottom decile of the major stock exchanges as ranked by market capitalization. Today, the Fund invests in companies that at the time of initial investment have a market capitalization below $300 million.
Bottom-Up Process The management team uses a bottom up approach, with ideas provided by in-house research and an external network of small company research boutiques and regional brokerage firms that has been cultivated over twenty-five  years.
Nine-Point Evaluation Companies are subjected to a nine-point evaluation based on balance sheets, cash flow and income statements that the management team believes demonstrate whether a company is acting in the interests of its shareholders.
Fundamental Research For companies whose fundamentals look favorable based on the nine point evaluation, the next step is to assess its broader business prospects. The management team meets with 3-5 company executives each week to identify what in our opinion are growing, niche companies with innovative products and/or services and the potential to build franchises and brands.
Valuation Assessment Stocks are assessed based on valuations, favoring companies with modest valuation multiples relative to long term growth prospects. Companies are considered for purchase if they fall under a range of valuation determinations, including GARP or Deep Value.
Investment Objective
The Perritt Ultra MicroCap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.


Fund managers named to the Barron’s list of the industry’s Top 100 have consistently outperformed their peers. The Barron’s/Value Line annual rankings system awards points to managers who generate more stable returns and subtracts points from funds deemed to volatile. Value Line first screens out those Funds with more than two lead managers and managers with less than three years’ tenure. The remaining funds are then organized by investment objective, and then sector funds and those with less than $200 million in assets are eliminated. The Barron’s Value/Line Survey was discontinued after 2007.
The sector classifications represented in the graph are in accordance with Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS®), which was developed by and/or is the exclusive property of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor Financial Services LLC.

What are analysts saying about ITT stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about ITT stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "ITT Inc. has a robust earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters. The company’s focus on business streamlining, cost controls and efficiency continues to prove beneficial to its financial performance. ITT Inc.’s diversified operations across key end markets adds to its strength. The company’s bottom line is expected to benefit from improved operating efficiency and successful cost containment actions. Further, ITT Inc.’s shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Diversified Operations industry average over the past year. ITT Inc. has achieved operational excellence through its Lean Six Sigma program, restructuring initiatives and global sourcing efforts. However, softness in industrial, oil & gas markets and aerospace and defense business is expected to affect client spending adversely, thus restricting the company’s growth to a great extent." (7/18/2017)
2. UBS AG analysts commented, "ITT's Process business performed better than we had expected in 4Q but order declines accelerated to -17% (-3% sequentially), which stands in contrast to other oil & gas levered companies we cover, such as DOV and EMR, which have started showing signs of improvement. We think this has to do with ITT's lack of exposure to North American fracking, as most of the company's upstream business (~45% of total O&G) is in Latin America and the Middle East. Management remains cautious on its IP outlook, expecting oil & gas down LDD and chemical/industrial pumps down HSD; we think ITT shares are pricing in a faster recovery for the business, but there remains risk that the company could see a more protracted recovery than U.S. competitors, in our view." (2/16/2017)
3. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented, "A reasonable and we think modestly conservative guide here with the main swing factor being primarily in ITT's short cycle pump business (which we think is more likely to be a bit better than a bit worse) with some potential upside from increasing rig count in ICS. Potential risks we see center primarily around rising input prices, mainly steel and copper. We believe IP and ICS will likely bottom in 2017 and while the voracity of any oil & gas recovery remains uncertain we expect significant growth in MT, benefits from carryover cost savings and price pressures to abate (well, at least be less of a headwind...) to drive ~20% EPS growth in 2018." (2/15/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for ITT (NYSE:ITT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 7 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.88)Consensus Price Target: $46.67 (12.10% upside)
