Title: Yoga Instructor
               Company: Kaya Yoga
Job Details
               Kaya Yoga (Kat Allen's Yoga Abode) is an intimate studio that provides quality instruction in Hatha Yoga, the popular form of yoga that includes physical conditioning. Yoga, the state or process of "union," is an ancient system of reintegration and a catalyst for transformation on all levels, bringing us greater physical health, as well as confidence, clarity and joy. Hatha Yoga is the name given to practices that develop the body, mind and vital energies. It is a science, not a religion, and includes an ethical code, physical postures, breathing practices, and techniques for relaxation, meditation and self-inquiry. Our intention is to offer well-rounded, non-competitive classes that strive to integrate all of the above, and are small enough to attend to individual needs. The history of Kaya Yoga goes back to when Kat Allen, the director, began teaching yoga out of her home studio in SE Seattle in the early 90's. She called it the "Abode of Joy," and many students who attend Kaya Yoga now, only a few blocks away, remember those days fondly. When it came time to expand in 1997, she sought a name that would carry a number of meanings, and Kaya Yoga seemed to do just that. The word kaya means "body" in Sanskrit, and refers, as well, to an earth goddess (similar to Gaia). It was also the name of Kat's cat, who passed on just months before the studio opened, and who is the model for the logo. It is Kat's intention to share the wealth of teachings she has received from some of the greatest living yogis from both the East and the West, and help train those who are inspired to journey deeper along the yogic path. Due to the intimate nature of the studio, those who continue find a well-spring of community and in-depth teachings. All the instructors at Kaya Yoga are highly trained and have been influenced by the teachings of yoga master T. Krishnamacarya, whose impact on yoga is beyond measure. Types of yoga associated with him are: Viniyoga, with emphasis on the breath, inner awareness, and function over form; Iyengar, which focuses on alignment, form, and the use of props; and elements of Ashtanga Vinyasa a dynamic flow series. All classes vary in emphasis according to the level and instructor, and are practiced in an atmosphere that is conscious of spirit and free of dogma. Full of heart, intelligence and integrity, we devote our teaching to people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities.  Getting Started: If you are brand new to yoga, taking an Introductory Series is highly recommended, while Basic level classes are also a good way to begin. Traditionally, yoga is taught one-on-one, therefore individual sessions are a particularly effective way to ensure that your specific needs are addressed and a practice built accordingly. Every new student, whether beginning or experienced, should plan to arrive ten minutes before your first class, so that you can familiarize yourself with the studio and let the instructor know any necessary information to ensure a positive experience. Getting to the studio: See a map along with directions.
