interests in a diversified investment portfolio of World Investment Series,

mutual funds may result in greater aggregate expenses than if you directly      
purchased shares of those funds.

(1) For shareholders of Class B, the contingent deferred sales charge is        
5.50% in the first year declining to 1.00% in the sixth year and 0.00%          
thereafter. For shareholders of Class C, the contingent deferred sales          
charge assessed is 1.00% of the lesser of the original purchase price or        
the net asset value of Shares redeemed within one year of their purchase        
date.  For a more complete description, see "Contingent Deferred Sales
Charge."                                                                        

(2) The Fund has no present intention of paying or accruing the management      
fee during the fiscal year ending November 30, 1997. If the Fund were           
paying or accruing the management fee, the Fund would be able to pay up to      
1.25% of its average daily net assets which are invested in individual          
stocks, bonds or money market instruments, and not on those assets invested     
in shares of the underlying funds.                                              

(3) The Fund has no present intention of paying or accruing the asset           
allocation fee during the fiscal year ending November 30, 1997. If the Fund     
were paying or accruing the asset allocation fee, the Fund would be able to     
pay up to 0.20% of its average daily net assets which are entirely held         
within the International Growth Fund, including both individual securities      
and shares of the underlying funds.                                             

(4) The Class A Shares has no present intention of paying or accruing the       
12b-1 fee during the fiscal year ending November 30, 1997. If the Class A       

Shares were paying or accruing the 12b-1, the Class A Shares would be able      
to pay up to 0.25% of its average daily net assets for the 12b-1 fee.           

(5) The shareholder services fee has been reduced to reflect the voluntary      
waiver of the shareholder services fee. The shareholder service provider        
can terminate this voluntary waiver at any time at its sole discretion. The     
maximum shareholder services fee is 0.25%.                                      

(6) The total Class A Shares operating expenses are estimated to be 1.28%       
absent the anticipated voluntary waiver described in note 5 above and the       
anticipated voluntary reimbursement of certain other operating expenses.        

(7) The total Class B Shares and Class C Shares operating expenses are          
estimated to be 2.03% absent the anticipated voluntary waiver described in      
note 5 above and the anticipated voluntary reimbursement of certain other       
operating expenses.                                                             

(8) Class B Shares convert to Class A Shares (which pay lower ongoing           
expenses) approximately eight years after purchase.                             

* Total operating expenses are estimated based on average expenses expected     
to be incurred during the period ending November 30, 1997. During the           
course of this period, expenses may be more or less than the average amount     
shown.                                                                          

The purpose of this table is to assist an investor in understanding the       
various costs and expenses that a shareholder of the Fund will bear, either     
directly or indirectly.  For more complete descriptions of the various          
costs and expenses, see "How To Purchase Shares" and "Fund Information."        

Wire-transferred redemptions of less than $5,000 may be subject to              
additional fees.

THIS EXAMPLE IS BASED ON ESTIMATED DATA FOR THE FUND'S FISCAL YEAR ENDING       
NOVEMBER 30, 1997.                                                              
SYNOPSIS                                                                        

The Corporation was established under the laws of the State of Maryland on      
January 25, 1994. The Corporation's address is Federated Investors Tower,       
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-3779. The Articles of Incorporation permit       
the Corporation to offer separate series of shares representing interests       
in separate portfolios of securities. As of the date of this prospectus,        
the Board of Directors (the `Directors'') has established three classes of      
shares for the Fund, known as Class A Shares, Class B Shares, and Class C       
Shares (individually and collectively as the context requires, `Shares'').      
Shares of the Fund are designed for individuals and institutions seeking        
long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in shares of other           
mutual funds, the portfolios of which consist primarily of equity               
securities of non-U.S. issuers and by investing directly in equity              
securities of companies domiciled outside the United States.                    
For information on how to purchase Shares of the Fund, please refer to          
`How to Purchase Shares.'' The minimum initial investment for Class A           
Shares is $500. The minimum initial investment for Class B Shares and Class     
C Shares is $1,500. However, the minimum initial investment for a               
retirement account in any class is $50. Subsequent investments in any class     
must be in amounts of at least $100, except for retirement plans which must     
be in amounts of at least $50.                                                  
In general, Class A Shares are sold at net asset value plus an applicable       
sales charge and are redeemed at net asset value. However, a contingent         
deferred sales charge is imposed under certain circumstances. For a more        
complete description, see `How to Redeem Shares.''                              
Class B Shares are sold at net asset value. A contingent deferred sales         
charge is imposed on certain Shares which are redeemed within six full          
years of purchase. See `How to Redeem Shares.''                                 

Class C Shares are sold at net asset value. A contingent deferred sales         
charge of 1.00% will be charged on assets redeemed within the first 12          
months following purchase. See `How to Redeem Shares.''                         
In addition, the Fund pays a shareholder services fee at an annual rate not     
to exceed 0.25% of average daily net assets.                                    
Additionally, information regarding the exchange privilege offered with         
respect to the Fund and certain other funds can be found under `Exchange        
Privilege.''                                                                    
Federated Global Research Corp. is the investment adviser (the `Adviser'')      
to the Fund and receives compensation for its services. The Adviser's           
address is 175 Water Street, New York, New York 10038-4965.                     
The Fund and the underlying funds may make certain investments and employ       
certain investment techniques that involve risks, including, but not            
limited to, investing in foreign securities, lending portfolio securities,      
investing in restricted and illiquid securities, investing in securities on     
a when-issued and delayed delivery basis, writing put and call options and      
entering into repurchase agreements.                                            
The Fund's net asset value and offering price can be found in the mutual        
funds section of local newspapers under `Federated'' and the appropriate        
class designation listing.                                                      
INVESTMENT INFORMATION                                                          
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE                                                            
The Fund's objective is to provide long-term growth of capital.  Any income     
received from the portfolio is incidental. The investment objective cannot      
be changed without the approval of shareholders.  While there is no             
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, it endeavors     
to do so by following the investment policies described in this prospectus.

`Federated Funds'' and herein referred to as the ``underlying funds'') that     
invest primarily in foreign equity securities. The underlying funds in          
which the Fund will invest include, but are not limited to, Federated Asia      
Pacific Growth Fund, Federated Emerging Markets Fund, Federated European        
Growth Fund, Federated International Small Company Fund, and Federated          
Latin American Growth Fund.                                                     

The charts below show the approximate parameters in which the Fund will         
generally invest in large and small capitalization stocks and in developed      
and emerging markets. The Adviser can adjust these ranges from time to time     
at its sole discretion.                                                         

The prospectus contains two pie charts in the center of the page.               
The first depicts `Developed vs. Emerging Markets Exposure'' and                
shows 30% of assets invested in emerging markets and 70% of assets              
invested in developed markets.  The second chart depicts                        
`Large Capitalization vs. Small Capitalization Exposure'' and shows 40%         
of assets invested in small capitalization stocks and 60% of assets             
invested in large capitalization stocks.                                        

Under normal circumstances, the Fund expects to operate within the              
following ranges:                                                               
Federated Asia Pacific Growth Fund           20 - 60%     
Federated European Growth Fund               20 - 60%     
Federated Emerging Markets Fund               0 - 25%     

Federated International Small Company Fund         0 - 25%      
Federated Latin American Growth Fund               0 - 25%      
The Fund's strategy of investing in the shares of other international           
equity funds is designed (but not guaranteed) to reduce the risk associated     
with investing in a single sector- or regional-specfic underlying fund.         
Holding a diversified portfolio of international equity funds also may          
provide access to a wider range of companies, industries, countries, and        
markets than would be available through any one underlying fund.                
International securities and markets are subject to currency rate               
fluctuations and potentially greater price volatility and liquidity             
considerations than U.S. securities. Investors have historically sought to      
reduce these risks through multi-country diversification. The Fund is           
designed to give shareholders a single investment that offers broad             
international diversification.                                                  
Under normal market conditions, and as an investment policy, the Fund will      
invest at least 65% of its total assets in underlying funds that are            
international equity funds. However, as an operational policy, the Fund         
anticipates investing substantially all of its assets in international          
equity funds. International equity funds are those which invest primarily       
in equity securities of companies located in three or more countries            
outside the United States. The Adviser will attempt to identify and select      
a varied portfolio of international equity funds which presents the             
greatest long-term capital growth potential based on the Adviser's analysis     
of many factors.                                                                

The Adviser will allocate the Fund's assets across the underlying funds         
such that the Fund will be exposed to large and small capitalization stocks     
from both developed and emerging markets outside of the United States.          
(Small capitalization companies are those companies that have a market          
capitalization of $1.5 billion or less at the time of purchase.  Large          
capitalization companies are those companies that have a market                 
capitalization of over $1.5 billion at the time of purchase.  Emerging          
markets companies are defined as (i) those for which the principal              
securities trading market is and emerging market country; (ii) those which      
are organized under the laws of, or with a principal office in, an emerging     
market country; or (iii) those, wherever organized or traded, who derive        
(directly or indirectly through subsidiaries) at least 50% of their total       
assets, capitalization, gross revenue or profit from its most current year      
from goods produced, services performed, or sales made in such emerging         
market countries.) From time to time, the Adviser will alter the allocation     
percentages of the underlying funds based on market risk, economic              
fundamentals and unique market characteristics within the foreign markets       
an asset classes in which the underlying funds invest. The Adviser will         
first assess the relative attractiveness of geographic regions and              
individual countries.  After identifying the most and least attractive          
countries or regions, consideration will be given to expected returns and       
risks before deciding which areas, if any, to overweight or underweight. By     
rebalancing the Fund through investment of the proceeds of new purchases        
into the Fund, by making purchases and sales among the shares of the            
underlying funds, or a combination of the two, the Adviser will continually     
manage the Fund's exposure to large and small capitalization stocks from        
both developed and emerging markets.                                            

Because the Fund and the underlying funds may invest in substantially           
similar securities in a similar fashion, thereby incurring similar risks,       
all further references to the Fund hereinafter include the underlying funds     
unless otherwise indicated. Although many of the underlying funds may have      
the same or similar investment policies as the Fund, they are not required      
to do so.                                                                       
Assets not invested in international equity funds may be invested in            
underlying funds other than international equity funds, such as global          
funds (funds that invest primarily in securities of issuers throughout the      
world, including the United States).                                            
The Fund also may enter  into forward commitments, repurchase agreements,       
and foreign currency transactions; maintain reserves in foreign or U.S.         
money market instruments; and purchase options and financial futures            
contracts.                                                                      
Unless indicated otherwise, the investment policies of the Fund may be          
changed by the Directors without approval of shareholders.  Shareholders        
will be notified before any material changes in these policies become           
effective.                                                                      
Following the grant of certain exemptive relief from the SEC, the Fund will     
also be permitted to invest directly in a professionally managed                
diversified portfolio of equity securities of companies domiciled outside       
the United States that the Adviser believes offer excellent opportunities       
for long-term growth. Additionally, the Fund, for liquidity purposes, may       
maintain direct investments in short-term money market securities.              
However, for temporary defensive purposes, when the Adviser determines that     
market conditions warrant, the Fund may invest up to 100% of its total          
assets in U.S. and foreign money market instruments.                            

To the extent that the Fund's assets are invested in the underlying funds,      
its investment performance will correspond directly to that of its              
proportionate investment in those underlying funds. This strategy involves      
certain additional expenses and certain tax results which would not be          
present in a direct investment in mutual funds. See `Expenses of the Fund       
and Shares''and ``Federal Tax Information.''  The Fund may purchase shares      
of no-load funds available without a transaction fee and/or pay their own       
distribution expenses. See `Additional Considerations of Investing in           
Other Investment Companies.''Each underlying fund provides a prospectus         
and other disclosure documents to the Fund. These documents are also            
available to Fund shareholders directly from the underlying fund.               
ACCEPTABLE INVESTMENTS.  The equity securities in which the Fund may invest     
include common stock, preferred stock (either convertible or non-               
convertible), sponsored or unsponsored depositary receipts or shares, and       
warrants, including other substantially similar forms of equity with            
comparable risk characteristics as well as other forms which may be             
developed in the future. Securities may be purchased on securities              
exchanges, traded over-the-counter, or have no organized market. The Fund       
may also purchase corporate and government fixed income securities              
denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars; enter into forward           
commitments, repurchase agreements and foreign currency transactions;           
maintain reserves in foreign or U.S. money market instruments and cash; and     
purchase options and financial futures contracts.                               

COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK.  Stocks represent shares of ownership in a          
company. Generally, preferred stock has a specified dividend and ranks          
after bonds and before common stocks in its claim on income for dividend        
payments and on assets should the company be liquidated. After other claims     
are satisfied, common stockholders participate in company profits on a pro      
rata basis; profits may be paid out in dividends or reinvested in the           
company to help it grow. Increases and decreases in earnings are usually        
reflected in a company's stock price, so common stocks generally have the       
greatest appreciation and depreciation potential of all corporate               
securities. While most preferred stocks pay a dividend, the Fund may            
purchase preferred stock where the issuer has omitted, or is in danger of       
omitting, payment of its dividend. Such investments would be made primarily     
for their capital appreciation                                                  

DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS.  The Fund may invest in foreign issuers by purchasing      
sponsored or unsponsored securities representing underlying international       
securities such as American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"), American              
Depositary Shares ("ADSs"), European Depositary Receipts ("EDRs"), Global       
Depositary Receipts ("GDRs"), Global Depositary Certificates ("GDCs"),          
International Depositary Receipts ("IDRs"), and Russian Depositary              
Certificates ("RDCs") or securities convertible into foreign equity             
securities. ADRs and ADSs typically are issued by a United States bank or       
trust company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a       
foreign corporation. EDRs, which are sometimes referred to as Continental       
Depositary Receipts ("CDRs"), GDRs, GDCs, IDRs and RDCs are typically           
issued by foreign banks or trust companies, although they also may be           
issued by United States banks or trust companies, and evidence ownership of     
underlying securities issued by either a foreign or a United States             
corporation. ADRs, ADSs, CDRs,                                                  

DEBT SECURITIES.  In pursuit of the Fund's objective of long-term growth of     
capital, the Fund may invest up to 35% of its total assets in debt              
securities. Capital appreciation in debt securities may arise as a result       
of favorable changes in the creditworthiness of issuers, relative interest      
rate levels, or relative foreign exchange rates. Any income received from       
debt securities will be incidental to the Fund's objective of long-term         
growth of capital. These debt obligations consist of U.S. and foreign           
government securities and corporate debt securities, including, but not         
limited to, Samurai and Yankee bonds, Eurobonds and depositary receipts.        
The issuers of such debt securities may or may not be domiciled in emerging     
countries.                                                                      
The debt securities in which the Fund may invest may be rated, at the time      
of purchase, as low as C by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P")             

Convertible securities are fixed income securities which may be exchanged       
or converted into a predetermined number of the issuer's underlying common      
stock at the option of the holder during a specified time period.               
Convertible securities may take the form of convertible bonds, convertible      
preferred stock or debentures, units consisting of "usable" bonds and           
warrants or a combination of the features of several of these securities.       
The investment characteristics of each convertible security vary widely,        
which allows convertible securities to be employed for a variety of             
different investment strategies. In selecting a convertible security, the       
Adviser evaluates the investment characteristics of the convertible             
security as a fixed income investment, and the investment potential of the      
underlying security for capital appreciation.                                   

RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES.  The Fund may invest in restricted          
securities. Restricted securities are any securities in which the Fund may      
otherwise invest pursuant to its investment objective and policies but          
which are subject to restrictions on resale under federal securities law.       
Securities that can be traded without restrictions in non-U.S. securities       
markets will not be treated as restricted, even if they cannot be traded in     
U.S. securities markets without restriction. Restricted securities may be       
issued by new and early stage companies which may include a high degree of      
business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses. As a         
result of the absence of a public trading market for these securities, they     
may be less liquid than publicly traded securities. Although these              
securities may be resold in privately negotiated transactions, the prices       
realized from these sales could be less                                         

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements.           
Repurchase agreements are arrangements by which the Fund purchases a            
security for cash and obtains a simultaneous commitment from the seller         
(usually a bank or broker/dealer) to repurchase the security at an agreed-      
upon price and specified future date. The repurchase price reflects an          
agreed-upon interest rate for the time period of the agreement. The Fund's      
risk is the inability of the seller to pay the agreed-upon price on the         
delivery date. However, this risk is tempered by the ability of the Fund to     
sell the security in the open market in the case of a default. In such a        
case, the Fund may incur costs in disposing of the security which would         
increase Fund expenses. The Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of        
the firms with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements.                
WHEN-ISSUED A                                                                   

LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES.  In order to generate additional income,       
the Fund may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis,      
to broker/dealers, banks, or other institutional borrowers of securities.       
The Fund will only enter into loan arrangements with broker/ dealers,           
banks, or other institutions which the Adviser has determined are               
creditworthy under guidelines established by the Directors and will receive     
collateral in the form of cash or U.S. government securities equal to at        
least 100% of the value of the securities loaned at all times.                  
TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS.  For temporary defensive purposes, when the Adviser      
determines that market conditions warrant (up to 100% of total assets) and      
to maintain liquidity (up to 35% of total assets), the Fund may invest in       
U.S. and foreign debt instruments as well as cash or cash equivalents,          
including foreign and domestic money market instruments, short-term             
government                                                                      

The Fund may also enter into foreign currency transactions to protect Fund      
assets against adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or            
exchange control regulations. Such changes could unfavorably affect the         
value of Fund assets which are denominated in foreign currencies, such as       
foreign securities or funds deposited in foreign banks, as measured in U.S.     
dollars. Although foreign currency exchanges may be used by the Fund to         
protect against a decline in the value of one or more currencies, such          
efforts may also limit any potential gain that might result from a relative     
increase in the value of such currencies and might, in certain cases,           
result in losses to the Fund. Further, the Fund may be affected either          
unfavorably or favorably by fluctuations in the relative rates of exchange      
between the currencies of different nations. Cross-hedging transactions by      
the Fund involve the                                                            

The Fund may also protect against the decline of a particular foreign           
currency by entering into a forward contract to sell an amount of that          
currency approximating the value of all or a portion of the Fund's assets       
denominated in that currency ("hedging"). The success of this type of           
short-term hedging strategy is highly uncertain due to the difficulties of      
predicting short-term currency market movements and of precisely matching       
forward contract amounts and the constantly changing value of the               
securities involved. Although the Adviser will consider the likelihood of       
changes in currency values when making investment decisions, the Adviser        
believes that it is important to be able to enter into forward contracts        
when it believes the interests of the Fund will be served. The Fund will        
not enter into forward contracts for hedging purposes in a particular           
currency in an amount in                                                        

A call option gives the purchaser the right to buy, and the writer the          
obligation to sell, the underlying currency, security or other asset at the     
exercise price during the option period. A put option gives the purchaser       
the right to sell, and the writer the obligation to buy, the underlying         
currency, security or other asset at the exercise price during the option       
period. The writer of a covered call owns assets that are acceptable for        
escrow, and the writer of a secured put invests an amount not less than the     
exercise price in eligible assets to the extent that it is obligated as a       
writer. If a call written by the Fund is exercised, the Fund foregoes any       
possible profit from an increase in the market price of the underlying          
asset over the exercise price plus the premium received. In writing             

FUTURES AND OPTIONS ON FUTURES.  The Fund may enter into futures contracts      
involving foreign currency, securities, and securities indices, or options      
thereon, for bona fide hedging purposes. The Fund may also enter into such      
futures contracts or related options for purposes other than bona fide          
hedging if the aggregate amount of initial margin deposits exclusive of the     
margin needed for foreign currency hedging, on the Fund's futures and           
related options positions would not exceed 5% of the net liquidation value      
of the Fund's assets, provided further that in the case of an option that       
is in-the-money at the time of the purchase, the in-the-money amount may be     
excluded in calculating the 5% limitation. In addition, the Fund may not        
sell futures contracts if the value of such futures contracts exceeds the       
total market value of the Fund's portfolio securities. Futures contracts        
and                                                                             

The Fund may enter into securities index futures contracts and purchase and     
write put and call options on securities index futures contracts that are       
traded on regulated exchanges, including non-U.S. exchanges, to the extent      
permitted by the CFTC. Securities index futures contracts are based on          
indexes that reflect the market value of securities of the firms included       
in the indexes. An index futures contract is an agreement pursuant to which     
two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to        
the differences between the value of the index at the close of the last         
trading day of the contract and the price at which the index contract was       
originally written.                                                             
The Fund may enter into securities index futures contracts to sell a            
securities index in anticipation of or during a market decline to attempt       
to offset the                                                                   

An option on a securities index futures contract gives the purchaser the        
right, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in a securities     
index futures contract. The Fund may purchase and write put and call            
options on securities index futures contracts in order to hedge all or a        
portion of its investment and may enter into closing purchase transactions      
with respect to written options in order to terminate existing positions.       
There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected. The       
Fund may also invest in options on securities index futures contracts when      
the Adviser believes such investment is more efficient, liquid or cost-         
effective than investing directly in the futures contract or in the             
securities underlying the index, or when the futures contract or underlying     
securities are not available for investment upon favorable terms.               
The use of                                                                      

It is not certain that a secondary market for positions in futures              
contracts or for options will exist at all times. Although the Adviser will     
consider liquidity before entering into these transactions, there is no         
assurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange or otherwise will       
exist for any particular futures contract or option at any particular time.     
The Fund's ability to establish and close out futures and options positions     
depends on this secondary market.                                               
New futures contracts, options thereon, and other financial products and        
risk management techniques continue to be developed. The Fund may use these     
investments and techniques to the extent consistent with its investment         
objectives and regulatory and federal tax considerations.                       
RISKS OF FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS.  When the Fund uses futures and      
options on futures as hedging devices, there is a risk that the prices of       
the securities                                                                  

SWAP AGREEMENTS.  As one way of managing its exposure to different types of     
investments, the Fund may enter into interest rate swaps, currency swaps,       
and other types of swap agreements such as caps, collars, and floors.           
Depending on how they are used, swap agreements may increase or decrease        
the overall volatility of the Fund's investments, its share price and           
yield. The Fund may invest up to 35% of its assets in swap agreements that      
the Adviser determines to be liquid.                                            
Swap agreements are sophisticated instruments that typically involve a          
small investment of cash relative to the magnitude of risks assumed. As a       
result, swaps can be highly volatile and may have a considerable impact on      
the Fund's performance. Swap agreements are subject to risks related to the     
counterparty's ability to perform, and may decline in value if the              
counterparty's creditworthiness deteriorates.                                   

The economies of foreign countries may differ from the U.S. economy in such     
respects as growth of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, currency       
depreciation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency, and balance      
of payments position. Further, the economies of developing countries            
generally are heavily dependent on international trade and, accordingly,        
have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by trade barriers,        
exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values, and         
other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with        
which they trade. These economies also have been, and may continue to be,       
adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they      
trade.                                                                          
Prior governmental approval for foreign investments may be required under       
certain circumstances in some countries, and the extent of foreign              
investment in certain debt securities and domestic companies may be subject     
to limitation. Foreign ownership                                                

With respect to any foreign country, there is the possibility of                
nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, political changes,     
governmental regulation, social instability or diplomatic developments          
(including war) which could affect adversely the economies of such              
countries or the value of the Fund's investments in those countries. In         
addition, it may be difficult to obtain and enforce a judgment in a court       
outside of the United States.                                                   
Brokerage commissions, custodial services, and other costs relating to          
investment may be more expensive than in the United States. Foreign markets     
may have different clearance and settlement procedures such as requiring        
payment for securities before delivery. In certain markets there have been      
times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of         
securities transactions, making it difficult to conduct such transactions.      
The inability of the Fund to make intended security purchases                   

Securities prices in emerging market countries can be significantly more        
volatile than in developed countries, reflecting the greater uncertainties      
of investing in lesser developed markets and economies. In particular,          
emerging market countries may have relatively unstable governments, and may     
present the risk of nationalization of businesses, expropriation,               
confiscatory taxation or, in certain instances, reversion to closed market,     
centrally planned economies. Such countries may also have restrictions on       
foreign ownership or prohibitions on the repatriation of assets, and may        
have less protection of property rights than developed countries.               
The economies of emerging market countries may be predominantly based on        
only a few industries or dependent on revenues from particular commodities      
or on international aid or development assistance, may be highly vulnerable     
to changes in local or global trade conditions, and may suffer from extreme     
and volatile debt burdens or inflation rates.                                   

CURRENCY RISKS.  Because the majority of securities purchased by the Fund       
are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, changes in            
foreign currency exchange rates will affect the Fund's net asset value; the     
value of interest earned; gains and losses realized on the sale of              
securities; and net investment income and capital gain, if any, to be           
distributed to shareholders by the Fund. If the value of a foreign currency     
rises against the U.S. dollar, the value of Fund assets denominated in the      
currency will increase; correspondingly, if the value of a foreign currency     
declines against the U.S. dollar, the value of Fund assets denominated in       
that currency will decrease. Under the United States Internal Revenue Code,     
(the "Code"), the Fund is required to separately account for the foreign        
currency component of gains or losses, which will usually be viewed under       

less readily available market quotations on foreign companies;      
differences in government regulation and supervision of foreign     
stock exchanges, brokers, listed companies, and banks;              
differences in legal systems which may affect the ability to enforce
contractual obligations or obtain court judgments;                  
the limited size of many foreign securities markets and limited     
trading volume in issuers compared to the volume of trading in U.S. 
securities could cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from  
factors that affect the quality of securities;                      
the likelihood that foreign securities may be less liquid or more   
volatile;                                                           
foreign brokerage commissions may be higher;                        
unreliable mail service between countries;                          
political or financial changes which adversely affect investments in
some countries;                                                     
increased risk of delayed settlements of portfolio transactions or  
loss of certificates for portfolio securities;                      
certain markets may require payment for securities before delivery; 
religious and ethnic instability; and                               
certain national policies which may restrict the Fund's investment  
opportunities, including restrictions on investment in issuers or   
industries deemed sensitive to national interests.                  
U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICIES. In the past, U.S. government policies have            
discouraged or restricted certain investments abroad by investors such as       
the Fund. Investors are advised that when such policies are instituted, the     
Fund will abide by them.                                                        

DIVERSIFICATION. With respect to 75% of the value of total assets, the Fund     
will not invest more than 5% in securities of any one issuer, other than        
cash, cash items, securities of investment companies or securities issued       
or guaranteed by the government of the United States or its agencies or         
instrumentalities and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S.              
government securities or acquire more than 10% of the outstanding voting        
securities of any one issuer (for which purposes all indebtedness of an         
issuer shall be deemed a single class and all preferred stock of an issuer      
shall be deemed a single class, except that futures or option contracts and     
securities of mutual funds shall not be subject to this restriction).  This     
policy cannot be changed without the approval of holders of a majority of       
the Fund's shares.                                                              
NON-DIVERSIFICATION. The underlying funds in which the Fund invests may be      
non-diversified investment companies. As such, there is no Investment           
Company Act of 1940 (`1940 Act'') limit on the percentage of assets which       
can be invested in any single issuer. An investment in such funds,              
therefore, will entail greater risks than would exist in diversified            
investment companies because the higher percentage of investments among         
fewer issuers may result in greater fluctuation in the total market value       
of the fund's portfolio. Any economic, political, or regulatory                 
developments affecting the value of the securities of such issuer held by       
the fund will have a greater impact on the total value of the fund's            
portfolio than would be the case if the fund were diversified among more        
issuers.                                                                        

However, it is anticipated that the underlying funds will comply with           
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. This requires that at the end of     
each quarter of the taxable year, the aggregate value of all investments in     
any one issuer (except U.S. government obligations, cash, cash items and        
other investment companies) which exceed 5% of a fund's total assets shall      
not exceed 50% of the value of its total assets, and, with respect to the       
remaining assets, no more than 25% of a fund's assets shall be invested in      
a single issuer.                                                                
RISK FACTORS RELATING TO INVESTING IN HIGH YIELD SECURITIES.  The debt          
securities in which the Fund invests are usually not in the three highest       
rating categories of a nationally recognized statistical rating                 
organization (AAA, AA, or A for S&P or Fitch and Aaa, Aa, or A for              
Moody's), but are in the lower rating categories or are unrated, but are of     
comparable quality and have speculative characteristics or are speculative.     
Lower-rated bonds or unrated bonds are commonly referred to as "junk            
bonds." A description of the rating categories is contained in the Appendix     
of this prospectus.                                                             
Debt obligations that are not determined to be investment grade are high-       
yield, high-risk bonds, typically subject to greater market fluctuations        
and greater risk of                                                             

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS OF INVESTING IN OTHER INVESTMENT COMPANIES            
Any investment in a mutual fund involves risk and, although the Fund            
invests in a number of underlying funds, this practice does not eliminate       
investment risk.                                                                
Under certain circumstances an underlying fund may determine to make            
payment of a redemption by a Fund wholly or partly by a distribution in         
kind of securities from its portfolio, in lieu of cash, in conformity with      
the rules of the SEC. In such cases, the Fund may hold portfolio securities     
distributed by an underlying fund until the Adviser determines that it is       
appropriate to dispose of such securities.                                      
The Fund may purchase shares of both load and no-load underlying funds          
(including those with a contingent deferred sales charge). However, in most     
cases, the Fund anticipates purchasing fund shares without a sales charge       
or qualifying for a reduction or waiver of any sales charge because of the      
amount it intends to invest in the underlying fund.                             
Under the 1940 Act, a mutual fund must sell its shares at the price             
(including sales charge, if any) described in its prospectus, and current       
rules under the 1940 Act do not permit negotiation of sales charges.            
Therefore, the Fund currently is not able to negotiate the level of the         
sales charges at which it will purchase shares of load funds. Nevertheless,     
when appropriate, the Fund will purchase such shares pursuant to (i)            
letters of intent, permitting it to obtain reduced or no sales charges by       
aggregating its intended purchases over time (generally 13 months from the      
initial purchase under the letter); (ii) rights of accumulation, permitting     
it to obtain reduced or no sales charges as it purchases additional shares      
of an underlying fund; and (iii) the right to obtain reduced or no sales        
charges by aggregating its purchases of several funds within a family of        
mutual funds.                                                                   

INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS                                                          
The Fund will not:                                                              
oborrow money directly or through reverse repurchase agreements       
(arrangements in which the Fund sells a portfolio instrument for a  
percentage of its cash value with an agreement to buy it back on a  
set date) or pledge securities except, under certain circumstances, 
the Fund may borrow up to one-third of the value of its total assets
and pledge its assets to secure such borrowings; or                 
owith respect to 75% of its total assets, invest more than 5% of the  
value of its total assets in securities of any one issuer (other    
than cash, cash items, securities of other investment companies, or 
securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government and its      
agencies or instrumentalities, and repurchase agreements            
collateralized by such securities) or acquire more than 10% of the  
outstanding voting securities of any one issuer.                    
The above investment limitations cannot be                                      

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER                                                              
Although the Fund does not intend to invest for the purpose of seeking          
short-term profits, securities in the Fund's portfolio will be sold             
whenever the Adviser believes it is appropriate to do so in light of the        
Fund's investment objective, without regard to the length of time a             
particular security may have been held. Generally, a high portfolio             
turnover rate results in increased transaction costs and higher taxes paid      
by the Fund's shareholders. In addition, a high rate of portfolio turnover      
may result in the realization of a larger amount of capital gains which,        
when distributed to the Fund's shareholders, are taxable to them.               
Transactions for the Fund's portfolio will be based only upon investment        
considerations and will not be limited by any other considerations when the     
Fund's Adviser deems it appropriate to make changes in the Fund's               
portfolio. There is no limit on the underlying funds' portfolio turnover        
rates.                                                                          
HUB AND SPOKE(R) OPTION                                                         
If the Directors determine it to be in the best interest of the Fund and        
its shareholders, the Fund may in the future seek to achieve its investment     
objective by investing all of its assets in another investment company          
having the same investment objective and substantially the same investment      
policies and restrictions as those applicable to the Fund.  It is expected      
that any such investment company would be managed in substantially the same     
manner as the Fund.                                                             

The initial shareholder of the Fund (who is an affiliate of Federated           
Global Research) voted to vest authority to use this investment structure       
in the sole discretion of the Directors.  No further approval of                
shareholders is required.  Shareholders will receive at least 30 days prior     
notice of any such investment.                                                  

In making its determination, the Directors will consider, among other           
things, the benefits to shareholders and/or the opportunity to reduce costs     
and achieve operational efficiencies.  Although it is expected that the         
Directors will not approve an arrangement that is likely to result in           
higher costs, no assurance is given that costs will remain the same or be       
materially reduced if this investment structure is implemented.                 
NET ASSET VALUE                                                                 

The Fund's net asset value per Share fluctuates. The net asset value for        
Shares is determined by adding the interest of each class of Shares in the      
market value of all securities and other assets of the Fund, subtracting        
the interest of each class of Shares in the liabilities of the Fund and         
those attributable to each class of Shares, and dividing the remainder by       
the total number of each class of Shares outstanding. The net asset value       
for each class of Shares may differ due to the variance in daily net income     
realized by each class. Such variance will reflect only accrued net income      
to which the shareholders of a particular class are entitled.                   
The net asset value of each class of Shares of the Fund is determined as of     
the close of trading (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on the New York         
Stock Exchange, Monday through Friday, except on: (i) days on which there       
are not sufficient changes in the value of the Fund's portfolio securities      
that its net asset value might be materially affected; (ii) days during         
which no Shares are tendered for redemption and no orders to purchase           
Shares are received; or (iii) the following holidays: New Year's Day,           
Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day,        
Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.                                            

INVESTING IN THE FUND                                                           

The Fund offers investors three classes of Shares that carry sales charges      
and contingent deferred sales charges in different levels of expenses.          
CLASS A SHARES. An investor who purchases Class A Shares pays a maximum         
sales charge of 5.50% at the time of purchase. As a result, Class A Shares      
are not subject to any charges when they are redeemed (except for special       
programs offered under "Purchases with Proceeds From Redemptions of             
Unaffiliated Investment Companies").  Certain purchases of Class A Shares       
qualify for reduced sales charges. See "Reducing or Eliminating the Sales       
Charge." Class A Shares have no conversion feature.                             
CLASS B SHARES. Class B Shares are sold without an initial sales charge,        
but are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge of up to 5.50% if         
redeemed within six full years following purchase. Class B Shares will          
automatically convert into Class A Shares, based on relative net asset          
value, on or around the fifteenth of the month eight full years after the       
purchase date. Class B Shares provide an investor the benefit of putting        
all of the investor's dollars to work from the time the investment is made,     
but (until conversion) will have a higher expense ratio and pay lower           
dividends than Class A Shares due to a 12b-1 fee.                               
CLASS C SHARES. Class C Shares are sold without an initial sales charge,        
but are subject to a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge on assets           
redeemed within the first 12 months following purchase. Class C Shares          
provide an investor the benefit of putting all of the investor's dollars to     
work from the time the investment is made, but will have a higher expense       
ratio and pay lower dividends than Class A Shares due to their 12b-1 fee.       
Class C Shares have no conversion feature.                                      

HOW TO PURCHASE SHARES 

Shares of the Fund are sold on days on which the New York Stock Exchange is     
open. Shares of the Fund may be purchased as described below, either            
through a financial institution (such as a bank or broker/dealer which has      
a sales agreement with the distributor) or by wire or by check directly to      
the Fund, with a minimum initial investment of $500 for Class A Shares and      
$1,500 for Class B Shares and Class C Shares. Additional investments can be     
made for as little as $100. The minimum initial and subsequent investment       
for retirement plans is only $50. (Financial institutions may impose            
different minimum investment requirements on their customers.)                  
In connection with any sale, Federated Securities Corp., may, from time to      
time, offer certain items of nominal value to any shareholder or investor.      
The Fund reserves the right to reject any purchase request. An account must

*See sub-section entitled "Dealer Concession" below.                            
No sales charge is imposed for Class A Shares purchased through financial       
intermediaries that do not receive a reallowance of a sales charge.             
However, investors who purchase Class A Shares through a trust department,      
Adviser, or other financial intermediary may be charged a service or other      
fee by the financial intermediary. Additionally, no sales charge is imposed     
on shareholders designated as Liberty Life Members or on Class A Shares         
purchased through "wrap accounts" or similar programs, under which clients      
pay a fee for services.                                                         

DEALER CONCESSION. For sales of Class A Shares, a dealer will normally          
receive up to 90% of the applicable sales charge.  Any portion of the sales     
charge which is not paid to a dealer will be retained by the distributor.       
However, the distributor may offer to pay dealers up to 100% of the sales       
charge retained by it.  Such payments may take the form of cash or              
promotional incentives, such as reimbursement of certain expenses of            
qualified employees and their spouses to attend informational meetings          
about the Fund, or other special events at recreational-type facilities, or     
of items of material value. In some instances, these incentives will be         
made available only to dealers whose employees have sold or may sell a          
significant amount of Shares. On purchases of $1 million or more, the           
investor pays no sales charge; however, the distributor will make twelve        
monthly payments to the dealer totaling 0.25% of the public offering price      
over the first year following the purchase. Such payments are based on the      
original purchase price of Shares outstanding at each month end.                
The sales charge for Shares sold other than through registered                  
broker/dealers will be retained by Federated Securities Corp. Federated         
Securities Corp. may pay fees to banks out of the sales charge in exchange      
for sales and/or administrative services performed on behalf of the bank's      
customers in connection with the initiation of customer accounts and            
purchases of Shares.                                                            
REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE SALES CHARGE. The sales charge can be reduced       
or eliminated on the purchase of Class A Shares through:                        
quantity discounts and accumulated purchases;                       
concurrent purchases.                                               
signing a 13-month letter of intent;                                
using the reinvestment privilege; or                                
purchases with proceeds from redemptions of unaffiliated investment 
companies.                                                          

QUANTITY DISCOUNTS AND ACCUMULATED PURCHASES. As shown in the table on the      
previous page, larger purchases may reduce the sales charge paid. The Fund      
will combine purchases of Class A Shares made on the same day by the            
investor, the investor's spouse, and the investor's children under age 21       
when it calculates the sales charge. In addition, the sales charge, if          
applicable, is eliminated or reduced for purchases made at one time by a        
trustee or fiduciary for a single trust estate or a single fiduciary            
account.                                                                        
If an additional purchase of Class A Shares is made, the Fund will consider     
the previous purchases still invested in the Fund. For example, if a            
shareholder already owns Class A Shares having a current value at the           
public offering price of $90,000 and he purchases $10,000 more at the           
current public offering price, the sales charge as a percentage of public       
offering price on the additional purchase according to the schedule now in      
effect would be 3.75%, not 4.50%.                                               
To receive the sales charge reduction, Federated Securities Corp. must be       
notified by the shareholder in writing or by his financial institution at       
the time the purchase is made that Class A Shares are already owned or that     
purchases are being combined. The Fund will reduce the sales charge after       
it confirms the purchases.                                                      
CONCURRENT PURCHASES. For purposes of qualifying for a sales charge             
elimination or reduction, a shareholder has the privilege of combining          
concurrent purchases of Class A Shares of two or more Federated Funds, the      
purchase price of which includes a sales charge. For example, if a              
shareholder concurrently invested $30,000 in Class A Shares of one of the       
other Federated Funds with a sales charge, and $20,000 in this Fund, the        
sales charge would be reduced.                                                  

To receive this sales charge reduction, Federated Securities Corp. must be      
notified by the shareholder in writing or by his financial institution at       
the time the concurrent purchases are made. The Fund will eliminate or          
reduce the sales charge after it confirms the purchases.                        
LETTER OF INTENT. If a shareholder intends to purchase at least $50,000 of      
Class A Shares of Federated Funds (excluding money market funds) over the       
next 13 months, the sales charge may be reduced by signing a letter of          
intent to that effect. This letter of intent includes a provision for a         
sales charge adjustment depending on the amount actually purchased within       
the 13-month period and a provision for the custodian to hold up to 5.50%       
of the total amount intended to be purchased in escrow (in Shares) until        
such purchase is completed.                                                     
The Shares held in escrow in the shareholder's account will be released         
upon fulfillment of the letter of intent or  the end of the 13-month            
period, whichever comes first.  If the amount specified in the letter of        
intent is not purchased, an appropriate number of escrowed Shares may be        
redeemed in order to realize the difference in the sales charge.                
While this letter of intent will not obligate the shareholder to purchase       
Shares, each purchase during the period will be at the sales charge             
applicable to the total amount intended to be purchased. At the time a          
letter of intent is established, current balances in accounts in any Class      
A Shares of any Federated Fund, excluding money market accounts, will be        
aggregated to provide a purchase credit towards fulfillment of the letter       
of intent. Prior trade prices will not be adjusted.                             

REINVESTMENT PRIVILEGE. If Class A Shares in the Fund have been redeemed,       
the shareholder has the privilege, within 120 days, to reinvest the             
redemption proceeds at the next-determined net asset value without any          
sales charge. Federated Securities Corp. must be notified by the                
shareholder in writing or by his financial institution of the reinvestment      
in order to eliminate a sales charge. If the shareholder redeems his Class      
A Shares in the Fund, there may be tax consequences.                            
INVESTING IN CLASS B SHARES                                                     
Class B Shares are sold at their net asset value next determined after an       
order is received. While Class B Shares are sold without an initial sales       
charge, under certain circumstances described under "Contingent Deferred
Sales Charge--Class B Shares," a contingent deferred sales charge may be        
applied by the distributor at the time Class B Shares are redeemed.             
CONVERSION OF CLASS B SHARES. Class B Shares will automatically convert         
into Class A Shares on or around the fifteenth of the month eight full          
years after the purchase date, except as noted below, and will no longer be     
subject to a fee under the Fund's Distribution Plan (see "Distribution of
Shares"). Such conversion will be on the basis of the relative net asset        
value per Share, without the imposition of any sales charge, fee, or other      
charge. Class B Shares acquired by exchange from Class B Shares of another      
Federated Fund will convert into Class A Shares based on the time of the        
initial purchase. Each time any Class B Shares in the shareholder's account     
(other than those in the sub-account) convert to Class A Shares, an equal       
pro rata portion of the Class B Shares in the sub-account will also convert     
to Class A Shares. The conversion of Class B Shares to Class A Shares is        
subject to the continuing availability of a ruling from the Internal            
Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel that such conversions will not         
constitute taxable events for federal tax purposes. There can be no             
assurance that such ruling or opinion will be available, and the conversion     

of Class B Shares to Class A Shares will not occur if such ruling or            
opinion is not available. In such event, Class B Shares would continue to       
be subject to higher expenses than Class A Shares for an indefinite period.     
Orders for $250,000 or more of Class B Shares will automatically be             
invested in Class A Shares.                                                     
INVESTING IN CLASS C SHARES                                                     
Class C Shares are sold at net asset value next determined after an order       
is received. A contingent deferred sales charge of 1.00% will be charged on     
assets redeemed within the first full 12 months following purchase. For a       
complete description of this charge see "Contingent Deferred Sales Charge--     
Class C Shares."
PURCHASING SHARES                                                               
PURCHASING SHARES THROUGH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. An investor may call his     
financial institution (such as a bank or an investment dealer) to place an      
order to purchase Shares. Orders placed through a financial institution are     
considered received when the Fund is notified of the purchase order or when     
payment is converted into federal funds. Purchase orders through a              
registered broker/dealer must be received by the broker before 4:00 p.m.        
(Eastern time) and must be transmitted by the broker to the Fund before         
5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) in order for Shares to be purchased at that day's      
price. Purchase orders through other financial institutions must be             
received by the financial institution and transmitted to the Fund before        
4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) in order for Shares to be purchased at that day's      
price. It is the financial institution's responsibility to transmit orders      
promptly. Financial institutions may charge additional fees for their           
services.                                                                       

The financial institutions which maintain investor accounts in Class B          
Shares or Class C Shares with the Fund must do so on a fully disclosed          
basis unless they account for share ownership periods used in calculating       
the contingent deferred sales charge (see "Contingent Deferred Sales
Charge"). In addition, advance payments made to financial institutions may      
be subject to reclaim by the distributor for accounts transferred to            
financial institutions which do not maintain investor accounts on a fully       
disclosed basis and do not account for share ownership periods.                 
PURCHASING SHARES BY WIRE. Once an account has been established, Shares may     
be purchased by Federal Reserve wire by calling the Fund. All information       
needed will be taken over the telephone, and the order is considered            
received immediately. Payment for purchases which are subject to a sales        
charge must be received within three business days following the order.         
Payment for purchases on which no sales charge is imposed must be received      
before 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the next business day following the          
order. Federal funds should be wired as follows: Federated Shareholder          
Services Company, c/o State Street Bank and Trust Company, Boston,              
Massachusetts; Attention: EDGEWIRE; For Credit to: (Fund Name) (Fund

by contacting the Fund); Account Number; Trade Date and Order Number; Group     
Number or Dealer Number; Nominee or Institution Name; and ABA Number            
011000028. Shares cannot be purchased by wire on holidays when wire             
transfers are restricted. Questions on wire purchases should be directed to     
your shareholder services representative at the telephone number listed on      
your account statement.                                                         

PURCHASING SHARES BY CHECK. Once an account has been established, Shares        
may be purchased by mailing a check made payable to the name of the Fund        
(designate class of Shares and account number) to: Federated Shareholder        
Services Company, P.O. Box 8600, Boston, Massachusetts 02266-8600. Orders       
by mail are considered received when payment by check is converted into         
federal funds (normally the business day after the check is received).          
SPECIAL PURCHASE FEATURES                                                       
SYSTEMATIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM. Once a Fund account has been opened,             
shareholders may add to their investment on a regular basis in a minimum        
amount of $100. Under this program, funds may be automatically withdrawn        
periodically from the shareholder's checking account at an Automated            
Clearing House ("ACH") member and invested in the Fund at the net asset         
value next determined after an order is received by the Fund, plus the          
applicable sales charge. Shareholders should contact their financial            
institution or the Fund to participate in this program.                         
RETIREMENT PLANS. Fund Shares can be purchased as an investment for             
retirement plans or for Individual Retirement Accounts (`IRAs''). For           
further details, contact the Fund and consult a tax adviser.                    
EXCHANGE PRIVILEGE                                                              

CLASS A SHARES. Class A shareholders may exchange all or some of their          
Shares for Class A Shares of other Federated Funds at net asset value.          
Neither the Fund nor any of the Federated Funds imposes any additional fees     
on exchanges. Shareholders in certain other Federated Funds may exchange        
all or some of their shares for Class A Shares.                                 

CLASS B SHARES. Class B shareholders may exchange all or some of their          
Shares for Class B Shares of other Federated Funds. (Not all Federated          
Funds currently offer Class B Shares. Contact your financial institution        
regarding the availability of other Class B Shares of the Federated Funds).     
Exchanges are made at net asset value without being assessed a contingent       
deferred sales charge on the exchanged Shares. To the extent that a             
shareholder exchanges Shares for Class B Shares in other Federated Funds,       
the time for which the exchanged-for Shares are to be held will be added to     
the time for which exchanged-from Shares were held for purposes of              
satisfying the applicable holding period. For more information, see             
"Contingent Deferred Sales Charge."                                             
CLASS C SHARES. Class C shareholders may exchange all or some of their          
Shares for Class C Shares of other Federated Funds at net asset value           
without a contingent deferred sales charge. (Not all Federated Funds            
currently offer Class C Shares. Contact your financial institution              
regarding the availability of other Class C Shares of the Federated Funds.)     
To the extent that a shareholder exchanges Shares for Class C Shares of         
other Federated Funds, the time for which the exchanged-for Shares are to       
be held will be added to the time for which exchanged-from Shares were held     
for purposes of satisfying the applicable holding period. For more              
information, see "Contingent Deferred Sales Charge."                            
Please contact your financial institution directly or Federated Securities      
Corp. at 1-800-341-7400 for information on and prospectuses for the             
Federated Fund into which your Shares may be exchanged free of charge.          
Shareholders of Class A Shares who have been designated Liberty Life            
Members are exempt from sales charges on future purchases in and exchanges      
between the Class A Shares of any Federated Fund, as long as they maintain      
a $500 balance in one of the Federated Funds.                                   

REQUIREMENTS FOR EXCHANGE. Shareholders using this privilege must exchange      
Shares having a net asset value equal to the minimum investment                 
requirements of the fund into which the exchange is being made. Before the      
exchange, the shareholder must receive a prospectus of the fund for which       
the exchange is being made.                                                     
Upon receipt of proper instructions and required supporting documents,          
Shares submitted for exchange are redeemed and the proceeds invested in         
shares of the other fund. The exchange privilege may be modified or             
terminated at any time. Shareholders will be notified of the modification       
or termination of the exchange privilege.                                       
TAX CONSEQUENCES. An exercise of the exchange privilege is treated as a         
sale for federal income tax purposes. Depending on the circumstances, a         
short-term or long-term capital gain or loss may be realized.                   
MAKING AN EXCHANGE. Instructions for exchanging may be given in writing or      
by telephone. Written instructions may require a signature guarantee.           
Shareholders of the Fund may have difficulty in making exchanges by             
telephone through brokers and other financial institutions during times of      
drastic economic or market changes. If a shareholder cannot contact his         
broker or financial institution by telephone, it is recommended that an         
exchange request be made in writing and sent by overnight mail to Federated     
Shareholder Services Company, 1099 Hingham Street, Rockland, Massachusetts
02370-3317.                                                                     

TELEPHONE INSTRUCTIONS. Telephone instructions made by the investor may be      
carried out only if a telephone authorization form completed by the             
investor is on file with the Fund. If the instructions are given by a           
broker, a telephone authorization form completed by the broker must be on       
file with the Fund. If reasonable procedures are not followed by the Fund,      
it may be liable for losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent telephone         
instructions. Shares may be exchanged between two funds by telephone only       
if the two funds have identical shareholder registrations.                      
Any Shares held in certificate form cannot be exchanged by telephone but        
must be forwarded to Federated Shareholder Services Company, P.O. Box 8600,     
Boston, Massachusetts 02266-8600, and deposited to the shareholder's           
account before being exchanged.  Telephone exchange instructions may be         
recorded and will be binding upon the shareholder. Such instructions will       
be processed as of 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) and must be received by the         
Fund before that time for Shares to be exchanged the same day. Shareholders     
exchanging into a fund will not receive any dividend that is payable to         
shareholders of record on that date. This privilege may be modified or          
terminated at any time.                                                         
HOW TO REDEEM SHARES                                                            

Shares are redeemed at their net asset value, less any applicable               
contingent deferred sales charge, next determined after the Fund receives       
the redemption request. Redemptions will be made on days on which the Fund      
computes its net asset value.  Investors who redeem Shares through a            
financial intermediary may be charged a service fee by that financial           
intermediary.  Redemption requests must be received in proper form and may      
be made as described below.                                                     

REDEEMING SHARES THROUGH YOUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. Shares of the Fund may     
be redeemed by calling your financial institution to request the                
redemption. Shares will be redeemed at the net asset value, less any            
applicable contingent deferred sales charge next determined after the Fund      
receives the redemption request from the financial institution. Redemption      
requests through a registered broker/dealer must be received by the broker      
before 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) and must be transmitted by the broker to        
the Fund before 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) in order for Shares to be redeemed     
at that day's net asset value. Redemption requests through other financial      
institutions (such as banks) must be received by the financial institution      
and transmitted to the Fund before 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) in order for        
Shares to be redeemed at that day's net asset value. The financial              
institution is responsible for promptly submitting redemption requests and      
providing proper written redemption instructions. Customary fees and            
commissions may be charged by the financial institution for this service.       
REDEEMING SHARES BY TELEPHONE. Shares may be redeemed in any amount by          
calling the Fund provided the Fund has a properly completed authorization       
form. These forms can be obtained from Federated Securities Corp. Proceeds      
will be mailed in the form of a check to the shareholder's address of           
record or wire-transferred to the shareholder's account at a domestic           
commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System. The minimum     
amount for a wire transfer is $1,000. Proceeds from redeemed Shares             
purchased by check or through an ACH will not be wired until that method of     
payment has been cleared.  Proceeds from redemption requests received on        
holidays when wire transfers are restricted will be wired the following         
business day. Questions about telephone redemptions on days when wire           
transfers are restricted should be directed to your shareholder services        
representative at the telephone number listed on your account statement.        

Telephone redemption instructions may be recorded. If reasonable procedures     
are not followed by the Fund, it may be liable for losses due to                
unauthorized or fraudulent telephone instructions. In the event of drastic      
economic or market changes, a shareholder may experience difficulty in          
redeeming by telephone. If this occurs, "Redeeming Shares By Mail" should       
be considered. If at any time the Fund shall determine it necessary to          
terminate or modify this method of redemption, shareholders would be            
promptly notified.                                                              
REDEEMING SHARES BY MAIL. Shares may be redeemed in any amount by mailing a     
written request to: Federated Shareholder Services Company, Fund Name, Fund     
Class, P.O. Box 8600, Boston, Massachusetts 02266-8600. If share                
certificates have been issued, they should be sent unendorsed with the          
written request by registered or certified mail to the address noted above.     
The written request should state: the Fund name and the Share class             
designation; the account name as registered with the Fund; the account          
number; and the number of Shares to be redeemed or the dollar amount            
requested. All owners of the account must sign the request exactly as the       
Shares are registered. Normally, a check for the proceeds is mailed within      
one business day, but in no event more than seven days, after the receipt       
of a proper written redemption request. Dividends are paid up to and            
including the day that a redemption request is processed.                       

Shareholders requesting a redemption of any amount to be sent to an address     
other than that on record with the Fund, or a redemption payable other than     
to the shareholder of record must have their signatures guaranteed by a         
commercial or savings bank, trust company or savings association whose          
deposits are insured by an organization which is administered by the            
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; a member firm of a domestic stock        
exchange; or any other "eligible guarantor institution," as defined in the      
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Fund does not accept signatures            
guaranteed by a notary public.                                                  
SPECIAL REDEMPTION FEATURES                                                     
SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PROGRAM. Shareholders who desire to receive payments      
of a predetermined amount not less than $100 may take advantage of the          
Systematic Withdrawal Program. Under this program, Shares are redeemed to       
provide for periodic withdrawal payments in an amount directed by the           
shareholder.                                                                    
Depending upon the amount of the withdrawal payments, the amount of             
dividends paid and capital gains distributions with respect to Shares, and      
the fluctuation of the net asset value of Shares redeemed under this            
program, redemptions may reduce, and eventually deplete, the shareholder's      
investment in the Fund. For this reason, payments under this program should     
not be considered as yield or income on the shareholder's investment in the     
Fund. To be eligible to participate in this program, a shareholder must         
have an account value of at least $10,000, other than retirement accounts       
subject to required minimum distributions. A shareholder may apply for          
participation in this program through his financial institution. Due to the     
fact that Class A Shares are sold with a sales charge, it is not advisable      
for shareholders to continue to purchase Class A Shares while participating     
in this program. A contingent deferred sales charge may be imposed on Class     
B Shares and Class C Shares.                                                    

CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE 
Shareholders may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge upon          
redemption of their Shares under the following circumstances:                   
CLASS A SHARES. Class A Shares purchased under a periodic special offering      
with the proceeds of a redemption of shares of an unaffiliated investment       
company purchased or redeemed with a sales charge and not distributed by        
Federated Securities Corp. may be charged a contingent deferred sales           
charge of .50% for redemptions made within one full year of purchase. Any       
applicable contingent deferred sales charge will be imposed on the lesser       
of the net asset value of the redeemed Shares at the time of purchase or        
the net asset value of the redeemed Shares at the time of redemption.           
CLASS B SHARES. Shareholders redeeming Class B Shares from their Fund           
accounts within six full years of the purchase date of those Shares will be     
charged a contingent deferred sales charge by the Fund's distributor. Any       
applicable contingent deferred sales charge will be imposed on the lesser       
of the net asset value of the redeemed Shares at the time of purchase or        
the net asset value of the redeemed Shares at the time of redemption in         
accordance with the following schedule:                                         
CONTINGENT                  
YEAR OF REDEMPTION        DEFERRED                                              
AFTER PURCHASE            SALES CHARGE                                          
First                        5.50%                                              
Second                       4.75%                                              
Third                        4.00%                                              
Fourth                       3.00%                                              
Fifth                        2.00%                                              
Sixth                        1.00%                                              
Seventh and thereafter       0.00%                                              

CLASS C SHARES. Shareholders redeeming Class C Shares from their Fund           
accounts within one full year of the purchase date of those Shares will be      
charged a contingent deferred sales charge by the Fund's distributor of         
1.00%. Any applicable contingent deferred sales charge will be imposed on       
the lesser of the net asset value of the redeemed Shares at the time of         
purchase or the net asset value of the redeemed Shares at the time of           
redemption.                                                                     
CLASS A SHARES, CLASS B SHARES, AND CLASS C SHARES. The contingent deferred     
sales charge will be deducted from the redemption proceeds otherwise            
payable to the shareholder and will be retained by the distributor. The         
contingent deferred sales charge will not be imposed with respect to: (1)       
Shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends or distributions of       
long-term capital gains; and (2) Shares held for more than six full years       
from the date of purchase with respect to Class B Shares and one full year      
from the date of purchase with respect to Class C Shares and applicable         
Class A Shares.  Redemptions will be processed in a manner intended to          
maximize the amount of redemption which will not be subject to a contingent     
deferred sales charge. In computing the amount of the applicable contingent     
deferred sales charge, redemptions are deemed to have occurred in the           
following order: (1) Shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends      
and long-term capital gains; (2) Shares held for more than six full years       
from the date of purchase with respect to Class B Shares and one full year      
from the date of purchase with respect to Class C Shares and applicable         
Class A Shares; (3) Shares held for fewer than six years with respect to        
Class B Shares and less than one full year from the date of purchase with       
respect to Class C Shares and applicable Class A Shares on a first-in,          
first-out basis. A contingent deferred sales charge is not assessed in          
connection with an exchange of Fund Shares for shares of other Federated        
Funds in the same class (see "Exchange Privilege"). Any contingent deferred     

sales charge imposed at the time the exchanged-for Shares are redeemed is       
calculated as if the shareholder had held the Shares from the date on which     
he became a shareholder of the exchanged-from Shares. Moreover, the             
contingent deferred sales charge will be eliminated with respect to certain     
redemptions (see "Elimination of Contingent Deferred Sales Charge").            
ELIMINATION OF CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE                                 
The contingent deferred sales charge will be eliminated with respect to the     
following redemptions:  (1) redemptions following the death or disability,      
as defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, of the     
last surviving shareholder; (2) redemptions representing minimum required       
distributions from an IRA or other retirement plan to a shareholder who has     
attained the age of 70 1/2; (3) involuntary redemptions by the Fund of          
Shares in shareholder accounts that do not comply with the minimum balance      
requirements; and (4) qualifying redemptions of Class B Shares under a          
Systematic Withdrawal Program.  To qualify for elimination of the               
contingent deferred sales charge through a Systematic Withdrawal Program,       
the redemptions of Class B Shares must be from an account: that is at least     
12 months old, has all Fund distributions reinvested in Fund Shares, and        
has a value of at least $10,000 when the Systematic Withdrawal Program is       
established.  Qualifying redemptions may not exceed 1.00% monthly of the        
account value as periodically determined by the Fund.  For more information     
regarding the elimination of the contingent deferred sales charge through a     
Systematic Withdrawal Program contact your financial intermediary or the        
Fund.  No contingent deferred sales charge will be imposed on redemptions       
of Shares held by Directors, employees and sales representatives of the         
Fund, the distributor, or affiliates of the Fund or distributor, and their      
immediate family members; employees of any financial institution that sells     
Shares of the Fund pursuant to a sales agreement with the distributor; and      
spouses and children under the age of 21 of the aforementioned persons.         

Finally, no contingent deferred sales charge will be imposed on the             
redemption of Shares originally purchased through a bank trust department,      
an Adviser registered under the Advisers Act of 1940 or retirement plans        
where the third party administrator has entered into certain arrangements       
with Federated Securities Corp. or its affiliates, or any other financial       
institution, to the extent that no payments were advanced for purchases         
made through such entities.  The Fund reserves the right to discontinue or      
modify the elimination of the contingent deferred sales charge.                 
Shareholders will be notified of a discontinuation.  Any Shares purchased       
prior to the termination of such waiver would have the contingent deferred      
sales charge eliminated as provided in the Fund's prospectus at the time of     
the purchase of the Shares.  If a shareholder making a redemption qualifies     
for an elimination of the contingent deferred sales charge, the shareholder     
must notify Federated Securities Corp. or the transfer agent in writing         
that the shareholder is entitled to such elimination.                           
ACCOUNT AND SHARE INFORMATION                                                   
CERTIFICATES AND CONFIRMATIONS                                                  
As transfer agent for the Fund, Federated Shareholder Services Company          
maintains a Share account for each shareholder. Share certificates are not      
issued unless requested in writing to Federated Shareholder Services            
Company.                                                                        
Detailed confirmations of each purchase and redemption are sent to each         
shareholder. Annual confirmations are sent to report dividends paid during      
the year.                                                                       

DIVIDENDS                                                                       
Dividends are declared and paid annually to all shareholders invested in        
the Fund on the record date. Dividends are automatically reinvested in          
additional Shares on the payment date, at the ex-dividend date net asset        
value without a sales charge, unless shareholders request cash payments on      
the new account form or by writing to the transfer agent. All shareholders      
on the record date are entitled to the dividend. If Shares are redeemed or      
exchanged prior to the record date, or purchased after the record date,         
those Shares are not entitled to that year's dividend.                          
CAPITAL GAINS                                                                   
Net long-term capital gains realized by the Fund, if any, will be               
distributed at least once every twelve months.                                  
ACCOUNTS WITH LOW BALANCES                                                      
Due to the high cost of maintaining accounts with low balances, the Fund        
may redeem Shares in any account, except retirement plans, and pay the          
proceeds to the shareholder if the account balance falls below the Class A      
Shares required minimum value of $500 or the required minimum value of          
$1,500 for Class B Shares and Class C Shares. This requirement does not         
apply, however, if the balance falls below the required minimum value           
because of changes in the net asset value of the respective Share class.        
Before Shares are redeemed to close an account, the shareholder is notified     
in writing and allowed 30 days to purchase additional Shares to meet the        
minimum requirement.                                                            

CORPORATION INFORMATION                                                         

MANAGEMENT OF THE CORPORATION 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The Corporation is managed by a Board of Directors. The     
Directors are responsible for managing the Corporation's business affairs       
and for exercising all the Corporation's powers except those reserved for       
the shareholders. An Executive Committee of the Board of Directors handles      
the Board's responsibilities between meetings of the Board.                     
ADVISER. Investment decisions for the Fund are made by Federated Global         
Research Corp., the Fund's Adviser, subject to direction by the Directors.      
The Adviser continually conducts investment research and supervision for        
the Fund and is responsible for the purchase or sale of portfolio               
instruments, for which it receives an annual fee from the Fund.                 
ADVISORY FEES. The Adviser receives an annual investment advisory fee equal     
to 1.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets. This advisory fee applies      
only to individual portfolio securities and not to investment in the            
underlying funds.  The fee paid by the Fund, while higher than the advisory     
fee paid by other mutual funds in general, is comparable to fees paid by        
many mutual funds with similar objectives and policies. The Adviser may         
voluntarily waive a portion of its fee. The Adviser can terminate this          
voluntary waiver at any time at its sole discretion.                            
The investment advisory fees of the underlying funds are not included in        
the discussion of the Fund's advisory fee above. By investing in the Fund,      
you bear not only the Fund's expenses, but also similar expenses of the         
underlying funds. You would not incur the Fund's expenses if you were to        
invest in the underlying funds directly.                                        

ASSET ALLOCATION FEE. The Adviser provides its asset allocation services to     
the Fund for which it receives an annual fee equal to .20% of the Fund's        
average daily net assets.  The Adviser determines the percentage of Fund        
assets to be allocated among the underlying funds. The Adviser monitors the     
allocation of the Fund's assets and is responsible for supervising              
compliance with the Fund's investment objective and policies.The Adviser        
will regularly review the Fund's allocation among the underlying funds and      
make any changes, within the ranges established for each underlying fund,       
that it believes will provide the most favorable outlook for achieving the      
Fund's investment objective.                                                    
ADVISER'S BACKGROUND. Federated Global Research Corp., incorporated in          
Delaware on May 12, 1995, is a registered investment adviser under the          
Advisers Act of 1940. It is a subsidiary of Federated Investors. All of the     
Class A (voting) shares of Federated Investors are owned by a trust, the        
trustees of which are John F. Donahue, Chairman and Trustee of Federated

and private accounts. Certain other subsidiaries also provide                   
administrative services to a number of investment companies. With over $76

Investors is one of the largest mutual fund investment managers in the          
United States. With more than 2,000 employees, Federated continues to be        
led by the management who founded the company in 1955.  Federated Funds are     
presently at work in and through 4,500 financial institutions nationwide.       

Drew J. Collins has been the Fund's portfolio manager since inception.  Mr.     
Collins joined Federated Investors in 1995 as a Senior Vice President of        
the Fund's Adviser. Mr. Collins served as a Vice President/Portfolio            
Manager of international equity portfolios at Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder,      
Inc. from 1994 to 1995. He served as an Assistant Vice President/ Portfolio     
Manager for international equities at the College Retirement Equities Fund      
from 1986 to 1994. Mr. Collins is a Chartered Financial Analyst and             
received his M.B.A. in finance from the Wharton School of The University of     
Pennsylvania.                                                                   
Henry A. Frantzen has been the Fund's portfolio manager since inception.        
Mr. Frantzen joined Federated Investors in 1995 as an Executive Vice            
President of the Fund's Adviser.  Mr. Frantzen served as Chief Investment       
Officer of international equities at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. from         
1992 until 1995.                                                                
Both the Corporation and the Adviser have adopted strict codes of ethics        
governing the conduct of all employees who manage the Fund and its              
portfolio securities. These codes recognize that such persons owe a             
fiduciary duty to the Fund's shareholders and must place the interests of       
shareholders ahead of the employees' own interest. Among other things, the      
codes: require preclearance and periodic reporting of personal securities       
transactions; prohibit personal transactions in securities being purchased      
or sold, or being considered for purchase or sale, by the Fund; prohibit        
purchasing securities in initial public offerings; and prohibit taking          
profits on securities held for less than sixty days. Violations of these        
codes are subject to review by the Directors, and could result in severe        
penalties.                                                                      

DISTRIBUTION OF SHARES 
Federated Securities Corp. is the principal distributor for Shares of the       
Fund. Federated Securities Corp. is located at Federated Investors Tower,       
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-3779. It is a Pennsylvania corporation           
organized on November 14, 1969, and is the principal distributor for a          
number of investment companies. Federated Securities Corp. is a subsidiary      
of Federated Investors.                                                         
The distributor may offer to pay financial institutions an amount equal to      
1% of the net asset value of Class C Shares purchased by their clients or       
customers at the time of purchase. These payments will be made directly by      
the distributor from its assets, and will not be made from assets of the        
Fund. Financial institutions may elect to waive the initial payment             
described above; such waiver will result in the waiver by the Fund of the       
otherwise applicable contingent deferred sales charge.                          

DISTRIBUTION PLAN AND SHAREHOLDER SERVICES.  Under a distribution plan          
adopted in accordance with Investment Company Act Rule 12b-1 (the               
"Distribution Plan"), the distributor may be paid a fee in an amount            
computed at an annual rate of up to 0.25% for Class A Shares and up to          
0.75% for Class B Shares and Class C Shares of the average daily net assets     
of each class of Shares to finance any activity which is principally            
intended to result in the sale of Shares subject to the Distribution Plan.      
The Fund does not currently make payments to the distributor or charge a        
fee under the Distribution Plan for Class A Shares, and shareholders of         
Class A Shares will be notified if the Fund intends to charge a fee under       
the Distribution Plan. For Class A Shares and Class C Shares, the               
distributor may select financial                                                

In addition, the Fund has entered into a Shareholder Services Agreement         
with Federated Shareholder Services, a subsidiary of Federated Investors,       
under which the Fund may make payments up to 0.25% of the average daily net     
asset value of Class A Shares, Class B Shares, and Class C Shares to obtain     
certain personal services for shareholders and for the maintenance of           
shareholder accounts ("Shareholder Services"). The fee paid by the Fund to      
Federated Shareholder Services will be reduced to the extent that the Fund      
receives a fee from an underlying fund pursuant to the underlying fund's        
Shareholder Services Agreement with Federated Shareholder Services.  Under      
the Shareholder Services Agreement, Federated Shareholder Services will         
either perform Shareholder Services directly or will select financial           
institutions to perform Shareholder Services. Financial institutions will       
receive fees based upon Shares owned by their clients or customers. The         
schedules of such fees and the basis upon which such fees will be paid will     
be determined from time to time by the Fund and Federated Shareholder           
Services.                                                                       
In addition to payments                                                         

Furthermore, with respect to Class A Shares, Class B Shares, and Class C        
Shares, Federated Securities Corp. and Federated Shareholder Services may       
offer to pay a fee from their own assets to financial institutions as           
financial assistance for providing substantial sales services, distribution     
related support services or shareholder services. The support may include       
sponsoring sales, educational and training seminars for their employees,        
providing sales literature, and engineering computer software programs that     
emphasize the attributes of the Fund. Such assistance will be predicated        
upon the amount of Shares the financial institution sells or may sell,          
and/or upon the type and nature of sales or marketing support furnished by      
the financial institution. Any payments made by the distributor may be          
reimbursed by the Fund's Adviser or its affiliates.                             
ADMINISTRATION OF THE FUND                                                      
Federated Services Company, a subsidiary of Federated Investors, provides       
administrative personnel and services (including certain legal and              
financial reporting services) necessary to operate the Corporation and the      
Fund. Federated Services Company provides these at an annual rate which         
relates to the                                                                  

EXPENSES OF THE FUND AND CLASS A SHARES, CLASS B SHARES, AND CLASS C SHARES     
Holders of Class A, Class B, and Class C Shares pay their allocable portion     
of Corporation and portfolio expenses.                                          
The Corporation expenses for which holders of Class A, Class B, and Class C     
Shares pay their allocable portion include, but are not limited to: the         
cost of organizing the Corporation and continuing its existence;                
registering the Corporation with federal and state securities authorities;      
Directors' fees; auditors' fees; the cost of meetings of Directors; legal       
fees of the Corporation; association membership dues; and such non-             
recurring and extraordinary items as may arise from time to time.               
The portfolio expenses for which holders of Class A, Class B, and Class C       
Shares pay their allocable portion include, but are not limited to:             
registering the portfolio and Shares of the portfolio; investment advisory      
services; taxes and commissions; custodian fees; insurance premiums;            
auditors' fees; and such non-recurring and extraordinary items as may arise     
from time to time.                                                              

At present, the only expenses which are allocated specifically to Class A,      
Class B, and Class C Shares as classes are expenses under the Corporation's     
Distribution Plan and fees for Shareholder Services. However, the Directors     
reserve the right to allocate certain other expenses to holders of Class A,     
Class B, and Class C Shares as it deems appropriate ("Class Expenses"). In      
any case, Class Expenses would be limited to: distribution fees; transfer       
agent fees as identified by the transfer agent as attributable to holders       
of Class A, Class B, and Class C Shares; fees for Shareholder Services;         
printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing             
materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current      
shareholders; registration fees paid to the Securities and Exchange             
Commission and registration fees paid to state securities commissions;          
expenses related to administrative personnel and services as required to        
support holders of Class A, Class B, and Class C Shares; legal fees             
relating solely to Class A, Class B, and Class C Shares and Directors' fees     
incurred as a result of issues relating solely to Class A, Class B, and         
Class C Shares.                                                                 

An investor in the Fund should recognize that you may invest directly in        
underlying funds and that, by investing in underlying funds indirectly          
through the Fund, you will bear not only your proportionate share of the        
expenses of the Fund and as described above, but also, indirectly, similar      
expenses of the underlying funds. In addition, you will bear your               
proportionate share of expenses, if any,  related to the distribution of        
the Fund's shares, see "Distribution of Shares," and also may indirectly        
bear expenses paid by an underlying fund related to the distribution of its     
shares. You also will bear your proportionate share of any sales charges        
incurred by the Fund related to the purchase of shares of the underlying        
funds. However, in certain instances, the Fund may be eligible to purchase      
underlying funds at a reduced or no sales charge, whereas an individual         
investor would have to pay the full sales charge if the investor directly       
invested in such underlying funds. In those instances, it may be possible       
for an investor to bear greater transaction and operating expenses by           
investing directly in the underlying funds than if the investor were to         
invest indirectly through such underlying funds as a shareholder in the         
Fund (even after aggregating the transaction and operating expenses of the      
Fund and the underlying funds). Finally, you should recognize that, as a        
result of the Fund's policies of investing in other mutual funds, you may       
receive taxable capital gains distributions to a greater extent than would      
be the case if you invested directly in the underlying funds. See               
"Dividends,''``Capital Gains'' and ``Federal Income Tax."
BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS                                                          
When selecting brokers and dealers to handle the purchase and sale of           
portfolio instruments, the Adviser looks for prompt execution of the order      
at a favorable price. In working with dealers, the Adviser will generally       
utilize those who are recognized dealers in specific portfolio instruments,     
except when a better price and execution of the order can be obtained           
elsewhere. In selecting among firms believed to meet this criteria, the         
Adviser may give consideration to those firms which have sold or are            
selling Shares of the Fund and other funds distributed by Federated             
Securities Corp. The Adviser makes decisions on portfolio transactions and      
selects brokers and dealers subject to review by the Directors.                 
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION                                                         
VOTING RIGHTS                                                                   
Each Share of the Fund gives the shareholder one vote in Director elections     
and other matters submitted to shareholders for vote. All Shares of each        
portfolio or class in the Corporation have equal voting rights, except that     
in matters affecting only a particular Fund or class, only Shares of that       
particular Fund or class are entitled to vote.                                  
As a Maryland corporation, the Corporation is not required to hold annual       
shareholder meetings. Shareholder approval will be sought only for certain      
changes in the Fund's operation and for the election of Directors under         
certain circumstances.                                                          
Directors may be removed by the Directors or by shareholders at a special       
meeting. The Directors shall call a special meeting of shareholders upon        
the written request of shareholders owning at least 10% of the                  
Corporation's outstanding shares entitled to vote.                              

When the Fund is asked to vote on matters relating to the underlying funds,     
the Fund is required to either: seek voting instructions from its               
shareholders regarding underlying fund proxies and to vote such proxies in      
accordance with the instructions received; or to vote such proxies in the       
same proportion as the vote of all other holders of the underlying fund         
securities.                                                                     
TAX INFORMATION                                                                 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX                                                              
The Fund will pay no federal income tax because it expects to meet              
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"),             
applicable to regulated investment companies and to receive the special tax     
treatment afforded to such companies. However, the Fund may invest in the       
stock of certain foreign corporations which would constitute a Passive          
Foreign Investment Company ("PFIC"). Federal income taxes may be imposed on     
the Fund upon disposition of PFIC investments.                                  
The Fund will be treated as a single, separate entity for federal income        
tax purposes so that income (including capital gains) and losses realized       
by the Corporation's other portfolios, if any, will not be combined for tax     
purposes with those realized by the Fund.                                       
Investment income received by the Fund from sources within foreign              
countries may be subject to foreign taxes withheld at the source. The           
United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries         
that entitle the Fund to reduced tax rates or exemptions on this income.        
The effective rate of foreign tax cannot be predicted since the amount of       
Fund assets to be invested within various countries is unknown. However,        
the Fund intends to operate so as to qualify for treaty-reduced tax rates       
where applicable.                                                               

Unless otherwise exempt, shareholders are required to pay federal income        
tax on any dividends and other distributions, including capital gains           
distributions, received. This applies whether dividends and distributions       
are received in cash or as additional Shares. Distributions representing        
long-term capital gains, if any, will be taxable to shareholders as long-       
term capital gains no matter how long the shareholders have held the            
Shares. No federal income tax is due on any dividends earned in an IRA or       
qualified retirement plan until distributed.                                    
The Fund may invest in underlying funds with capital loss carry-forwards.       
If such an underlying fund realizes capital gains, it will be able to           
offset the gains to the extent of its loss carry-forwards in determining        
the amount of capital gains which must be distributed to its shareholders.      
To the extent that gains are offset in this manner, the Fund will not           
realize gains on the related fund until such time as the underlying fund is     
sold.                                                                           
STATE AND LOCAL TAXES                                                           
Shares are exempt from personal property taxes imposed by counties,             
municipalities, and school districts in Pennsylvania.                           
Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the          
status of their accounts under state and local tax laws.                        
PERFORMANCE INFORMATION                                                         

From time to time, the Fund advertises the total return for each class of       
Shares.                                                                         
Total return represents the change, over a specified period of time, in the     
value of an investment in each class of Shares after reinvesting all income     
and capital gains distributions. It is calculated by dividing that change       
by the initial investment and is expressed as a percentage.                     

The performance information reflects the effect of non-recurring charges,       
such as the maximum sales charge and contingent deferred sales charges,         
which, if excluded, would increase the total return.                            
Total return will be calculated separately for Class A Shares, Class B          
Shares, and Class C Shares. Expense differences between Class A Shares,         
Class B Shares and Class C Shares may affect the performance of each class.     
From time to time, advertisements for Class A Shares, Class B Shares and        
Class C Shares of the Fund may refer to ratings, rankings, and other            
information in certain financial publications and/or compare the                
performance of Class A Shares, Class B Shares and Class C Shares to certain     
indices.                                                                        

APPENDIX                                                                        
STANDARD AND POOR'S RATINGS GROUP LONG TERM DEBT RATING DEFINITIONS             
AAA--Debt rated AAA has the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's        
Ratings Group. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely        
strong. AA--Debt rated AA has a very strong capacity to pay interest and        
repay principal and differs from the higher rated issues only in small          
degree.                                                                         
A--Debt rated A has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal       
although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes      
in circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higher rated              
categories.                                                                     

BBB--Debt rated BBB is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay           
interest and repay principal. Whereas it normally exhibits adequate             
protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing                  
circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay             
interest and repay principal for debt in this category than in higher rated     
categories.                                                                     
BB--Debt rated BB has less near-term, vulnerability to default than other       
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or            
exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could     
lead to inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments.     
The BB rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt        
that is assigned an actual or implied BBB-rating.                               
B--Debt rated B has a greater vulnerability to default but currently has        
the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments. Adverse        
business, financial,                                                            

C--The rating C typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt        
which is assigned an actual or implied CCC-debt rating. The C rating may be     
used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed, but       
debt service payments are continued.                                            
MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. LONG TERM BOND RATING DEFINITIONS               
AAA--Bonds which are rated AAA are judged to be of the best quality. They       
carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to      
as "gilt edged." Interest payments are protected by a large or by an            
exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While the various          
protective elements are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized     
are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such           
issues.                                                                         
AA--Bonds which are rated AA are judged to be of high quality by all            
standards.                                                                      

BA--Bonds which are BA are judged to have speculative elements; their           
future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection of            
interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well       
safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of      
position characterizes bonds in this class.                                     
B--Bonds which are rated B generally lack characteristics of the desirable      
investment. Assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance      
of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small.       
CAA--Bonds which are rated CAA are of poor standing. Such issues may be in      
default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to              
principal or interest.                                                          
CA--Bonds which are rated CA represent obligations which are speculative in     
a high degree. Such issues are often in default or have other                   

A--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality. The      
obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be       
strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic               
conditions and circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.                    
BBB--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit         
quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is           
considered to be adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and           
circumstances, however, are more likely to have adverse impact on these         
bonds, and therefore impair timely payment. The likelihood that the ratings     
of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than for bonds        
with higher ratings.                                                            
BB--Bonds are considered speculative. The obligor's ability to pay interest     
and repay principal may be affected over time by adverse economic changes.      
However, business and financial alternatives can                                

PRIME-1--Issuers rated PRIME-1 (or related supporting institutions) have a      
superior capacity for repayment of short-term promissory obligations.           
PRIME-1 repayment capacity will normally be evidenced by the following          
characteristics:                                                                
oLeading market positions in well established industries.             
oHigh rates of return on funds employed.                              
oConservative capitalization structure with moderate reliance on debt 
and ample asset protection.                                         
oBroad margins in earning coverage of fixed financial charges and     
high internal cash generation.                                      
oWell established access to a range of financial markets and assured  
sources of alternate liquidity.                                     
PRIME-2--Issuers rated PRIME-1 (or related supporting institutions) have a      
strong capacity for repayment of short-term promissory obligations. This        
will normally be evidenced by many of the characteristics cited above but       
to a lesser degree. Earnings trends and coverage ratios, while sound, will      
be more subject to variation. Capitalization characteristics, while still       
appropriate, may                                                                

FITCH-2--(Very Good Grade) Issues assigned this rating reflect an assurance     
of timely payment only slightly less in degree than the strongest issues.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND                                              

The Fund is a portfolio in World Investment Series, Inc. (the                   
`Corporation''), which was established under the laws of the State of           
Maryland on January 25, 1994.                                                   
Shares of the Fund are offered in three classes, known as Class A Shares,       
Class B Shares, and Class C Shares (individually and collectively referred      
to as `Shares'' as the context may require). This Statement of Additional       
Information relates to all three classes of Shares of the Fund.                 
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES                                               

The investment objective of the Fund is to provide long-term growth of          
capital.  Any income realized from the portfolio is incidental. The Fund        
pursues its investment objective by investing primarily in shares of other      
mutual funds, the portfolios of which consist primarily of equity               
securities of non-U.S. issuers. Additionally, pursuant to exemptive relief      
from the Securities and Exchange Commission (`SEC''), the Fund may also         
invest directly in equity securities of companies domiciled outside the         
United States. The investment objective cannot be changed without approval      
of shareholders.                                                                

TYPES OF INVESTMENTS                                                            
The Fund invests primarily in shares of other open-end management               
investment companies for which affiliates of Federated Investors serve as       
investment adviser and principal underwriter (the `Federated Funds'' and        
herein referred to as the `underlying funds'') that invest primarily in         
foreign equity securities. To the extent that the Fund's assets are             
invested in underlying funds, its investment experience will correspond         
directly with that of its proportionate investment in those funds. The Fund     
may also invest in a diversified portfolio composed of non-U.S. securities      
and directly in the securities held by the underlying funds. Because the        
Fund and the underlying funds will have substantially similar investment        
experiences and incur similar risks, all further references to the Fund         
hereinafter include the underlying funds unless otherwise indicated.            
Although many of the underlying funds have the same or similar investment       
policies as the Fund, they are not required to do so.                           
A substantial portion of these instruments will be equity securities of         
companies domiciled outside the United States.  The Fund will invest in         
equity securities denominated in foreign currencies, including European         
Currency Units, of issuers located in at least three countries outside of       
the United States and sponsored or unsponsored depositary receipts. The         
Fund may also enter into forward commitments, repurchase agreements,            
foreign currency transactions and maintain reserves in foreign or U.S.          
money market instruments.                                                       

WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS                                   
These transactions are made to secure what is considered to be an               
advantageous price or yield for the Fund. No fees or other expenses, other      
than normal transaction costs, are incurred. However, liquid assets of the      
Fund sufficient to make payment for the securities to be purchased are          
segregated on the Fund's records at the trade date. These assets are marked     
to market daily and are maintained until the transaction has been settled.      
The Fund does not intend to engage in when-issued and delayed delivery          
transactions to an extent that would cause the segregation of more than 20%     
of the total value of its assets.                                               
LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES                                                 
The collateral received when the Fund lends portfolio securities must be        
valued daily and, should the market value of the loaned securities              
increase, the borrower must furnish additional collateral to the Fund.          
During the time portfolio securities are on loan, the borrower pays the         
Fund any dividends or interest paid on such securities. Loans are subject       
to termination at the option of the Fund or the borrower. The Fund may pay      
reasonable administrative and custodial fees in connection with a loan and      
may pay a negotiated portion of the interest earned on the cash or              
equivalent collateral to the borrower or placing broker. The Fund does not      
have the right to vote securities on loan, but would terminate the loan and     
regain the right to vote if that were considered important with respect to      
the investment.                                                                 
There is the risk that when lending portfolio securities, the securities        
may not be available to the Fund on a timely basis and the Fund may,            
therefore, lose the opportunity to sell the securities at a desirable           
price. In addition, in the event that a borrower of securities would file       
for bankruptcy or become insolvent, disposition of the securities may be        
delayed pendng court action.                                                    

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS                                                           
The Fund or its custodian will take possession of the securities subject to     
repurchase agreements, and these securities will be marked to market daily.     
To the extent that the original seller does not repurchase the securities       
from the Fund, the Fund could receive less than the repurchase price on any     
sale of such securities.  In the event that such a defaulting seller filed      
for bankruptcy or became insolvent, disposition of such securities by the       
Fund might be delayed pending court action. The Fund believes that under        
the regular procedures normally in effect for custody of the Fund's             
portfolio securities subject to repurchase agreements, a court of competent     
jurisdiction would rule in favor of the Fund and allow retention or             
disposition of such securities. The Fund will only enter into repurchase        
agreements with banks and other recognized financial institutions, such as      
broker/dealers, which are found by Federated Global Research, the Fund's        
investment adviser (the `Adviser'') to be creditworthy pursuant to              
guidelines established by the Corporation's Board of Directors (the             
`Directors'').                                                                  
The Fund or its custodian will take possession of the securities subject to     
repurchase agreements, and these securities will be marked to market daily.     
In the event that such a defaulting seller filed for bankruptcy or became       
insolvent, disposition of such securities by the Fund might be delayed          
pending court action. The Fund believes that under the regular procedures       
normally in effect for custody of the Fund's portfolio securities subject       
to repurchase agreements, a court of competent jurisdiction would rule in       
favor of the Fund and allow retention or disposition of such securities.        
The Fund will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other        
recognized financial institutions, such as broker/dealers, which are deemed     
by Federated Global Research Corp., the Fund's Adviser (the `Adviser'') to      
be creditworthy.                                                                

RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES                                              
The ability of the Directors to determine the liquidity of certain              
restricted securities is permitted under an SEC staff position set forth in     
the adopting release for Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as         
amended (the `Rule'').  The Rule is a non-exclusive safe-harbor for             
certain secondary market transactions involving registration for resales of     
otherwise restricted securities to qualified institutional buyers.  The         
Rule was expected to further enhance the liquidity of the secondary market      
for securities eligible for resale under the Rule.  The Fund believes that      
the staff of the SEC has left the question of determining the liquidity of      
all restricted securities to the Directors.  The Directors may consider the     
following criteria in determining the liquidity of certain restricted           
securities:                                                                     
othe frequency of trades and quotes for the security;                 
othe number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and   
the number of other potential buyers;                               
odealer undertakings to make a market in the security; and            
othe nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, securities of foreign issuers which are not      
listed on a recognized domestic or foreign exchange or for which a bona         
fide market does not exist at the time of purchase or subsequent                
transaction shall be treated as illiquid securities by the Directors.           

FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS                                                
The Fund may engage in futures and options hedging transactions. In an          
effort to reduce fluctuations in the net asset value of Shares, the Fund        
may attempt to hedge all or a portion of its portfolio by buying and            
selling financial futures contracts, buying put options on portfolio            
securities and listed put options on futures contracts, and writing call        
options on futures contracts. The Fund may also write covered call options      
on portfolio securities to attempt to increase its current income. The Fund     
will maintain its positions in securities, option rights, and segregated        
cash subject to puts and calls until the options are exercised, closed, or      
have expired. An option position on financial futures contracts may be          
closed out only on the exchange on which the position was established.          
FUTURES CONTRACTS 
The Fund may engage in transactions in futures contracts. A futures             
contract is a firm commitment by two parties: the seller who agrees to make     
delivery of the specific type of security called for in the contract            
(`going short'') and the buyer who agrees to take delivery of the security      
(`going long'') at a certain time in the future. However, a stock index         
futures contract is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to         
take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between      
the value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract     
and the price at which the index contract was originally written. No            
physical delivery of the underlying securities in the index is made.            

The purpose of the acquisition or sale of a futures contract by the Fund is     
to protect the Fund from fluctuations in the value of its securities caused     
by anticipated changes in interest rates or market conditions without           
necessarily buying or selling the securities. For example, in the fixed         
income securities market, price generally moves inversely to interest           
rates. A rise in rates generally means a drop in price. Conversely, a drop      
in rates generally means a rise in price. In order to hedge its holdings of     
fixed income securities against a rise in market interest rates, the Fund       
could enter into contracts to deliver securities at a predetermined price       
(i.e., `go short'') to protect itself against the possibility that the          
prices of its fixed income securities may decline during the anticipated        
holding period. The Fund would `go long'' (i.e., agree to purchase              
securities in the future at a predetermined price) to hedge against a           
decline in market interest rates.                                               
PUT OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTS 
The Fund may engage in transactions in put options on futures contracts.        
The Fund may purchase listed put options on futures contracts. Unlike           
entering directly into a futures contract, which requires the purchaser to      
buy a financial instrument on a set date at a specified price, the purchase     
of a put option on a futures contract entitles (but does not obligate) its      
purchaser to decide on or before a future date whether to assume a short        
position at the specified price. The Fund would purchase put options on         
futures contracts to protect portfolio securities against decreases in          
value resulting from market factors, such as an anticipated increase in         
interest rates.                                                                 

Generally, if the hedged portfolio securities decrease in value during the      
term of an option, the related futures contracts will also decrease in          
value and the option will increase in value. In such an event, the Fund         
will normally close out its option by selling an identical option. If the       
hedge is successful, the proceeds received by the Fund upon the sale of the     
second option may be large enough to offset both the premium paid by the        
Fund for the original option plus the decrease in value of the hedged           
securities. Alternatively, the Fund may exercise its put option to close        
out the position. To do so, it would simultaneously enter into a futures        
contract of the type underlying the option (for a price less than the           
strike price of the option) and exercise the option. The Fund would then        
deliver the futures contract in return for payment of the strike price. If      
the Fund neither closes out nor exercises an option, the option will expire     
on the date provided in the option contract, and only the premium paid for      
the contract will be lost.                                                      

When the Fund sells a put on a futures contract, it receives a cash premium     
which can be used in whatever way is deemed most advantageous to the Fund.      
In exchange for such premium, the Fund grants to the purchaser of the put       
the right to receive from the Fund, at the strike price, a short position       
in such futures contract, even though the strike price upon exercise of the     
option is greater than the value of the futures position received by such       
holder. If the value of the underlying futures position is not such that        
exercise of the option would be profitable to the option holder, the option     
will generally expire without being exercised. The Fund has no obligation       
to return premiums paid to it whether or not the option is exercised. It        
will generally be the policy of the Fund, in order to avoid the exercise of     
an option sold by it, to cancel its obligation under the option by entering     
into a closing purchase transaction, if available, unless it is determined      
to be in the Fund's interest to deliver the underlying futures position. A      
closing purchase transaction consists of the purchase by the Fund of an         
option having the same term as the option sold by the Fund, and has the         
effect of canceling the Fund's position as a seller. The premium which the      
Fund will pay in executing a closing purchase transaction may be higher         
than the premium received when the option was sold, depending in large part     
upon the relative price of the underlying futures position at the time of       
each transaction.                                                               

CALL OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTS 
The Fund may engage in transactions in call options on futures contracts.       
In addition to purchasing put options on futures, the Fund may write listed     
call options on futures contracts to hedge its portfolio against, for           
example, an increase in market interest rates. When the Fund writes a call      
option on a futures contract, it is undertaking the obligation of assuming      
a short futures position (selling a futures contract) at the fixed strike       
price at any time during the life of the option if the option is exercised.     
As market interest rates rise or as stock prices fall, causing the prices       
of futures to go down, the Fund's obligation under a call option on a           
future (to sell a futures contract) costs less to fulfill, causing the          
value of the Fund's call option position to increase. In other words, as        
the underlying future's price goes down below the strike price, the buyer       
of the option has no reason to exercise the call, so that the Fund keeps        
the premium received for the option. This premium can help substantially to     
offset the drop in value of the Fund's portfolio securities. Prior to the       
expiration of a call written by the Fund, or exercise of it by the buyer,       
the Fund may close out the option by buying an identical option. If the         
hedge is successful, the cost of the second option will be less than the        
premium received by the Fund for the initial option. The net premium income     
of the Fund will then help offset the decrease in value of the hedged           
securities.                                                                     
When the Fund purchases a call on a financial futures contract, it receives     
in exchange for the payment of a cash premium the right, but not the            
obligation, to enter into the underlying futures contract at a strike price     
determined at the time the call was purchased, regardless of the                
comparative market value of such futures position at the time the option is     
exercised. The holder of a call option has the right to receive a long (or      
buyer's) position in the underlying futures contract.                           

The Fund will not maintain open positions in futures contracts it has sold      
or call options it has written on futures contracts if, in the aggregate,       
the value of the open positions (marked to market) exceeds the current          
market value of its securities portfolio (including cash or cash                
equivalents) plus or minus the unrealized gain or loss on those open            
positions, adjusted for the correlation of volatility between the hedged        
securities and the futures contracts. If this limitation is exceeded at any     
time, the Fund will take prompt action to close out a sufficient number of      
open contracts to bring its open futures and options positions within this      
limitation.                                                                     
`MARGIN'' IN FUTURES TRANSACTIONS                                               
Unlike the purchase or sale of a security, the Fund does not pay or receive     
money upon the purchase or sale of a futures contract. Rather, the Fund is      
required to deposit an amount of `initial margin'' in cash or U.S.              
Treasury bills with the custodian (or the broker, if legally permitted).        
The nature of initial margin in futures transactions is different from that     
of margin in securities transactions in that futures contracts initial          
margin does not involve a borrowing by the Fund to finance the                  
transactions. Initial margin is in the nature of a performance bond or good     
faith deposit on the contract which is returned to the Fund upon                
termination of the futures contract, assuming all contractual obligations       
have been satisfied.                                                            

A futures contract held by the Fund is valued daily at the official             
settlement price of the exchange on which it is traded. Each day the Fund       
pays or receives cash, called `variation margin,'' equal to the daily           
change in value of the futures contract. This process is known as `marking      
to market.''Variation margin does not represent a borrowing or loan by the      
Fund but is instead settlement between the Fund and the broker of the           
amount one would owe the other if the futures contract expired. In              
computing its daily net asset value, the Fund will mark to market its open      
futures positions. The Fund is also required to deposit and maintain margin     
when it writes call options on futures contracts.                               
REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS                                                         
To the extent required to comply with Commodity Futures Trading Commission      
Regulation 4.5 and thereby avoid status as a `commodity pool operator,''        
the Fund will not enter into a futures contract, or purchase an option          
thereon, if immediately thereafter the initial margin deposits for futures      
contracts held by it, plus premiums paid by it for open options on futures,     
would exceed 5% of the total assets of the Fund. The Fund will not engage       
in transactions in futures contracts or options thereon for speculation,        
but only to attempt to hedge against changes in market conditions affecting     
the value of assets which the Fund holds or intends to purchase. When           
futures contracts or options thereon are purchased in order to protect          
against a price increase on securities or other assets intended to be           
purchased later, it is anticipated that at least 75% of such intended           
purchases will be completed. When other futures contracts or options            
thereon are purchased, the underlying value of such contracts at all times      
will not exceed the sum of (1) accrued profit on such contracts held by the     
broker; (2) cash or high-quality money market instruments set aside in an       
identifiable manner; and (3) cash proceeds from investments due in 30 days      
or less.                                                                        

PURCHASING PUT OPTIONS ON PORTFOLIO SECURITIES                                  
The Fund may purchase put options on portfolio securities to protect            
against price movements in particular securities in its portfolio. A put        
option gives the Fund, in return for a premium, the right to sell the           
underlying security to the writer (seller) at a specified price during the      
term of the option.                                                             
WRITING COVERED CALL OPTIONS ON PORTFOLIO SECURITIES                            
The Fund may write covered call options to generate income. As a writer of      
a call option, the Fund has the obligation upon exercise of the option          
during the option period to deliver the underlying security upon payment of     
the exercise price. The Fund may only sell call options either on               
securities held in its portfolio or on securities which it has the right to     
obtain without payment of further consideration (or has segregated cash in      
the amount of any additional consideration).                                    
OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTIONS                                                        
The Fund may purchase and write over-the-counter options (`OTC options'')       
on portfolio securities in negotiated transactions with the buyers or           
writers of the options for those options on portfolio securities held by        
the Fund and not traded on an exchange.                                         
OTC options are two-party contracts with price and terms negotiated between     
buyer and seller. In contrast, exchange-traded options are third-party          
contracts with standardized strike prices and expiration dates and are          
purchased from a clearing corporation. Exchange-traded options have a           
continuous liquid market while over-the-counter options may not.                

RISKS                                                                           
OPTIONS                                                                         

Certain hedging vehicles have risks associated with them including      
possible default by the other party to the transaction, illiquidity       
and, to the extent the adviser's view as to certain market movements is   
incorrect, the risk that the use of such hedging strategies could         
result in losses greater than if they had not been used.  Use of put      
and call options may result in losses to the Fund, force the sale or      
purchase of portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices       
higher than (in the case of put options) or lower than (in the case of    
call options) current market values, limit the amount of appreciation     
the Fund can realize on its investments or cause the Fund to hold a       
security it might otherwise sell.  The use of currency transactions can   
result in the Fund incurring losses as a result of a number of factors    
including the imposition of exchange controls, suspension of              
settlements, or the inability to deliver or receive a specified           
currency.  The use of options and futures transactions entails certain    
other risks. In particular, the variable degree of correlation between    
price movements of futures contracts and price movements in the related   
portfolio position of the Fund creates the possibility that losses on     
the hedging instrument may be greater than gains in the value of the      
Fund's position.  In addition, futures and options markets may both be    
liquid in all circumstances and certain over-the-counter options may      
have not markets.  As a result, in certain markets, the Fund might not    
be able to close out a transaction without incurring substantial          
losses, if at all. Although the use of futures and options transactions   
for hedging should tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline     
in the value of the hedged position, at the same time they tend to        
limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in value     
of such position.  Finally, the daily variation margin requirements for   
futures contracts would create a greater ongoing potential financial      

risk than would purchase of options, where the exposure is limited to     
the cost of the initial premium.  Losses resulting from the use of        
hedging strategies would reduce net asset value, and possibly income,     
and such losses can be greater than if the hedging strategies had not     
been utilized.                                                            
COMBINED TRANSACTIONS                                                           
The Fund may enter into multiple transactions, including multiple         
options transactions, multiple futures transactions, multiple currency    
transaction (including forward currency contracts) and multiple           
interest rate transactions and any combination of futures, options,       
currency and interest rate transactions (``component" transactions),      
instead of a single hedging strategy, as part of a single or combined     
strategy when, in the opinion of the Adviser, it is in the best           
interests of the Fund to do so. A combined transaction will usually       
contain elements of risk that are present in each of its component        
transactions. Although combined transactions are normally entered into    
based on the Adviser's judgment that the combined strategies will         
reduce risk or otherwise more effectively achieve the desired portfolio   
management goal, it is possible that the combination will instead         
increase such risks or hinder achievement of the portfolio management     
objective.                                                                

SWAPS, CAPS, FLOORS AND COLLARS                                                 
Among the hedging strategies into which the Fund may enter are interest   
rate, currency and index swaps and the purchase or sale of related        
caps, floors, and collars.  The Fund expects to enter into these          
transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular     
investment or portion of its portfolio, to protect against currency       
fluctuations, as a duration management technique or to protect against    
any increase in the price of securities the Fund anticipates purchasing   
at a later date. The Fund intends to use these transactions as hedges     
and not as speculative investments and will not sell interest rate caps   
or floors where it does not own securities or other instruments           
providing the income stream the Fund may be obligated to pay.  Interest   
rate swaps involve the  exchange by the Fund with another party of        
their respective commitments to pay or receive interest, e.g., an         
exchange of floating rating payments of fixed rate payments with          
respect to a notional amount of principal.  A currency swap is an         
agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more      
currencies based on the relative value differential among them and an     
index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount        
based on changes in the values of the reference indices. The purchase     
of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional         
principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a     
specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount.  The     
purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a       
notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the        
extent that  specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate    
or amount.  A collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that           
preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest       
rates or values.                                                          

The Fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis, i.e., the two      
payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date   
or dates specified in the instrument, with the Fund receiving or          
paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments.      
Inasmuch as these swaps, caps, floors, and collars are entered into for   
good faith hedging purposes, the Adviser and the Fund believe such        
obligations do not constitute senior securities under the Investment      
Company Act of 1940, as amended, and, accordingly, will not treat them    
as being subject to its borrowing restrictions.  There is no minimal      
acceptable rating for a swap, cap, floor, or collar to be purchased or    
held in the Fund's portfolio.  If there is a default by the               
counterparty, the Fund may have contractual remedies pursuant to the      
agreements related to the transaction.  The swap market has grown         
substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and            
investment banking firms acting both as principals and agents utilizing   
standardized swap documentation.  As a result, the swap market has        
become relatively liquid.  Caps, floors and collars are more recent       
innovations for which standardized documentation has not yet been fully   
developed and, accordingly, they are less liquid than swaps.              

RISKS OF HEDGING STRATEGIES OUTSIDE THE U.S.                                    
When conducted outside the U.S., hedging strategies may not be            
regulated as rigorously  as in the U.S., may not involve a clearing       
mechanism and related guarantees, and are subject to the risk of          
governmental actions affecting trading in, or the prices of, foreign      
securities, currencies and other instruments.  The value of such          
positions also could be adversely affected by:  (i) other complex         
foreign political, legal and economic factors, (ii) lesser availability   
than in the U.S. of data on which to make trading decisions, (iii)        
delays in the Fund's ability to act upon economic events occurring in     
foreign markets during non-business hours in the U.S., (iv) the           
imposition of different exercise and settlement terms and procedures      
and the margin requirements than in the U.S., and (v) lower trading       
volume and liquidity.                                                     

USE OF SEGREGATED AND OTHER SPECIAL ACCOUNTS                                    
Many hedging strategies, in addition to other requirements, require       
that the Fund segregate liquid high grade assets with its custodian to    
the extent Fund obligations are not otherwise "covered" through           
ownership of the underlying security, financial instrument or currency.   
In general, either the full amount of any obligation by the Fund to pay   
or deliver securities or assets must be covered at all times by the       
securities, instruments or currency required to be delivered, or,         
subject to any regulatory restrictions, an amount of cash or liquid       
high grade securities at least equal to the current amount of the         
obligation must be segregated with the custodian.  The segregated         
assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent assets are         
substituted in their place or it is no longer necessary to segregate      
them.  For example, a call option written by the Fund will require the    
Fund to hold the securities subject to the call (or securities            
convertible into the needed securities without additional                 
consideration) or to segregate liquid high grade securities sufficient    
to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised.  A       
call option sold by the Fund on an index will require the Fund to own     
portfolio securities which correlate with the index or to segregate       
liquid high grade assets equal to the excess of the index value over      
the exercise price on a current basis.  A put option written by the       
Fund requires the Fund to segregate liquid high grade assets equal to     
the exercise price.                                                       

Except when the Fund enters into a forward contract for the purchase or   
sale of a security denominated in a particular currency, a currency       
contract which obligates the Fund to buy or sell currency will            
generally require the Fund to hold an amount of that currency or liquid   
securities denominated in that currency equal to the Fund's obligations   
or to segregate liquid high grade assets equal to the amount of the       
Fund's obligations.                                                       
OTC options entered into by the Fund, including those on securities,      
currency, financial instruments or indices and OTC issued and exchange    
listed index options, will generally provide for cash settlement.  As a   
result, when the Fund sells these instruments it will only segregate an   
amount of assets equal to its accrued net obligations, as there is no     
requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net       
amount.  These amounts will equal 100% of the exercise price in the       
case of a non cash-settled put, the same as an OTC guaranteed listed      
option sold by the Fund, or the in-the-money amount plus any sell-back    
formula amount in the case of a cash-settled put or call.  In addition,   
when the Fund sells a call option on an index at a time when the in-      
the-money amount exceeds the exercise price, the Fund will segregate,     
until the option expires or is closed out, cash or cash equivalents       
equal in value to such excess.  OTC issued and exchange listed options    
sold by the Fund other than those above generally settle with physical    
delivery, and the Fund will segregate an equal amount of assets equal     
to the full value of the option. OTC options settling with physical       
delivery, or with an election of either physical delivery or cash         
settlement will be treated the same as other options settling with        
physical delivery.                                                        

In the case of a futures contract or an option thereon, the Fund must     
deposit initial margin and possible daily variation margin in addition    
to segregating assets sufficient to meet its obligation to purchase or    
provide securities or currencies, or to pay the amount owed at the        
expiration of an index-based futures contract.  Such assets may consist   
of cash, cash equivalents, liquid debt or equity securities or other      
acceptable assets.                                                        
With respect to swaps, the Fund will accrue the net amount of the         
excess, if any, of its obligations over its entitlements with respect     
to each swap on a daily basis and will segregate an amount of cash or     
liquid high grade securities having a value equal to the accrued          
excess.  Caps, floors and collars require segregation of assets with a    
value equal to the Fund's net obligation, if any.                         
Strategic transactions may be covered by other means when consistent      
with applicable regulatory policies.  The Fund may also enter into        
offsetting transactions so that its combined position, coupled with any   
segregated assets, equals its net outstanding obligation in related       
options and hedging strategies.  For example, the Fund could purchase a   
put option if the strike price of that option is the same or higher       
than the strike price of a put option sold by the Fund.  Moreover,        
instead of segregating assets if the Fund held a futures or forward       
contract, it could purchase a put option on the same futures or forward   
contract with a strike price as high or higher than the price of the      
contract held.  Other hedging strategies may also be offset in            
combinations.  If the offsetting transaction terminates at the time of    
or after the primary transaction no segregation is required, but if it    
terminates prior to such time, assets equal to any remaining obligation   
would need to be segregated.                                              

The Fund's activities involving hedging strategies may be limited by      
the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,    
as amended (the "Code") for qualification as a regulated investment       
company.  (See "Tax Status")                                              
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS                                                   
CURRENCY RISKS                                                                  
The exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies are a   
function of such factors as supply and demand in the currency exchange    
markets, international balances of payments, governmental intervention,   
speculation and other economic and political conditions. Although the     
Fund values its assets daily in U.S. dollars, the Fund may not convert    
its holdings of foreign currencies to U.S. dollars daily. The Fund may    
incur conversion costs when it converts its holdings to another           
currency. Foreign exchange dealers may realize a profit on the            
difference between the price at which the Fund buys and sells             
currencies.                                                               
The Fund will engage in foreign currency exchange transactions in         
connection with its portfolio investments. The Fund will conduct its      
foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot (i.e., cash)      
basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange        
market or through forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign           
currencies.                                                               

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS 
The Fund may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts in    
order to protect against a possible loss resulting from an adverse        
change in the relationship between the U.S. dollar and a foreign          
currency involved in an underlying transaction. However, forward          
foreign currency exchange contracts may limit potential gains which       
could result from a positive change in such currency relationships. The   
Adviser believes that it is important to have the flexibility to enter    
into forward foreign currency exchange contracts whenever it determines   
that it is in the Fund's best interest to do so. The Fund will not        
speculate in foreign currency exchange.                                   
The Fund will not enter into forward foreign currency exchange            
contracts or maintain a net exposure in such contracts when it would be   
obligated to deliver an amount of foreign currency in excess of the       
value of its portfolio securities or other assets denominated in that     
currency or, in the case of a "cross-hedge" denominated in a currency     
or currencies that the Adviser believes will tend to be closely           
correlated with that currency with regard to price movements.             
Generally, the Fund will not enter into a forward foreign currency        
exchange contract with a term longer than one year.                       
FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS                                                        
A foreign currency option provides the option buyer with the right to     
buy or sell a stated amount of foreign currency at the exercise price     
on a specified date or during the option period. The owner of a call      
option has the right, but not the obligation, to buy the currency.        
Conversely, the owner of a put option has the right, but not the          
obligation, to sell the currency.                                         

When the option is exercised, the seller (i.e., writer) of the option     
is obligated to fulfill the terms of the sold option. However, either     
the seller or the buyer may, in the secondary market, close its           
position during the option period at any time prior to expiration.        
A call option on foreign currency generally rises in value if the         
underlying currency appreciates in value, and a put option on foreign     
currency generally rises in value if the underlying currency              
depreciates in value. Although purchasing a foreign currency option can   
protect the Fund against an adverse movement in the value of a foreign    
currency, the option will not limit the movement in the value of such     
currency. For example, if the Fund was holding securities denominated     
in a foreign currency that was appreciating and had purchased a foreign   
currency put to hedge against a decline in the value of the currency,     
the Fund would not have to exercise its put option. Likewise, if the      
Fund were to enter into a contract to purchase a security denominated     
in foreign currency and, in conjunction with that purchase, were to       
purchase a foreign currency call option to hedge against a rise in        
value of the currency, and if the value of the currency instead           
depreciated between the date of purchase and the settlement date, the     
Fund would not have to exercise its call. Instead, the Fund could         
acquire in the spot market the amount of foreign currency needed for      
settlement.                                                               

SPECIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS                          
Buyers and sellers of foreign currency options are subject to the same    
risks that apply to options generally. In addition, there are certain     
risks associated with foreign currency options. The markets in foreign    
currency options are relatively new, and the Fund's ability to            
establish and close out positions on such options is subject to the       
maintenance of a liquid secondary market. Although the Fund will not      
purchase or write such options unless and until, in the opinion of the    
Adviser, the market for them has developed sufficiently to ensure that    
the risks in connection with such options are not greater than the        
risks in connection with the underlying currency, there can be no         
assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for a particular      
option at any specific time.                                              
In addition, options on foreign currencies are affected by all of those   
factors that influence foreign exchange rates and investments             
generally.                                                                
The value of a foreign currency option depends upon the value of the      
underlying currency relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, the price   
of the option position may vary with changes in the value of either or    
both currencies and may have no relationship to the investment merits     
of a foreign security. Because foreign currency transactions occurring    
in the interbank market involve substantially larger amounts than those   
that may be involved in the use of foreign currency options, investors    
may be disadvantaged by having to deal in an odd lot market (generally    
consisting of transactions of less than $1 million) for the underlying    
foreign currencies at prices that are less favorable than for round       
lots.                                                                     

There is no systematic reporting of last sale information for foreign     
currencies or any regulatory requirement that quotations available        
through dealers or other market sources be firm or revised on a timely    
basis. Available quotation information is generally representative of     
very large transactions in the interbank market and thus may not          
reflect relatively smaller transactions (i.e., less than $1 million)      
where rates may be less favorable. The interbank market in foreign        
currencies is a global, around-the-clock market. To the extent that the   
U.S. option markets are closed while the markets for the underlying       
currencies remain open, significant price and rate movements may take     
place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the options   
markets until they reopen.                                                
FOREIGN CURRENCY FUTURES TRANSACTIONS                                           
By using foreign currency futures contracts and options on such           
contracts, the Fund may be able to achieve many of the same objectives    
as it would through the use of forward foreign currency exchange          
contracts. The Fund may be able to achieve these objectives possibly      
more effectively and at a lower cost by using futures transactions        
instead of forward foreign currency exchange contracts.                   
SPECIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY FUTURES CONTRACTS AND            
RELATED OPTIONS                                                                 
Buyers and sellers of foreign currency futures contracts are subject to   
the same risks that apply to the use of futures generally. In addition,   
there are risks associated with foreign currency futures contracts and    
their use as a hedging device similar to those associated with options    
on currencies, as described above.                                        

Options on foreign currency futures contracts may involve certain         
additional risks. Trading options on foreign currency futures contracts   
is relatively new. The ability to establish and close out positions on    
such options is subject to the maintenance of a liquid secondary          
market. To reduce this risk, the Fund will not purchase or write          
options on foreign currency futures contracts unless and until, in the    
opinion of the Adviser, the market for such options has developed         
sufficiently that the risks in connection with such options are not       
greater than the risks in connection with transactions in the             
underlying foreign currency futures contracts. Compared to the purchase   
or sale of foreign currency futures contracts, the purchase of call or    
put options on futures contracts involves less potential risk to the      
Fund because the maximum amount at risk is the premium paid for the       
option (plus transaction costs). However, there may be circumstances      
when the purchase of a call or put option on a futures contract would     
result in a loss, such as when there is no movement in the price of the   
underlying currency or futures contract.                                  

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING EMERGING MARKETS                               
Investing in equity securities of companies in emerging markets may entail      
greater risks than investing in equity securities in developed countries.       
These risks include (i) less social, political and economic stability; (ii)     
the small current size of the markets for such securities and the currently     
low or nonexistent volume of trading, which result in a lack of liquidity       
and in greater price volatility; (iii) certain national policies which may      
restrict the Fund's investment opportunities, including restrictions on         
investment in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to national interests;     
(iv) foreign taxation; and (v) the absence of developed structures              
governing private or foreign investment or allowing for judicial redress        
for injury to private property. Investing in the securities of companies in     
emerging markets, may entail special risks relating to the potential            
political and economic instability and the risks of expropriation,              
nationalization, confiscation or the imposition of restrictions on foreign      
investment, convertibility of currencies into  U.S. dollars and on              
repatriation of capital invested. In the event of such expropriation,           
nationalization or other confiscation by any country, the Fund could lose       
its entire investment in any such country.                                      
Settlement mechanisms in emerging markets may be less efficient and             
reliable than in more developed markets. In such emerging securities            
markets there may be share registration and delivery delays or failures.        
Most Latin American countries have experienced substantial, and in some         
periods extremely high, rates of inflation for many years. Inflation and        
rapid fluctuations in inflation rates and corresponding currency                
devaluations have had any may continue to have negative effects on the          
economies and securities markets of certain Latin American countries.           

POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS.  Even though opportunities for            
investment may exist in emerging markets, any change in the leadership or       
policies of the governments of those countries or in the leadership or          
policies of any other government which exercises a significant influence        
over those countries, may halt the expansion of or reverse the                  
liberalization of foreign investment policies now occurring and thereby         
eliminate any investment opportunities which may currently exist.               
Investors should note that upon the accession to power of authoritarian         
regimes, the governments of a number of Latin American countries previously     
expropriated large quantities of real and personal property similar to the      
property which will be represented by the securities purchased by the Fund.     
The claims of property owners against those governments were never finally      
settled. There can be no assurance that any property represented by             
securities purchased by the Fund will not also be expropriated,                 
nationalized, or otherwise confiscated. If such confiscation were to occur,     
the Fund could lose its entire investment in such countries. The Fund's         
investments would similarly be adversely affected by exchange control           
regulation in any of those countries.                                           

Certain countries in which the Fund may invest may have groups that             
advocate radical religious or revolutionary philosophies or support ethnic      
independence. Any disturbance on the part of such individuals could carry       
the potential for widespread destruction or confiscation of property owned      
by individuals and entities foreign to such country and could cause the         
loss of the Fund's investment in those countries. Instability may also          
result from, among other things: (i) authoritarian governments or military      
involvement in political and economic decision-making, including changes in     
government through extraconsititutional means; (ii) popular unrest              
associated with demands for improved political, economic and social             
conditions; and (iii) hostile relations with neighboring or other               
countries. Such political, social and economic instability could disrupt        
the principal financial markets in which the Fund invests and adversely         
affect the value of the Fund's assets.                                          
ADDITIONAL RISK CONSIDERATIONS                                                  
The Directors consider at least annually the likelihood of the imposition       
by any foreign government of exchange control restrictions which would          
affect the liquidity of the Fund's assets maintained with custodians in         
foreign countries, as well as the degree of risk from political acts of         
foreign governments to which such assets may be exposed. The Directors also     
consider the degree of risk involved through the holding of portfolio           
securities in domestic and foreign securities depositories. However, in the     
absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part       
of the Adviser, any losses resulting from the holding of the Fund's             
portfolio securities in foreign countries and/or with securities                
depositories will be at the risk of shareholders. No assurance can be given     
that the Directors' appraisal of the risks will always be correct or that       
such exchange control restrictions or political acts of foreign governments     
might not occur.                                                                

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER                                                              
The Fund will not attempt to set or meet a portfolio turnover rate since        
any turnover would be incidental to transactions undertaken in an attempt       
to achieve the Fund's investment objective. Portfolio securities will be        
sold when the Adviser believes it is appropriate, regardless of how long        
those securities have been held.  However, the underlying funds may             
experience much higher portfolio turnover rates resulting in higher             
brokerage commissions, and taxable gains or losses.  It is estimated the        
rate of portfolio turnover will, generally, not exceed 40%.                     
For the period from February 28, 1996 (date of initial public investment)       
to November 30, 1996 (fiscal year end), the Federated Asia Pacific Growth       
Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 99%.                                         
For the period from February 28, 1996 (date of initial public investment)       
to November 30, 1996 (fiscal year end), the Federated Emerging Markets          
Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 32%.                                         
For the period from February 28, 1996 (date of initial public investment)       
to November 30, 1996 (fiscal year end), the Federated European Growth           
Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 58%.                                         
For the period from February 28, 1996 (date of initial public investment)       
to November 30, 1996 (fiscal year end), the Federated International Small       
Company Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 174%.                                
For the period from February 28, 1996 (date of initial public investment)       
to November 30, 1996 (fiscal year end), the Federated Latin American Growth     
Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 38%.                                         

INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS                                                          
The following investment limitations are fundamental (except that no            
investment limitation of the Fund shall prevent the Fund from investing         
substantially all of its assets (except for assets which are not considered     
`investment securities'' under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as           
amended, or assets exempted by the SEC) in an open-end investment company       
with substantially the same investment objectives):                             
SELLING SHORT AND BUYING ON MARGIN                                              
The Fund will not sell any securities short or purchase any securities    
on margin, but may obtain such short-term credits as are necessary for    
the clearance of purchases and sales of portfolio securities. The         
deposit or payment by the Fund of initial or variation margin in          
connection with financial futures contracts or related options            
transactions is not considered the purchase of a security on margin.      
ISSUING SENIOR SECURITIES AND BORROWING MONEY                                   
The Fund will not issue senior securities, except that the Fund may       
borrow money directly or through reverse repurchase agreements in         
amounts up to one-third of the value of its total assets, including the   
amount borrowed, and except to the extent that the Fund may enter into    
futures contracts.  The Fund will not borrow money or engage in reverse   
repurchase agreements for investment leverage, but rather as a            
temporary, extraordinary, or emergency measure or to facilitate           
management of the portfolio by enabling the Fund to meet redemption       
requests when the liquidation of portfolio securities is deemed to be     
inconvenient or disadvantageous.  The Fund will not purchase any          
securities while any borrowings in excess of 5% of its total assets are   
outstanding.                                                              

PLEDGING ASSETS                                                                 
The Fund will not mortgage, pledge, or hypothecate any assets except to   
secure permitted borrowings.  In these cases, the Fund may pledge         
assets as necessary to secure such borrowings.  For purposes of this      
limitation, the following will not be deemed to be pledges of the         
Fund's assets:  (a) the deposit of assets in escrow in connection with    
the writing of covered put or call options and the purchase of            
securities on a when-issued basis; and (b) collateral arrangements with   
respect to:  (i) the purchase and sale of securities options (and         
options on securities indexes) and (ii) initial or variation margin for   
futures contracts.                                                        
CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS                                                    
The Fund will not invest 25% or more of the value of its total assets     
in any one industry, except that the Fund may invest 25% or more of the   
value of its total assets in securities issued or guaranteed by the       
U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, and repurchase        
agreements collateralized by such securities.                             
INVESTING IN COMMODITIES                                                        
The Fund will not invest in commodities, except that the Fund reserves    
the right to engage in transactions involving futures contracts,          
options, and forward contracts with respect to securities, securities     
indexes or currencies.                                                    
INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE                                                        
The Fund will not purchase or sell real estate, including limited         
partnership interests, although it may invest in the securities of        
companies whose business involves the purchase or sale of real estate     
or in securities which are secured by real estate or interests in real    
estate.                                                                   

LENDING CASH OR SECURITIES                                                      
The Fund will not lend any of its assets, except portfolio securities.    
This shall not prevent the Fund from purchasing or holding U.S.           
government obligations, corporate bonds, money market instruments,        
debentures, notes, certificates of indebtedness, or other debt            
securities, entering into repurchase agreements, or engaging in other     
transactions where permitted by the Fund's investment objective,          
policies, and limitations or the Corporation's Articles of                
Incorporation.                                                            
UNDERWRITING                                                                    
The Fund will not underwrite any issue of securities, except as it may    
be deemed to be an underwriter under the Securities Act of 1933 in        
connection with the sale of securities in accordance with its             
investment objective, policies, and limitations.                          
DIVERSIFICATION OF INVESTMENTS                                                  
With respect to securities comprising 75% of the value of its total       
assets, the Fund will not purchase securities issued by any one issuer    
(other than cash, cash items, securities of investment companies, or      
securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or   
instrumentalities, and repurchase agreements collateralized by such       
securities) if, as a result, more than 5% of the value of its total       
assets would be invested in the securities of that issuer, and will not   
acquire more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one     
issuer.                                                                   

The above investment limitations cannot be changed without shareholder          
approval. The following limitations, however, may be changed by the             
Directors without shareholder approval (except that no investment               
limitation of the Fund shall prevent the Fund from investing substantially      
all of its assets (except for assets which are not considered `investment       
securities''under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or            
assets exempted by the SEC) in an open-end investment company with              
substantially the same investment objectives). Shareholders will be             
notified before any material changes in these limitations become effective.     
INVESTING IN ILLIQUID SECURITIES                                                
The Fund will not invest more than 15% of the value of its net assets     
in illiquid securities, including repurchase agreements providing for     
settlement in more than seven days after notice, non-negotiable time      
deposits with maturities over seven days, over-the-counter options,       
swap agreements not determined to be liquid, and certain restricted       
securities not determined by the Directors to be liquid.                  
PURCHASING SECURITIES TO EXERCISE CONTROL                                       
The Fund will not purchase securities of a company for the purpose of     
exercising control or management.                                         
INVESTING IN PUT OPTIONS                                                        
The Fund will not purchase put options on securities or futures           
contracts, unless the securities or futures contracts are held in the     
Fund's portfolio or unless the Fund is entitled to them in deliverable    
form without further payment or after segregating cash in the amount of   
any further payment.                                                      

WRITING COVERED CALL OPTIONS                                                    
The Fund will not write call options on securities unless the             
securities or futures contracts are held in the Fund's portfolio or       
unless the Fund is entitled to them in deliverable form without further   
payment or after segregating cash in the amount of any further payment.   
Except with respect to borrowing money, if a percentage limitation is           
adhered to at the time of investment, a later increase or decrease in           
percentage resulting from any change in value or net assets will not result     
in a violation of such restriction.                                             
The Fund has no present intent to borrow money, pledge securities, or           
invest in reverse repurchase agreements in excess of 5% of the value of its     
total assets in the coming fiscal year.  In addition, the Fund expects to       
lend not more than 5% of its total assets in the coming fiscal year.            
For purposes of its policies and limitations, the Fund considers                
certificates of deposit and demand and time deposits issued by a U.S.           
branch of a domestic bank or savings associations having capital, surplus,      
and undivided profits in excess of $100,000,000 at the time of investment       
to be `cash items.''

INVESTMENT ADVISORY SERVICES                                                    
ADVISER TO THE FUND                                                             
The Fund's Adviser is Federated Global Research Corp. It is a subsidiary of     
Federated Investors. All the voting securities of Federated Investors are       
owned by a trust, the trustees of which are John F. Donahue, his wife, and      
his son, J. Christopher Donahue.                                                
The Adviser shall not be liable to the Fund, the Corporation, or any            
shareholder of the Fund for any losses that may be sustained in the             
purchase, holding, or sale of any security or for anything done or omitted      
by it, except acts or omissions involving willful misfeasance, bad faith,       
gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties imposed upon it by        
its contract with the Corporation.                                              
ADVISORY FEES                                                                   
For its advisory services, the Adviser receives an annual investment            
advisory fee as described in the prospectus.                                    

BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS                                                          

The Adviser may select brokers and dealers who offer brokerage and research     
services. These services may be furnished directly to the Fund or to the        
Adviser and may include: advice as to the advisability of investing in          
securities; security analysis and reports; economic studies; industry           
studies; receipt of quotations for portfolio evaluations; and similar           
services. Research services provided by brokers and dealers may be used by      
the Adviser or its affiliates in advising the Fund and other accounts. To       
the extent that receipt of these services may supplant services for which       
the Adviser or its affiliates might otherwise have paid, it would tend to       
reduce their expenses. The Adviser and its affiliates exercise reasonable       
business judgment in selecting brokers who offer brokerage and research         
services to execute securities transactions. They determine in good faith       
that commissions charged by such persons are reasonable in relationship to      
the value of the brokerage and research services provided.                      
Although investment decisions for the Fund are made independently from          
those of any other accounts managed by the Adviser, investments of the type     
the Fund may make may also be made by those other accounts. When the Fund       
and one or more other accounts managed by the Adviser are prepared to           
invest in, or desire to dispose of, the same security, available                
investments or opportunities for sales will be allocated in a manner            
believed by the Adviser to be equitable to each. In some cases, this            
procedure may adversely affect the price paid or received by the Fund or        
the size of the position obtained or disposed of by the Fund. In other          
cases, however, it is believed that coordination and the ability to             
participate in volume transactions will be to the benefit of the Fund.          

The Adviser may engage in other non-U.S. transactions that may have adverse     
effects on the market for securities in the Fund's portfolio. The Adviser       
is not obligated to obtain any material non-public (`inside'') information      
about any securities issuer, or to base purchase or sale recommendations on     
such information.                                                               
The distributor may assist in the execution of the Fund's portfolio             
transactions to purchase underlying fund shares for which it may receive        
distribution payments from the underlying funds or their underwriters in        
accordance with the distribution plans of those funds. In providing             
execution assistance, the distributor receives orders from the Adviser;         
places them with the underlying fund's distributor, transfer agent or other     
person, as appropriate; confirms the trade, price and number of shares          
purchased; and assures prompt payment by the Fund and proper completion of      
the order.                                                                      
With respect to purchases of load fund shares, the Adviser may direct           
substantially all of the Fund's orders to the distributor, which may, in        
its discretion, direct the order to other broker-dealers in consideration       
of sales of the Fund's shares.                                                  
The distributor may retain brokerage commissions on portfolio transactions      
of mutual funds held in the Fund's portfolio, including funds which have a      
policy of considering sales of their shares in selecting broker-dealers for     
the execution of their portfolio transactions. Payment of brokerage             
commissions to the distributor is not a factor considered by the Adviser in     
selecting an underlying fund for investment.                                    

Under certain circumstances, a sales charge incurred by the Fund in             
acquiring shares of an underlying fund may not be taken into account in         
determining the gain or loss on the disposition of the shares acquired. If      
shares are disposed of within 90 days from the date they were purchased and     
if shares of a new underlying fund are subsequently acquired without            
imposition of a sales charge or imposition of a reduced sales charge            
pursuant to a right granted to the Fund to acquire shares without payment       
of a sales charge or with the payment of a reduced charge, then the sales       
charge paid upon the purchase of the initial shares will be treated as paid     
in connection with the acquisition of the new underlying fund's shares          
rather than the initial shares.                                                 
OTHER SERVICES                                                                  
FUND ADMINISTRATION                                                             
Federated Services Company, a subsidiary of Federated Investors, provides       
administrative personnel and services to the Fund for a fee as described in     
the prospectus.                                                                 
CUSTODIAN AND PORTFOLIO ACCOUNTANT                                              
State Street Bank and Trust Company, Boston, MA, is custodian for the           
securities and cash of the Fund.  Federated Services Company, Pittsburgh,       
PA, provides certain accounting and recordkeeping services with respect to      
the Fund's portfolio investments.  The fee paid for this service is based       
upon the level of the Fund's average net assets for the period, plus out-       
of-pocket expenses.                                                             
TRANSFER AGENT                                                                  
Federated Services Company, through its registered transfer agent,              
Federated Shareholder Services Company maintains all necessary shareholder      
records. For its services, the transfer agent receives a fee based on size,     
type, and number of accounts and transactions made by shareholders.             

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS                                                            
The independent auditors for the Fund are Ernst & Young LLP, Pittsburgh,        
PA.                                                                             
PURCHASING SHARES                                                               

Except under certain circumstances described in the prospectus, Shares are      
sold at their net asset value, plus a sales charge (for Class A Shares          
only) on days the New York Stock Exchange (`NYSE'') is open for business.       
The procedure for purchasing Shares is explained in the prospectus under        
`How to Purchase Shares.''                                                      
DISTRIBUTION PLAN AND SHAREHOLDER SERVICES AGREEMENT                            
These arrangements permit the payment of fees to financial institutions,        
the distributor, and Federated Shareholder Services as appropriate, to          
stimulate distribution activities and to cause services to be provided to       
shareholders by a representative who has knowledge of the shareholder's         
particular circumstances and goals. These activities and services may           
include, but are not limited to, marketing efforts; providing office space,     
equipment, telephone facilities, and various clerical, supervisory,             
computer, and other personnel as necessary or beneficial to establish and       
maintain shareholder accounts and records; processing purchase and              
redemption transactions and automatic investments of client account cash        
balances; answering routine client inquiries; and assisting clients in          
changing dividend options, account designations, and addresses.                 

By adopting the Distribution Plan, the Directors expect that the Class A        
Shares, Class B Shares, and Class C Shares of the Fund will be able to          
achieve a more predictable flow of cash for investment purposes and to meet     
redemptions. This will facilitate more efficient portfolio management and       
assist the Fund in pursuing its investment objectives. By identifying           
potential investors whose needs are served by the Fund's objectives, and        
properly servicing these accounts, it may be possible to curb sharp             
fluctuations in rates of redemptions and sales.                                 
Other benefits, which may be realized under either arrangement, may             
include: (1) providing personal services to shareholders; (2) investing         
shareholder assets with a minimum of delay and administrative detail; (3)       
enhancing shareholder recordkeeping systems; and (4) responding promptly to     
shareholders' requests and inquiries concerning their accounts.                 
CONVERSION TO FEDERAL FUNDS                                                     
It is the Fund's policy to be as fully invested as possible so that maximum     
interest may be earned. To this end, all payments from shareholders must be     
in federal funds or be converted into federal funds before shareholders         
begin to earn dividends. Federated Shareholder Services Company acts as the     
shareholder's agent in depositing checks and converting them to federal         
funds.                                                                          
PURCHASES BY SALES REPRESENTATIVES, DIRECTORS OF THE CORPORATION, AND           
EMPLOYEES                                                                       
Directors, employees, and sales representatives of the Fund, the Adviser,       
and Federated Securities Corp., or their affiliates and their immediate         
family members, or any investment dealer who has a sales agreement with         
Federated Securities Corp., and their spouses and children under 21, may        
buy Class A Shares at net asset value without a sales charge. Shares may        
also be sold without sales charges to trusts or pension or profit-sharing       
plans for these persons.                                                        

These sales are made with the purchaser's written assurance that the            
purchase is for investment purposes and that the securities will not be         
resold except through redemption by the Fund.                                   
DETERMINING NET ASSET VALUE                                                     

Net asset value generally changes each day. The days on which net asset         
value is calculated by the Fund are described in the prospectus.                
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except certain             
dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have           
passed.  Such dividends are recorded as soon as the Fund is informed of the     
ex-dividend date.                                                               
DETERMINING MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES                                          
Market or fair values of the Fund's portfolio securities are determined as      
follows:                                                                        
oaccording to the last reported sale price on a recognized securities 
exchange, if available. (If a security is traded on more than one   
exchange, the price on the primary market for that security, as     
determined by the Adviser, is used);                                
oin the absence of recorded sales for equity securities, according to 
the mean between the last closing bid and asked prices;             
oat fair value as determined in good faith by the Directors; or       
ofor short-term obligations with remaining maturities of 60 days or   
less at the time of purchase, at amortized cost, which approximates 
value.                                                              
Prices provided by independent pricing services may be determined without       
relying exclusively on quoted prices and may consider: institutional            
trading in similar groups of securities; yield; quality; coupon rate;           
maturity; type of issue; trading characteristics; and other market data.        

The underlying funds in which the Fund may invest value securities in their     
portfolios for which market quotations are readily available at their           
current market value (generally the last reported sale price) and all other     
securities and assets at fair value pursuant to methods established in good     
faith by the board of directors/trustees of the underlying fund.                
TRADING IN FOREIGN SECURITIES                                                   
Trading in foreign securities may be completed at times which vary from the     
closing of the NYSE. In computing the net asset value, the Fund values          
foreign securities at the latest closing price on the exchange on which         
they are traded immediately prior to the closing of the NYSE. Certain           
foreign currency exchange rates may also be determined at the latest rate       
prior to the closing of the NYSE. Foreign securities quoted in foreign          
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at current rates. Occasionally,     
events that affect these values and exchange rates may occur between the        
times at which they are determined and the closing of the NYSE. If such         
events materially affect the value of portfolio securities, these               
securities may be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by     
the Directors, although the actual calculation may be done by others.           
REDEEMING SHARES                                                                

The Fund redeems Shares at the next computed net asset value after the Fund     
receives the redemption request. Shareholder redemptions may be subject to      
a contingent deferred sales charge. Redemption procedures are explained in      
the prospectus under `How to Redeem Shares.'' Although the Fund does not        
charge for telephone redemptions, it reserves the right to charge a fee for     
the cost of wire-transferred redemptions of less than $5,000.                   

Class B Shares redeemed within six years of purchase and Class C Shares         
redeemed within one year of purchase may be subject to a contingent             
deferred sales charge. The amount of the contingent deferred sales charge       
is based upon the amount of the administrative fee paid at the time of          
purchase by the distributor to the financial institutions for services          
rendered, and the length of time the investor remains a shareholder in the      
Fund. Should financial institutions elect to receive an amount less than        
the administrative fee that is stated in the prospectus for servicing a         
particular shareholder, the contingent deferred sales charge and/or holding     
period for that particular shareholder will be reduced accordingly.             
Since portfolio securities of the Fund may be traded on foreign exchanges       
which trade on Saturdays or on holidays on which the Fund will not make         
redemptions, the net asset value of each class of Shares of the Fund may be     
significantly affected on days when shareholders do not have an opportunity     
to redeem their Shares.                                                         

REDEMPTION IN KIND                                                              
Although the Corporation intends to redeem Shares in cash, it reserves the      
right under certain circumstances to pay the redemption price, in whole or      
in part, by a distribution of securities from the Fund's portfolio. The         
Corporation has elected to be governed by Rule 18f-1 of the Investment          
Company Act of 1940, under which the Corporation is obligated to redeem         
Shares for any one shareholder in cash only up to the lesser of $250,000 or     
1% of a class of Shares' net asset value during any 90-day period. Any          
redemption beyond this amount will also be in cash unless the Directors         
determine that further cash payments will have a materially adverse effect      
on remaining shareholders. In such a case, the Fund will pay all or a           
portion of the remainder of the redemption in portfolio instruments, valued     
in the same way as the Fund determines net asset value. The portfolio           
instruments will be selected in a manner that the Directors deem fair and       
equitable.                                                                      
Redemption in kind will be made in conformity with applicable SEC rules,        
taking such securities at the same value employed in determining net asset      
value and selecting the securities in a manner the Directors determine to       
be fair and equitable.                                                          
Redemption in kind is not as liquid as a cash redemption. If redemption is      
made is kind, shareholders receiving their securities and selling them          
before their maturity could receive less than the redemption value of their     
securities and could incur certain transaction costs.                           
ELIMINATION OF THE CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE                             
The amounts that a shareholder may withdraw under a Systematic Withdrawal       
Program that qualify for elimination of the contingent deferred sales           
charge may not exceed 12% annually with reference initially to the value of     
the Class B Shares upon establishment of the Systematic Withdrawal Program      
and then as calculated at the fiscal year end.  Redemptions on a qualifying     

Systematic Withdrawal Program can be made at a rate of 1.00% monthly, 3.00%     
quarterly, or 6.00% semi-annually with reference to the applicable account      
valuation amount.  Amounts that exceed the 12.00% annual limit for              
redemption, as described, may be subject to the contingent deferred sales       
charge. To the extent that a shareholder exchanges Shares for Class B           
Shares of other Federated Funds, the time for which the exchanged-for           
Shares are to be held will be added to the time for which exchanged-from        
Shares were held for purposes of satisfying the 12 month holding                
requirement.  However, for purposes of meeting the $10,000 minimum account      
value requirement, Class B Share accounts values will not be aggregated.        
TAX STATUS                                                                      
THE FUND'S TAX STATUS                                                           
The Fund will pay no federal income tax because it expects to meet the          
requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended,          
applicable to regulated investment companies and to receive the special tax     
treatment afforded to such companies. To qualify for this treatment, the        
Fund must, among other requirements:                                            
oderive at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest,    
and gains from the sale of securities;                              
oderive less than 30% of its gross income from the sale of securities 
held less than three months;                                        
oinvest in securities within certain statutory limits; and            
odistribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its net income earned 
during the year.                                                    
Income the Fund receives from sources within various foreign countries may      
be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. If the Fund has      
at least 50% of its assets invested directly in foreign securities at the       
end of its taxable year, it may elect to pass through the foreign tax           

credit to its shareholders. It is expected that the Fund will not have more     
than 50% of the value of its total assets at the close of its taxable year      
invested directly in foreign securities, and therefore will not be              
permitted to make this election and `pass through'' to its shareholders.        
Each shareholder's respective pro rata share of foreign taxes the Fund pays     
will, therefore, be netted against their share of the Fund's gross income.      
The Fund may  invest in any non-U.S. corporations which could be treated as     
passive foreign investment companies ("PFICs"). This could result in            
adverse tax consequences upon the disposition of, or the receipt of "excess     
distributions" with respect to, such equity investments. To the extent the      
Fund does invest in PFICs, it may adopt certain tax strategies to reduce or     
eliminate the adverse effects of certain federal tax provisions governing       
PFIC investments. Many non-U.S. banks and insurance companies may not be        
treated as PFICs if they satisfy certain technical requirements under the       
Code. To the extent that the Fund does invest in foreign securities which       
are determined to be PFIC securities and is required to pay a tax on such       
investments, a credit for this tax would not be allowed to be passed            
through to its shareholders. Therefore, the payment of this tax would           
reduce the Fund's economic return from its PFIC shares, and excess              
distributions received with respect to such shares are treated as ordinary      
income rather than capital gains.                                               
An underlying fund may  invest in non-U.S. corporations which would be          
treated as a PFIC or become a PFIC under the Code. This could result in         
adverse tax consequences upon the disposition of, or the receipt of "excess     
distributions" with respect to, such equity investments. To the extent an       
underlying fund does invest in PFICs, it may elect to treat the PFIC as a       
"qualified electing fund" or mark-to-market its investments in PFICs            
annually. In either case, the underlying fund may be required to distribute     
amounts in excess of its realized income and gains. To the extent that the      

underlying fund itself is required to pay a tax on income or gain from          
investment in PFICs, the payment of this tax would reduce the Fund's            
economic return.                                                                
Investment income on certain foreign securities in which the Fund may           
invest may be subject to foreign withholding or other taxes that could          
reduce the return on these securities. Tax treaties between the United          
States and foreign countries, however, may reduce or eliminate the amount       
of foreign taxes to which the Fund would be subject.                            
SHAREHOLDERS' TAX STATUS                                                        
Shareholders are subject to federal income tax on dividends and capital         
gains received as cash or additional Shares. The Fund's dividends, and any      
short-term capital gains, are taxable as ordinary income.                       
CAPITAL GAINS                                                                   
Shareholders will pay federal tax at capital gains rates on long-term     
capital gains distributed to them regardless of how long they have held   
the Fund Shares.                                                          

TOTAL RETURN                                                                    

The average annual total return for each class of Shares of the Fund is the     
average compounded rate of return for a given period that would equate a        
$1,000 initial investment to the ending redeemable value of that                
investment. The ending redeemable value is computed by multiplying the          
number of Shares owned at the end of the period by the offering price per       
Share at the end of the period. The number of Shares owned at the end of        
the period is based on the number of Shares purchased at the beginning of       
the period with $1,000, less any applicable sales charge on Class A Shares,     
adjusted over the period by any additional Shares, assuming the annual          
reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. Any applicable contingent      
deferred sales charge is deducted from the ending value of the investment       
based on the lesser of the original purchase price or the offering price of     
Shares redeemed. Occasionally, total return which does not reflect the          
effect of the sales charge may be quoted in advertising.                        
YIELD                                                                           

The yield for each class of Shares is determined by dividing the net            
investment income per share (as defined by the SEC) earned by the class         
over a thirty-day period by the maximum offering price per Share of the         
Fund on the last day of the period. This value is then annualized using         
semi-annual compounding. This means that the amount of income generated         
during the thirty-day period is assumed to be generated each month over a       
twelve-month period and is reinvested every six months. The yield does not      
necessarily reflect income actually earned by the class of Share because of     
certain adjustments required by the SEC and, therefore, may not correlate       
to the dividends or other distributions paid to shareholders.                   
To the extent that financial institutions and broker/dealers charge fees in     
connection with services provided in conjunction with an investment in the      

Fund, the performance will be reduced for those shareholders paying those       
fees.                                                                           
PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS                                                         

The Fund's performance of each class of Shares depends upon such variables      
as:                                                                             
oportfolio quality;                                                   
oaverage portfolio maturity;                                          
otype of instruments in which the portfolio is invested;              
ochanges in interest rates on money market instruments;               
ochanges in the Fund's or a class of Shares' expenses; and            
ovarious other factors.                                               
The Fund's performance fluctuates on a daily basis largely because net          
earnings and offering price per Share fluctuate daily. Both net earnings        
and offering price per Share are factors in the computation of total            
return.                                                                         
Investors may use financial publications and/or indices to obtain a more        
complete view of the Fund's performance. When comparing performance,            
investors should consider all relevant factors such as the composition of       
any indices used, prevailing market conditions, portfolio compositions of       
other funds, and methods used to value portfolio securities and compute         
offering price. The financial publications and/or indices which the Fund        
uses in advertising may include:                                                
oLIPPER ANALYTICAL SERVICES, INC., for example, makes comparative     
calculations for one-month, three-month, one-year, and five-year    
periods which assume the reinvestment of all capital gains          
distributions and income dividends.

effect of the sales charge or contingent deferred sales charge, as              
applicable.                                                                     
Advertising and other promotional literature may include charts, graphs and     
other illustrations using the Fund's returns, or returns in general, that       
demonstrate basic investment concepts such as tax-deferred compounding,         
dollar-cost averaging and systematic investment. In addition, the Fund can      
compare its performance, or performance for the types of securities in          
which it invests, to a variety of other investments, such as bank savings       
accounts, certificates of deposit, and Treasury bills.

economic, financial and political developments and their effect on the          
securities market. Such discussions may take the form of commentary on          
these developments by Fund portfolio managers and their views and analysis

PROSPECTUS/PROXY STATEMENT
August 25, 2004

Acquisition of the assets of

 FEDERATED GLOBAL VALUE FUND
a portfolio of Federated World Investment Series, Inc.

 Federated Investors Funds
5800 Corporate Drive
 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15237-7000
Telephone No: 1-800-245-5000

By and in exchange for Shares of

FEDERATED INTERNATIONAL VALUE FUND
a portfolio of Federated World Investment Series, Inc.

 Federated Investors Funds
5800 Corporate Drive
 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15237-7000
Telephone No: 1-800-245-5000

     This Prospectus/Proxy Statement describes the proposal for Federated Global
Value Fund (the "Global  Value Fund") to transfer all of its assets to Federated
International  Value Fund (the  "International  Value  Fund"),  in exchange  for
shares of the  International  Value Fund (the  "Reorganization").  International
Value Fund Shares will then be distributed  pro rata by the Global Value Fund to
its  shareholders  in complete  liquidation  and dissolution of the Global Value
Fund. As a result of the Reorganization, each owner of Class A, B or C Shares of
the  Global  Value  Fund will  become the owner of Class A, B or C Shares of the
International Value Fund, respectively,  having a total net asset value equal to
the total net asset value of his or her holdings in the Global Value Fund on the
date of the Reorganization (the "Closing Date").                                

     The investment  objective of the  International  Value Fund is to seek long
term growth of capital.  The investment objective of the Global Value Fund is to
provide total return.  Both the Global Value Fund and  International  Value Fund
pursue their investment  objectives by investing  primarily in equity securities
that Federated Global  Investment  Management Corp. (the "Adviser"),  the Funds'
investment  adviser,  deems to be undervalued.  The primary  difference in their
investment  strategies  is that the Global Value Fund  anticipates  investing in
domestic companies to a greater extent than the International Value Fund.

 SUMMARY

     This summary is  qualified  in its entirety by reference to the  additional
information  contained  elsewhere  in  this  Prospectus/Proxy   Statement,   the
Prospectus  and  Statement of Additional  Information  of the Global Value Fund,
both dated  January  31,  2004,  the  Prospectus  and  Statement  of  Additional
Information of the  International  Value Fund,  both dated January 31, 2004, the
Statement of  Additional  Information  dated  August 25, 2004  (relating to this
Prospectus/Proxy  Statement) and the Agreement and Plan of  Reorganization  (the
Plan).  A copy of the Plan is attached  to this  Prospectus/Proxy  Statement  as
Exhibit A. The  prospectus  of the  International  Value Fund  accompanies  this
Prospectus/Proxy Statement.                                                     

Reasons For The Proposed Reorganization                                         

     The Board of Directors of the  Corporation  ("Board") has determined that a
combination  of the Global Value Fund with the  International  Value Fund is the
best course of action for the Global Value Fund's  shareholders  because,  after
nine years of  operation,  the Global Value Fund has not grown to a viable size.
The Global  Value Fund's net assets  reached a calendar  year end high of $139.8
million in 2000. However, as of May 31, 2004, the Global Value Fund's net assets
had steadily  declined to reach $44.2  million.  At the Fund's present size, the
fixed  expenses of operating  the Fund relative to the Fund's net assets are too
high for shares of the Fund to be saleable  without the Adviser's  waiver of its
investment  advisory fee and/or  reimbursement of Fund operating  expenses.  The
Fund's distributor,  Federated Securities Corp., (the "Distributor") has advised
the Board that it does not believe it can  significantly  increase sales of Fund
shares in the  future.  The Adviser of the Fund has advised the Board that it is
unwilling  to  continue  to waive its fee and  reimburse  the  Fund's  operating
expenses.                                                                       

     The following table shows the total return  performance of the Global Value
Fund,  based on net asset value,  for the past five  calendar  years against its
performance benchmarks, net sales of Fund shares for each calendar year, and the
Fund's net assets at each  calendar  year end.1  Prior to August 14,  2002,  the
Average  Annual  Returns  of the  Global  Value  Fund  should  not be  viewed as
indicative of the future  performance  because the results reflect  performance,
when the Fund was operated as the World  Utility Fund and invested  primarily in
securities issued by domestic and foreign companies in the utilities sector.    

                                                                [Download Table]

1.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  Investment  return and
     principal will fluctuate,  so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may
be worth more or less than their original cost.                       

2.   During the Fund's last fiscal year, the Adviser changed its benchmark index
     to the MSCI World Value Index from the MSCI World Free Index  because it is
more reflective of the Fund's current investment strategy.            

3.   Prior to August 14,  2002,  the Fund's  benchmark  index was the MSCI World
     Telecom  Services  Index  and  reflected  the  Fund's  previous  investment
strategy.                                                             

     As  the  table  above  illustrates,   despite  the  generally  satisfactory
performance of the Global Value Fund relative to its performance benchmarks, net
sales of the Fund's shares and Fund assets have not grown, but rather declined. 

     The  Distributor  believes  that the  Reorganization  will result in a more
viable Fund for Global Value Fund shareholders.  As the "Comparative Fee Tables"
below show, it is  anticipated  that the  Reorganization  will result in the net
expenses of the International  Value Fund decreasing due to increased  economies
of scale.  This is primarily  the result of spreading  expenses  across a larger
pool of assets  allowing  shareholders to benefit from economies of scale in the
form of lower fees and expenses.  The Distributor believes that this decrease in
the  International  Value Fund's  expenses will  increase the  salability of the
Fund.                                                                           

     The Board has voted to recommend the approval of the Plan pursuant to which
International  Value Fund, a portfolio of the Corporation,  would acquire all of
the assets of the  Global  Value  Fund,  also a  portfolio  of  Corporation,  in
exchange  for  Class  A,  B  and C  Shares  of  International  Value  Fund  (the
"Exchange").   Immediately  following  the  Exchange,  Global  Value  Fund  will
distribute the Class A, B and C Shares of International Value Fund to holders of
Class A, B and C Shares of Global Value Fund, respectively (the "Distribution").
The  Exchange  and  the  Distribution  are  collectively  referred  to  in  this
Prospectus/Proxy   Statement  as  the  "Reorganization."  As  a  result  of  the
Reorganization, each holder of Class A, B and C Shares of Global Value Fund will
become the owner of Class A, B and C Shares of International Value Fund having a
total net asset value equal to the total net asset value of his or her  holdings
of  Class  A, B and C  Shares  in  Global  Value  Fund on the  Closing  Date (as
hereinafter defined).                                                           

     In   considering   the  proposed   Reorganization,   the  Board  took  into
consideration  a number of  factors,  including:  (1) the  compatibility  of the
International Value Fund's and the Global Value Fund's policies and limitations;
(2) the greater long-term  viability of the International  Value Fund that could
result in economics  of scale  through the  spreading of operating  costs over a
larger  asset  base;   (3)  the   Reorganization   provides  for  continuity  of
distribution and shareholder servicing arrangements;  and (4) the Reorganization
will not result in the  recognition  of any gain or loss for federal  income tax
purposes either to the  International  Value Fund or the Global Value Fund or to
shareholders of the Global Value Fund.                                          

     The Board concluded to recommend that the  shareholders of the Global Value
Fund vote to  approve  the  Reorganization.  Pursuant  to Rule  17a-8  under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, ("1940 Act"), the Board, including a majority of
the Directors who are not interested  persons,  determined that participation in
the   transaction  was  in  the  best  interests  of  the  Global  Value  Fund's
shareholders  and that the interests of existing Global Value Fund  shareholders
would not be diluted as a result of effecting the transaction.                  

     The  Board  likewise   approved  the   Reorganization   on  behalf  of  the
International  Value Fund. Pursuant to Rule 17a-8 under the 1940 Act, the Board,
including a majority of the Directors who are not interested persons, determined
that  participation  in  the  transaction  was  in  the  best  interests  of the
International  Value  Fund's  shareholders  and that the  interests  of existing
International  Value  Fund  shareholders  would  not be  diluted  as a result of
effecting the transaction.                                                      

     As a condition to the Reorganization,  each Fund will receive an opinion of
counsel that the Reorganization  will be considered a tax-free  "reorganization"
under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, so
that no gain or loss will be  recognized  by  either  Fund or the  Global  Value
Fund's shareholders. The tax basis of the shares of the International Value Fund
received by Global Value Fund  shareholders will be the same as the tax basis of
their shares in the Global Value Fund.                                          

Purchase, Redemption and Exchange Procedures; Dividends and Distributions       

     Procedures  for the purchase,  redemption  and exchange of Class A, B and C
Shares of the International Value Fund are identical to procedures applicable to
the purchase and redemption of Class A, B and C Shares of the Global Value Fund.
The dividend and  distribution  policies of the Funds are also identical.  For a
complete description,  refer to the accompanying Prospectus of the International
Value Fund.  Any  questions may be directed to the  International  Value Fund at
1-800-341-7400.                                                                 

Comparison of Investment Objectives and Policies                                

Investment  objective.  The investment  objective of the Global Value Fund is to
provide total return.  Total return  generally  consists of two components:  (1)
changes in the market  value of its  portfolio  securities  (both  realized  and
unrealized appreciation); and (2) income received from its portfolio securities.
The investment objective of the International Value Fund is to provide long-term
growth of capital.                                                              

Investment  exposure  provided  by each  Fund.  The Global  Value  Fund  invests
primarily  in a portfolio  of domestic and foreign  equity  securities  that the
Fund's Adviser believes will appreciate in value,  provide income,  or both. The
International  Value Fund  invests  primarily in a portfolio  of  securities  of
foreign equity securities that the Fund's Adviser has deemed  undervalued.  Both
Funds are permitted to invest in the developed  and emerging  market  countries.
However, in each Fund, the Adviser expects that, normally, foreign stocks in the
Fund's portfolio will primarily be in developed markets. Both Funds may purchase
shares of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The shares of ETFs are listed and traded
on stock exchanges at market prices.                                            

As of May 29, 2004, the  International  Value Fund and Global Value Fund held 24
securities in common, representing 46.5% of International Value Fund's portfolio
and 47.6% of Global Value Fund's portfolio. Therefore, after the Reorganization,
Global  Value Fund  shareholders  will  continue  to gain  exposure  to a global
portfolio of securities that the Adviser has deemed to be undervalued  though it
is anticipated  that they will have greater exposure to foreign markets than the
Global  Value  Fund.  As of May 31,  2004,  the  International  Value  Fund  has
approximately  19.10%  (which  includes  a 6.90%  cash  position)  of its assets
invested in domestic  companies  while the Global  Value Fund had  approximately
55.35% (which includes a 2.53% cash position).                                  

Role of active  management.  Both the Global  Value  Fund and the  International
Value Fund are actively  managed.  This means that the Adviser's goal is for its
stock selection  skill to drive each Fund's  performance.  The Adviser  actively
manages the Global Value Fund seeking  total returns over longer time periods in
excess of a benchmark  index,  the MSCI World  Value  Index.  The  Adviser  also
actively manages the International Value Fund seeking total returns in excess of
the  MSCI-EAFE  Value Index.  Currently,  the  International  Value Fund and the
Global Value Fund share a common portfolio manager, Marc Halperin.              

Adviser's stock  selection  process.  The Adviser's stock selection  process for
both Funds is value oriented.  The Adviser's  process for selecting  investments
begins  with the  screening  of the  universe  of  available  stocks to identify
companies  with  those  "value"  characteristics,  which  the  Adviser  believes
correlate to  long-term  return.  These  characteristics  include,  for example,
relatively low price/book value or  price/earnings  ratios,  and relatively high
dividend  yields.  Screening is performed by market so that value is relative to
each individual  market.  After screening,  the Adviser  emphasizes  fundamental
analysis of companies by skilled portfolio managers (bottom-up stock selection),
instead of  attempting  to  predict  the impact of  economic  and market  cycles
(top-down), because it believes this approach provides a greater opportunity for
the  Adviser's  expertise,  experience  and  skill  to  create  excess  returns.
Fundamental  analysis  involves  researching a company's  financial  statements,
management,  and  industry  leadership  in an  attempt to  appraise a  company's
prospects.  The Adviser also considers the economic  environment and outlook for
making stock  selection  decisions,  but those factors play a secondary  role to
bottom-up analysis.                                                             

The Adviser seeks to purchase  undervalued  stocks that the Adviser  expects may
significantly  increase in price as the market  recognizes  the  company's  true
value. The Adviser's key buy criteria for a value stock includes  relatively low
market price, quality of company management,  industry leadership,  and presence
of a catalyst for higher market valuation.  Realization of income is a secondary
consideration  in the  Adviser's  stock  selection  for the Global Value Fund. A
company's  stock may be  undervalued  due to factors such as temporary  earnings
declines,  investor indifference,  a change in management, or unfavorable market
or industry  conditions.  The Adviser selects the stock based on its belief that
over time the price at which the stock trades will rise to reflect the company's
true  value.  The Adviser is free to seek  relative  value  opportunities  among
markets and sectors.                                                            

Risk management. In both the Global Value Fund and the International Value Fund,
the Adviser manages the portfolio's  exposure to random or unpredictable  events
that may adversely affect individual companies,  or the risk that the Adviser is
otherwise  wrong in its analysis of any particular  company,  through  portfolio
diversification.  There is no assurance  these  strategies will be successful in
reducing portfolio risk.                                                        

Investment  constraints.  Neither  the Global  Value Fund nor the  International
Value Fund is limited  in the  portion of its assets  that it invests in foreign
companies based in either  developed  markets or in emerging  markets.  Further,
neither Fund is limited in the portion of its  investments  that are denominated
in either foreign currency or in U.S. dollars.  The Global Value Fund contains a
fundamental  investment  policy that permits it to  concentrate in the utilities
industry and the  International  Value Fund  contains a  fundamental  investment
policy  that  permits it to  concentrate  in the  financial  services  industry.
However, both Funds have no present intention of concentrating their investments
in an industry.  Both Funds may hedge a portion of their  currency risk by using
derivatives  such as futures or forward  contracts.  Currency hedges can protect
against price movements in a security that a Fund owns that are  attributable to
changes  in the value of the  currency  in which the  security  is  denominated.
Hedging  may reduce  gains or cause  losses to the Fund if the  hedged  currency
moves in a different  manner than the Adviser  anticipated or if the cost of the
hedge outweighs its value. The majority of both Funds'  portfolios have not been
hedged and have  therefore  been subject to currency risk, and it is anticipated
that this will remain the case for the International Value Fund.                

Comparison of Risks                                                             

The risks associated with the International Value Fund and the Global Value Fund
are  similar.  Both  Funds  are  subject  to the risk of  general  stock  market
volatility,   investing  in  foreign   securities,   foreign   currency   risks,
exchange-traded  funds risk,  liquidity risks and risks related to investing for
value. However, the International Value Fund is more susceptible to the risks of
investing in foreign  securities  and currency  risks  because its  portfolio is
normally  comprised of a higher percentage of foreign securities than the Global
Value Fund.  At May 28, 2004,  the  International  Value Fund had  approximately
78.19% of its assets invested in foreign securities compared to the Global Value
Fund,  which  had  approximately  40.50%  of  its  assets  invested  in  foreign
securities.

1    The redemption fee is imposed upon the redemptions of shares within 30 days                          
     of purchase.                                                                                         

2    The  percentages  shown are based on  expenses  for the entire  fiscal year                          
     ended  November 30, 2003.  However,  the rate at which expenses are accrued                          
     during the fiscal year may not be constant  and, at any  particular  point,                          
     may be greater or less than the stated average percentage.  With respect to

     although not contractually  obligated to do so, the Adviser,  administrator                          
     and distributor  waived certain  amounts.  These are shown below along with                          
     the net expenses the Funds actually paid for the fiscal year ended November
30, 2003.

3    For the Global Value Fund, the Adviser  voluntarily waived a portion of the
     management  fee. The Adviser can  terminate  this  voluntary  waiver at any
     time. The management fee paid by the Global Value Fund (after the voluntary
waiver) was 0.44% for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2003.        

4    The Class A Shares of the International  Value Fund and International Value
     Fund Pro Forma Combined did not pay or accrue the distribution  (12b-1) fee
     for the  fiscal  year  ended  November  30,  2003.  Class A  Shares  of the
     International  Value  Fund  and the  International  Value  Fund  Pro  Forma
     Combined has no present  intention  of paying or accruing the  distribution
(12b-1) fee for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2004.             

5    For the Class A Shares of the  International  Value Fund, Global Value Fund
     and  International  Value  Fund  Pro  Forma  Combined,   the  administrator
     voluntarily  waived a portion of its fee. The  administrator  can terminate
     this voluntary waiver at any time. Total other expenses paid by the Class A
     Shares of the International Value Fund, Global Value Fund and International
     Value Fund Pro Forma  Combined  (after the  voluntary  waivers) were 1.27%,
1.38% and 0.72%,  respectively, for the fiscal year ended             
November 30, 2003.                                                    

EXAMPLE                                                                         

This  Example is  intended  to help you  compare  the cost of  investing  in the
International  Value Fund Class A Shares,  Global  Value Fund Class A Shares and
International  Value  Fund Class A Shares  Pro Forma  Combined  with the cost of
investing in other mutual funds.                                                

The Example  assumes that you invest $10,000 in each  respective  Fund's Class A
Shares for the time periods  indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the
end of those  periods.  The Example also assumes that your  investment  has a 5%
return  each year and that each Fund's  Class A Shares  operating  expenses  are
before  waivers as shown in the table and remain the same.  Although your actual
costs and returns may be higher or lower,  based on these assumptions your costs
would be:

     time. The management fee paid by the Global Value Fund (after the voluntary                          
     waiver) was 0.44% for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2003.

     and  International  Value  Fund  Pro  Forma  Combined,   the  administrator                          
     voluntarily  waived a portion of its fee. The  administrator  can terminate                          
     this voluntary waiver at any time. Total other expenses paid by the Class B                          
     Shares of the International Value Fund, Global Value Fund and International

5    After the Class B Shares  have been held for eight  years  from the date of                          
     purchase, they will automatically convert to Class A Shares on or about the                          
     last  day of the  following  month.  Class A  Shares  pay  lower  operating                          
     expenses than Class B Shares.

The Example  assumes that you invest $10,000 in each  respective  Fund's Class B
Shares for the time periods  indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the
end of those  periods.  The Example also assumes that your  investment  has a 5%
return  each year and that each Fund's  Class B Shares  operating  expenses  are
before  waivers as shown in the table and remain the same.  Although your actual
costs and returns may be higher or lower,  based on these assumptions your costs
would be:

investing in other mutual funds.                                                

The Example  assumes that you invest $10,000 in each  respective  Fund's Class C
Shares for the time periods  indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the
end of those  periods.  The Example also assumes that your  investment  has a 5%
return  each year and that each Fund's  Class C Shares  operating  expenses  are
before  waivers as shown in the table and remain the same.  Although your actual
costs and returns may be higher or lower,  based on these assumptions your costs
would be:

     The performance  information  shown below will help you analyze each Fund's
investment  risks in light of its  historical  returns.  The bar charts show the
variability of each Fund's Class A Shares total returns on a calendar year basis
for the years  indicated.  The Average  Annual Total Return table shows  returns
averaged  over  the  stated  periods,  and  includes   comparative   performance
information.  Each  Fund's  performance  will  fluctuate,  and past  performance
(before and after taxes) is no guarantee of future results.

[The graphic  presentation  displayed here consists of a bar chart  representing
the  annual  total  returns  of Class A Shares  of Global  Value  Fund as of the
calendar  year-end  for each of ten years.  The `y' axis  reflects  the "% Total
Return"  beginning  with  "-40.00%" and increasing in increments of 20.00% up to
40.00%. The `x' axis represents  calculation  periods from the earliest calendar
year end of the  Fund's  start of  business  through  the  calendar  year  ended
December 31, 2003.  The light gray shaded chart  features ten distinct  vertical
bars,  each shaded in charcoal,  and each  visually  representing  by height the
total return  percentages for the calendar year stated directly at its base. The
calculated total return percentage for the Class A Shares for each calendar year
is stated  directly at the bottom of each respective bar, for the calendar years
1995 through 2003. The percentages noted are: 23.46%,  17.64%,  21.11%,  23.69%,
39.25%, (12.24)%, (22.37)%, (21.39)% and (37.01)%, respectively.                

Federated International Value Fund Bar Chart - Class A Shares                   

[The graphic  presentation  displayed here consists of a bar chart  representing
the annual  total  returns of Class A Shares of  Federated  International  Value
Fund, as of the calendar  year-end for each of five years. The `y' axis reflects
the "% Total Return"  beginning  with  "-20.00%" and increasing in increments of
10.00%  up to  40.00%.  The `x' axis  represents  calculation  periods  from the
earliest  calendar year end of the Fund's start of business through the calendar
year ended December 31, 2003. The light gray shaded chart features five distinct
vertical bars, each shaded in charcoal, and each visually representing by height
the total return  percentages for the calendar year stated directly at its base.
The calculated total return  percentage for the Class A Shares for each calendar
year is stated  directly at the bottom of each  respective bar, for the calendar
years 1999 through 2003. The percentages  noted are:  11.03%,  22.48%,  (2.99)%,
(19.68)%, and 34.54% respectively.                                              

The total  returns  shown in the bar charts do not  reflect  the  payment of any
sales  charges or recurring  shareholder  account fees. If these charges or fees
had been included, the returns shown would have been lower.                     

Global Value Fund's  Class A Shares total return for the  six-month  period from
January 1, 2004 to June 30, 2004 was 4.14%.                                     

International  Value Fund's Class A Shares total return for the six-month period
from January 1, 2004 to June 30, 2004 was 2.85%.                                

Listed below are the highest and lowest quarterly  returns for the International
Value Fund and the  Global  Value  Fund for the  periods  shown in the bar chart
above.  The Highest and Lowest  Quarterly  Returns of the Funds for  performance
prior to August 14, 2002 and September 4, 2003, was not  necessarily  consistent
with its  subsequent  investment  performance  because the  results  reflect the
performance  when the Global Value Fund was  operated as the World  Utility Fund
and the International  Value Fund was operated as the Global Financial  Services
Fund.

Average Annual Total Return Tables                                              

The Average  Annual Total  Returns for each Fund's Shares are reduced to reflect
applicable sales charges. Remember, you will not be charged any sales charges in
connection  with  the   reorganization   of  the  Global  Value  Fund  into  the
International Value Fund. Returns Before Taxes are shown for all Classes of each
Fund. In addition  Return After Taxes is shown for each Fund's Class A Shares to
illustrate the effect of federal taxes on each Fund's returns.  Actual after-tax
returns  depend on each  investor's  personal tax  situation,  and are likely to
differ from those shown.  The table also shows returns for the  MSCI-World  Free
Index and the MSCI-EAFE Value Index, both broad-based market indexes.           

     Total returns for the indexes shown do not reflect sales charges,  expenses
or other fees that the SEC requires to be reflected in a Fund's performance. The
indexes are unmanaged, and it is not possible to invest directly in an index.

1.   Prior to August 14, 2002, the Global Value Fund's name was Federated  World
     Utility Fund.  The World  Utility Fund  invested its assets  primarily in a
global portfolio of utility securities.                               

2.   The  Global  Value  Fund's  Class A,  Class B and  Class C Shares  start of
     performance  dates were April 22,  1994,  July 27, 1995 and July 27,  1995,
respectively.                                                         

3.   After-tax  returns are calculated using a standard set of assumptions.  The
     stated  returns  assume the highest  historical  federal income and capital
     gains tax rates.  Return After Taxes on  Distributions  assumes a continued
     investment  in a Fund and shows the effect of taxes on Fund  distributions.
     Return  After Taxes on  Distributions  and Sale of Fund Shares  assumes all
     shares were redeemed at the end of each measurement  period,  and shows the
     effect of any taxable gain (or offsetting  loss) on redemption,  as well as
     the effects of taxes on Fund distributions.  These after-tax returns do not
     reflect  the  effect of any  applicable  state and local  taxes.  After-tax
     returns  for Class B Shares and Class C Shares will differ from those shown
     above for Class A Shares.  After-tax  returns are not relevant to investors
    holding Shares through tax-deferred programs, such as IRA or 401(k) plans.

4.   Prior to  September  4,  2003,  the  International  Value  Fund's  name was
     Federated  Global Financial  Services Fund. The Global  Financial  Services
     Fund  invested  its assets  primarily  in a global  portfolio  of financial
securities.                                                           

5.   The International Value Fund's Class A, Class B and Class C Shares start of
performance date was September 30, 1998

     net investment income (loss) ratios shown above.                                                                    


Service Fees, Advisory Fees and Expense Ratios                                  

     The service providers,  applicable service fees and the investment advisory
fees, for both Funds are identical.  The maximum annual investment  advisory fee
for both Funds is 1.00% of average daily net assets.                            

     For its fiscal year ending  November  30,  2004,  the  International  Value
Fund's  projected  ratio of  expenses  to average  daily net assets is 2.52% for
Class A Shares,  and 3.27% for both  Class B Shares  and Class C Shares.  Absent
voluntary waivers and reimbursement,  the projected ratio of expenses to average
daily net assets  would be 2.78% for Class A Shares and 3.28% for Class B Shares
and Class C Shares of the International Value Fund.                             

     For its fiscal year ending  November  30,  2004,  the Global  Value  Fund's
projected  ratio of  expenses  to average  daily net assets is 2.07% for Class A
Shares,  and 2.82% for both Class B Shares and Class C Shares.  Absent voluntary
waivers and reimbursement,  the projected ratio of expenses to average daily net
assets  would be 2.64% for Class A Shares  and 3.39% for both Class B Shares and
Class C Shares.                                                                 

     The Global Value  Fund's  Class B and Class C Shares and the  International
Value Fund have the  ability  to pay a Rule  12b-1 fee.  The Rule 12b-1 fee as a
percentage of average daily net assets of each Fund is 0.75% for Class B Shares,
and 0.75% for Class C Shares. The International Value Fund's Rule 12b-1 fee as a
percentage of net assets of Class A Shares is 0.25%.  However, the International
Value Fund did not pay or accrue the 12b-1 fee for Class A Shares for the recent
fiscal year and has no present intention of paying or accruing the 12b-1 fee for
Class A Shares during the fiscal year ending November 30, 2004. The Global Value
Fund does not charge a 12b-1 fee for Class A Shares.                            

INFORMATION ABOUT THE REORGANIZATION

     The Funds have  similar  investment  objectives.  The  International  Value
Fund's  investment  objective  is to provide  long term growth of  capital.  The
Global Value Fund's investment objective is to provide a total return on assets.
Total  return  generally  consists  of (1)  changes in the  market  value of its
portfolio securities (both realized and unrealized appreciation); and (2) income
received  from its  portfolio  securities.  Both Funds pursue  their  respective
investment  objectives  by  investing  in  securities  of foreign  and  domestic
companies that the Adviser deems to be undervalued.                             

     The fundamental  investment limitations of the International Value Fund and
the Global  Value Fund are  similar.  The  International  Value Fund  contains a
fundamental  investment  policy  that  permits it to  concentrate  in  financial
services industries and the Global Value Fund contains a fundamental policy that
permits it to concentrate in the utilities industry. However, both Funds have no
present intention of concentrating their investments in an industry.  For a more
in depth  comparison of investment  objectives,  policies and  limitations,  see
"Comparison of Investment Objectives and Policies."                             

     The Global Value Fund invests a higher percentage of its assets in domestic
securities  than  the  International  Value  Fund.  As  of  May  31,  2004,  the
International  Value Fund has approximately  19.10% (which includes a 6.90% cash
position) of its assets  invested in domestic  companies  while the Global Value
Fund had approximately 55.35% (which includes a 2.53% cash position). Therefore,
after the  Reorganization,  Global Value Fund shareholders will continue to gain
exposure to a global  portfolio of securities  that the Adviser has deemed to be
undervalued  though it is  anticipated  that they will have greater  exposure to
foreign  markets and less  exposure to domestic  markets  than the Global  Value
Fund.                                                                           

Description of the Plan of Reorganization                                       

     The Plan provides that on or about the Closing Date (presently  expected to
be on or about October 22, 2004) the  International  Value Fund will acquire all
of the assets of the Global  Value Fund in exchange  for Class A, B and C Shares
of the  International  Value Fund to be distributed pro rata by the Global Value
Fund to  holders  of its  Class A, B and C  Shares,  respectively,  in  complete
liquidation and termination of the Global Value Fund. Shareholders of the Global
Value Fund will become  shareholders of the International  Value Fund as of 4:00
p.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date and will begin accruing dividends on the
next day. Shares of the  International  Value Fund received by Global Value Fund
shareholders as part of the Reorganization will not be subject to a sales load. 

     Consummation of the  Reorganization  is subject to the conditions set forth
in the Plan, including receipt of an opinion in form and substance  satisfactory
to  the  Corporation,  as  described  under  the  caption  "Federal  Income  Tax
Consequences"  below. The Plan may be terminated and the  Reorganization  may be
abandoned  at any time before or after  approval by  shareholders  of the Global
Value Fund prior to the Closing  Date by the  Corporation  if it  believes  that
consummation  of the  Reorganization  would not be in the best  interests of the
shareholders of either Fund.                                                    

     The Adviser  will bear the  expenses  related to the  Reorganization.  Such
expenses  include,  but are not  limited  to:  legal  fees;  registration  fees;
transfer taxes (if any); the fees of banks and transfer agents; and the costs of
preparing,  printing,  copying, and mailing proxy solicitation  materials to the
Global Value Fund's shareholders and the costs of holding the special meeting of
shareholders.                                                                   

     The  foregoing   brief  summary  of  the  Plan  entered  into  between  the
International  Value Fund and the Global Value Fund is qualified in its entirety
by the terms and  provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is attached  hereto as
Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference.                                 

Description of International Value Fund Shares and Capitalization               

     Class A, B and C Shares  of the  International  Value  Fund to be issued to
shareholders  of the  Global  Value  Fund  under the Plan will be fully paid and
non-assessable when issued,  transferable  without restrictions and will have no
preemptive or conversion  rights.  Reference is hereby made to the Prospectus of
the International Value Fund provided herewith for additional  information about
Class A, B and C Shares of the International Value Fund.                        

     The following tables show the  capitalization  of the  International  Value
Fund and the Global Value Fund as of July 15, 2004,  and on a pro forma basis as
of that date:

     As a condition  to the  Reorganization,  the  Corporation  will  receive an
opinion of counsel to the  Corporation,  to the effect that, on the basis of the
existing  provisions  of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended  (the
"Code"),  current  administrative rules and court decisions,  for federal income
tax purposes:                                                                   

o       the Reorganization as set forth in the Plan will constitute a tax-free  
     reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code, and the Global Value
Fund and the International Value Fund each will be a party to a 
reorganization within the meaning of section 368(b) of the Code;
o       no gain or loss will be recognized by the International Value Fund upon 
its receipt of the Global Value Fund's assets in exchange for   
International Value Fund shares;                                
o       no gain or loss will be recognized by the Global Value Fund upon        
      transfer of its assets to the International Value Fund in exchange for
International Value Fund shares or upon the distribution of the 
       International Value Fund shares to the Global Value Fund's shareholders
in exchange for their Global Value Fund shares;                 
o       no gain or loss will be recognized by shareholders of the Global Value  
      Fund upon exchange of their Global Value Fund shares for International
Value Fund shares;                                              
o       the tax basis of the assets of the Global Value Fund acquired by the    
  International Value Fund will be the same as the tax basis of such
        assets to the Global Value Fund immediately prior to the Reorganization;
o       the aggregate tax basis of shares of the International Value Fund       
     received by each shareholder of the Global Value Fund pursuant to the
        Reorganization will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the shares
      of the Global Value Fund held by such shareholder immediately prior to
the Reorganization;                                             
o       the holding period of the Global Value Fund's assets in the hands of the
   International Value Fund will include the period during which those
assets were held by the Global Value Fund; and                  
o       the holding period of International Value Fund shares received by each  
      shareholder of the Global Value Fund pursuant to the Plan will include
       the period during which the Global Value Fund shares exchanged therefor
    were held by such shareholder, provided the Global Value Fund shares
were held as capital assets on the date of the Reorganization.  

     The  Reorganization  may  require  the  Global  Value  Fund to dispose of a
portion of its portfolio securities (which portion will be limited to the extent
necessary to enable the  Reorganization to qualify as a tax-free transfer) prior
to the  Reorganization  due to  non-conformance  of  those  securities  with the
investment objectives,  policies or limitations of the International Value Fund.
However,  it is  anticipated  that any gain realized by the  disposition  of the
portfolio  securities  will be offset by the Global Value Fund's  existing carry
forward losses. The Reorganization may also require the International Value Fund
to sell  acquired  portfolio  securities  in order to rebalance  its  portfolio.
However,  it is anticipated  that at least a portion of any gain realized by the
disposition of portfolio  securities  will be offset by carry forward losses (to
the extent  allowed  by the Code)  received  from the  Global  Value Fund in the
Reorganization.                                                                 

       As of November 30, 2003 Global Value Fund had approximately $32 million
in capital loss carryovers. As a result of the Reorganization, a portion of     
these capital loss carryovers may not be available for use by the International 
Value Fund.                                                                     

      The foregoing opinion may state that no opinion is expressed as to the
effect of the Reorganization on the International Value Fund, the Global Value  
Fund or the Global Value Fund's shareholders with respect to any asset as to    
which unrealized gain or loss is required to be recognized for federal income   
tax purposes at the end of a taxable year (or on the termination or transfer    
thereof) under a mark-to-market system of accounting.                           

       Shareholders of the Global Value Fund should consult their tax advisors
regarding the effect, if any, of the Reorganization in light of their individual
circumstances. Because the foregoing discussion only relates to the federal     
income tax consequences of the Reorganization, those shareholders also should   
consult their tax advisors about state and local tax consequences, if any, of   
the Reorganization.

Legal Proceedings                                                               

     Like many  other  mutual  fund  companies,  in  September  2003,  Federated
Investors,  Inc.,  the  parent  company of the  Federated  funds'  advisers  and
distributor   (collectively,   "Federated"),   received  detailed  requests  for
information on shareholder trading activities in the Federated funds ("Federated
Funds")  from the SEC,  the New York State  Attorney  General,  and the National
Association  of  Securities  Dealers.  Since that time,  Federated  has received
additional  inquiries from regulatory  authorities on these and related matters,
and more such inquiries may be received in the future.                          

     As a result of these  inquiries,  Federated  and the  Federated  Funds have
conducted  an internal  investigation  of the  matters  raised,  which  revealed
instances  in which a few  investors  were  granted  exceptions  to  Federated's
internal  procedures for limiting  frequent  transactions  and that one of these
investors  made  an  additional   investment  in  another  Federated  fund.  The
investigation  has also  identified  inadequate  procedures  which  permitted  a
limited  number  of  investors   (including  several  employees)  to  engage  in
undetected  frequent trading  activities  and/or the placement and acceptance of
orders to purchase  shares of fluctuating net asset value funds after the funds'
closing times.  Federated has issued a series of press releases describing these
matters in greater detail and  emphasizing  that it is committed to compensating
the Federated Funds for any detrimental  impact these  transactions may have had
on them.  In that regard,  on February 3, 2004,  Federated  and the  independent
directors of the Federated Funds announced the  establishment  by Federated of a
restoration  fund that is intended  to cover any such  detrimental  impact.  The
press  releases  and  related  communications  are  available  in the "About Us"
section of Federated's website www.federatedinvestors.com,  and any future press
releases on this subject will also be posted there.                             

     Shortly  after  Federated's  first  public   announcement   concerning  the
foregoing matters, and notwithstanding Federated's commitment to taking remedial
actions,  Federated  and various  Federated  Funds were named as  defendants  in
several class action  lawsuits now pending in the United States  District  Court
for the  District  of  Maryland  seeking  damages of  unspecified  amounts.  The
lawsuits were purportedly filed on behalf of people who purchased,  owned and/or
redeemed shares of  Federated-sponsored  mutual funds during  specified  periods
beginning  November 1, 1998.  The suits are  generally  similar in alleging that
Federated  engaged in illegal and improper  trading  practices  including market
timing and late  trading in concert with certain  institutional  traders,  which
allegedly caused financial injury to the mutual fund shareholders.              

     Federated and various Federated Funds have also been named as defendants in
several additional lawsuits, the majority of which are now pending in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania,  alleging, among
other things,  excessive  advisory and rule 12b-1 fees,  and seeking  damages of
unspecified amounts.                                                            

     The board of the  Federated  Funds has retained the law firm of  Dickstein,
Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky LLP to represent the Federated Funds in these lawsuits.
Federated and the Federated Funds, and their respective  counsel,  are reviewing
the allegations and will respond  appropriately.  Additional lawsuits based upon
similar  allegations may be filed in the future.  The potential  impact of these
recent lawsuits and future potential similar suits is uncertain.  Although we do
not  believe  that these  lawsuits  will have a material  adverse  effect on the
Funds, there can be no assurance that these suits, the ongoing adverse publicity
and/or other developments resulting from the regulatory  investigations will not
result in increased  Fund  redemptions,  reduced sales of Fund shares,  or other
adverse consequences for the Funds.                                             

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT
 SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

About the Proxy Solicitation and the Meeting                                    

     Proxies are being solicited by the Board,  on behalf of its portfolio,  the
Global  Value  Fund.  The  proxies  will be  voted  at the  special  meeting  of
shareholders of the Corporation to be held on October 22, 2004 at 5800 Corporate
Drive, Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania 15237-7000,  at 2:00 p.m. (such special meeting
and any  adjournment  or  postponement  thereof are  referred to as the "Special
Meeting").                                                                      

     The cost of the  solicitation,  including the printing and mailing of proxy
materials,  will be borne by the Adviser.  In addition to solicitations  through
the mails,  proxies may be solicited by officers,  employees,  and agents of the
Corporation or, if necessary,  a communications  firm retained for this purpose.
Such  solicitations  may be by  telephone,  telegraph,  through the  Internet or
otherwise.  Any  telephonic  solicitations  will follow  procedures  designed to
ensure accuracy and prevent fraud,  including requiring identifying  shareholder
information,  recording the  shareholder's  instructions,  and confirming to the
shareholder after the fact. Shareholders who communicate proxies by telephone or
by other electronic means have the same power and authority to issue, revoke, or
otherwise change their voting instructions as shareholders submitting proxies in
written  form.  The  Corporation  may  reimburse   custodians,   nominees,   and
fiduciaries  for the  reasonable  costs  incurred  by them  in  connection  with
forwarding  solicitation  materials to the  beneficial  owners of shares held of
record by such persons.                                                         

   The purpose of the Special Meeting is set forth in the accompanying
Notice. The Board knows of no business other than that mentioned in the Notice  
that will be presented for consideration at the Special Meeting. Should other   
business properly be brought before the Special Meeting, proxies will be voted  
in accordance with the best judgment of the persons named as proxies. This      
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card are expected to be mailed
on or about September 8, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of        
business on August 23, 2004 (the "Record Date").                                

    The International Value Fund's annual report, which includes audited
financial statements for its fiscal year ended November 30, 2003, was previously
mailed to shareholders. The semi-annual reports for the Global Value Fund and   
the International Value Fund, which contain unaudited financial statements for  
the periods ended May 31, 2004, were also previously mailed to shareholders. The
Corporation will promptly provide, without charge and upon request, to each     
person to whom this Prospectus/Proxy Statement is delivered, a copy of the      
annual reports and/or the semi-annual reports for the International Value Fund  
and the Global Value Fund. Requests for annual reports or semi-annual reports   
for the International Value Fund and the Global Value Fund may be made by       
writing to the Corporation's principal executive offices or by calling the      
Corporation. The Corporation's principal executive offices are located at       
Federated Investors Funds, 5800 Corporate Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
15237-7000. The Corporation's toll-free telephone number is 1-800-341-7400.     

Proxies, Quorum and Voting at the Special Meeting                               

       Only shareholders of record on the Record Date will be entitled to vote
at the Special Meeting. Each share of the Corporation is entitled to one vote.  
Fractional shares are entitled to proportionate shares of one vote.             

      Any person giving a proxy has the power to revoke it any time prior to
its exercise by executing a superseding proxy or by submitting a written notice 
of revocation to the Secretary of the Corporation. In addition, although mere   
attendance at the Special Meeting will not revoke a proxy, a shareholder present
at the Special Meeting may withdraw his or her proxy and vote in person. All    
properly executed and unrevoked proxies received in time for the Special Meeting
will be voted in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxies. If  
no instruction is given on the proxy, the persons named as proxies will vote the
shares represented thereby in favor of the matter set forth in the attached     
Notice.                                                                         

        In order to hold the Special Meeting, a "quorum" of shareholders must be
present. Holders of one-third of the total number of outstanding shares of the  
Global Value Fund, present in person or by proxy, shall be required to          
constitute a quorum for the purpose of voting on the proposals.                 

    For purposes of determining a quorum for transacting business at the
Special Meeting, abstentions and broker "non-votes" (that is, proxies from      
brokers or nominees indicating that such persons have not received instructions 
from the beneficial owner or other persons entitled to vote shares on a         
particular matter with respect to which the brokers or nominees do not have     
discretionary power) will be treated as shares that are present but which have  
not been voted. For this reason, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the 
effect of a "no" vote for purposes of obtaining the requisite approval of each  
proposal.                                                                       

       If a quorum is not present, the persons named as proxies may vote those
proxies that have been received to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date. 
In the event that a quorum is present but sufficient votes in favor of the      
proposal have not been received, the persons named as proxies may propose one or
more adjournments of the Special Meeting to permit further solicitations of     
proxies with respect to the proposal. All such adjournments will require the    
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at   
the session of the Special Meeting to be adjourned. The persons named as proxies
will vote AGAINST an adjournment those proxies that they are required to vote   
against the proposal, and will vote in FAVOR of such an adjournment all other   
proxies that they are authorized to vote. A shareholder vote may be taken on the
proposal in this Prospectus/Proxy Statement prior to any such adjournment if    
sufficient votes have been received for approval.                               

      Shareholder approval requires the affirmative vote of more than 50% of
the shares of the Global Value Fund entitled to vote.

                  OTHER MATTERS AND DISCRETION OF ATTORNEYS NAMED IN THE PROXY

     The Corporation is not required, and does not intend, to hold regular
annual meetings of shareholders. Shareholders wishing to submit proposals for   
consideration for inclusion in a Prospectus/Proxy Statement for the next meeting
of shareholders should send their written proposals to Federated World

     WHEREAS,  the Acquiring  Fund and the Acquired Fund are separate  series of
the  Corporation,  and the  Corporation  is an open-end,  registered  management
investment  company and the Acquired  Fund owns  securities  that  generally are
assets of the character in which the Acquiring Fund is permitted to invest;     

     WHEREAS,  the Acquiring  Fund and the Acquired Fund are each  authorized to
issue their shares of capital stock;                                            

     WHEREAS,  the  Directors  of  the  Corporation  have  determined  that  the
Reorganization,  with respect to the Acquiring Fund, is in the best interests of

agreements  hereinafter  set forth,  the parties  hereto  covenant  and agree as
follows:                                                                        

Article I

SHARES AND LIQUIDATION OF THE ACQUIRED FUND 

1.1 THE EXCHANGE.  Subject to the terms and conditions  contained  herein and on
the basis of the representations  and warranties  contained herein, the Acquired
Fund agrees to transfer all of its assets, as set forth in paragraph 1.2, to the
Acquiring  Fund. In exchange,  the Acquiring Fund agrees:  (i) to deliver to the
Acquired  Fund  the  number  of  full  and  fractional  Acquiring  Fund  Shares,
determined  by (a)  multiplying  the  shares  outstanding  of each  class of the
Acquired Fund by (b) the ratio  computed by dividing (x) the net asset value per
share of such class of the Acquired Fund by (y) the net asset value per share of
the  corresponding  class of Acquiring Fund Shares computed in the manner and as
of the time and date set  forth in  paragraph  2.2.  Holders  of Class A Shares,
Class B Shares  and Class C Shares of the  Acquired  Fund will  receive  Class A
Shares,  Class  B  Shares  and  Class  C  Shares  of the  Acquiring  Fund.  Such
transactions shall take place at the closing on the Closing Date provided for in
paragraph 3.1.                                                                  

1.2 ASSETS TO BE ACQUIRED. The assets of the Acquired Fund to be acquired by the
Acquiring Fund shall consist of all property, including, without limitation, all
cash,  securities,  commodities,  interests in futures and dividends or interest
receivable,  owned by the  Acquired  Fund and any  deferred or prepaid  expenses
shown as an asset on the books of the Acquired Fund on the Closing Date.        

     The  Acquired  Fund has provided  the  Acquiring  Fund with its most recent
audited financial statements, which contain a list of all of the Acquired Fund's
assets as of the date of such  statements.  The Acquired Fund hereby  represents
that as of the date of the  execution  of this  Agreement,  there  have  been no
changes in its  financial  position as  reflected in such  financial  statements
other than those occurring in the ordinary course of business in connection with
the purchase and sale of  securities,  the issuance and  redemption  of Acquired
Fund shares and the payment of normal operating expenses,  dividends and capital
gains distributions.                                                            

1.3  LIABILITIES TO BE  DISCHARGED.  The Acquired Fund will discharge all of its
liabilities and obligations prior to the Closing Date.

State of Maryland, effective as of the Closing Date.                            

1.5  LIQUIDATION  AND  DISTRIBUTION.  On or as soon after the Closing Date as is
conveniently  practicable:  (a) the Acquired  Fund will  distribute  in complete
liquidation  of the  Acquired  Fund,  pro rata to its  shareholders  of  record,
determined as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the  "Acquired  Fund
Shareholders"),  all of the Acquiring Fund Shares  received by the Acquired Fund
pursuant to paragraph 1.1; and (b) the Acquired Fund will  thereupon  proceed to
dissolve and  terminate as set forth in paragraph 1.9 below.  Such  distribution
will be  accomplished  by the transfer of Acquiring Fund Shares  credited to the
account of the Acquired Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts
on the share  records of the  Acquiring  Fund in the name of the  Acquired  Fund
Shareholders,  and representing the respective pro rata number of Acquiring Fund
Shares due such shareholders.  All issued and outstanding shares of the Acquired
Fund (the "Acquired Fund Shares") will  simultaneously  be canceled on the books
of  the  Acquired  Fund.  The  Acquiring  Fund  shall  not  issue   certificates
representing  Acquiring Fund Shares in connection with such transfer.  After the
Closing  Date,  the  Acquired  Fund shall not  conduct  any  business  except in
connection with its termination.                                                

1.6 OWNERSHIP OF SHARES. Ownership of Acquiring Fund Shares will be shown on the
books of the Acquiring  Fund's  transfer  agent.  Acquiring  Fund Shares will be
issued  simultaneously  to the Acquired Fund, in an amount equal in value to the
aggregate  net asset value of the Acquired  Fund Shares,  to be  distributed  to
Acquired Fund Shareholders.                                                     

1.7 TRANSFER  TAXES.  Any transfer  taxes payable upon the issuance of Acquiring
Fund  Shares in a name other than the  registered  holder of the  Acquired  Fund
shares on the books of the Acquired  Fund as of that time shall,  as a condition
of such issuance and transfer, be paid by the person to whom such Acquiring Fund
Shares are to be issued and transferred.                                        

1.8 REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY.  Any reporting responsibility of the Acquired Fund
is and shall remain the responsibility of the Acquired Fund.                    

1.9 TERMINATION.  The Acquired Fund shall be terminated  promptly  following the
Closing Date and the making of all distributions pursuant to paragraph 1.5.     

1.10 BOOKS AND RECORDS.  All books and records of the Acquired  Fund,  including
all books and records required to be maintained under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 (the "1940 Act"),  and the rules and  regulations  thereunder,  shall be
available  to the  Acquiring  Fund from and after the Closing  Date and shall be
turned over to the Acquiring Fund as soon as  practicable  following the Closing
Date.                                                                           

Article II                                                                      

 VALUATION

2.1 VALUATION OF ASSETS.  The value of the Acquired Fund's assets to be acquired
by the Acquiring Fund hereunder shall be the value of such assets at the closing
on the Closing Date,  using the valuation  procedures set forth in the Acquiring
Fund's then current  prospectus and statement of additional  information or such
other valuation procedures as shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties.     

2.2 VALUATION OF SHARES.  The net asset value per share of Acquiring Fund Shares
shall be the net asset  value per share  computed  at the closing on the Closing
Date,  using the valuation  procedures  set forth in the  Acquiring  Fund's then
current  prospectus  and  statement  of  additional  information,  or such other
valuation procedures as shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties.           

2.3 SHARES TO BE ISSUED.  The number of the  Acquiring  Fund Shares to be issued
(including  fractional  shares,  if any) in  exchange  for the  Acquired  Fund's
assets,  shall be determined by (a) multiplying  the shares  outstanding of each
class of the  Acquired  Fund by (b) the ratio  computed by (x)  dividing the net
asset  value per share of such class of the  Acquired  Fund by (y) the net asset
value per share of the  corresponding  class of the Acquiring Fund determined in
accordance with paragraph 2.2.

shall be closed to trading or trading on such exchange shall be  restricted;  or
(b)  trading  or the  reporting  of trading  on the NYSE or  elsewhere  shall be
disrupted  so that  accurate  appraisal  of the  value of the net  assets of the
Acquiring Fund or the Acquired Fund is impracticable,  the Closing Date shall be
postponed  until the first  business  day  after the day when  trading  is fully
resumed and reporting is restored.

a)   The Acquired Fund is a legally designated, separate series of a corporation
     duly organized,  validly  existing,  and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Maryland.                                                

b)   The Corporation is registered as an open-end management  investment company
     under the 1940 Act, and the Corporation's  registration with the Securities

     Acquired  Fund  conform  in  all  material   respects  to  the   applicable
     requirements  of the  Securities  Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and the 1940
     Act,  and the rules and  regulations  thereunder,  and do not  include  any
     untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omit to state any  material  fact
     required to be stated or necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.      

d)   The Acquired Fund is not, and the execution,  delivery,  and performance of
     this Agreement  (subject to shareholder  approval) will not,  result in the
     violation of any provision of the  Corporation's  Articles of Incorporation
     or By-Laws or of any material agreement, indenture,  instrument,  contract,
     lease,  or other  undertaking  to which the Acquired  Fund is a party or by
which it is bound.                                                    

e)   The Acquired  Fund has no material  contracts or other  commitments  (other
     than this  Agreement)  that will be terminated  with liability to it before
     the Closing  Date,  except for  liabilities,  if any, to be  discharged  as
provided in paragraph 1.3 hereof.                                     

f)   Except as otherwise  disclosed in writing to and accepted by the  Acquiring
     Fund, no litigation,  administrative  proceeding,  or  investigation  of or
     before  any  court or  governmental  body is  presently  pending  or to its
     knowledge  threatened against the Acquired Fund or any of its properties or
     assets,  which,  if adversely  determined,  would  materially and adversely
     affect its financial condition, the conduct of its business, or the ability
     of the Acquired  Fund to carry out the  transactions  contemplated  by this
     Agreement.  The  Acquired  Fund knows of no facts that might form the basis
     for the institution of such proceedings and is not a party to or subject to
     the  provisions  of  any  order,  decree,  or  judgment  of  any  court  or
     governmental  body that could  materially and adversely affect its business
or its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein.    

g)   The financial  statements of the Acquired Fund as of November 30, 2003, and
     for the fiscal  year then  ended  have been  prepared  in  accordance  with
     generally accepted  accounting  principles,  and such statements (copies of
     which have been  furnished to the  Corporation  on behalf of the  Acquiring
     Fund) fairly  reflect the  financial  condition of the Acquired  Fund as of
     such date,  and there are no known  contingent  liabilities of the Acquired
Fund as of such date that are not disclosed in such statements.       

h)   The unaudited financial statements of the Acquired Fund as of May 31, 2004,
     and for the six months  then ended have been  prepared in  accordance  with
     generally accepted  accounting  principles,  and such statements (copies of
     which have been  furnished to the  Corporation  on behalf of the  Acquiring
     Fund) fairly reflect the financial condition of the Acquired Fund as of May
31, 2004,  and there are no known  contingent  liabilities  of the Acquired
Fund as of such date that are not disclosed in such statements.       

i)   Since the date of the  financial  statements  referred to in paragraph  (h)
     above,  there have been no material  adverse changes in the Acquired Fund's
     financial  condition,  assets,  liabilities or business (other than changes
     occurring in the ordinary  course of  business),  or any  incurrence by the
     Acquired  Fund of  indebtedness  maturing  more than one year from the date
     such  indebtedness  was  incurred,  except as  otherwise  disclosed  to and
     accepted  by the  Corporation  on behalf  of the  Acquiring  Fund.  For the
     purposes  of this  paragraph  (i), a decline in the net asset  value of the
Acquired Fund shall not constitute a material adverse change.         

j)   All federal and other tax returns and reports of the Acquired Fund required
     by law to be filed,  have been filed, and all federal and other taxes shown
     to be due on such returns and reports have been paid, or, if not paid as of
     the Closing Date,  provision shall have been made for the payment  thereof.
     To the best of the  Corporation's  knowledge,  no such return is  currently
     under  audit,  and no  assessment  has been  asserted  with respect to such
returns.                                                              

k)   All issued and outstanding shares of the Acquired Fund are duly and validly
     issued and outstanding, fully paid and non-assessable by the Acquired Fund.
     All of the issued and outstanding  shares of the Acquired Fund will, at the
     time of the  Closing  Date,  be held by the  persons and in the amounts set
     forth in the records of the Acquired  Fund's  transfer agent as provided in
     paragraph 3.4. The Acquired Fund has no outstanding options,  warrants,  or
     other rights to subscribe  for or purchase any of the Acquired Fund shares,
     and has no outstanding securities convertible into any of the Acquired Fund
shares.                                                               

l)   At the Closing Date, the Acquired Fund will have good and marketable  title
     to the Acquired  Fund's  assets to be  transferred  to the  Acquiring  Fund
     pursuant to paragraph  1.2, and full right,  power,  and authority to sell,
     assign,  transfer,  and deliver such assets hereunder,  free of any lien or
     other  encumbrance,  except  those  liens  or  encumbrances  to  which  the
     Acquiring Fund has received notice, and, upon delivery and payment for such
     assets,  and the filing of any articles,  certificates  or other  documents
     under the laws of the state of Maryland,  the  Acquiring  Fund will acquire
     good and marketable title,  subject to no restrictions on the full transfer
     of such assets,  other than such restrictions as might arise under the 1933
 Act, and other than as disclosed to and accepted by the Acquiring Fund.

m)   The  execution,  delivery and  performance of this Agreement have been duly
     authorized  by all  necessary  action  on the  part of the  Acquired  Fund.
     Subject to approval  by the  Acquired  Fund  Shareholders,  this  Agreement
     constitutes  a  valid  and  binding   obligation  of  the  Acquired   Fund,
     enforceable in accordance  with its terms,  subject as to  enforcement,  to
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and other laws relating
to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.   

n)   The  information  to be furnished by the Acquired Fund for use in no-action
     letters, applications for orders, registration statements, proxy materials,
     and  other   documents  that  may  be  necessary  in  connection  with  the
     transactions  contemplated  herein  shall be accurate  and  complete in all
     material  respects and shall comply in all material  respects  with federal
securities and other laws and regulations.                            

o)   From the  effective  date of the  Registration  Statement  (as  defined  in
     paragraph  5.7),  through  the time of the  meeting  of the  Acquired  Fund
     Shareholders and on the Closing Date, any written information  furnished by
     the  Corporation  with  respect to the  Acquired  Fund for use in the Proxy
     Materials (as defined in paragraph 5.7), or any other materials provided in
     connection  with the  Reorganization,  does not and  will not  contain  any
     untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or omit to  state a  material  fact
     required to be stated or necessary to make the statements,  in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading.  

p)   The Acquired  Fund has elected to qualify and has qualified as a "regulated
     investment  company"  under the Code (a  "RIC"),  as of and since its first
     taxable  year;  has been a RIC under the Code at all times since the end of
     its  first  taxable  year  when it so  qualified;  and  qualifies  and will
     continue  to qualify as a RIC under the Code for its  taxable  year  ending
upon its liquidation.                                                 

q)   No governmental consents, approvals, authorizations or filings are required
     under the 1933 Act, the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act"),
     the 1940 Act or Maryland  law for the  execution  of this  Agreement by the
     Corporation,  for itself and on behalf of the Acquired Fund, except for the
     effectiveness  of  the  Registration  Statement,  and  the  filing  of  any
     articles,  certificates  or  other  documents  that may be  required  under
     Maryland law, and except for such other consents, approvals, authorizations
     and filings as have been made or received,  and such  consents,  approvals,
     authorizations  and  filings as may be required  subsequent  to the Closing
     Date,  it  being   understood,   however,   that  this  Agreement  and  the
     transactions  contemplated  herein must be approved by the  shareholders of
the Acquired Fund as described in paragraph 5.2.                      

4.2  REPRESENTATIONS  OF THE ACQUIRING FUND. The  Corporation,  on behalf of the
Acquiring  Fund,  represents and warrants to the  Corporation,  on behalf of the
Acquired Fund, as follows:                                                      

a)   The  Acquiring  Fund  is  a  legally  designated,   separate  series  of  a
     corporation,  duly organized,  validly  existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Maryland.                                    

b)   The Corporation is registered as an open-end management  investment company
     under the 1940 Act, and the Corporation's  registration with the Commission
  as an investment company under the 1940 Act is in full force and effect.

c)   The current  prospectus  and  statement of  additional  information  of the
     Acquiring  Fund  conform  in  all  material   respects  to  the  applicable
     requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations
     thereunder,  and do not include any untrue  statement of a material fact or
     omit to state any material  fact required to be stated or necessary to make
     such statements  therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under which they
were made, not misleading.                                            

d)   The Acquiring Fund is not, and the execution,  delivery and  performance of
     this  Agreement  will  not,  result  in a  violation  of the  Corporation's
     Articles  of  Incorporation  or  By-Laws  or  of  any  material  agreement,
     indenture,  instrument,  contract, lease, or other undertaking to which the
Acquiring Fund is a party or by which it is bound.                    

e)   Except as  otherwise  disclosed  in writing to and accepted by the Acquired
     Fund,  no  litigation,  administrative  proceeding or  investigation  of or
     before  any  court or  governmental  body is  presently  pending  or to its
     knowledge threatened against the Acquiring Fund or any of its properties or
     assets,  which,  if adversely  determined,  would  materially and adversely
     affect its financial condition,  the conduct of its business or the ability
     of the Acquiring Fund to carry out the  transactions  contemplated  by this
     Agreement.  The Acquiring  Fund knows of no facts that might form the basis
     for the institution of such proceedings and it is not a party to or subject
     to the  provisions  of any  order,  decree,  or  judgment  of any  court or
     governmental  body that could  materially and adversely affect its business
or its ability to consummate the transaction contemplated herein.     

f)   The financial  statements of the Acquiring Fund as of November 30, 2003 and
     for the fiscal  year then  ended  have been  prepared  in  accordance  with
     generally accepted  accounting  principles,  and such statements (copies of
     which  have been  furnished  to the  Acquired  Funds)  fairly  reflect  the
     financial condition of the Acquiring Fund as of such date, and there are no
     known contingent liabilities of the Acquiring Fund as of such date that are
not disclosed in such statements.                                     

g)   The unaudited  financial  statements  of the  Acquiring  Fund as of May 31,
2004,  and for the six months then ended have been  prepared in  accordance
     with generally accepted accounting principles,  and such statements (copies
     of which have been  furnished  to the  Acquired  Fund)  fairly  reflect the
     financial condition of the Acquiring Fund as of such date, and there are no
     known contingent liabilities of the Acquiring Fund as of such date that are
not disclosed in such statements.                                     

h)   Since the date of the  financial  statements  referred to in paragraph  (g)
     above,  there have been no material adverse changes in the Acquiring Fund's
     financial  condition,  assets,  liabilities or business (other than changes
     occurring in the ordinary  course of  business),  or any  incurrence by the
     Acquiring  Fund of  indebtedness  maturing more than one year from the date
     such  indebtedness  was  incurred,  except as  otherwise  disclosed  to and
     accepted by the Acquired  Fund.  For the purposes of this  paragraph (h), a
     decline in the net asset value of the Acquiring Fund shall not constitute a
material adverse change.                                              

i)   All  federal  and other tax  returns  and  reports  of the  Acquiring  Fund
     required by law to be filed,  have been filed.  All federal and other taxes
     shown to be due on such  returns and reports have been paid or, if not paid
     as of the Closing Date,  provision  shall have been made for their payment.
     To the best of the Acquiring Fund's knowledge,  no such return is currently
     under  audit,  and no  assessment  has been  asserted  with respect to such
returns.                                                              

j)   All issued  and  outstanding  Acquiring  Fund  Shares are duly and  validly
     issued and  outstanding,  fully paid and  non-assessable  by the  Acquiring
     Fund.  The Acquiring Fund has no outstanding  options,  warrants,  or other
     rights to subscribe  for or purchase any Acquiring  Fund Shares,  and there
   are no outstanding securities convertible into any Acquiring Fund Shares.

k)   The  execution,  delivery and  performance of this Agreement have been duly
     authorized by all necessary  action on the part of the Acquiring  Fund, and
     this Agreement  constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Acquiring
     Fund,  enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject as to enforcement,
     to  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium,  and other  laws
     relating  to  or  affecting   creditors'   rights  and  to  general  equity
principles.                                                           

l)   Acquiring  Fund Shares to be issued and  delivered to the Acquired Fund for
     the account of the Acquired Fund Shareholders pursuant to the terms of this
     Agreement  will, at the Closing Date,  have been duly  authorized.  When so
     issued and delivered, such shares will be duly and validly issued Acquiring
Fund Shares, and will be fully paid and non-assessable.               

m)   The  information to be furnished by the Acquiring Fund for use in no-action
     letters, registration statements, proxy materials, and other documents that
     may be necessary in connection with the  transactions  contemplated  herein
     shall be accurate and complete in all material respects and shall comply in
     all  material   respects  with  federal   securities  and  other  laws  and
regulations.                                                          

n)   From the  effective  date of the  Registration  Statement  (as  defined  in
     paragraph  5.7),  through  the time of the  meeting  of the  Acquired  Fund
     Shareholders and on the Closing Date, any written information  furnished by
     the  Corporation  with respect to the  Acquiring  Fund for use in the Proxy
     Materials (as defined in paragraph 5.7), or any other materials provided in
     connection  with the  Reorganization,  does not and  will not  contain  any
     untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or omit to  state a  material  fact
     required to be stated or necessary to make the statements,  in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading.  

o)   The Acquiring  Fund has elected to qualify and has qualified as a RIC under
     the Code as of and since its first taxable  year;  has been a RIC under the
     Code at all  times  since  the end of its  first  taxable  year  when it so
     qualified;  and qualifies and shall  continue to qualify as a RIC under the
Code for its current taxable year.                                    

p)   No governmental consents, approvals, authorizations or filings are required
     under the 1933  Act,  the 1934 Act,  the 1940 Act or  Maryland  law for the
     execution of this Agreement by the Corporation, for itself and on behalf of
     the Acquiring Fund, or the performance of the Agreement by the Corporation,
     for  itself  and  on  behalf  of  the  Acquiring   Fund,   except  for  the
     effectiveness  of  the  Registration  Statement,  and  the  filing  of  any
     articles,  certificates  or  other  documents  that may be  required  under
     Maryland  law,  and such  other  consents,  approvals,  authorizations  and
     filings  as have been  made or  received,  and  except  for such  consents,
     approvals,  authorizations and filings as may be required subsequent to the
Closing Date.                                                         

q)   The  Acquiring  Fund  agrees to use all  reasonable  efforts  to obtain the
     approvals  and  authorizations  required by the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and
     any state Blue Sky or securities  laws as it may deem  appropriate in order
to continue its operations after the Closing Date.

Article VIII

FURTHER CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE
ACQUIRING FUND AND ACQUIRED FUND

     If any of the  conditions  set forth  below do not  exist on or before  the
Closing Date with respect to the Acquired Fund or the Acquiring  Fund, the other
party to this Agreement shall, at its option,  not be required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement:                                    

8.1 This Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, with respect to the
Acquired Fund,  shall have been approved by the requisite vote of the holders of
the  outstanding  shares of the Acquired Fund in accordance  with applicable law
and the provisions of the  Corporation's  Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws.
Certified  copies of the  resolutions  evidencing  such approval shall have been
delivered  to  the  Acquiring  Fund.  Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to  the
contrary,  neither  the  Acquiring  Fund nor the  Acquired  Fund may  waive  the
conditions set forth in this paragraph 8.1.                                     

8.2 On the Closing Date,  the  Commission  shall not have issued an  unfavorable
report under Section 25(b) of the 1940 Act, or instituted any proceeding seeking
to enjoin the  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement

proceeding  shall be  threatened  or pending  before  any court or  governmental
agency in which it is sought to restrain or prohibit, or obtain damages or other

herein.                                                                         

8.3 All required consents of other parties and all other consents,  orders,  and
permits of federal,  state and local regulatory  authorities (including those of
the  Commission  and of State  securities  authorities,  including any necessary
"no-action"   positions  and  exemptive  orders  from  such  federal  and  state
authorities) to permit  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  herein
shall have been  obtained,  except  where  failure  to obtain any such  consent,
order,  or permit would not involve a risk of a material  adverse  effect on the
assets or properties of the Acquiring Fund or the Acquired  Fund,  provided that
either party hereto may waive any such conditions for itself.                   

8.4 The  Registration  Statement shall have become effective under the 1933 Act,
and no stop orders suspending the effectiveness  thereof shall have been issued.
To the best  knowledge of the parties to this  Agreement,  no  investigation  or
proceeding for that purpose shall have been instituted or be pending, threatened
or contemplated under the 1933 Act.                                             

8.5 The Corporation  shall have received an opinion of Dickstein Shapiro Morin &
Oshinsky LLP substantially to the effect that for federal income tax purposes:  

a)   The transfer of all of the Acquired  Fund's  assets to the  Acquiring  Fund
     solely in exchange for Acquiring Fund Shares  (followed by the distribution
     of Acquiring Fund Shares to the Acquired Fund  Shareholders  in dissolution
     and  liquidation of the Acquired Fund) will  constitute a  "reorganization"
     within the meaning of Section  368(a) of the Code,  and the Acquiring  Fund
     and the Acquired Fund will each be a "party to a reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code.                                

b)   No gain or loss will be recognized  by the Acquiring  Fund upon the receipt
     of the assets of the Acquired  Fund solely in exchange for  Acquiring  Fund
Shares.                                                               

c)   No gain or loss will be  recognized  by the Acquired Fund upon the transfer
     of the Acquired  Fund's assets to the Acquiring Fund solely in exchange for
     Acquiring  Fund  Shares  or  upon  the  distribution   (whether  actual  or
     constructive)  of Acquiring  Fund Shares to Acquired Fund  Shareholders  in
exchange for their Acquired Fund Shares.                              

d)   No gain or loss will be recognized by any Acquired  Fund  Shareholder  upon
the exchange of its Acquired Fund Shares for Acquiring Fund Shares.   

e)   The  aggregate  tax basis of the  Acquiring  Fund  Shares  received by each
     Acquired Fund Shareholder  pursuant to the Reorganization  will be the same
     as the  aggregate  tax  basis  of  the  Acquired  Fund  Shares  held  by it
     immediately  prior to the  Reorganization.  The holding period of Acquiring
     Fund Shares  received by each  Acquired Fund  Shareholder  will include the
     period during which the Acquired Fund Shares  exchanged  therefor were held
     by such shareholder,  provided the Acquired Fund Shares are held as capital
assets at the time of the Reorganization.                             

f)   The tax basis of the Acquired  Fund's assets acquired by the Acquiring Fund
     will be the  same as the tax  basis of such  assets  to the  Acquired  Fund
     immediately prior to the  Reorganization.  The holding period of the assets
     of the Acquired  Fund in the hands of the  Acquiring  Fund will include the
period during which those assets were held by the Acquired Fund.      

Such opinion shall be based on customary assumptions and such representations as
     Dickstein  Shapiro  Morin & Oshinsky LLP may  reasonably  request,  and the
     Acquired  Fund and  Acquiring  Fund will  cooperate to make and certify the
     accuracy of such  representations.  The foregoing opinion may state that no
     opinion  is  expressed  as to  the  effect  of  the  Reorganization  on the
     Acquiring  Fund,  the Acquired Fund or any Acquired Fund  Shareholder  with
     respect to any asset as to which  unrealized gain or loss is required to be
     reorganized  for federal  income tax  purposes at the end of a taxable year
     (or on the termination or transfer  thereof) under a mark-to-market  system
     of accounting. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the
     Acquiring  Fund nor the Acquired Fund may waive the conditions set forth in
this paragraph 8.5.                                                   

Article IX

10.2 Except as specified in the next sentence set forth in this paragraph  10.2,
the representations, warranties, and covenants contained in this Agreement or in
any document delivered  pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement,  shall
not survive the consummation of the  transactions  contemplated  hereunder.  The

Article XI

a)   a  breach  by the  other  of any  representation,  warranty,  or  agreement

b)   a condition  herein  expressed to be precedent  to the  obligations  of the
     terminating  party that has not been met and it reasonably  appears that it
will not or cannot be met; or

 Notes to Pro Forma Financial Statements
Year Ended November 30, 2003

Basis of Combination                                                            

The  accompanying  unaudited  Pro Forma  Combining  Portfolios  of  Investments,
Statements of Assets and  Liabilities  and Statements of Operations  ("Pro Forma
Financial  Statements")  reflect the accounts of Federated Global Value Fund and
Federated  International  Value Fund,  collectively ("the Funds"),  for the year
ended November 30, 2003.  These  statements have been derived from the books and
records utilized in calculating daily net asset values at November 30, 2003.    

The Pro  Forma  Financial  Statements  should  be read in  conjunction  with the
historical  financial  statements of the Funds which have been  incorporated  by
reference in the Statement of Additional Information. The Funds follow generally
accepted accounting  principles  applicable to management  investment  companies
which are disclosed in the historical financial statements of each fund.        

The Pro Forma  Financial  Statements  give  effect to the  proposed  transfer of
assets of  Federated  Global  Value Fund for shares of  Federated  International
Value. Under generally accepted accounting principles,  Federated  International
Value  Fund  will be the  surviving  entity  for  accounting  purposes  with its
historical cost of investment securities and results of operations being carried
forward.                                                                        

The Pro Forma Financial Statements have been adjusted to reflect the anticipated
advisory fee arrangement for the surviving entity. Certain other operating costs
have also been adjusted to reflect anticipated expenses of the combined entity. 
Other costs which may change as a result of the reorganization are currently    
undeterminable.                                                                 

For the year ended November 30, 2003,  Federated Global Value Fund and Federated
International  Value Fund paid  investment  advisory fees computed at the annual
rate of 1.00% as a percentage of average daily net assets.                      

Shares of Beneficial Interest                                                   

The Pro Forma net asset value per share assumes the issuance of 254,732 Class A 
Shares of  Federated  International  Value  Fund  (accounting  survivor)  to the
holders of 1,741,544 Class A Shares of Federated Global Value Fund which would  
have been issued at November 30, 2003.                                          

The Pro Forma net asset value per share  assumes the issuance of 173,897 Class B
Shares of  Federated  International  Value  Fund  (accounting  survivor)  to the
holders of 1,353,329  Class B Shares of Federated  Global Value Fund which would
have been issued at November 30, 2003.                                          

The Pro Forma net asset value per share  assumes the  issuance of 32,954 Class C
Shares of  Federated  International  Value  Fund  (accounting  survivor)  to the
holders of 254,751  Class C Shares of  Federated  Global  Value Fund which would
have been issued at November 30, 2003.

     This  Prospectus/Proxy  Statement  describes  the  proposal  for  Federated
European Equity Fund (the "European  Equity Fund") to transfer all of its assets
to Federated International Capital Appreciation Fund (the "International Capital
Appreciation  Fund"),  in  exchange  for  shares  of the  International  Capital
Appreciation Fund (the  "Reorganization").  International  Capital  Appreciation
Fund  Shares will be  distributed  pro rata by the  European  Equity Fund to its
shareholders  in complete  liquidation  and  dissolution of the European  Equity
Fund. As a result of the Reorganization, each owner of Class A, B or C shares of
the European  Equity Fund will become the owner of Class A, B or C Shares of the
International Capital Appreciation Fund, respectively,  having a total net asset
value equal to the total net asset value of his or her  holdings in the European
Equity Fund on the date of the Reorganization (the "Closing Date").             

     The investment  objectives of the International  Capital  Appreciation Fund
and the European  Equity Fund  (collectively  referred to as the "Funds") are to
provide long-term growth of capital. The International Capital Appreciation Fund
pursues its  investment  objective  by  investing  primarily  in foreign  equity
securities  from both  developed  and emerging  market  countries.  The European
Equity Fund pursues its  investment  objective by investing  primarily in equity
securities of European companies. Each Fund's portfolio is managed using a blend
of growth and value  investment  styles.  In the growth style,  Federated Global
Investment  Management  Corp.  (the  "Adviser")  seeks  to  purchase  stocks  of
companies  that it expects will rapidly  increase  earnings or cash flows in the
future.  In the value style, the Adviser seeks to purchase stocks of undervalued
stocks that may  significantly  increase in price as the market  recognizes  the
company's true value.

AND EXCHANGE  COMMISSION,  NOR HAS THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PASSED
UPON  THE  ACCURACY  OR  ADEQUACY  OF  THIS  PROSPECTUS/PROXY   STATEMENT.   ANY
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.                           

     For a comparison of the investment  policies of the Funds,  see "Summary --
Comparison of Investment Objectives and Policies."  Information concerning Class
A, B and C Shares of the International Capital Appreciation Fund, as compared to

 SUMMARY

     This summary is  qualified  in its entirety by reference to the  additional
information  contained  elsewhere  in  this  Prospectus/Proxy   Statement,   the
Prospectus and Statement of Additional  Information of the European Equity Fund,
both dated  January  31,  2004,  the  Prospectus  and  Statement  of  Additional
Information of the International  Capital  Appreciation Fund, both dated January
31,  2004,  the  Statement  of  Additional  Information  dated  August 25,  2004
(relating to this  Prospectus/Proxy  Statement)  and the  Agreement  and Plan of
Reorganization   (the  "Plan").   A  copy  of  the  Plan  is  attached  to  this
Prospectus/Proxy  Statement as Exhibit A. The  prospectus  of the  International
Capital Appreciation Fund accompanies this Prospectus/Proxy Statement.          

 REASONS FOR THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION

     The Board of Directors of the  Corporation  ("Board") has determined that a
combination  of  the  European  Equity  Fund  with  the  International   Capital
Appreciation  Fund is the best course of action for the European  Equity  Fund's
shareholders because,  after eight years of operation,  the European Equity Fund
has not grown to a viable size. The European  Equity Fund's net assets reached a
calendar year end high in 2000 of $83.6  million.  However,  as of May 31, 2004,
the  European  Equity  Fund's net assets had  steadily  declined  to reach $20.5
million.  At the Fund's  present size,  the fixed expenses of operating the Fund
relative  to the  Fund's  net  assets  are too high for shares of the Fund to be
saleable  without the  Adviser's  waiver of its  investment  advisory fee and/or
reimbursement  of Fund operating  expenses.  The Fund's  distributor,  Federated
Securities  Corp.,  (the  "Distributor")  has advised the Board that it does not
believe it can  significantly  increase sales of Fund shares in the future.  The
Adviser of the Fund has advised the Board that is unwilling to continue to waive
its fee and reimburse the Fund's operating expenses.                            

     The following  table shows net sales of the European Equity Fund shares for
the past  five  calendar  years  and the  Fund's  net  assets  for the past five
calendar years.

     As the tables  show,  the  Distributor  has been able to  increase  the net
assets of the International  Capital Appreciation Fund but has been unable to do
so with regard to the European  Equity  Fund.  The  Distributor  has advised the
Board that it  believes it can  continue to increase  the sales of shares of the
International Capital Appreciation Fund.                                        

     Both the European Equity Fund and the  International  Capital  Appreciation
Fund  are  managed  by  the  Adviser  and  invest  directly  in  foreign  equity
securities.  Both Funds invest in companies  located in  international  markets,
however,  the European  Equity Fund  primarily  focuses on investing in European
companies.  Both Funds pursue their investment  objectives by using a "blend" of
growth and value investment  styles (although from January 31, 1996 to March 28,
2003 the European Equity Fund used primarily a growth  investment  style and was
named the  Federated  European  Growth  Fund).  In the  growth  style the Funds'
Adviser  seeks to purchase  stocks of  companies  that it expects  will  rapidly
increase  earnings or cash flows in the future.  In the value style, the Adviser
seeks to purchase undervalued stocks that may significantly increase in price as
the market recognizes the company's true value. The primary  difference  between
the two Funds is that the International  Capital Appreciation Fund has a broader
mandate to invest in other  regions  of the world  such as Asia and in  emerging
markets, in addition to the European region. The Adviser of each Fund shares the
same  analytical,  trading  and  other  resources  and is  subject  to the  same
investment process disciplines within the Federated organization.               

     Shareholders of the European Equity Fund will continue to receive  exposure
to European companies after the Reorganization. As of May 31, 2004, the European
Equity Fund has approximately  96.9% of its assets invested in companies located
in the European region while the  International  Capital  Appreciation  Fund had
approximately 61%.                                                              

        As shown below in the "Comparative Fee Tables," an additional benefit to
European Equity Fund shareholders will be the significant reduction in expenses 
as a result of the Reorganization. While the International Capital Appreciation 
Fund has a higher management fee than the European Equity Fund, overall expenses
charged to European Equity Fund shareholders are expected to decrease as a      
result of the Reorganization. This is primarily the result of spreading expenses
across a larger pool of assets, allowing shareholders to benefit from economies 
of scale in the form of lower fees and expenses.                                

     The following table shows the Funds' Average Annual Total Returns, based on
net asset value, relative to each Fund's respective  benchmark,  for the periods
ended May 31, 2004.1 The Average  Annual  Returns of the  International  Capital
Appreciation  Fund  for the  period  June 30,  1997 to  August  7,  2002 was not
necessarily  consistent  with its  subsequent  performance  because  the results
reflect the performance of the International  Capital  Appreciation Fund when it
was named the Federated  International  Growth Fund and was managed in a fund of
funds format,  pursuant to which the Adviser selected other international equity
funds for investment by the Federated International Growth Fund.

1    Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  Investment  return and
     principal will fluctuate,  so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may
be worth more or less than their original cost.                       

2    The International Capital Appreciation Fund changed its name from Federated
     International Growth Fund to Federated  International  Capital Appreciation
     Fund on August 7,  2002.  Total  returns  shown for this  period  should be
     compared  to the  Fund's  former  benchmark  - The Morgan  Stanley  Capital
International Europe, Australasia and Far East Index.                 

     The Board has voted to recommend the approval of the Plan pursuant to which
International  Capital Appreciation Fund, a portfolio of the Corporation,  would
acquire  all of the assets of European  Equity  Fund,  also a  portfolio  of the
Corporation,  in exchange for Class A, B and C Shares of  International  Capital
Appreciation Fund (the "Exchange"). Immediately following the Exchange, European
Equity Fund will distribute the Class A, B and C Shares of International Capital
Appreciation Fund to holders of Class A, B and C Shares of European Equity Fund,
respectively  (the  "Distribution").  The  Exchange  and  the  Distribution  are
collectively   referred   to  in   this   Prospectus/Proxy   Statement   as  the
"Reorganization."  As a result of the Reorganization,  each holder of Class A, B
and C Shares of  European  Equity Fund will become the owner of Class A, B and C
Shares of International Capital Appreciation Fund having a total net asset value
equal to the total net asset  value of his or her  holdings  of Class A, B and C
Shares in European Equity Fund on the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined).    

     In   considering   the  proposed   Reorganization,   the  Board  took  into
consideration  a number of  factors,  including:  (1) the  compatibility  of the
International  Capital  Appreciation  Fund's  and  the  European  Equity  Fund's
investment  objectives,  policies  and  limitations;  (2) the greater  potential
long-term viability of the International Capital Appreciation Fund; (3) the fact
that the Reorganization  provides for continuity of distribution and shareholder
servicing arrangements;  and (4) that the proposed Reorganization will result in
lower fees for the European Equity Fund shareholders as a result of economies of
scale achieved by the spreading of operating costs over a larger asset base.    

     The Board  concluded to  recommend  that the  shareholders  of the European
Equity Fund vote to approve the Reorganization. Pursuant to Rule 17a-8 under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, ("1940 Act"), the Board, including a majority of
the Directors who are not interested  persons,  determined that participation in
the  transaction  was in  the  best  interests  of the  European  Equity  Fund's
shareholders   and  that  the  interests  of  existing   European   Equity  Fund
shareholders would not be diluted as a result of effecting the transaction.     

     The  Board  likewise   approved  the   Reorganization   on  behalf  of  the
International  Capital  Appreciation Fund. Pursuant to Rule 17a-8 under the 1940
Act, the Board,  including a majority of the  Directors  who are not  interested
persons,  determined  that  participation  in the  transaction  was in the  best
interests of the International Capital Appreciation Fund's shareholders and that
the interests of existing  International  Capital Appreciation Fund shareholders
would not be diluted as a result of effecting the transaction.                  

     As a condition to the Reorganization,  each Fund will receive an opinion of
counsel that the Reorganization  will be considered a tax-free  "reorganization"
under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, so
that no gain or loss will be  recognized  by either Fund or the European  Equity
Fund's  shareholders.  The tax basis of the shares of the International  Capital
Appreciation Fund received by European Equity Fund shareholders will be the same
as the tax  basis  of  their  shares  in the  European  Equity  Fund.           

Purchase, Redemption and Exchange Procedures; Dividends and Distributions       

     Procedures  for the purchase,  redemption  and exchange of Class A, B and C
Shares  of  the  International   Capital  Appreciation  Fund  are  identical  to
procedures  applicable to the purchase and redemption of Class A, B and C Shares
of the European Equity Fund. The dividend and distribution policies of the Funds
are also  identical.  For a  complete  description,  refer  to the  accompanying
Prospectus of the International  Capital Appreciation Fund. Any questions may be
directed  to the  International  Capital  Appreciation  Fund at  1-800-341-7400.
Comparison of  Investment  Objectives  and Policies  Investment  objective.  The
European Equity Fund and the International  Capital  Appreciation Fund share the
same  investment  objective,  which is to provide  long-term  growth of capital.
Investment  exposure  provided  by each Fund.  Both Funds  invest  primarily  in
securities of foreign companies. However, the International Capital Appreciation
Fund  primarily  invests in both the  developed  and emerging  market  countries
throughout  the world  while the  European  Equity  Fund  primarily  invests  in
securities issued by European  companies.  Normally,  the European Equity Fund's
portfolio  consists  primarily  of  equity  securities  of the  larger  and more
developed countries within Europe (such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy and
Germany).  However,  the  European  Equity Fund can  emphasize  investment  in a
particular country within Europe,  including emerging markets, from time to time
when conditions in a country or particular  opportunities  are attractive to the
Adviser.                                                                        

Role of active management. Both the European Equity Fund and the International  
Capital Appreciation Fund are actively managed. This means that the Adviser's   
goal is for its stock selection skill to drive each Fund's performance. The     
Adviser actively manages the European Equity Fund, seeking total returns in     
excess of a benchmark index, the MSCI-Europe. The Adviser also actively manages 
the International Capital Appreciation Fund, seeking total returns in excess of 
the MSCI All Country World Index Free Ex. U.S. Adviser's stock selection        
process. The Adviser's process for selecting investments combines different     
analytical and valuation techniques according to investment style. In the growth
style, the Adviser seeks to purchase stocks of companies that it expects will   
rapidly increase earnings or cash flows in the future. The Adviser selects      
growth stocks through fundamental research and analysis of companies (bottom-up 
research). While the Adviser also considers the potential impact of economic and
market cycles (top-down) in various markets, bottom-up research is the primary  
driver of stock selection because the Adviser believes this approach provides a 
greater opportunity for its expertise, experience and skill to create excess    
returns. The Adviser's key buy criteria for a growth stock include quality of   
company management, industry leadership, high growth in sales and earnings, and 
reasonable valuation.                                                           

In the value style,  the Adviser seeks to purchase  undervalued  stocks that the
Adviser expects may significantly increase in price as the market recognizes the
company's true value. The Adviser identifies value stocks by first screening the
universe of available  stocks to identify those  companies  with  relatively low
price/book  value  or  price/earnings  ratios,  as well as other  indicators  of
relative value, such as dividend yield. After identifying investment candidates,
the Adviser  performs  fundamental  research and analysis to select stocks.  The
Adviser's  key buy  criteria  for a value stock  include  relatively  low market
price,  quality of company  management,  industry  leadership  and presence of a
catalyst for higher market valuation.                                           

The  Adviser  employs a team  approach  to  fundamental  analysis.  The  Adviser
continuously  seeks to identify  the  countries,  sectors and  industries  where
fundamental  analysis  is most  effective  at  forecasting  returns  and then to
develop expertise in those areas.  Analysts and portfolio managers specialize in
different  sectors  and  industries,  and  then  support  each  other  in  stock
selection.  Based  on  this  analytical  support,  the  portfolio  manager  then
independently makes stock selection decisions.                                  

By  blending  growth and value  styles,  the  Adviser  seeks to provide  capital
appreciation  with lower overall  portfolio  volatility than a portfolio of only
growth   stocks.   The   Adviser   attempts  to  manage  the  risk  of  relative
underperformance of the stocks of growth companies in down markets by seeking to
purchase growth stocks at reasonable prices.                                    

While the Adviser does not take concentrated positions in individual stocks, the
Adviser  may  emphasize  business  sectors  or certain  countries  in the Fund's
portfolio  because  they  exhibit  stronger  growth  potential,  or the  Adviser
believes it has greater  skill (or  fundamental  analysis is more  effective) in
picking  stocks in those  sectors or  countries.  Risk  management.  In both the
European  Equity  Fund and the  International  Capital  Appreciation  Fund,  the
Adviser manages the portfolio's  exposure to random or unpredictable events that
may  adversely  affect  individual  companies,  or the risk that the  Adviser is
otherwise  wrong in its analysis of any particular  company,  through  portfolio
diversification. In both Funds, the Adviser attempts to manage the relative risk
of underperformance of the stocks of growth companies in down markets by seeking
to purchase growth stocks at reasonable prices.                                 

Investment  constraints.  Neither the European Equity Fund nor the International
Capital  Appreciation  Fund is  limited in the  portion  of its  assets  that it
invests in foreign  companies based in either  developed  markets or in emerging
markets. Further, neither Fund is limited in the portion of its investments that
are denominated in either foreign  currency or in U.S.  dollars.  Both Funds may
hedge a portion of their currency risk by using  derivatives  such as futures or
forward  contracts.  Currency  hedges can protect  against price  movements in a
security that a Fund owns that are  attributable  to changes in the value of the
currency in which the security is denominated. Hedging may reduce gains or cause
losses to the Fund if the hedged  currency moves in a different  manner than the
Adviser  anticipated  or if the  cost of the  hedge  outweighs  its  value.  The
majority of both Funds'  portfolios have not been hedged and have therefore been
subject to currency risk, and it anticipated  that this will remain the case for
the International Capital Appreciation Fund. Comparison of Risks                

Both Funds are subject to the risk of general stock market volatility, investing
in foreign  securities and foreign  currency risks.  The  International  Capital
Appreciation Fund, however, is subject to emerging market risk and small company
risks to a greater  extent than the  European  Equity  Fund,  while the European
Equity Fund is subject to a greater degree to European Monetary Union risks than
the International Capital Appreciation Fund.

annual  total  returns  of  Class A Shares  of  European  Equity  Fund as of the
calendar  year-end  for each of five years.  The `y' axis  reflects the "% Total
Return"  beginning  with  "-50.00%" and increasing in increments of 50.00% up to
150.00%. The `x' axis represents  calculation periods from the earliest calendar
year end of the  Fund's  start of  business  through  the  calendar  year  ended
December 31, 2003. The light gray shaded chart  features five distinct  vertical
bars,  each shaded in charcoal,  and each  visually  representing  by height the
total return  percentages for the calendar year stated directly at its base. The
calculated total return percentage for the Class A Shares for each calendar year
is stated  directly at the bottom of each respective bar, for the calendar years
1997 through 2003. The percentages noted are: 17.96%, 21.68%, 27.59%, (13.77) %,
(25.95) %, (21.21) %, and 30.52%, respectively.                                 

The total returns shown in the bar chart do not reflect the payment of any sales
charges or recurring shareholder account fees. If these charges or fees had been
included, the returns shown would have been lower.                              

For the  period  January  25,  1994 to March  28,  2003,  the Fund was named the
Federated European Growth Fund and was managed primarily using a growth style of
investing.  The  graphic  presentation  displayed  here  consists of a bar chart
representing   the  annual  total   returns  of  Class  A  Shares  of  Federated
International Capital Appreciation Fund, as of the calendar year-end for each of
four years. The `y' axis reflects the "% Total Return"  beginning with "-40.00%"
and  increasing in increments  of 40.00% up to 80.00%.  The `x' axis  represents
calculation  periods from the earliest  calendar year end of the Fund's start of
business  through the calendar  year ended  December  31,  2003.  The light gray
shaded chart features four distinct vertical bars, each shaded in charcoal,  and
each  visually  representing  by height  the total  return  percentages  for the
calendar  year  stated  directly  at  its  base.  The  calculated  total  return
percentage  for the Class A Shares for each calendar year is stated  directly at
the bottom of each respective bar, for the calendar years 1998 through 2003. The
percentages noted are: 0.49%, 63.54%, (26.50)%,  (25.60)%, (16.06)%, and 36.01%,
respectively.                                                                   

The total  returns  shown in the bar charts do not  reflect  the  payment of any
sales  charges or recurring  shareholder  account fees. If these charges or fees
had been included, the returns shown would have been lower.                     

For the period January 25, 1994 to August 7, 2002, the Fund was named  Federated
International Growth Fund and was managed in a fund of funds format.            

European Equity Fund's Class A Shares total return for the six-month period from
January 1, 2004 to June 30, 2004 was (0.95)%.                                   

International  Capital  Appreciation  Fund's Class A Shares total return for the
six-month period from January 1, 2004 to June 30, 2004 was 1.65%.               

Listed below are the highest and lowest quarterly returns for the International 
Capital Appreciation Fund and the European Equity Fund for the periods shown in 
the bar chart above. The Highest and Lowest Quarterly Returns of the Funds for  
performance prior to March 3, 2003 and August 7, 2002, was not necessarily      
consistent with its subsequent performance because the results reflect the      
performance when the European Equity Fund was operated as the European Growth   
Fund and the International Capital Appreciation Fund was operated as the        
International Growth Fund.

Average Annual Total Return Tables                                              

     The Average  Annual  Total  Returns  for each Fund's  Shares are reduced to
reflect  applicable sales charges.  Remember,  you will not be charged any sales
charges in connection with the  reorganization  of the European Equity Fund into
the International  Capital Appreciation Fund. Returns Before Taxes are shown for
all  Classes of each Fund.  In  addition  Return  After  Taxes is shown for each
Fund's Class A Shares to  illustrate  the effect of federal taxes on each Fund's
returns.  Actual  after-tax  returns  depend  on each  investor's  personal  tax
situation,  and are  likely to differ  from  those  shown.  The table also shows
returns for the MSCI-Europe  and the MSCI-ACWI Free Ex. U.S.,  both  broad-based
market indexes.                                                                 

Total returns for the indexes shown do not reflect  sales  charges,  expenses or
other fees that the SEC requires to be reflected  in a Fund's  performance.  The
indexes are unmanaged, and it is not possible to invest directly in an index.

1.   The  European  Equity  Fund's  Class A, Class B and Class C Shares start of
performance dates was February 28, 1996.                              

2.   Prior to March 28, 2003,  the  European  Equity  Fund's name was  Federated
European Growth Fund.                                                 

3.   After-tax  returns are calculated using a standard set of assumptions.  The
     stated  returns  assume the highest  historical  federal income and capital
     gains tax rates.  Return After Taxes on  Distributions  assumes a continued
     investment  in a Fund and shows the effect of taxes on Fund  distributions.
     Return  After Taxes on  Distributions  and Sale of Fund Shares  assumes all
     shares were redeemed at the end of each measurement  period,  and shows the
     effect of any taxable gain (or offsetting  loss) on redemption,  as well as
     the effects of taxes on Fund distributions.  These after-tax returns do not
     reflect  the  effect of any  applicable  state and local  taxes.  After-tax
     returns  for Class B Shares and Class C Shares will differ from those shown
     above for Class A Shares.  After-tax  returns are not relevant to investors
    holding Shares through tax-deferred programs, such as IRA or 401(k) plans.

4.   The International  Capital Appreciation Fund's Class A, Class B and Class C
Shares start of performance date was July 1, 1997.

4   During the year, the Fund was reimbursed by the Adviser for certain 
      losses on investments, which had an impact of less than 0.01% on total
return. (Note 7)                                                
5   Computed on an annualized basis.                                    
  6 This voluntary expense decrease is reflected in both the expense and the
net investment income (loss) ratios shown above.                        

See Notes which are an integral part of the Financial Statements        

Service Fees, Advisory Fees and Expense Ratios                                  
        The maximum annual investment advisory fee for the International Capital
Appreciation Fund is 1.25% of average daily net assets. The maximum annual      
investment advisory fee for the European Equity Fund is 1.00% of average daily  
net assets. The shareholder servicing fee of 0.25% for the Funds is identical.  
       For its fiscal year ending November 30, 2004, the International Capital
Appreciation Fund's projected ratio of expenses to average daily net assets is  
1.65% for Class A Shares, and 2.40% for both Class B Shares and Class C Shares. 
Absent voluntary waivers and reimbursement, the projected ratio of expenses to  
average daily net assets would be 2.90% for Class A Shares and 3.40% for Class B
Shares and Class C Shares of the International Capital Appreciation Fund.       
        For its fiscal year ending November 30, 2003, the European Equity Fund's
expenses actually paid were equivalent to a ratio of expenses to average net    
assets of 2.50% for Class A Shares, and 3.25% for both Class B Shares and Class 
C Shares. Absent voluntary waivers and reimbursement, the projected ratio of    
expenses to average daily net assets would be 3.66% for Class A Shares and 4.16%
for both Class B Shares and Class C Shares.                                     
        Both the European Equity Fund and the International Capital Appreciation
Fund have the ability to pay a Rule 12b-1 fee. The Rule 12b-1 fee as a          
percentage of average daily net assets of each Fund is 0.25% for Class A Shares,
0.75% for Class B Shares, and 0.75% for Class C Shares. For the fiscal year     
ended November 30, 2003, the Funds did not pay or accrue the 12b-1 fee for Class
A Shares and the Funds have no present intention of paying or accruing their    
12b-1 fee for Class A Shares during the fiscal year ending November 30, 2004.   
INFORMATION ABOUT THE REORGANIZATION
Comparison of Investment Objectives, Policies and Limitations                   
  The Funds share the same investment objective, which is to provide
long-term growth of capital. The European Equity Fund pursues its investment    
objective by investing primarily in equity securities of European companies,    
while the International Capital Appreciation Fund pursues its investment        
objective by investing primarily in equity securities of companies based in     
foreign countries.                                                              
   The fundamental investment limitations of the International Capital
Appreciation Fund and the European Equity Fund are identical. For a more in     
depth comparison of investment objectives, policies and limitations, see        
"Comparison of Investment Objectives and Policies." Description of the Plan of  
Reorganization                                                                  
       The Plan provides that on or about the Closing Date (presently expected
to be on or about October 22, 2004) the International Capital Appreciation Fund 
will acquire all of the assets of the European Equity Fund in exchange for Class
A, B and C Shares of the International Capital Appreciation Fund to be          
distributed pro rata by the European Equity Fund to holders of its Class A, B   
and C Shares, respectively, in complete liquidation and termination of the      
European Equity Fund. Shareholders of the European Equity Fund will become      
shareholders of the International Capital Appreciation Fund as of 4:00 p.m.     
(Eastern time) on the Closing Date and will begin accruing dividends on the next
day. Shares of the International Capital Appreciation Fund received by European 
Equity Fund shareholders as part of the Reorganization will not be subject to a 
sales load.                                                                     
   Consummation of the Reorganization is subject to the conditions set
forth in the Plan, including receipt of an opinion in form and substance        
satisfactory to the Corporation, as described under the caption "Federal Income
Tax Consequences" below. The Plan may be terminated and the Reorganization may  
be abandoned at any time before or after approval by shareholders of the        
European Equity Fund prior to the Closing Date by the Corporation if it believes
that consummation of the Reorganization would not be in the best interests of   
the shareholders of either Fund.                                                
      The Adviser will bear the expenses related to the Reorganization. Such
expenses include, but are not limited to: legal fees; registration fees;        
transfer taxes (if any); the fees of banks and transfer agents; and the costs of
preparing, printing, copying, and mailing proxy solicitation materials to the   
European Equity Fund's shareholders and the costs of holding the special meeting
of shareholders.                                                                
The foregoing brief summary of the Plan entered into between the
International Capital Appreciation Fund and the European Equity Fund is         
qualified in its entirety by the terms and provisions of the Plan, a copy of    
which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference.

Federal Income Tax Consequences                                                 
     As a condition to the Reorganization, the Corporation will receive an
opinion of counsel to the Corporation, to the effect that, on the basis of the  
existing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the       
"Code"), current administrative rules and court decisions, for federal income   
tax purposes:                                                                   
o       the Reorganization as set forth in the Plan will constitute a tax-free  
        reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code, and the European Equity
   Fund and the International Capital Appreciation Fund each will be a
       "party to a reorganization" within the meaning of section 368(b) of the
Code;                                                           
o       no gain or loss will be recognized by the International Capital         
       Appreciation Fund upon its receipt of the European Equity Fund's assets
in exchange for International Capital Appreciation Fund shares; 
o       no gain or loss will be recognized by the European Equity Fund upon     
        transfer of its assets to the International Capital Appreciation Fund in
       exchange for International Capital Appreciation Fund shares or upon the
     distribution of the International Capital Appreciation Fund shares to
      the European Equity Fund's shareholders in exchange for their European
Equity Fund shares;                                             
o       no gain or loss will be recognized by shareholders of the European      
  Equity Fund upon exchange of their European Equity Fund shares for
International Capital Appreciation Fund shares;                 
o       the tax basis of the assets of the European Equity Fund acquired by the 
   International Capital Appreciation Fund will be the same as the tax
     basis of such assets to the European Equity Fund immediately prior to
the Reorganization;                                             
o       the aggregate tax basis of shares of the International Capital          
     Appreciation Fund received by each shareholder of the European Equity
     Fund pursuant to the Reorganization will be the same as the aggregate
tax basis of the shares of the European Equity Fund held by such
shareholder immediately prior to the Reorganization;            
o       the holding period of the European Equity Fund's assets in the hands of 
   the International Capital Appreciation Fund will include the period
    during which those assets were held by the European Equity Fund; and
o       the holding period of International Capital Appreciation Fund shares    
        received by each shareholder of the European Equity Fund pursuant to the
  Plan will include the period during which the European Equity Fund
      shares exchanged therefore were held by such shareholder, provided the
      European Equity Fund shares were held as capital assets on the date of
the Reorganization.                                             
      The foregoing opinion may state that no opinion is expressed as to the
effect of the Reorganization on the International Capital Appreciation Fund, the
European Equity Fund or the European Equity Fund's shareholders with respect to 
any asset as to which unrealized gain or loss is required to be recognized for  
federal income tax purposes at the end of a taxable year (or on the termination 
or transfer thereof) under a mark-to-market system of accounting.               
 Shareholders of the European Equity Fund should consult their tax
advisors regarding the effect, if any, of the Reorganization in light of their  
individual circumstances. Because the foregoing discussion only relates to the  
federal income tax consequences of the Reorganization, those shareholders also  
should consult their tax advisors about state and local tax consequences, if    
any, of the Reorganization.

Legal Proceedings                                                               

   Like many other mutual fund companies, in September 2003, Federated
Investors, Inc., the parent company of the Federated funds' advisers and        
distributor (collectively, "Federated"), received detailed requests for         
information on shareholder trading activities in the Federated funds ("Funds")  
from the SEC, the New York State Attorney General, and the National Association 
of Securities Dealers. Since that time, Federated has received additional       
inquiries from regulatory authorities on these and related matters, and more    
such inquiries may be received in the future.                                   
      As a result of these inquiries, Federated and the Funds have conducted
an internal investigation of the matters raised, which revealed instances in    
which a few investors were granted exceptions to Federated's internal procedures
for limiting frequent transactions and that one of these investors made an      
additional investment in another Federated fund. The investigation has also     
identified inadequate procedures which permitted a limited number of investors  
(including several employees) to engage in undetected frequent trading          
activities and/or the placement and acceptance of orders to purchase shares of  
fluctuating net asset value funds after the funds' closing times. Federated has 
issued a series of press releases describing these matters in greater detail and
emphasizing that it is committed to compensating the Funds for any detrimental  
impact these transactions may have had on them. In that regard, on February 3,
2004, Federated and the independent directors of the Funds announced the        
establishment by Federated of a restoration fund that is intended to cover any  
such detrimental impact. The press releases and related communications are      
available in the "About Us" section of Federated's website
www.federatedinvestors.com, and any future press releases on this subject will  
also be posted there.                                                           
  Shortly after Federated's first public announcement concerning the
foregoing matters, and notwithstanding Federated's commitment to taking remedial
actions, Federated and various Funds were named as defendants in several class  
action lawsuits now pending in the United States District Court for the District
of Maryland seeking damages of unspecified amounts. The lawsuits were           
purportedly filed on behalf of people who purchased, owned and/or redeemed      
shares of Federated-sponsored mutual funds during specified periods beginning   
November 1, 1998. The suits are generally similar in alleging that Federated    
engaged in illegal and improper trading practices including market timing and   
late trading in concert with certain institutional traders, which allegedly     
caused financial injury to the mutual fund shareholders.                        
 Federated and various Funds have also been named as defendants in
several additional lawsuits, the majority of which are now pending in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging, among 
other things, excessive advisory and rule 12b-1 fees, and seeking damages of    
unspecified amounts.                                                            
      The board of the Funds has retained the law firm of Dickstein, Shapiro
Morin & Oshinsky LLP to represent the Funds in these lawsuits. Federated and the
Funds, and their respective counsel, are reviewing the allegations and will     
respond appropriately. Additional lawsuits based upon similar allegations may be
filed in the future. The potential impact of these recent lawsuits and future   
potential similar suits is uncertain. Although we do not believe that these     
lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Funds, there can be no      
assurance that these suits, the ongoing adverse publicity and/or other          
developments resulting from the regulatory investigations will not result in    
increased Fund redemptions, reduced sales of Fund shares, or other adverse      
consequences for the Funds.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT
 SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------   

About the Proxy Solicitation and the Meeting                                    
     Proxies are being solicited by the Board, on behalf of its portfolio,
the European Equity Fund. The proxies will be voted at the special meeting of   
shareholders of the Corporation to be held on October 22, 2004 at 5800 Corporate
Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15237-7000, at 2:00 p.m. (such special meeting  
and any adjournment or postponement thereof are referred to as the "Special     
Meeting").                                                                      
   The cost of the solicitation, including the printing and mailing of
proxy materials, will be borne by the Adviser. In addition to solicitations     
through the mails, proxies may be solicited by officers, employees, and agents  
of the Corporation or, if necessary, a communications firm retained for this    
purpose. Such solicitations may be by telephone, telegraph, through the Internet
or otherwise. Any telephonic solicitations will follow procedures designed to   
ensure accuracy and prevent fraud, including requiring identifying shareholder  
information, recording the shareholder's instructions, and confirming to the    
shareholder after the fact. Shareholders who communicate proxies by telephone or
by other electronic means have the same power and authority to issue, revoke, or
otherwise change their voting instructions as shareholders submitting proxies in
written form. The Corporation may reimburse custodians, nominees, and           
fiduciaries for the reasonable costs incurred by them in connection with        
forwarding solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of shares held of    
record by such persons.                                                         
   The purpose of the Special Meeting is set forth in the accompanying
Notice. The Board knows of no business other than that mentioned in the Notice  
that will be presented for consideration at the Special Meeting. Should other   
business properly be brought before the Special Meeting, proxies will be voted  
in accordance with the best judgment of the persons named as proxies. This      
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card are expected to be mailed
on or about September 8, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of        
business on August 23, 2004 (the "Record Date").                                
  The International Capital Appreciation Fund's annual report, which
includes audited financial statements for its fiscal year ended November 30,
2003, was previously mailed to shareholders. The semi-annual reports for the    
European Equity Fund and the International Capital Appreciation Fund, which     
contain unaudited financial statements for the periods ended May 31, 2004, were 
also previously mailed to shareholders. The Corporation will promptly provide,  
without charge and upon request, to each person to whom this Prospectus/Proxy   
Statement is delivered, a copy of the annual reports and/or the semi-annual     
reports for the International Capital Appreciation Fund and the European Equity 
Fund. Requests for annual reports or semi-annual reports for the International  
Capital Appreciation Fund and the European Equity Fund may be made by writing to
the Corporation's principal executive offices or by calling the Corporation. The
Corporation's principal executive offices are located at Federated Investors    
Funds, 5800 Corporate Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15237-7000. The           
Corporation's toll-free telephone number is 1-800-341-7400.                     
Proxies, Quorum and Voting at the Special Meeting                               
       Only shareholders of record on the Record Date will be entitled to vote
at the Special Meeting. Each share of the Corporation is entitled to one vote.  
Fractional shares are entitled to proportionate shares of one vote.             
      Any person giving a proxy has the power to revoke it any time prior to
its exercise by executing a superseding proxy or by submitting a written notice 
of revocation to the Secretary of the Corporation. In addition, although mere   
attendance at the Special Meeting will not revoke a proxy, a shareholder present
at the Special Meeting may withdraw his or her proxy and vote in person. All    
properly executed and unrevoked proxies received in time for the Special Meeting
will be voted in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxies. If  
no instruction is given on the proxy, the persons named as proxies will vote the
shares represented thereby in favor of the matter set forth in the attached     
Notice.                                                                         
        In order to hold the Special Meeting, a "quorum" of shareholders must be
present. Holders of one-third of the total number of outstanding shares of the  
European Equity Fund, present in person or by proxy, shall be required to       
constitute a quorum for the purpose of voting on the proposals.                 
    For purposes of determining a quorum for transacting business at the
Special Meeting, abstentions and broker "non-votes" (that is, proxies from      
brokers or nominees indicating that such persons have not received instructions 
from the beneficial owner or other persons entitled to vote shares on a         
particular matter with respect to which the brokers or nominees do not have     
discretionary power) will be treated as shares that are present but which have  
not been voted. For this reason, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the 
effect of a "no" vote for purposes of obtaining the requisite approval of each  
proposal.                                                                       
       If a quorum is not present, the persons named as proxies may vote those
proxies that have been received to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date. 
In the event that a quorum is present but sufficient votes in favor of the      
proposal have not been received, the persons named as proxies may propose one or
more adjournments of the Special Meeting to permit further solicitations of     
proxies with respect to the proposal. All such adjournments will require the    
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at   
the session of the Special Meeting to be adjourned. The persons named as proxies
will vote AGAINST an adjournment those proxies that they are required to vote   
against the proposal, and will vote in FAVOR of such an adjournment all other   
proxies that they are authorized to vote. A shareholder vote may be taken on the
proposal in this Prospectus/Proxy Statement prior to any such adjournment if    
sufficient votes have been received for approval.                               
      Shareholder approval requires the affirmative vote of more than 50% of
the shares of the European Equity Fund entitled to vote.

of the Corporation.                                                             

OTHER MATTERS AND DISCRETION OF ATTORNEYS NAMED IN THE PROXY

     The  Corporation  is not  required,  and does not intend,  to hold  regular
annual meetings of  shareholders.  Shareholders  wishing to submit proposals for
consideration for inclusion in a Prospectus/Proxy Statement for the next meeting
of  shareholders   should  send  their  written  proposals  to  Federated  World
Investment  Series,  Inc.,  Federated  Investors  Funds,  5800 Corporate  Drive,
Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania 15237-7000,  so  that  they  are  received  within  a

     No  business  other than the  matters  described  above is expected to come
before the  Special  Meeting,  but should any other  matter  requiring a vote of
shareholders arise,  including any question as to an adjournment or postponement
of the Special  Meeting,  the persons named on the enclosed proxy card will vote
on such  matters  according  to their  best  judgment  in the  interests  of the
Corporation.

       John W. McGonigle
Secretary 
August 25, 2004
                                                                       EXHIBIT A
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF  REORGANIZATION  (the "Agreement") is made as of
this 6th day of August,  2004, by and between Federated World Investment Series,
Inc.,  a Maryland  corporation,  with its  principal  place of  business at 5800
Corporate Drive, Pittsburgh, PA, 15237 (the "Corporation"),  with respect to its
Federated  International  Capital  Appreciation  Fund (the "Acquiring  Fund"), a
series of the  Corporation,  and Federated  World  Investment  Series,  Inc., on
behalf of its portfolio Federated European Equity Fund (the "Acquired Fund" and,
collectively  with the Acquiring  Fund,  the  "Funds"),  also with its principal
place of business at 5800 Corporate Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15237-7000. 

     This   Agreement  is  intended  to  be,  and  is  adopted  as,  a  plan  of
reorganization  within the meaning of Section 368 of the United States  Internal
Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended  (the  "Code") and the  Treasury  Regulations
promulgated thereunder.  The reorganization will consist of: (i) the transfer of
all of the assets of the Acquired  Fund in exchange for Class A Shares,  Class B
Shares and Class C Shares,  $0.001 par value per share,  of the  Acquiring  Fund
("Acquiring Fund Shares");  and (ii) the distribution of Class A Shares, Class B
Shares and Class C Shares of the  Acquiring  Fund to the  holders of the Class A
Shares,  Class B Shares and Class C Shares of the Acquired  Fund,  respectively,
and the liquidation of the Acquired Fund as provided herein,  all upon the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "Reorganization").              

     WHEREAS,  the Acquiring  Fund and the Acquired Fund are separate  series of
the Corporation,  respectively,  and the Corporation is an open-end,  registered
management  investment  company  and the  Acquired  Fund  owns  securities  that
generally are assets of the  character in which the Acquiring  Fund is permitted
to invest;                                                                      

     WHEREAS,  the Acquiring  Fund and the Acquired Fund each are  authorized to
issue their shares of capital stock;                                            

     WHEREAS,  the  Directors  of  the  Corporation  have  determined  that  the
Reorganization,  with respect to the Acquiring Fund, is in the best interests of
the Acquiring  Fund and that the interests of the existing  shareholders  of the
Acquiring Fund will not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization;           

     WHEREAS,  the  Directors  of  the  Corporation  have  determined  that  the
Reorganization,  with respect to the Acquired  Fund, is in the best interests of
the Acquired  Fund and that the  interests of the existing  shareholders  of the
Acquired Fund will not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization;            

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration of the premises and of the covenants and
agreements  hereinafter  set forth,  the parties  hereto  covenant  and agree as
follows:                                                                        

Article I                                                                       

 TRANSFER OF ASSETS OF THE ACQUIRED FUND IN EXCHANGE FOR ACQUIRING FUND SHARES
AND LIQUIDATION OF THE ACQUIRED FUND

     1.1 THE EXCHANGE.  Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein and
on the  basis  of the  representations  and  warranties  contained  herein,  the
Acquired  Fund agrees to transfer  all of its assets,  as set forth in paragraph
1.2, to the Acquiring  Fund.  In exchange,  the  Acquiring  Fund agrees:  (i) to
deliver to the  Acquired  Fund the  number of each class of full and  fractional
Acquiring Fund Shares,  determined by (a) multiplying the shares  outstanding of
each class of the  Acquired  Fund by (b) the ratio  computed by dividing (x) the
net  asset  value per share of such  class of the  Acquired  Fund by (y) the net
asset  value per  share of the  corresponding  class of  Acquiring  Fund  Shares
computed in the manner and as of the time and date set forth in  paragraph  2.2.
Holders  of Class A Shares,  Class B Shares  and Class C Shares of the  Acquired
Fund  will  receive  Class A  Shares,  Class B Shares  and Class C Shares of the
Acquiring Fund. Such transactions shall take place at the closing on the Closing
Date provided for in paragraph 3.1.                                             

     1.2 ASSETS TO BE ACQUIRED.  The assets of the Acquired  Fund to be acquired
by the  Acquiring  Fund  shall  consist  of  all  property,  including,  without
limitation,  all  cash,  securities,   commodities,  interests  in  futures  and
dividends or interest receivable, owned by the Acquired Fund and any deferred or
prepaid  expenses  shown as an asset on the  books of the  Acquired  Fund on the
Closing Date.                                                                   

     The  Acquired  Fund has provided  the  Acquiring  Fund with its most recent
audited financial statements, which contain a list of all of the Acquired Fund's
assets as of the date of such  statements.  The Acquired Fund hereby  represents
that as of the date of the  execution  of this  Agreement,  there  have  been no
changes in its  financial  position as  reflected in such  financial  statements
other than those occurring in the ordinary course of business in connection with
the purchase and sale of  securities,  the issuance and  redemption  of Acquired
Fund shares and the payment of normal operating expenses,  dividends and capital
gains distributions.                                                            

     1.3  LIABILITIES TO BE DISCHARGED.  The Acquired Fund will discharge all of
its liabilities and obligations prior to the Closing Date.                      

     1.4 STATE FILINGS.  Prior to the Closing Date, the  Corporation  shall make
any filings  with the State of Maryland  that may be required  under the laws of
the State of Maryland, effective as of the Closing Date.                        

     1.5 LIQUIDATION AND  DISTRIBUTION.  On or as soon after the Closing Date as
is conveniently  practicable:  (a) the Acquired Fund will distribute in complete
liquidation  of the  Acquired  Fund,  pro rata to its  shareholders  of  record,
determined as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the  "Acquired  Fund
Shareholders"),  all of the Acquiring Fund Shares  received by the Acquired Fund
pursuant to paragraph 1.1; and (b) the Acquired Fund will  thereupon  proceed to
dissolve and  terminate as set forth in paragraph 1.9 below.  Such  distribution
will be  accomplished  by the transfer of Acquiring Fund Shares  credited to the
account of the Acquired Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts
on the share  records of the  Acquiring  Fund in the name of the  Acquired  Fund
Shareholders,  and representing the respective pro rata number of Acquiring Fund
Shares due such shareholders.  All issued and outstanding shares of the Acquired
Fund (the "Acquired Fund Shares") will  simultaneously  be canceled on the books
of  the  Acquired  Fund.  The  Acquiring  Fund  shall  not  issue   certificates

sold,  shall  be  closed  to  trading  or  trading  on such  exchange  shall  be
restricted;  or (b) trading or the reporting of trading on the NYSE or elsewhere
shall be disrupted so that accurate  appraisal of the value of the net assets of
the Acquiring Fund or the Acquired Fund is impracticable, the Closing Date shall
be  postponed  until the first  business day after the day when trading is fully
resumed and reporting is restored.

     duly organized,  validly  existing,  and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Maryland.                                                

b)   The Corporation is registered as an open-end management  investment company
     under the 1940 Act, and the Corporation's  registration with the Securities

     Act,  and the rules and  regulations  thereunder,  and do not  include  any
     untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omit to state any  material  fact
     required to be stated or necessary to make the statements therein, in light

d)   The Acquired Fund is not, and the execution,  delivery,  and performance of
     this Agreement  (subject to shareholder  approval) will not,  result in the
     violation of any provision of the  Corporation's  Articles of Incorporation
     or By-Laws or of any material agreement, indenture,  instrument,  contract,
     lease,  or other  undertaking  to which the Acquired  Fund is a party or by
which it is bound.                                                    

e)   The Acquired  Fund has no material  contracts or other  commitments  (other
     than this  Agreement)  that will be terminated  with liability to it before
     the Closing  Date,  except for  liabilities,  if any, to be  discharged  as
provided in paragraph 1.3 hereof.                                     

f)   Except as otherwise  disclosed in writing to and accepted by the  Acquiring
     Fund, no litigation,  administrative  proceeding,  or  investigation  of or
     before  any  court or  governmental  body is  presently  pending  or to its
     knowledge  threatened against the Acquired Fund or any of its properties or
     assets,  which,  if adversely  determined,  would  materially and adversely
     affect its financial condition, the conduct of its business, or the ability
     of the Acquired  Fund to carry out the  transactions  contemplated  by this
     Agreement.  The  Acquired  Fund knows of no facts that might form the basis
     for the institution of such proceedings and is not a party to or subject to
     the  provisions  of  any  order,  decree,  or  judgment  of  any  court  or
     governmental  body that could  materially and adversely affect its business
or its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein.    

g)   The financial  statements of the Acquired Fund as of November 30, 2003, and
     for the fiscal  year then  ended  have been  prepared  in  accordance  with
     generally accepted  accounting  principles,  and such statements (copies of
     which have been  furnished to the  Corporation  on behalf of the  Acquiring
     Fund) fairly  reflect the  financial  condition of the Acquired  Fund as of
     such date,  and there are no known  contingent  liabilities of the Acquired
Fund as of such date that are not disclosed in such statements.       

h)   The unaudited financial statements of the Acquired Fund as of May 31, 2004,

     generally accepted  accounting  principles,  and such statements (copies of
     which have been  furnished to the  Corporation  on behalf of the  Acquiring
     Fund) fairly reflect the financial condition of the Acquired Fund as of May
31, 2003,  and there are no known  contingent  liabilities  of the Acquired
Fund as of such date that are not disclosed in such statements.       

i)   Since the date of the  financial  statements  referred to in paragraph  (h)
     above,  there have been no material  adverse changes in the Acquired Fund's

     occurring in the ordinary  course of  business),  or any  incurrence by the
     Acquired  Fund of  indebtedness  maturing  more than one year from the date
     such  indebtedness  was  incurred,  except as  otherwise  disclosed  to and
     accepted  by the  Corporation  on behalf  of the  Acquiring  Fund.  For the
     purposes  of this  paragraph  (i), a decline in the net asset  value of the
Acquired Fund shall not constitute a material adverse change.         

j)   All federal and other tax returns and reports of the Acquired Fund required
     by law to be filed,  have been filed, and all federal and other taxes shown
     to be due on such returns and reports have been paid, or, if not paid as of
     the Closing Date,  provision shall have been made for the payment  thereof.
     To the best of the  Corporation's  knowledge,  no such return is  currently
     under  audit,  and no  assessment  has been  asserted  with respect to such
returns.                                                              

k)   All issued and outstanding shares of the Acquired Fund are duly and validly
     issued and outstanding, fully paid and non-assessable by the Acquired Fund.
     All of the issued and outstanding  shares of the Acquired Fund will, at the
     time of the  Closing  Date,  be held by the  persons and in the amounts set
     forth in the records of the Acquired  Fund's  transfer agent as provided in
     paragraph 3.4. The Acquired Fund has no outstanding options,  warrants,  or
     other rights to subscribe  for or purchase any of the Acquired Fund shares,
     and has no outstanding securities convertible into any of the Acquired Fund
shares.                                                               

l)   At the Closing Date, the Acquired Fund will have good and marketable  title
     to the Acquired  Fund's  assets to be  transferred  to the  Acquiring  Fund
     pursuant to paragraph  1.2, and full right,  power,  and authority to sell,
     assign,  transfer,  and deliver such assets hereunder,  free of any lien or
     other  encumbrance,  except  those  liens  or  encumbrances  to  which  the
     Acquiring Fund has received notice, and, upon delivery and payment for such
     assets,  and the filing of any articles,  certificates  or other  documents
     under the laws of the State of Maryland,  the  Acquiring  Fund will acquire
     good and marketable title,  subject to no restrictions on the full transfer
     of such assets,  other than such restrictions as might arise under the 1933
 Act, and other than as disclosed to and accepted by the Acquiring Fund.

     enforceable in accordance  with its terms,  subject as to  enforcement,  to
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and other laws relating
to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.   

n)   The  information  to be furnished by the Acquired Fund for use in no-action
     letters, applications for orders, registration statements, proxy materials,

     transactions  contemplated  herein  shall be accurate  and  complete in all
     material  respects and shall comply in all material  respects  with federal
securities and other laws and regulations.                            

o)   From the  effective  date of the  Registration  Statement  (as  defined  in
     paragraph  5.7),  through  the time of the  meeting  of the  Acquired  Fund
     Shareholders and on the Closing Date, any written information  furnished by

     untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or omit to  state a  material  fact
     required to be stated or necessary to make the statements,  in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading.  

p)   The Acquired  Fund has elected to qualify and has qualified as a "regulated
     investment  company"  under the Code (a  "RIC"),  as of and since its first
     taxable  year;  has been a RIC under the Code at all times since the end of
     its  first  taxable  year  when it so  qualified;  and  qualifies  and will
     continue  to qualify as a RIC under the Code for its  taxable  year  ending
upon its liquidation.                                                 

q)   No governmental consents, approvals, authorizations or filings are required
     under the 1933 Act, the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act"),
     the 1940 Act or Maryland  law for the  execution  of this  Agreement by the

FURTHER CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE
ACQUIRING FUND AND ACQUIRED FUND

     If any of the  conditions  set forth  below do not  exist on or before  the
Closing Date with respect to the Acquired Fund or the Acquiring  Fund, the other
party to this Agreement shall, at its option,  not be required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement:                                    

     8.1 This Agreement and the transactions  contemplated  herein, with respect
to the Acquired  Fund,  shall have been  approved by the  requisite  vote of the
holders  of the  outstanding  shares of the  Acquired  Fund in  accordance  with
applicable law and the provisions of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation
and By-Laws.  Certified copies of the resolutions evidencing such approval shall
have been delivered to the Acquiring  Fund.  Notwithstanding  anything herein to
the  contrary,  neither the  Acquiring  Fund nor the Acquired Fund may waive the
conditions set forth in this paragraph 8.1.                                     

     8.2  On  the  Closing  Date,  the  Commission  shall  not  have  issued  an
unfavorable  report  under  Section  25(b) of the 1940 Act,  or  instituted  any

by this Agreement under Section 25(c) of the 1940 Act.  Furthermore,  no action,
suit or other  proceeding  shall be  threatened  or pending  before any court or
governmental  agency in which it is sought to  restrain or  prohibit,  or obtain
damages or other relief in connection  with this  Agreement or the  transactions
contemplated herein.                                                            

     8.3 All required consents of other parties and all other consents,  orders,
and permits of federal,  state and local regulatory authorities (including those
of the Commission and of State securities  authorities,  including any necessary
"no-action"   positions  and  exemptive  orders  from  such  federal  and  state
authorities) to permit  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  herein
shall have been  obtained,  except  where  failure  to obtain any such  consent,
order,  or permit would not involve a risk of a material  adverse  effect on the
assets or properties of the Acquiring Fund or the Acquired  Fund,  provided that
either party hereto may waive any such conditions for itself.                   

     8.4 The  Registration  Statement shall have become effective under the 1933
Act, and no stop orders  suspending  the  effectiveness  thereof shall have been
issued. To the best knowledge of the parties to this Agreement, no investigation
or  proceeding  for that  purpose  shall  have been  instituted  or be  pending,
threatened or contemplated under the 1933 Act.                                  

     8.5 The  corporation  shall have  received an opinion of Dickstein  Shapiro
Morin & Oshinsky  LLP  substantially  to the effect that for federal  income tax
purposes:                                                                       

a)      The transfer of all of the Acquired Fund's assets to the Acquiring Fund 
solely in exchange for Acquiring Fund Shares (followed by the   
       distribution of Acquiring Fund Shares to the Acquired Fund Shareholders
      in dissolution and liquidation of the Acquired Fund) will constitute a
      "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and
   the Acquiring Fund and the Acquired Fund will each be a "party to a
 reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code.

b)      No gain or loss will be recognized by the Acquiring Fund upon the       
 receipt of the assets of the Acquired Fund solely in exchange for
Acquiring Fund Shares.                                          

c)      No gain or loss will be recognized by the Acquired Fund upon the        
      transfer of the Acquired Fund's assets to the Acquiring Fund solely in
    exchange for Acquiring Fund Shares or upon the distribution (whether
 actual or constructive) of Acquiring Fund Shares to Acquired Fund
Shareholders in exchange for their Acquired Fund Shares.        

d)      No gain or loss will be recognized by any Acquired Fund Shareholder upon
   the exchange of its Acquired Fund Shares for Acquiring Fund Shares.

e)      The aggregate tax basis of the Acquiring Fund Shares received by each   
    Acquired Fund Shareholder pursuant to the Reorganization will be the
      same as the aggregate tax basis of the Acquired Fund Shares held by it
        immediately prior to the Reorganization. The holding period of Acquiring
       Fund Shares received by each Acquired Fund Shareholder will include the
    period during which the Acquired Fund Shares exchanged therefor were
       held by such shareholder, provided the Acquired Fund Shares are held as
capital assets at the time of the Reorganization.               

f)      The tax basis of the Acquired Fund's assets acquired by the Acquiring   
     Fund will be the same as the tax basis of such assets to the Acquired
       Fund immediately prior to the Reorganization. The holding period of the
   assets of the Acquired Fund in the hands of the Acquiring Fund will
      include the period during which those assets were held by the Acquired
Fund.                                                           

Such opinion shall be based on customary assumptions and such   
        representations as Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky LLP may reasonably
        request, and the Acquired Fund and Acquiring Fund will cooperate to make
       and certify the accuracy of such representations. The foregoing opinion
may state that no opinion is expressed as to the effect of the  
       Reorganization on the Acquiring Fund, the Acquired Fund or any Acquired
      Fund Shareholder with respect to any asset as to which unrealized gain
        or loss is required to be reorganized for federal income tax purposes at
     the end of a taxable year (or on the termination or transfer thereof)
     under a mark-to-market system of accounting. Notwithstanding anything
        herein to the contrary, neither the Acquiring Fund nor the Acquired Fund
may waive the conditions set forth in this paragraph 8.5.       

Article IX                                                                      

EXPENSES

expenses associated with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Materials; (b) 
postage; (c) printing; (d) accounting fees; (e) legal fees incurred by each     
Fund; (f) solicitation costs of the transaction; and (g) other related          
administrative or operational costs.                                            

Article X                                                                       

ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SURVIVAL OF WARRANTIES

      10.1 The Corporation, on behalf of the Funds, agree that neither party
has made to the other party any representation, warranty and/or covenant not set
forth herein, and that this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between  
the parties.                                                                    

10.2 Except as specified in the next sentence set forth in this 
paragraph 10.2, the representations, warranties, and covenants contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to or in connection with this   
Agreement, shall not survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated  
hereunder. The covenants to be performed after the Closing Date, shall continue 
in effect beyond the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder.   

Article XI                                                                      

 TERMINATION

   11.1 This Agreement may be terminated by the mutual agreement of the Funds.
In addition, each Fund may at its option terminate this Agreement at or before  
the Closing Date due to:                                                        

a)      a breach by the other of any representation, warranty, or agreement     
      contained herein to be performed at or before the Closing Date, if not
cured within 30 days;                                           

b)      a condition herein expressed to be precedent to the obligations of the  
      terminating party that has not been met and it reasonably appears that
it will not or cannot be met; or                                

c)      a determination by the Corporation's Board of Directors that the        
       consummation of the transactions contemplated herein is not in the best
interest of either Fund.                                        

11.2 In the event of any such termination, in the absence of willful    
default, there shall be no liability for damages on the part of either the      
Acquiring Fund, the Acquired Fund, the Corporation, or its Directors or         
officers.                                                                       

Article XII                                                                     

AMENDMENTS

     12.1 This Agreement may be amended, modified, or supplemented in such
manner as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by the officers of the         
Corporation as specifically authorized by its Board of Directors; provided,     
however, that following the meeting of the Acquired Fund Shareholders called by 
the Acquired Fund pursuant to paragraph 5.2 of this Agreement, no such amendment
may have the effect of changing the provisions for determining the number of    
Acquiring Fund Shares to be issued to the Acquired Fund Shareholders under this 
Agreement to the detriment of such shareholders without their further approval. 

Article XIII

 Notes to Pro Forma Financial Statements
Year Ended November 30, 2003

Basis of Combination                                                            

The accompanying unaudited Pro Forma Combining Portfolios of Investments,       
Statements of Assets and Liabilities and Statements of Operations ("Pro Forma   
Financial Statements") reflect the accounts of Federated European Equity Fund   
and Federated International Capital Appreciation Fund, collectively ("the       
Funds"), for the year ended November 30, 2003. These statements have been       
derived from the books and records utilized in calculating daily net asset      
values at November 30, 2003.                                                    

The Pro Forma Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the       
historical financial statements of the Funds which have been incorporated by    
reference in the Statement of Additional Information. The Funds follow generally
accepted accounting principles applicable to management investment companies    
which are disclosed in the historical financial statements of each fund.        

The Pro Forma Financial Statements give effect to the proposed transfer of      
assets of Federated European Equity Fund for shares of Federated International  
Capital Appreciation Fund. Under generally accepted accounting principles,      
Federated International Capital Appreciation Fund will be the surviving entity  
for accounting purposes with its historical cost of investment securities and   
results of operations being carried forward.                                    

The Pro Forma Financial Statements have been adjusted to reflect the anticipated
advisory fee arrangement for the surviving entity. Certain other operating costs
have also been adjusted to reflect anticipated expenses of the combined entity. 
Other costs which may change as a result of the reorganization are currently    
undeterminable.                                                                 

For the year ended November 30, 2003, Federated European Equity Fund and        
Federated International Capital Appreciation Fund paid investment advisory fees 
computed at the annual rate of 1.00% and 1.25% respectively as a percentage of  
average daily net assets.

Shares of Federated International Capital Appreciation Fund (accounting
