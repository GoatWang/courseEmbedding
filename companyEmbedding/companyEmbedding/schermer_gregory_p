 From AJR,   April/May 2005  An Enterprising Company   By  Lori Robertson   Lori Robertson (robertson.lori@gmail.com), a former AJR managing editor, is a senior contributing writer for the magazine.       







abortion pillabortion pillhttp://hughescounty.org/index.asp?q=abortion-pill&folderID=4&fileID=6 abortion pillTwelve years after Joseph Pulitzer had begun building his newspaper empire, another enterprising man began his. With help from local investors, A.W. (Alfred Wilson) Lee in 1890 started out small--very small--buying the 575-circulation Ottumwa Courier in Iowa. 
The paper was one of three dailies in Ottumwa back then, according to Lee Enterprises' company history, and its circulation increased by a whopping 545 percent to 3,709 in the next 10 years. Over the decades, the company continued to exhibit a penchant for hometown, Midwestern publications. 
The Lee family name disappeared from the company's personnel relatively early. Though Lee's daughter held controlling stock in the handful of papers he and associates owned, Lee, before his death, bequeathed operating control to two business colleagues, E.P. (Emanuel Philip) Adler and James F. Powell. 
In 1970, the company--which then included a collection of Montana papers as well as dailies in Wisconsin, Oregon, Illinois and Nebraska--went public. Three years later, Lloyd Schermer, husband of Betty Adler, granddaughter of E.P. Adler, became president and CEO and held those positions until 1991, staying on as chairman of the board of directors until January 2000. A Harvard business school graduate, Schermer had made the Missoulian in Montana into something of an environmental activist paper when he was publisher there from 1959 to 1970, running stories and editorials criticizing industrial practices that polluted the state's rivers. 
As president, Schermer says one of his goals was to keep the company independent. The fact that the Schermer family and some key friends own a large portion of the stock, he says, has enabled the company to avoid a takeover. 
Dick Gottlieb, a great-great nephew to E.P. Adler, served as CEO from 1991 to 2001. Gottlieb was the first to look outside the company and, notably, to the opposite sex, to find his successor in Mary Junck. She was in the process of leaving an executive vice president position at Times Mirror, where she oversaw the company's eastern newspapers in 1999. ("I left Times Mirror because I didn't think it was much fun," she says.) Gottlieb hired her as an executive vice president and chief operating officer that year. Junck became president the following year and started collecting titles, until she was also CEO and chairman by January 2002. 
Junck, 57, is universally admired for her enthusiasm and her down-to-earth personality. As Post-Dispatch senior writer Harry Levins says of the visit to St. Louis by Junck and other Lee executives, "they didn't come across as corporate slickies." 
Not in the least. Vice President of Interactive Media Gregory P. Schermer, the only corporate officer with a connection to the original family ownership, sums up what it's like to have Junck as a boss: "Working with Mary is fun," he says. "And I think one of the things that makes it fun to work with Mary and sets Mary apart as a leader is her genuine interest in soliciting and listening to the opinions of her team." 
Although Junck has a master's in journalism from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she got her start on the business side, as a marketing research manager at the Charlotte Observer in 1972. Her bio includes stints as publisher of the Baltimore Sun and St. Paul Pioneer Press. She just so happens to be an Iowa native, from the town of Ogden. 
Lee sold off some television properties under Gottlieb, let its Ottumwa paper go in 1999 and has grown rapidly in recent years. Junck has become Ms. Acquisitions since she took over, more than doubling the company's revenue in three years. The chain has focused on gobbling up newspapers of 30,000 circulation or more, a benchmark for papers that would have strong local markets, she says. 
Junck says she still seeks advice from Dick Gottlieb and Lloyd Schermer, though neither plays an official role in the company. Now retired and splitting his time between Colorado and Arizona, Schermer, 78, says the "mainstream press" may grab all those big-name prizes, but he cares about the difference Lee's "main street press" can make in a community. Building a reputation among the major players isn't a big deal to Schermer. "What's important is getting something done," he says. "In terms of putting out good local newspapers that have an impact on the local community, I think we're damn good at it. And we'll be even better under Mary."

If you had asked me to predict which brand would debut a new logo on its Fall 2017 runway, I wouldn't have guessed Fendi. The brand already has both an iconic logo print and logo hardware that longchamp outlet it has barely capitalized on during the recent resurgence of that look in the accessories market, but for Fall 2017, those things sit alongside the Fendi brand markers we all know and love from the 90s and mulberry replica handbags early 2000s. The new logo hardware is featured prominently on a slew of new flap bags, and it's an open circle with an F resting on its side at the bottom, as though it fell that way. The new replica designer handbags logo's best use by far is as the center of a flower made of leather petals on micro bags and bag charms, several of which made it to the runway alongside the larger bags. Fendi's Zucca logo fabric, which has long been mostly missing from the brand's bags, also figured prominently in several pieces, and now is the perfect time for it to be returning to favor among the label's bag designers.

Greg Schermer Takes Key Strategy Role in Lee Enterprises | Business Wire


























































Greg Schermer Takes Key Strategy Role in Lee Enterprises






October 05, 2012 09:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



DAVENPORT, Iowa--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In an expansion of digital leadership, Lee Enterprises, Incorporated 
      (NYSE: LEE), has called on top digital executive and longtime board 
      member Gregory P. Schermer to focus exclusively on strategic 
      opportunities for its 51 daily newspapers and digital media in 23 states.
    


      Mary Junck, Lee chairman and chief executive officer, said Schermer will 
      move from vice president of interactive media to a new position of vice 
      president of strategy.
    

      “With the exponential growth of digital opportunities, we look to Greg 
      as our chief horizon-watching expert,” she said. “His leadership has 
      made Lee an industry standout in digital initiatives and this new 
      position will allow him to devote his full efforts toward identifying 
      new and better ways to serve our audiences, advertisers and communities.”
    

      Among his responsibilities, she said, will be actively developing 
      strategic partnerships and seeking other opportunities that will help 
      Lee drive revenue and build digital audiences, as well as continuing to 
      represent Lee in significant collaborations that benefit the industry.
    

      She said the remainder of Schermer’s current responsibilities will be 
      assigned to another new position, vice president of digital development 
      and operations, also reporting directly to her and responsible for 
      creating and advancing digital products and services.
    

      “We believe this intensified focus on both the future and the present 
      will keep Lee at the forefront in harnessing digital opportunities,” she 
      said. “We expect to fill the new position quickly. Until then, Greg will 
      continue to oversee both strategy and development.”
    

      Schermer, 58, joined Lee in 1989 and has led Lee’s digital expansion 
      since 1998. He also served as corporate counsel from 1989 to 2006. He 
      became a member of the Lee board of directors in 1999. Before joining 
      Lee, he was a partner at the law firm of Hanson, O'Brien, Birney and 
      Butler in Washington, D.C. He received a bachelor of arts degree from 
      Amherst College in Massachusetts and a juris doctorate degree from 
      Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1980.
    

      Among many industry contributions, he helped found The Newspaper 
      Consortium, a group of 30 companies that represent nearly 800 
      newspapers, helping advertisers reach local audiences. He serves on the 
      NAA Digital Advisory Committee. He also serves on the board of Lee's 
      digital subsidiary, Townnews.com, 
      an online service provider to more than 1,500 community and weekly 
      newspapers. Among community activities in Davenport, he is chairman of 
      the RCPA Board, the owner of the Adler Theatre, and a board and 
      executive committee member of the Quad Cities Symphony Orchestra.
    

      “I’m delighted to focus my efforts to assist our board, management team 
      and enterprises to identify new products, partnerships and digital 
      services, and new ways of delivering them,” he said. “As the pace of 
      digital technology change continues to accelerate, so do the 
      opportunities and pressures to innovate. It’s an exciting time for our 
      industry.”
    

      Lee Enterprises is a leading provider of local news and information, and 
      a major platform for advertising, in its markets, with 47 daily 
      newspapers and a joint interest in four others, rapidly growing digital 
      products and nearly 300 specialty publications in 23 states. Lee's 
      newspapers have circulation of 1.3 million daily and 1.5 million Sunday, 
      reaching nearly four million readers in print alone. Lee's websites and 
      mobile and tablet products attracted 22.2 million unique visitors in 
      June 2012. Lee's markets include St. Louis, MO; Lincoln, NE; Madison, 
      WI; Davenport, IA; Billings, MT; Bloomington, IL; and Tucson, AZ. Lee 
      Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol 
      LEE. For more information about Lee, please visit www.lee.net.
