AllianzGI to acquire Sound Harbor Partners


Agreement reinforces AllianzGI's capability in Alternatives and will accelerate the global buildout of its Private Debt Platform

1 December 2016 
Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI), one of the world’s leading active investment managers, announced today that Sound Harbor Partners, a US private credit manager led by Michael Zupon and Dean Criares, have agreed to join its fast-growing Private Debt Platform. Under the terms of the transaction, AllianzGI will acquire Sound Harbor’s assets for an undisclosed sum and the Sound Harbor team will join AllianzGI.


As a result of the acquisition, AllianzGI’s clients will be able to access US private credit investment funds managed by a highly respected team with a robust investment approach and track record of outperformance.  The Sound Harbor team will become part of the AllianzGI global investment platform, maintaining the integrity of its investment strategy, process and team while accessing deep insights and knowledge-sharing among colleagues across the platform.


Andreas Utermann, CEO and Global CIO of AllianzGI, said:



“Over the last five years, AllianzGI has invested steadily in the quality and breadth of its active investment offering.  Within our fast-growing Alternatives segment, private debt stands out as a particularly exciting area, where we’ve clearly signalled our intent to expand our capabilities to address our clients’ evolving investment needs.  The addition of the team from Sound Harbor is a significant step in that process, strengthening and complementing our existing capabilities in this important space.”






Deborah Zurkow, Head of Alternatives at AllianzGI, added:



"We are very excited the Sound Harbor team are joining our expanding private debt platform. We continue to see strong demand from our clients for access to a diverse range of illiquid alternatives solutions. Sound Harbor's expertise enhances AllianzGI’s existing global Alternatives capability, which includes infrastructure debt and a fast-growing corporate loans capability in Paris, underlining our desire to establish ourselves as one of the most prominent private debt managers globally.”






Commenting on behalf of Sound Harbor, Michael Zupon said:



“Dean and I, along with the entire team, are looking forward to joining a leading and respected investment manager that shares Sound Harbor’s commitment to outstanding investment performance and dedication to its clients’ needs. Joining AllianzGI will enhance our ability to capitalize on trends favoring growth in alternative investment managers with scale, brand recognition and long-term capital.”






Sound Harbor is a New York-based private credit manager focused on alternative investments in corporate loans, direct lending, distressed debt and opportunistic credit.  The firm manages these investments on behalf of its clients in private limited partnerships, collateralized loan obligations and separately managed accounts.  Mr. Zupon is a former Partner at The Carlyle Group where he founded and led the leveraged finance business. Mr. Criares is a former Partner of The Blackstone Group where he founded and led the loan management business. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.


Alternatives is one of the four pillars of AllianzGI’s global investment platform, alongside Equities, Fixed Income and Multi-Asset. Since the creation of AllianzGI’s Alternatives pillar, which comprises a diverse mix of both liquid and illiquid alternative investment solutions for clients, Assets Under Management have more than doubled, growing from USD 9.2 billion in December 2014 to over USD 22.0 billion by the end of Q3 2016.

What our customers say ...








                                    I enrolled as a premium member 3 days ago and have already received interest from 5 potential investors.  This is the best response that I have ever had from an online investment organization.

                                    Just started sending out connect requests… 30 sec later, my first profile look. 1 minute later, first connection. 2 mins later a message asking me to book a meeting with his PA to discuss my investment opportunity! Awesome!

                                    We added our pitch for AOX a week ago and since then we've had conference calls with 10 potential investors and 2 offers of investment. We're delighted with the service and expect to be able to close the round in the next few weeks.

NEWS RELEASE - Commercial real estate venture gets funded for $250K from funded.com's funding provider. Comment: I was very pleased with the speed and professional attitude of the site. I will recommend this to anyone in the future.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
