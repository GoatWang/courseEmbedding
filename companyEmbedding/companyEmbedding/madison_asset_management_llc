Investment Philosophy
The Madison Asset Advisors investment philosophy is based on the following basic principles:Develop highly diversified portfolios that may include a broad range of asset classes and market sectors.Utilize low cost investment options when feasible.Emphasizes holding investments for long periods of time.Periodically reallocate investments, as conditions warrant.Rebalance strategically as needed.Our investment advice will vary depending upon each client's specific financial situation.  The investment process begins with creating a customized Investment Policy Statement (IPS) defining each client's investment objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon, financial horizon, financial information, liquidity needs, and other suitability factors.  We will then determine asset class and market sector allocations that best correspond to the IPS and construct a portfolio utilizing information and data from a wide variety of third party sources.  The investment process emphasizes being highly diversified, with investments made in generally low-cost mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.  Depending on specific client circumstances and objectives, individual equity securities, warrants, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, municipal securities, investment company securities, US Government securities, and options contracts on securities can also be included in portfolios.  This approach can be very effective, but of course cannot ensure investment success or prevent loss in a declining market. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  Any restrictions and guidelines dictated by the client may affect the composition of the portfolio.

Investment Management | Wealth Management | Madison Investments

































































Disciplined investment strategies crafted to pursue superior risk-adjusted returns through full market cycles.




01








Madison has been an independent, employee-owned firm since 1974, freedom that has helped us hone a distinct style of active management.


We seek to avoid the undue risks of reaching for short-term results by emphasizing restraint and focusing on valuation through full market cycles.
- Our Investment Teams
















02

Madison manages approximately $16 billion* in assets for a broad spectrum of clients, including institutions and individuals whose financial landscape involves taxes, funding and regulations.
- Wealth Management












03

Our separately managed accounts and investment solutions are complemented by a roster of actively managed mutual funds. These high-conviction, high active share funds provide investors with exposure to segments of the fixed income and equity markets that differentiates from passive index funds.
- Madison Funds






We look to build trust by maintaining our conservative investment philosophy. When uncertainty strikes, we seek consistency in what we know rather than reacting to what others feel.









We work diligently to ensure our products and people uphold the integrity on which Madison was founded.


Madison’s 100% employee-ownership cultivates a culture of clarity: we want each shareholder to know the goals of our portfolios and why we make each investment. 
We believe that our portfolio managers' goals should align with those of long-term investors. That is why our portfolio managers have meaningful personal capital committed to their own strategies, and senior staff have a significant portion of their own net-worth invested in portfolios managed by Madison. 


Our Investment Capabilities (PDF)















*All statistics are as of 3/31/17. Gross assets under management and firm statistics are for the consolidated Madison organization. The Madison organization consists of its holding company, Madison Investment Holdings, Inc., and its affiliates: Madison Asset Management, LLC; Madison Investment Advisors, LLC; and Hansberger Growth Investors, LP. Asset information presented includes non-discretionary assets.

However, there is no assurance that this expectation will be realized.

Investment Management | Wealth Management | Madison Investments

































































Disciplined investment strategies crafted to pursue superior risk-adjusted returns through full market cycles.




01








Madison has been an independent, employee-owned firm since 1974, freedom that has helped us hone a distinct style of active management.


We seek to avoid the undue risks of reaching for short-term results by emphasizing restraint and focusing on valuation through full market cycles.
- Our Investment Teams
















02

Madison manages approximately $16 billion* in assets for a broad spectrum of clients, including institutions and individuals whose financial landscape involves taxes, funding and regulations.
- Wealth Management












03

Our separately managed accounts and investment solutions are complemented by a roster of actively managed mutual funds. These high-conviction, high active share funds provide investors with exposure to segments of the fixed income and equity markets that differentiates from passive index funds.
- Madison Funds






We look to build trust by maintaining our conservative investment philosophy. When uncertainty strikes, we seek consistency in what we know rather than reacting to what others feel.









We work diligently to ensure our products and people uphold the integrity on which Madison was founded.


Madison’s 100% employee-ownership cultivates a culture of clarity: we want each shareholder to know the goals of our portfolios and why we make each investment. 
We believe that our portfolio managers' goals should align with those of long-term investors. That is why our portfolio managers have meaningful personal capital committed to their own strategies, and senior staff have a significant portion of their own net-worth invested in portfolios managed by Madison. 


Our Investment Capabilities (PDF)















*All statistics are as of 3/31/17. Gross assets under management and firm statistics are for the consolidated Madison organization.

"Participate and Protect®" is a registered trademark of Madison Investment Advisors, reflecting our general investment philosophy. We seek to invest our client assets to participate in market appreciation during bull markets and be protected during bear markets compared with assets invested in more speculative and volatile securities. However, there is no assurance that this expectation will be realized.

Emerging Markets at the Crossroads
A radical shift in the forces shaping emerging market (EM) growth will require investors to take a different investment approach from what may have worked in the past. Increasingly, discovering EM investment opportunities will be rooted in the ability to capture the alpha from the new growth drivers, rather than in chasing the beta of the broad EM universe.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
