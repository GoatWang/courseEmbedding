Webcast


Market Insights Q3 2017 Markets seem to be telling us conflicting stories. On one hand, stocks have continued to climb on seemingly unabated investor optimism this year. On the other, bond yields have reversed course and fallen, indicating investor pessimism over future growth and inflation. Which story is right? Forward indicators suggest we may see a mini down cycle soon, which suggests caution.
Jon Hubbard from the MFS Investment Solutions team will moderate a discussion with MFS Chief Investment Strategist James Swanson and MFS Chief Economist Erik Weisman as they discuss how to decipher the conflicting narratives being told by the current market landscape.

MFS Investment Management (MFS) is an American-based global investment manager, formerly known as Massachusetts Financial Services. Founded in 1924, MFS is one of the oldest asset management companies in the world and has been credited with pioneering the mutual fund.[1] The very first mutual fund, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund, is still in operation today. MFS had USD$448.7 billion in assets under management as of April 30, 2017.[2]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1924 by L. Sherman Adams, Charles H. Learoyd and Ashton L. Carr.[3] The company's oldest fund is the Massachusetts Investors Trust, a mutual fund created with $50,000 at the company's inception and reported to be "the world's first open-end investment fund".[3] The company used "brokerage channels" to market its shares to the public and later expanded to $14 million in assets over the next five years.[3] During the stock market crash of 1929 the fund survived an 83% loss and went on to create a second fund in 1934. By 1959, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund had become the largest mutual fund in the United States.
In 1969, MIT was reorganized as Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS) to reflect the firm's broadened scope of products and services.
In 1976, MFS offered one of the nation’s first national municipal bond funds (Managed Municipal Bond Trust) and in 1981, MFS launched the country’s first globally diversified fixed-income fund (Massachusetts Financial International Trust-Bond Portfolio). In 1986, MFS offered the first closed-end, high-yield municipal bond fund to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1982, the company was acquired by Sun Life Financial of Canada.
In 1998, MFS Chairman and Chief Executive, A. Keith Brodkin died, causing a major shift in top management. MFS's assets under management grew from $55 billion to $90 billion between 1997 and 1998, and was reported to be the fastest growing company amongst the twenty largest that funds sold through brokers.[4]
During the early 2000s, MFS and five other mutual fund companies in the Boston area were investigated by Massachusetts and New Hampshire regulators. That same year, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that MFS made "false and misleading" statements in its fund prospectus about its policy on market trading and market timing. MFS paid $350 million to settle state and federal fraud charges. MFS appointed Robert Pozen as non-executive chairman from 2004 to 2010. [5] MFS then implemented a set of company reforms to inform investors about fees, keep fund boards independent and create deterrents to market timing. These changes were intended to address the concerns of regulators and lawmakers and were praised by fund industry analysts and consumer advocates. These reforms ended the "soft-dollar" arrangements which allowed the swapping of brokerage commissions for market research and data.
From 2010 to today, assets under management grew from $253 billion to more than $413 billion.[citation needed]

Time is an Asset | MFS





























Time is an Asset
Time. It's what we do with it that matters to investors.

READ NOW












Believing
To see only in the moment is to take what's put before you. To look out into the distance is to believe in something more.
					






A Matter of Time
Of all the arrows in an investor's quiver, among the most powerful is time. Yet many asset managers and owners don't fully grasp how powerful an impact time can have on investment decision-making and outcomes.


Lengthening the Investment Time Horizon
Investors are increasingly short term in their orientation, even while demographic trends point to longer life expectancy and the need for larger pools of retirement funds.





Refining
Instant gratification is fleeting. True fulfillment takes time, but offers greater potential reward.
					






Time is a Terrible Thing to Waste
Investors' misperceptions about what impacts their outcomes often make them spend too much time measuring what doesn't matter and not enough time on what does. It's time to start looking at what really counts when choosing an investment manager.


More Time for Active
How does investor tolerance for underperformance line up with their understanding of a long-term perspective? Our Active Sentiment Study looked at their thoughts, behaviors and the connections between the two.





Growing
Recognizing potential takes insight. Making something of it takes passion and patience.






Making Sense of Misalignment
Given the powerful relationship between decision-making and time, a misalignment between the two can significantly impact investment outcomes. It's time to break through that disconnect – and better align asset management delegation decisions with investor time horizons.


Riding the S Curve of Creative Disruption
The S-curve, which shows the growth trajectory of a company creating a new product or even a new industry can be an ally or enemy for investors. Skilled active managers try to find these companies much earlier on in the curve, with an eye toward tapping greater growth potential.





Crafting
When patience, action and insight work in harmony, risk can be an ally not an adversary.






Risk Management: It’s All About Culture
For many investors, risk is frequently an unwelcome four letter word: We are all too familiar with the painful consequences of unforeseen and excessive risks taken in the financial markets, not least of all the economic fallout from the global financial crisis in 2008–2009. And yet, in the investment context it is a truism that returns can only be generated when calculated risks are taken.


Risk: Managing From All Angles
In the countless discussions I've had with clients about the best way to manage risk in a portfolio, the critical takeaway is always the same. Effective risk management isn't any one practice, but rather an entire process — an integral part of the firm's investment management process, to be more specific.

Since opening our doors in 1947, MFS Investment Management Canada Limited has grown to become one of Canada’s most respected investment management companies. From offices in Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver and Chicago, we manage over $34 billion on behalf of pension, foundation & endowment, private wealth and mutual fund clients.
We take a team approach to investing, which allows our clients to take advantage of the collective strength of our various investment managers and analysts. We create separate teams that are comprised of three to seven individuals who build model portfolios for asset mix, Canadian equities (growth, value and core), global equities (growth, value and core), U.S. equities, EAFE (Europe, Australasia and Far East) equities and fixed income.
However, no team is ever complete without you, the client, as the decisions of each of our teams are implemented according to your investment objectives. This is why our portfolio managers stress the importance of regular meetings with you, so that we are constantly aware of all of your requirements and wishes.
MFS Investment Management Canada Limited’s success is based in large part on an entrepreneurial team culture. As owner-managers, we focus on running the business with a long term view and are strongly incented to maintain superior investment research, establish long-run succession planning, facilitate steady growth, and uphold the highest service standards. On a long-term basis, management owns 40% of the firm, with share ownership currently spread among 60 partners, and Sun Life Financial Corp. owning the balance. The MFS Investment Management Canada Limited team consists of over 110 employees, including 46 portfolio managers of whom 17 are research analysts.
To learn more about MFS Investment Management Canada Limited and how we would work together, please get in touch. We look forward to it.
Five areas distinguish MFS Investment Management Canada Limited:
Proven Investment Management Philosophy
Our firm uses a team-based majority voting approach to investment management. Decisions are made by experienced teams of investment managers supported by a globally oriented group of research analysts. This process integrates decision-making and research to maximize synergies regarding idea generation and portfolio structure.
Depth of our research expertise
The recognized research expertise within each of our investment management groups enables us to emphasize internal proprietary research in our investment process. Research is done on a global basis.
Equity Management Process
By using integrated equity management teams and structuring their responsibilities along global sectors, we have allowed every equity strategy to be managed on a truly global basis. All portfolios have focused approaches that have clearly defined risk controls.
Strong, Stable Organization and Ability to Effectively Handle Management Transition
We have an experienced management group, which is diversified by age. We are committed to having a management structure, which provides orderly personnel succession and is not overly dependent on any particular individual. The investment groups operate in a disciplined, democratic fashion while maintaining our long-term investment philosophy. We have been managing money successfully since 1947 and have demonstrated our ability to handle management changes.
Superior Service
Our client retention rate is high and, in part, this has been the result of the strong rapport we have built with plan sponsors and investment committees. Our investment reviews are structured to make our investment results and intentions clear and concise. We regularly consult with clients to ensure they are provided with the information they require.




























 


 



MFS McLean Budden Becomes MFS Investment Management Canada Limited | Business Wire
























































MFS McLean Budden Becomes MFS Investment Management Canada Limited




Name Change Demonstrates Local Commitment, Aligns with Global Brand






November 04, 2013 10:45 AM Eastern Standard Time



BOSTON & TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Global asset manager MFS® has announced a name change to its Canadian 
      operations. MFS McLean Budden is now MFS Investment Management Canada 
      Limited. The name change reflects the consistency of the MFS brand 
      and aligns the Canadian division with MFS' global operations.
    


      "The Canadian market represents a key area of focus for MFS," said 
      Michael Roberge, MFS president and chief investment officer. “A local 
      presence is important to MFS. Our regional Canadian investment teams 
      help deliver real-time knowledge and insights to their MFS counterparts 
      around the world. That same approach employed globally by MFS in other 
      local markets enhances the knowledge and insights available to our 
      Canadian investment teams. They work collaboratively across sectors and 
      asset classes as part of 200-plus person investment team, to the benefit 
      of our clients globally.”
    

      In September 2011, MFS' parent company, Sun Life Financial, merged 
      McLean Budden with MFS, significantly increasing MFS' presence in 
      Canada. Today, MFS’ global research platform benefits from a team of 22 
      Canadian investment professionals based in Toronto offering local 
      investment insight, including trading, working collaboratively across 
      eight global sector teams. Client relations, sales, marketing, legal and 
      other operational functions are conducted in Toronto, Montreal and 
      Vancouver as well.
    

      "The new name extends the consistency of our brand identity and our 
      global approach," said Carol Geremia, president of MFS Institutional 
      Advisors, Inc. "In addition, it represents the importance MFS places on 
      its Canadian business and our inherent promise to deliver a world class 
      client experience that clients around the world have come to expect.”
    

      The name change took effect November 1, 2013. For more information, 
      visit the new Institutions & Consultants Web site for Canadian investors 
      on mfs.com.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp.").

MFS Investment Management (MFS) is an American-based global investment manager, formerly known as Massachusetts Financial Services. Founded in 1924, MFS is one of the oldest asset management companies in the world and has been credited with pioneering the mutual fund.[1] The very first mutual fund, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund, is still in operation today. MFS had USD$448.7 billion in assets under management as of April 30, 2017.[2]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1924 by L. Sherman Adams, Charles H. Learoyd and Ashton L. Carr.[3] The company's oldest fund is the Massachusetts Investors Trust, a mutual fund created with $50,000 at the company's inception and reported to be "the world's first open-end investment fund".[3] The company used "brokerage channels" to market its shares to the public and later expanded to $14 million in assets over the next five years.[3] During the stock market crash of 1929 the fund survived an 83% loss and went on to create a second fund in 1934. By 1959, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund had become the largest mutual fund in the United States.
In 1969, MIT was reorganized as Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS) to reflect the firm's broadened scope of products and services.
In 1976, MFS offered one of the nation’s first national municipal bond funds (Managed Municipal Bond Trust) and in 1981, MFS launched the country’s first globally diversified fixed-income fund (Massachusetts Financial International Trust-Bond Portfolio). In 1986, MFS offered the first closed-end, high-yield municipal bond fund to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1982, the company was acquired by Sun Life Financial of Canada.
In 1998, MFS Chairman and Chief Executive, A. Keith Brodkin died, causing a major shift in top management. MFS's assets under management grew from $55 billion to $90 billion between 1997 and 1998, and was reported to be the fastest growing company amongst the twenty largest that funds sold through brokers.[4]
During the early 2000s, MFS and five other mutual fund companies in the Boston area were investigated by Massachusetts and New Hampshire regulators. That same year, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that MFS made "false and misleading" statements in its fund prospectus about its policy on market trading and market timing. MFS paid $350 million to settle state and federal fraud charges. MFS appointed Robert Pozen as non-executive chairman from 2004 to 2010. [5] MFS then implemented a set of company reforms to inform investors about fees, keep fund boards independent and create deterrents to market timing. These changes were intended to address the concerns of regulators and lawmakers and were praised by fund industry analysts and consumer advocates. These reforms ended the "soft-dollar" arrangements which allowed the swapping of brokerage commissions for market research and data.
From 2010 to today, assets under management grew from $253 billion to more than $413 billion.[citation needed]

Swanson: It’s a time to think about capital preservation.pic.twitter.com/rvQDDIagSP









Sleepy Inflation Could Limit Interest Rate Scares
With global inflation running below target, interest rates are likely to stay lower for longer. With that in mind, this late in the business cycle, capital preservation becomes increasingly important.

MFS Investment Management (MFS) is an American-based global investment manager, formerly known as Massachusetts Financial Services. Founded in 1924, MFS is one of the oldest asset management companies in the world and has been credited with pioneering the mutual fund.[1] The very first mutual fund, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund, is still in operation today. MFS had USD$448.7 billion in assets under management as of April 30, 2017.[2]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1924 by L. Sherman Adams, Charles H. Learoyd and Ashton L. Carr.[3] The company's oldest fund is the Massachusetts Investors Trust, a mutual fund created with $50,000 at the company's inception and reported to be "the world's first open-end investment fund".[3] The company used "brokerage channels" to market its shares to the public and later expanded to $14 million in assets over the next five years.[3] During the stock market crash of 1929 the fund survived an 83% loss and went on to create a second fund in 1934. By 1959, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund had become the largest mutual fund in the United States.
In 1969, MIT was reorganized as Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS) to reflect the firm's broadened scope of products and services.
In 1976, MFS offered one of the nation’s first national municipal bond funds (Managed Municipal Bond Trust) and in 1981, MFS launched the country’s first globally diversified fixed-income fund (Massachusetts Financial International Trust-Bond Portfolio). In 1986, MFS offered the first closed-end, high-yield municipal bond fund to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1982, the company was acquired by Sun Life Financial of Canada.
In 1998, MFS Chairman and Chief Executive, A. Keith Brodkin died, causing a major shift in top management. MFS's assets under management grew from $55 billion to $90 billion between 1997 and 1998, and was reported to be the fastest growing company amongst the twenty largest that funds sold through brokers.[4]
During the early 2000s, MFS and five other mutual fund companies in the Boston area were investigated by Massachusetts and New Hampshire regulators. That same year, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that MFS made "false and misleading" statements in its fund prospectus about its policy on market trading and market timing. MFS paid $350 million to settle state and federal fraud charges. MFS appointed Robert Pozen as non-executive chairman from 2004 to 2010. [5] MFS then implemented a set of company reforms to inform investors about fees, keep fund boards independent and create deterrents to market timing. These changes were intended to address the concerns of regulators and lawmakers and were praised by fund industry analysts and consumer advocates. These reforms ended the "soft-dollar" arrangements which allowed the swapping of brokerage commissions for market research and data.
From 2010 to today, assets under management grew from $253 billion to more than $413 billion.[citation needed]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
