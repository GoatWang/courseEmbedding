karen is MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SKINCARE SPECIALIST!!!  EVER!!!!!!!!!!!

lucky for texas, she does the best facial in austin, 24/7 and for the 'loyals' in los angles, we have her once a month. 

i have been seeing karen for 3 years now. i have gone to many specialists, but no one has elevated to her level of perfection.  i believe it's because she is a registered nurse and worked with top dermatologists. this certainly gave her a very unique angle to get in deep and understand your skin.  

i have suffered from rosacea breakouts that started in my adult years.  i started seeing miss karen to help ease the mini flares and skin maintenance to prevent future flares. her microdermabrasion facials are awesome and have truly kept my skin happy, healthy & vibrant.  i also & must mention how adorably nerdy she is... especially when she does her blackhead removal.  

you walk out of her studio smiling with seriously glowing dewy perfect skin!!! 

obviously i am a HUGE fan!!!!







So I finally had to sit down and make the time to write this review. I usually don't write reviews, but this one is worth reading ;)

I've gotten facials in several spas in the Austin area and not one of them compares to the one I got from Miss Karen. Her facials actually give me results. My skin looks amazing, and believe me, I'm very hard to please... HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend her services...!!!







Miss Karen is the best esthetician / best facialist I've ever been to.  I only had the pleasure of meeting her in person once.  I was referred to her by a close friend.  I left her table glowing, and her office with the best skincare products I had ever used.  They were nearly half the cost of the department store products I was buying, and SOOO much better for the health of my skin.  The results were far more advanced than the super expensive products - plus they come with a knowledgeable aesthetic registered nurse who knows her stuff - Miss Karen!  

We now live in separate states, but over the last 4 years I have stayed in contact with her through email because she takes the stress out of skincare.  I seriously feel like a deer in headlights when it comes to this stuff - the market is saturated, and I can tell you that Miss Karen's products work.  I trust her to curate the most bang for my buck, and she does a fantastic job.  Plus there's no more guesswork of whether I'm using products correctly - if I have a question after a purchase, I just shoot an email to her and problem solved.

Thank you Miss Karen for helping me develop my skincare regimen!  You are loved :)







Miss Karen gives one of the best facials, ever. She is knowledgable, thorough, and extremely helpful in giving advice about diet, skin care routine, and products. She's very easy going and creates such a relaxed environment for her clients. I am so happy that I discovered her awesomeness!







Stop scrolling through looking for the best skin technician in Austin. You've found her. I had my first facial with Karen last weekend and it was the best facial I have ever had. She is a consummate professional, she *really* knows her stuff. She is a pro, and I'm very glad I found her. You will not waste a penny on your skin if you put it in Karen's hands. Thanks Karen!







I've been going to Miss Karen for YEARS and I'm so glad I found her. For facials, microdermabrasian, chemical peels, botox, dermaplaning...really anything, she in incredible. Karen KNOWS skin and takes time to discuss what results you want, what the best procedure would be for you, and makes your skin look amazing.







I have been seeing Miss Karen for over ten years and that should tell you how amazing she is.  Her treatments are top flight and wonderful. She really knows what she's doing. I even have before and after photos of when I lived in NYC for a time and the rough weather really took a toll on my skin. She brought my skin back to health and a youthful glow. I was so grateful. Her work is impeccable. She knows skin better than anyone I've ever been to which is why I've stayed so long. She has an extensive knowledge of skin and beauty products as well and doesn't hesitate to give you a recommendation, opinion or suggestion if you need it. She uses high quality products and has her own skincare line which is spectacular. I'm now using a few of her own products and I love them! 
I live in Los Angeles and have been to some of the best skincare centers here frequented by movie stars and the like so I've been around the skincare world for a long time and there is no one like Karen. Besides her knowledge and expertise she's a really personable, caring professional, easy with a laugh and a good joke. She's really a gem and if you're lucky enough to find her don't let go! I sure won't. She is simply the best in her field.







I've been going to KK for 10 years. She has always been a pleasure to receive professional skincare from. She is always honest, yet positive! Recently I had my first experience with filler and I knew I was in good hands since Karen is one of the best estheticians I've ever had. My experience was very positive and I feel so beautiful!!







Cannot leave enough stars for Karen!!! I have tried countless treatments to improve my skin and never experienced the type of drastic results as I did from the Microneedling with PRP aka Vampire facial. After only one treatment my skin is so much brighter and smoother. Karen is extremely thorough and texted me a few days later to check on my results. As long as she's in Austin, I'll never go to anyone else!







Amazing facial experience with the one and only, Miss Karen! Everything was perfect, from the ease of scheduling with her by phone to the post-facial check-in email. I have found my favorite facialist in Austin and will definitely be back. Just some of the amazing aspects of my experience: best microdermabrasion facial, best extractions, great parking, high quality products, and a tranquil facial room. Thank you, Miss Karen, for making my skin glow!!







I had my first microdermabrasion facial and blackhead extractions ever here and it was amazing! My primary concerns were blackheads and Karen was able to work her magic on my troubled skin. She's super sweet and accommodating to my needs! I can't wait for my next appointment! Highly recommend :)







I don't typically write reviews but Miss Karen's is one of the first and only places that made me feel so inclined to spread the good word about her!

This was hands down the best facial experience I've ever had. The salon is easy to find, tons of parking (so clutch in downtown Austin) and such a comfortable and private space. 

Karen will escort you upstairs away from the noise of the hair salon in the most peaceful little airy room. We sat down and chatted about my skincare, health habits, beauty routine for close to 35 minutes. She is so easy to talk to and and makes you feel so comfortable.  

I came in desperate for a really good deep cleaning and pore extraction and that's exactly what she gave me and more! I walked out with glowing skin, several amazing free samples of her products and some really smart tips on how I can optimize my beauty routine. 

So far I am obsessed with her exfoliator product, the moisturizer with SPF and foundation she gave me as samples. 

Best of all she sent me a follow up note thanking me and checking in on how I was doing post facial. 

I will 100% be coming back for more facials and more products!







Miss Karen is amazing! I went for an acne peel which was AWESOME! She was very knowledgable and gave me a lot of helpful information about how I should be taking care of my skin and what products to use or try. Even after my appointment she would check up on my progress.

I highly recommend her and will definitely go again myself!







Karen is awesome! Not only is she extremely talented at what she does, but her funny positive attitude is what made the experience that much better. She treats you as if you were a good friend she has known for years. When you combine that type customer service and straight up talent, it's a no-brainier, I will recommend all my family and friends to her. Thanks Karen you rock!







OH MISS KAREN. QUEEN OF ALL THINGS BEAUTY.

I'll give you the long story short and the short story long for those who are interested.

Miss Karen is amazing at what she does.  She is extremely knowledgeable about the ingredients that go into skin care and make up products as well as the roots of all your skin problems. Not only that... she is a delight! The whole experience is like being taking care of by a best friend. She is upbeat and genuinely interested in her clients needs.  She is one of a kind.  Also, most PAINLESS brazilian wax ever.  She is magic. The products she sells are no scam they are the BEST I have ever used. I honestly see a difference in my skin. I feel so beautiful!

More story if you want it...

I met Miss Karen when she worked in Los Angeles and from day one knew I was in the best hands!  Like I said, most painless wax of my life.  She is always cheery. She has helped me solve skin issues, try new products, talk through break ups... all the things! Now that she is in Austin I don't get to see her but she is THE BEST because she emails me and answers all my detailed questions with detailed answers...at no cost. She always seems just happy to help and answer any questions.  To me it seems she loves being involved in the process with her clients! 

The skin care line she uses has done wonderful things for my skin. I don't even have bad skin to start off with but after using her products my skin looked and felt more even and healthy.  She knows what she is talking about and isn't out to rip you off or take your money. She honestly loves what she does and you can tell.  Ignore all the crap in the magazines ladies and just go to Miss Karen. I even strayed and tried a different brand... alas it sucked and I went back to Miss Karen... and she welcomed me with open arms.  If you're ready to stop the exhausting search for the right products, Miss Karen is your girl.







After only seeing Miss Karen once for a facial, I can easily say that I will likely follow this woman until the ends of the earth for my skin. She is a life changer.

I found Karen through yelp in a 911-skin situation. I typically have great skin but in the past couple weeks prior, I had broken out like never before. A visit to a different facialist in the area made it even worse and they didnt even bother to do extractions. Having physicians as parents, I know a little bit more than your average person about health, skincare, etc and I knew that my face simply needed extractions and extractions by the best of the best. I can unequivocally say that the best of the best is Karen.

Karen's demeanor is wonderful and she sees skincare as a passion and a craft. After one visit (and her skillful extractions), my skin literally looked like a new canvas. And it keeps getting better with everyday after. 

Karen's skincare is holistic in a way that I have never experienced before. She had me bring my skincare regime products and makeup so she could take a look, not to see what she could push product wise, but to really investigate and provide recommendations as necessary. She also followed up a couple days after just to check how my skin was doing post-facial!

Two people at work asked for Karen's information when I got to the office the next day and people keep commenting about the freshness of my skin lately. While Karen isn't inexpensive, she is worth absolutely every penny and I cannot wait to go back to see her (albeit hopefully not in a 911 situation). 

THANK YOU KAREN!







AH-mazing - Miss Karen will not let you down.  She took the time to understand the specifics of what I was looking for and what my skin needs, then delivered a skilled and thorough treatment that left my skin feeling awesome. I will be back - Miss Karen is my new facial go-to!







After reading all of the incredible reviews Miss Karen has received, I had to try her out for myself - and let me tell you - she's really as good as everyone claims! 

The past couple of months my skin started to change and become more sensitive. I've always had pretty decent skin and had no idea how to handle this new norm. Even before my appointment, Miss Karen took the time to reach out and introduce herself! She asked that I bring all of my skincare products with me to the appointment so that she could see what I was using and what ingredients I might be missing. Once I arrived, Miss Karen talked to me about my pain points, goals, skincare / lifestyle routines and did a thorough assessment of my skin's current condition and what products I was using. She provided amazing information and was so great about explaining her recommendations! Throughout the facial she lets you know what's going on and at no time did I ever feel uneasy or rushed. I even added on a lash tint while in the middle of my treatment, which I now believe I am thoroughly addicted to (it makes a world of difference if you have light eyelashes!). Afterwards, Miss Karen recommended I try a few of her high quality products - which I did and they are incredible - but the great thing is that she doesn't make you feel forced to buy everything at once. She even advises that you finish out the products you have (as long as they're not detrimental to your skin) so that you don't waste your money. The day after my facial, my skin was glowing and felt super soft. I'm now post-facial 3 days and my skin literally just keeps getting better!

Overall, Miss Karen is top notch and I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a knowledgeable, talented beauty guru!! Believe the hype. She's totally worth it, and I'm so thankful to all the other Yelp reviewers who helped me find her :) I know I've just become a client for life.







A few years ago, I saw Karen for a skin products consultation. Karen was very knowledgeable and really looked at all of my makeup and skin care products I was using and made recommendations on ingredients i should avoid, and ingredients I should look for. I ended up buying a few products that she recommenced for me that day and really appreciated that she didn't pressure me and was conscious of my budget. She threw in a sample of her Foaming Facial Refiner Scrub and I fell in LOVE.  

I would recommend it to anyone and I've been using it for over two years. I haven't found a scrub like it that actually really gets everything off and doesn't leave my sensitive skin red and irritated. The granules are super concentrated and fine which is hard to find in products of the same price range. Definitely worth the money and thank god she ships from Austin!







I discovered Miss Karen via Yelp (after Googling "blackhead extraction Austin").  Made my appointment via her website & went in hoping I would come out feeling as awesome as previous reviewers --and I did!  She really took her time explaining every step as she cleansed, prepped, and worked her magic on my skin.  She also went through my products (which I brought in with me) & modified my "routine list" (yes, I actually follow a product list daily).  I left with zero blackheads on my nose --which was a stark contrast to when I walked in.  The next day, my skin was GLOWING!  It's been over a week and my nose still is clean & blackhead free!  Note: Her services are not cheap.  I'm sure there are less expensive facial options out there; but in the case of skin, you really get what you pay for.  I've had a handful of cheaper facials that left me blackhead free...for a few days.  Miss Karen really works some magic, because my face still looks just as clean / glow-y as the day of my service.  Her services are worth every single penny.  Not once did I think, "Damn, that wasn't really worth it."  I will definitely be going back to her for my future facials / services.  If you're on the fence, it's worth it to give her a try.

I've been going to Miss Karen for YEARS and I'm so glad I found her. For facials, microdermabrasian, chemical peels, botox, dermaplaning...really anything, she in incredible. Karen KNOWS skin and takes time to discuss what results you want, what the best procedure would be for you, and makes your skin look amazing.

I have been seeing Miss Karen for over ten years and that should tell you how amazing she is. Â Her treatments are top flight and wonderful. She really knows what she's doing. I even have before and after photos of when I lived in NYC for a time and the rough weather really took a toll on my skin. She brought my skin back to health and a youthful glow. I was so grateful. Her work is impeccable. She knows skin better than anyone I've ever been to which is why I've stayed so long. She has an extensive knowledge of skin and beauty products as well and doesn't hesitate to give you a recommendation, opinion or suggestion if you need it. She uses high quality products and has her own skincare line which is spectacular. I'm now using a few of her own products and I love them! I live in Los Angeles and have been to some of the best skincare centers here frequented by movie stars and the like so I've been around the skincare world for a long time and there is no one like Karen. Besides her knowledge and expertise she's a really personable, caring professional, easy with a laugh and a good joke. She's really a gem and if you're lucky enough to find her don't let go! I sure won't. She is simply the best in her field.

I've been going to KK for 10 years. She has always been a pleasure to receive professional skincare from. She is always honest, yet positive! Recently I had my first experience with filler and I knew I was in good hands since Karen is one of the best estheticians I've ever had. My experience was very positive and I feel so beautiful!!

Cannot leave enough stars for Karen!!! I have tried countless treatments to improve my skin and never experienced the type of drastic results as I did from the Microneedling with PRP aka Vampire facial. After only one treatment my skin is so much brighter and smoother. Karen is extremely thorough and texted me a few days later to check on my results. As long as she's in Austin, I'll never go to anyone else!

Amazing facial experience with the one and only, Miss Karen! Everything was perfect, from the ease of scheduling with her by phone to the post-facial check-in email. I have found my favorite facialist in Austin and will definitely be back. Just some of the amazing aspects of my experience: best microdermabrasion facial, best extractions, great parking, high quality products, and a tranquil facial room. Thank you, Miss Karen, for making my skin glow!!

I had my first microdermabrasion facial and blackhead extractions ever here and it was amazing! My primary concerns were blackheads and Karen was able to work her magic on my troubled skin. She's super sweet and accommodating to my needs! I can't wait for my next appointment! Highly recommend :)

I don't typically write reviews but Miss Karen's is one of the first and only places that made me feel so inclined to spread the good word about her!This was hands down the best facial experience I've ever had. The salon is easy to find, tons of parking (so clutch in downtown Austin) and such a comfortable and private space. Karen will escort you upstairs away from the noise of the hair salon in the most peaceful little airy room. We sat down and chatted about my skincare, health habits, beauty routine for close to 35 minutes. She is so easy to talk to and and makes you feel so comfortable. Â I came in desperate for a really good deep cleaning and pore extraction and that's exactly what she gave me and more! I walked out with glowing skin, several amazing free samples of her products and some really smart tips on how I can optimize my beauty routine. So far I am obsessed with her exfoliator product, the moisturizer with SPF and foundation she gave me as samples. Best of all she sent me a follow up note thanking me and checking in on how I was doing post facial. I will 100% be coming back for more facials and more products!

Miss Karen is amazing! I went for an acne peel which was AWESOME! She was very knowledgable and gave me a lot of helpful information about how I should be taking care of my skin and what products to use or try. Even after my appointment she would check up on my progress.I highly recommend her and will definitely go again myself!

Karen is awesome! Not only is she extremely talented at what she does, but her funny positive attitude is what made the experience that much better. She treats you as if you were a good friend she has known for years. When you combine that type customer service and straight up talent, it's a no-brainier, I will recommend all my family and friends to her. Thanks Karen you rock!

OH MISS KAREN. QUEEN OF ALL THINGS BEAUTY.I'll give you the long story short and the short story long for those who are interested.Miss Karen is amazing at what she does. Â She is extremely knowledgeable about the ingredients that go into skin care and make up products as well as the roots of all your skin problems. Not only that... she is a delight! The whole experience is like being taking care of by a best friend. She is upbeat and genuinely interested in her clients needs. Â She is one of a kind. Â Also, most PAINLESS brazilian wax ever. Â She is magic. The products she sells are no scam they are the BEST I have ever used. I honestly see a difference in my skin. I feel so beautiful!More story if you want it...I met Miss Karen when she worked in Los Angeles and from day one knew I was in the best hands! Â Like I said, most painless wax of my life. Â She is always cheery. She has helped me solve skin issues, try new products, talk through break ups... all the things! Now that she is in Austin I don't get to see her but she is THE BEST because she emails me and answers all my detailed questions with detailed answers...at no cost. She always seems just happy to help and answer any questions. Â To me it seems she loves being involved in the process with her clients! The skin care line she uses has done wonderful things for my skin. I don't even have bad skin to start off with but after using her products my skin looked and felt more even and healthy. Â She knows what she is talking about and isn't out to rip you off or take your money. She honestly loves what she does and you can tell. Â Ignore all the crap in the magazines ladies and just go to Miss Karen. I even strayed and tried a different brand... alas it sucked and I went back to Miss Karen... and she welcomed me with open arms. Â If you're ready to stop the exhausting search for the right products, Miss Karen is your girl.

After only seeing Miss Karen once for a facial, I can easily say that I will likely follow this woman until the ends of the earth for my skin. She is a life changer.I found Karen through yelp in a 911-skin situation. I typically have great skin but in the past couple weeks prior, I had broken out like never before. A visit to a different facialist in the area made it even worse and they didnt even bother to do extractions. Having physicians as parents, I know a little bit more than your average person about health, skincare, etc and I knew that my face simply needed extractions and extractions by the best of the best. I can unequivocally say that the best of the best is Karen.Karen's demeanor is wonderful and she sees skincare as a passion and a craft. After one visit (and her skillful extractions), my skin literally looked like a new canvas. And it keeps getting better with everyday after. Karen's skincare is holistic in a way that I have never experienced before. She had me bring my skincare regime products and makeup so she could take a look, not to see what she could push product wise, but to really investigate and provide recommendations as necessary. She also followed up a couple days after just to check how my skin was doing post-facial!Two people at work asked for Karen's information when I got to the office the next day and people keep commenting about the freshness of my skin lately. While Karen isn't inexpensive, she is worth absolutely every penny and I cannot wait to go back to see her (albeit hopefully not in a 911 situation). THANK YOU KAREN!

After reading all of the incredible reviews Miss Karen has received, I had to try her out for myself - and let me tell you - she's really as good as everyone claims! The past couple of months my skin started to change and become more sensitive. I've always had pretty decent skin and had no idea how to handle this new norm. Even before my appointment, Miss Karen took the time to reach out and introduce herself! She asked that I bring all of my skincare products with me to the appointment so that she could see what I was using and what ingredients I might be missing. Once I arrived, Miss Karen talked to me about my pain points, goals, skincare / lifestyle routines and did a thorough assessment of my skin's current condition and what products I was using. She provided amazing information and was so great about explaining her recommendations! Throughout the facial she lets you know what's going on and at no time did I ever feel uneasy or rushed. I even added on a lash tint while in the middle of my treatment, which I now believe I am thoroughly addicted to (it makes a world of difference if you have light eyelashes!). Afterwards, Miss Karen recommended I try a few of her high quality products - which I did and they are incredible - but the great thing is that she doesn't make you feel forced to buy everything at once. She even advises that you finish out the products you have (as long as they're not detrimental to your skin) so that you don't waste your money. The day after my facial, my skin was glowing and felt super soft. I'm now post-facial 3 days and my skin literally just keeps getting better!Overall, Miss Karen is top notch and I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a knowledgeable, talented beauty guru!! Believe the hype. She's totally worth it, and I'm so thankful to all the other Yelp reviewers who helped me find her :) I know I've just become a client for life.

First to Review
        


A few years ago, I saw Karen for a skin products consultation. Karen was very knowledgeable and really looked at all of my makeup and skin care products I was using and made recommendations on ingredients i should avoid, and ingredients I should look for. I ended up buying a few products that she recommenced for me that day and really appreciated that she didn't pressure me and was conscious of my budget. She threw in a sample of her Foaming Facial Refiner Scrub and I fell in LOVE. Â I would recommend it to anyone and I've been using it for over two years. I haven't found a scrub like it that actually really gets everything off and doesn't leave my sensitive skin red and irritated. The granules are super concentrated and fine which is hard to find in products of the same price range. Definitely worth the money and thank god she ships from Austin!

I discovered Miss Karen via Yelp (after Googling "blackhead extraction Austin"). Â Made my appointment via her website & went in hoping I would come out feeling as awesome as previous reviewers --and I did! Â She really took her time explaining every step as she cleansed, prepped, and worked her magic on my skin. Â She also went through my products (which I brought in with me) & modified my "routine list" (yes, I actually follow a product list daily). Â I left with zero blackheads on my nose --which was a stark contrast to when I walked in. Â The next day, my skin was GLOWING! Â It's been over a week and my nose still is clean & blackhead free! Â Note: Her services are not cheap. Â I'm sure there are less expensive facial options out there; but in the case of skin, you really get what you pay for. Â I've had a handful of cheaper facials that left me blackhead free...for a few days. Â Miss Karen really works some magic, because my face still looks just as clean / glow-y as the day of my service. Â Her services are worth every single penny. Â Not once did I think, "Damn, that wasn't really worth it." Â I will definitely be going back to her for my future facials / services. Â If you're on the fence, it's worth it to give her a try.

karen is MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SKINCARE SPECIALIST!!!  EVER!!!!!!!!!!!

lucky for texas, she does the best facial in austin, 24/7 and for the 'loyals' in los angles, we have her once a month. 

i have been seeing karen for 3 years now. i have gone to many specialists, but no one has elevated to her level of perfection.  i believe it's because she is a registered nurse and worked with top dermatologists. this certainly gave her a very unique angle to get in deep and understand your skin.  

i have suffered from rosacea breakouts that started in my adult years.  i started seeing miss karen to help ease the mini flares and skin maintenance to prevent future flares. her microdermabrasion facials are awesome and have truly kept my skin happy, healthy & vibrant.  i also & must mention how adorably nerdy she is... especially when she does her blackhead removal.  

you walk out of her studio smiling with seriously glowing dewy perfect skin!!! 

obviously i am a HUGE fan!!!!







So I finally had to sit down and make the time to write this review. I usually don't write reviews, but this one is worth reading ;)

I've gotten facials in several spas in the Austin area and not one of them compares to the one I got from Miss Karen. Her facials actually give me results. My skin looks amazing, and believe me, I'm very hard to please... HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend her services...!!!







Miss Karen is the best esthetician / best facialist I've ever been to.  I only had the pleasure of meeting her in person once.  I was referred to her by a close friend.  I left her table glowing, and her office with the best skincare products I had ever used.  They were nearly half the cost of the department store products I was buying, and SOOO much better for the health of my skin.  The results were far more advanced than the super expensive products - plus they come with a knowledgeable aesthetic registered nurse who knows her stuff - Miss Karen!  

We now live in separate states, but over the last 4 years I have stayed in contact with her through email because she takes the stress out of skincare.  I seriously feel like a deer in headlights when it comes to this stuff - the market is saturated, and I can tell you that Miss Karen's products work.  I trust her to curate the most bang for my buck, and she does a fantastic job.  Plus there's no more guesswork of whether I'm using products correctly - if I have a question after a purchase, I just shoot an email to her and problem solved.

Thank you Miss Karen for helping me develop my skincare regimen!  You are loved :)







Miss Karen gives one of the best facials, ever. She is knowledgable, thorough, and extremely helpful in giving advice about diet, skin care routine, and products. She's very easy going and creates such a relaxed environment for her clients. I am so happy that I discovered her awesomeness!







Stop scrolling through looking for the best skin technician in Austin. You've found her. I had my first facial with Karen last weekend and it was the best facial I have ever had. She is a consummate professional, she *really* knows her stuff. She is a pro, and I'm very glad I found her. You will not waste a penny on your skin if you put it in Karen's hands. Thanks Karen!







I've been going to Miss Karen for YEARS and I'm so glad I found her. For facials, microdermabrasian, chemical peels, botox, dermaplaning...really anything, she in incredible. Karen KNOWS skin and takes time to discuss what results you want, what the best procedure would be for you, and makes your skin look amazing.







I have been seeing Miss Karen for over ten years and that should tell you how amazing she is.  Her treatments are top flight and wonderful. She really knows what she's doing. I even have before and after photos of when I lived in NYC for a time and the rough weather really took a toll on my skin. She brought my skin back to health and a youthful glow. I was so grateful. Her work is impeccable. She knows skin better than anyone I've ever been to which is why I've stayed so long. She has an extensive knowledge of skin and beauty products as well and doesn't hesitate to give you a recommendation, opinion or suggestion if you need it. She uses high quality products and has her own skincare line which is spectacular. I'm now using a few of her own products and I love them! 
I live in Los Angeles and have been to some of the best skincare centers here frequented by movie stars and the like so I've been around the skincare world for a long time and there is no one like Karen. Besides her knowledge and expertise she's a really personable, caring professional, easy with a laugh and a good joke. She's really a gem and if you're lucky enough to find her don't let go! I sure won't. She is simply the best in her field.







I've been going to KK for 10 years. She has always been a pleasure to receive professional skincare from. She is always honest, yet positive! Recently I had my first experience with filler and I knew I was in good hands since Karen is one of the best estheticians I've ever had. My experience was very positive and I feel so beautiful!!







Cannot leave enough stars for Karen!!! I have tried countless treatments to improve my skin and never experienced the type of drastic results as I did from the Microneedling with PRP aka Vampire facial. After only one treatment my skin is so much brighter and smoother. Karen is extremely thorough and texted me a few days later to check on my results. As long as she's in Austin, I'll never go to anyone else!







Amazing facial experience with the one and only, Miss Karen! Everything was perfect, from the ease of scheduling with her by phone to the post-facial check-in email. I have found my favorite facialist in Austin and will definitely be back. Just some of the amazing aspects of my experience: best microdermabrasion facial, best extractions, great parking, high quality products, and a tranquil facial room. Thank you, Miss Karen, for making my skin glow!!







I had my first microdermabrasion facial and blackhead extractions ever here and it was amazing! My primary concerns were blackheads and Karen was able to work her magic on my troubled skin. She's super sweet and accommodating to my needs! I can't wait for my next appointment! Highly recommend :)







I don't typically write reviews but Miss Karen's is one of the first and only places that made me feel so inclined to spread the good word about her!

This was hands down the best facial experience I've ever had. The salon is easy to find, tons of parking (so clutch in downtown Austin) and such a comfortable and private space. 

Karen will escort you upstairs away from the noise of the hair salon in the most peaceful little airy room. We sat down and chatted about my skincare, health habits, beauty routine for close to 35 minutes. She is so easy to talk to and and makes you feel so comfortable.  

I came in desperate for a really good deep cleaning and pore extraction and that's exactly what she gave me and more! I walked out with glowing skin, several amazing free samples of her products and some really smart tips on how I can optimize my beauty routine. 

So far I am obsessed with her exfoliator product, the moisturizer with SPF and foundation she gave me as samples. 

Best of all she sent me a follow up note thanking me and checking in on how I was doing post facial. 

I will 100% be coming back for more facials and more products!







Miss Karen is amazing! I went for an acne peel which was AWESOME! She was very knowledgable and gave me a lot of helpful information about how I should be taking care of my skin and what products to use or try. Even after my appointment she would check up on my progress.

I highly recommend her and will definitely go again myself!







Karen is awesome! Not only is she extremely talented at what she does, but her funny positive attitude is what made the experience that much better. She treats you as if you were a good friend she has known for years. When you combine that type customer service and straight up talent, it's a no-brainier, I will recommend all my family and friends to her. Thanks Karen you rock!







OH MISS KAREN. QUEEN OF ALL THINGS BEAUTY.

I'll give you the long story short and the short story long for those who are interested.

Miss Karen is amazing at what she does.  She is extremely knowledgeable about the ingredients that go into skin care and make up products as well as the roots of all your skin problems. Not only that... she is a delight! The whole experience is like being taking care of by a best friend. She is upbeat and genuinely interested in her clients needs.  She is one of a kind.  Also, most PAINLESS brazilian wax ever.  She is magic. The products she sells are no scam they are the BEST I have ever used. I honestly see a difference in my skin. I feel so beautiful!

More story if you want it...

I met Miss Karen when she worked in Los Angeles and from day one knew I was in the best hands!  Like I said, most painless wax of my life.  She is always cheery. She has helped me solve skin issues, try new products, talk through break ups... all the things! Now that she is in Austin I don't get to see her but she is THE BEST because she emails me and answers all my detailed questions with detailed answers...at no cost. She always seems just happy to help and answer any questions.  To me it seems she loves being involved in the process with her clients! 

The skin care line she uses has done wonderful things for my skin. I don't even have bad skin to start off with but after using her products my skin looked and felt more even and healthy.  She knows what she is talking about and isn't out to rip you off or take your money. She honestly loves what she does and you can tell.  Ignore all the crap in the magazines ladies and just go to Miss Karen. I even strayed and tried a different brand... alas it sucked and I went back to Miss Karen... and she welcomed me with open arms.  If you're ready to stop the exhausting search for the right products, Miss Karen is your girl.







After only seeing Miss Karen once for a facial, I can easily say that I will likely follow this woman until the ends of the earth for my skin. She is a life changer.

I found Karen through yelp in a 911-skin situation. I typically have great skin but in the past couple weeks prior, I had broken out like never before. A visit to a different facialist in the area made it even worse and they didnt even bother to do extractions. Having physicians as parents, I know a little bit more than your average person about health, skincare, etc and I knew that my face simply needed extractions and extractions by the best of the best. I can unequivocally say that the best of the best is Karen.

Karen's demeanor is wonderful and she sees skincare as a passion and a craft. After one visit (and her skillful extractions), my skin literally looked like a new canvas. And it keeps getting better with everyday after. 

Karen's skincare is holistic in a way that I have never experienced before. She had me bring my skincare regime products and makeup so she could take a look, not to see what she could push product wise, but to really investigate and provide recommendations as necessary. She also followed up a couple days after just to check how my skin was doing post-facial!

Two people at work asked for Karen's information when I got to the office the next day and people keep commenting about the freshness of my skin lately. While Karen isn't inexpensive, she is worth absolutely every penny and I cannot wait to go back to see her (albeit hopefully not in a 911 situation). 

THANK YOU KAREN!







AH-mazing - Miss Karen will not let you down.  She took the time to understand the specifics of what I was looking for and what my skin needs, then delivered a skilled and thorough treatment that left my skin feeling awesome. I will be back - Miss Karen is my new facial go-to!







After reading all of the incredible reviews Miss Karen has received, I had to try her out for myself - and let me tell you - she's really as good as everyone claims! 

The past couple of months my skin started to change and become more sensitive. I've always had pretty decent skin and had no idea how to handle this new norm. Even before my appointment, Miss Karen took the time to reach out and introduce herself! She asked that I bring all of my skincare products with me to the appointment so that she could see what I was using and what ingredients I might be missing. Once I arrived, Miss Karen talked to me about my pain points, goals, skincare / lifestyle routines and did a thorough assessment of my skin's current condition and what products I was using. She provided amazing information and was so great about explaining her recommendations! Throughout the facial she lets you know what's going on and at no time did I ever feel uneasy or rushed. I even added on a lash tint while in the middle of my treatment, which I now believe I am thoroughly addicted to (it makes a world of difference if you have light eyelashes!). Afterwards, Miss Karen recommended I try a few of her high quality products - which I did and they are incredible - but the great thing is that she doesn't make you feel forced to buy everything at once. She even advises that you finish out the products you have (as long as they're not detrimental to your skin) so that you don't waste your money. The day after my facial, my skin was glowing and felt super soft. I'm now post-facial 3 days and my skin literally just keeps getting better!

Overall, Miss Karen is top notch and I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a knowledgeable, talented beauty guru!! Believe the hype. She's totally worth it, and I'm so thankful to all the other Yelp reviewers who helped me find her :) I know I've just become a client for life.







A few years ago, I saw Karen for a skin products consultation. Karen was very knowledgeable and really looked at all of my makeup and skin care products I was using and made recommendations on ingredients i should avoid, and ingredients I should look for. I ended up buying a few products that she recommenced for me that day and really appreciated that she didn't pressure me and was conscious of my budget. She threw in a sample of her Foaming Facial Refiner Scrub and I fell in LOVE.  

I would recommend it to anyone and I've been using it for over two years. I haven't found a scrub like it that actually really gets everything off and doesn't leave my sensitive skin red and irritated. The granules are super concentrated and fine which is hard to find in products of the same price range. Definitely worth the money and thank god she ships from Austin!







I discovered Miss Karen via Yelp (after Googling "blackhead extraction Austin").  Made my appointment via her website & went in hoping I would come out feeling as awesome as previous reviewers --and I did!  She really took her time explaining every step as she cleansed, prepped, and worked her magic on my skin.  She also went through my products (which I brought in with me) & modified my "routine list" (yes, I actually follow a product list daily).  I left with zero blackheads on my nose --which was a stark contrast to when I walked in.  The next day, my skin was GLOWING!  It's been over a week and my nose still is clean & blackhead free!  Note: Her services are not cheap.  I'm sure there are less expensive facial options out there; but in the case of skin, you really get what you pay for.  I've had a handful of cheaper facials that left me blackhead free...for a few days.  Miss Karen really works some magic, because my face still looks just as clean / glow-y as the day of my service.  Her services are worth every single penny.  Not once did I think, "Damn, that wasn't really worth it."  I will definitely be going back to her for my future facials / services.  If you're on the fence, it's worth it to give her a try.

karen is MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SKINCARE SPECIALIST!!! Â EVER!!!!!!!!!!!lucky for texas, she does the best facial in austin, 24/7 and for the 'loyals' in los angles, we have her once a month. i have been seeing karen for 3 years now. i have gone to many specialists, but no one has elevated to her level of perfection. Â i believe it's because she is a registered nurse and worked with top dermatologists. this certainly gave her a very unique angle to get in deep and understand your skin. Â i have suffered from rosacea breakouts that started in my adult years. Â i started seeing miss karen to help ease the mini flares and skin maintenance to prevent future flares. her microdermabrasion facials are awesome and have truly kept my skin happy, healthy & vibrant. Â i also & must mention how adorably nerdy she is... especially when she does her blackhead removal. Â you walk out of her studio smiling with seriously glowing dewy perfect skin!!! obviously i am a HUGE fan!!!!

So I finally had to sit down and make the time to write this review. I usually don't write reviews, but this one is worth reading ;)I've gotten facials in several spas in the Austin area and not one of them compares to the one I got from Miss Karen. Her facials actually give me results. My skin looks amazing, and believe me, I'm very hard to please... HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend her services...!!!








This is my skin now.. I'm not wearing any makeup (just fake lash extensions) my skin was awful before Miss Karen.....

Miss Karen is the best esthetician / best facialist I've ever been to. Â I only had the pleasure of meeting her in person once. Â I was referred to her by a close friend. Â I left her table glowing, and her office with the best skincare products I had ever used. Â They were nearly half the cost of the department store products I was buying, and SOOO much better for the health of my skin. Â The results were far more advanced than the super expensive products - plus they come with a knowledgeable aesthetic registered nurse who knows her stuff - Miss Karen! Â We now live in separate states, but over the last 4 years I have stayed in contact with her through email because she takes the stress out of skincare. Â I seriously feel like a deer in headlights when it comes to this stuff - the market is saturated, and I can tell you that Miss Karen's products work. Â I trust her to curate the most bang for my buck, and she does a fantastic job. Â Plus there's no more guesswork of whether I'm using products correctly - if I have a question after a purchase, I just shoot an email to her and problem solved.Thank you Miss Karen for helping me develop my skincare regimen! Â You are loved :)

I've been going to Miss Karen for YEARS and I'm so glad I found her. For facials, microdermabrasian, chemical peels, botox, dermaplaning...really anything, she in incredible. Karen KNOWS skin and takes time to discuss what results you want, what the best procedure would be for you, and makes your skin look amazing.

I have been seeing Miss Karen for over ten years and that should tell you how amazing she is. Â Her treatments are top flight and wonderful. She really knows what she's doing. I even have before and after photos of when I lived in NYC for a time and the rough weather really took a toll on my skin. She brought my skin back to health and a youthful glow. I was so grateful. Her work is impeccable. She knows skin better than anyone I've ever been to which is why I've stayed so long. She has an extensive knowledge of skin and beauty products as well and doesn't hesitate to give you a recommendation, opinion or suggestion if you need it. She uses high quality products and has her own skincare line which is spectacular. I'm now using a few of her own products and I love them! I live in Los Angeles and have been to some of the best skincare centers here frequented by movie stars and the like so I've been around the skincare world for a long time and there is no one like Karen. Besides her knowledge and expertise she's a really personable, caring professional, easy with a laugh and a good joke. She's really a gem and if you're lucky enough to find her don't let go! I sure won't. She is simply the best in her field.

I've been going to KK for 10 years. She has always been a pleasure to receive professional skincare from. She is always honest, yet positive! Recently I had my first experience with filler and I knew I was in good hands since Karen is one of the best estheticians I've ever had. My experience was very positive and I feel so beautiful!!

Cannot leave enough stars for Karen!!! I have tried countless treatments to improve my skin and never experienced the type of drastic results as I did from the Microneedling with PRP aka Vampire facial. After only one treatment my skin is so much brighter and smoother. Karen is extremely thorough and texted me a few days later to check on my results. As long as she's in Austin, I'll never go to anyone else!

Amazing facial experience with the one and only, Miss Karen! Everything was perfect, from the ease of scheduling with her by phone to the post-facial check-in email. I have found my favorite facialist in Austin and will definitely be back. Just some of the amazing aspects of my experience: best microdermabrasion facial, best extractions, great parking, high quality products, and a tranquil facial room. Thank you, Miss Karen, for making my skin glow!!

I had my first microdermabrasion facial and blackhead extractions ever here and it was amazing! My primary concerns were blackheads and Karen was able to work her magic on my troubled skin. She's super sweet and accommodating to my needs! I can't wait for my next appointment! Highly recommend :)

I don't typically write reviews but Miss Karen's is one of the first and only places that made me feel so inclined to spread the good word about her!This was hands down the best facial experience I've ever had. The salon is easy to find, tons of parking (so clutch in downtown Austin) and such a comfortable and private space. Karen will escort you upstairs away from the noise of the hair salon in the most peaceful little airy room. We sat down and chatted about my skincare, health habits, beauty routine for close to 35 minutes. She is so easy to talk to and and makes you feel so comfortable. Â I came in desperate for a really good deep cleaning and pore extraction and that's exactly what she gave me and more! I walked out with glowing skin, several amazing free samples of her products and some really smart tips on how I can optimize my beauty routine. So far I am obsessed with her exfoliator product, the moisturizer with SPF and foundation she gave me as samples. Best of all she sent me a follow up note thanking me and checking in on how I was doing post facial. I will 100% be coming back for more facials and more products!

Miss Karen is amazing! I went for an acne peel which was AWESOME! She was very knowledgable and gave me a lot of helpful information about how I should be taking care of my skin and what products to use or try. Even after my appointment she would check up on my progress.I highly recommend her and will definitely go again myself!

Karen is awesome! Not only is she extremely talented at what she does, but her funny positive attitude is what made the experience that much better. She treats you as if you were a good friend she has known for years. When you combine that type customer service and straight up talent, it's a no-brainier, I will recommend all my family and friends to her. Thanks Karen you rock!

OH MISS KAREN. QUEEN OF ALL THINGS BEAUTY.I'll give you the long story short and the short story long for those who are interested.Miss Karen is amazing at what she does. Â She is extremely knowledgeable about the ingredients that go into skin care and make up products as well as the roots of all your skin problems. Not only that... she is a delight! The whole experience is like being taking care of by a best friend. She is upbeat and genuinely interested in her clients needs. Â She is one of a kind. Â Also, most PAINLESS brazilian wax ever. Â She is magic. The products she sells are no scam they are the BEST I have ever used. I honestly see a difference in my skin. I feel so beautiful!More story if you want it...I met Miss Karen when she worked in Los Angeles and from day one knew I was in the best hands! Â Like I said, most painless wax of my life. Â She is always cheery. She has helped me solve skin issues, try new products, talk through break ups... all the things! Now that she is in Austin I don't get to see her but she is THE BEST because she emails me and answers all my detailed questions with detailed answers...at no cost. She always seems just happy to help and answer any questions. Â To me it seems she loves being involved in the process with her clients! The skin care line she uses has done wonderful things for my skin. I don't even have bad skin to start off with but after using her products my skin looked and felt more even and healthy. Â She knows what she is talking about and isn't out to rip you off or take your money. She honestly loves what she does and you can tell. Â Ignore all the crap in the magazines ladies and just go to Miss Karen. I even strayed and tried a different brand... alas it sucked and I went back to Miss Karen... and she welcomed me with open arms. Â If you're ready to stop the exhausting search for the right products, Miss Karen is your girl.

After only seeing Miss Karen once for a facial, I can easily say that I will likely follow this woman until the ends of the earth for my skin. She is a life changer.I found Karen through yelp in a 911-skin situation. I typically have great skin but in the past couple weeks prior, I had broken out like never before. A visit to a different facialist in the area made it even worse and they didnt even bother to do extractions. Having physicians as parents, I know a little bit more than your average person about health, skincare, etc and I knew that my face simply needed extractions and extractions by the best of the best. I can unequivocally say that the best of the best is Karen.Karen's demeanor is wonderful and she sees skincare as a passion and a craft. After one visit (and her skillful extractions), my skin literally looked like a new canvas. And it keeps getting better with everyday after. Karen's skincare is holistic in a way that I have never experienced before. She had me bring my skincare regime products and makeup so she could take a look, not to see what she could push product wise, but to really investigate and provide recommendations as necessary. She also followed up a couple days after just to check how my skin was doing post-facial!Two people at work asked for Karen's information when I got to the office the next day and people keep commenting about the freshness of my skin lately. While Karen isn't inexpensive, she is worth absolutely every penny and I cannot wait to go back to see her (albeit hopefully not in a 911 situation). THANK YOU KAREN!

After reading all of the incredible reviews Miss Karen has received, I had to try her out for myself - and let me tell you - she's really as good as everyone claims! The past couple of months my skin started to change and become more sensitive. I've always had pretty decent skin and had no idea how to handle this new norm. Even before my appointment, Miss Karen took the time to reach out and introduce herself! She asked that I bring all of my skincare products with me to the appointment so that she could see what I was using and what ingredients I might be missing. Once I arrived, Miss Karen talked to me about my pain points, goals, skincare / lifestyle routines and did a thorough assessment of my skin's current condition and what products I was using. She provided amazing information and was so great about explaining her recommendations! Throughout the facial she lets you know what's going on and at no time did I ever feel uneasy or rushed. I even added on a lash tint while in the middle of my treatment, which I now believe I am thoroughly addicted to (it makes a world of difference if you have light eyelashes!). Afterwards, Miss Karen recommended I try a few of her high quality products - which I did and they are incredible - but the great thing is that she doesn't make you feel forced to buy everything at once. She even advises that you finish out the products you have (as long as they're not detrimental to your skin) so that you don't waste your money. The day after my facial, my skin was glowing and felt super soft. I'm now post-facial 3 days and my skin literally just keeps getting better!Overall, Miss Karen is top notch and I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a knowledgeable, talented beauty guru!! Believe the hype. She's totally worth it, and I'm so thankful to all the other Yelp reviewers who helped me find her :) I know I've just become a client for life.

A few years ago, I saw Karen for a skin products consultation. Karen was very knowledgeable and really looked at all of my makeup and skin care products I was using and made recommendations on ingredients i should avoid, and ingredients I should look for. I ended up buying a few products that she recommenced for me that day and really appreciated that she didn't pressure me and was conscious of my budget. She threw in a sample of her Foaming Facial Refiner Scrub and I fell in LOVE. Â I would recommend it to anyone and I've been using it for over two years. I haven't found a scrub like it that actually really gets everything off and doesn't leave my sensitive skin red and irritated. The granules are super concentrated and fine which is hard to find in products of the same price range. Definitely worth the money and thank god she ships from Austin!

I discovered Miss Karen via Yelp (after Googling "blackhead extraction Austin"). Â Made my appointment via her website & went in hoping I would come out feeling as awesome as previous reviewers --and I did! Â She really took her time explaining every step as she cleansed, prepped, and worked her magic on my skin. Â She also went through my products (which I brought in with me) & modified my "routine list" (yes, I actually follow a product list daily). Â I left with zero blackheads on my nose --which was a stark contrast to when I walked in. Â The next day, my skin was GLOWING! Â It's been over a week and my nose still is clean & blackhead free! Â Note: Her services are not cheap. Â I'm sure there are less expensive facial options out there; but in the case of skin, you really get what you pay for. Â I've had a handful of cheaper facials that left me blackhead free...for a few days. Â Miss Karen really works some magic, because my face still looks just as clean / glow-y as the day of my service. Â Her services are worth every single penny. Â Not once did I think, "Damn, that wasn't really worth it." Â I will definitely be going back to her for my future facials / services. Â If you're on the fence, it's worth it to give her a try.
