charitable gifts as and when directed by Mr. Ellison. As of March 27, 2009, those shares represented approximately 51.7% of our outstanding stock. Mr. Ellison is the Chief Executive Officer, a director and a principal stockholder of
Oracle. We have been told that Mr. Ellison made the transfer in view of his position and duties at Oracle, to effectively eliminate his voting control over the election of our directors and certain other matters, to limit the circumstances
under which his voting control could be exercised or restored, and to avoid and mitigate potential future conflicts of interest that might otherwise arise.  To that end, Mr. Ellison established the LLC, the sole member of which is Mr. Ellisons revocable trust. The LLC is managed solely by an unrelated third party. The manager has no ability to dispose of
our shares, other than to fund charitable gifts as and when directed by Mr. Ellison, to cover any tax liabilities resulting from ownership of the shares in the LLC structure, and to participate in a transaction involving a change of control
approved by our stockholders or a tender offer approved or recommended by our board of directors.  The LLC Operating Agreement does not
permit the LLC to be liquidated or dissolved, or any ownership interest in the LLC to be transferred, so long as Mr. Ellison remains an officer or director of Oracle, except with the approval of an independent committee of Oracles board
of directors. Mr. Ellison has informed us of his intention that, upon his death, his membership interest in the LLC will be transferred to the Ellison Medical Foundation or to one or more other charities designated by Mr. Ellison.
 The Operating Agreement for the LLC contains provisions regarding the voting of our shares that are designed to neutralize the voting
power of the shares or our stock held by the LLC and that require that all the shares held by the LLC that are entitled to be voted at any meeting of our stockholders will be present and voted at such meeting, except as described below. These
provisions require the shares held by the LLC to be voted on each matter presented by the stockholders in strict proportion (for, against, withheld, and/or abstain) to the votes collectively cast by all of our other voting stockholders who are
present and voting, other than shares beneficially owned by Mr. Ellison or members of his family, shares owned by trusts created for the benefit of Mr. Ellisons family members, and shares beneficially owned by any person or group
that makes (or under applicable law is required to make) a filing on Schedule 13D with the SEC. These voting provisions apply to all matters brought before our stockholders, except transactions involving a change of control, dissolution, sale of
substantially all the assets, or a liquidation of NetSuite, in which case the shares held by the LLC will be voted as directed by Mr. 
Ellison.  This excerpt taken from the N DEF 14A filed Apr 15, 2008.Lawrence J. Ellison  In connection with our initial public offering, Lawrence J. Ellison transferred 31,964,894 shares of our common stock (representing all of the shares formerly held directly by Tako Ventures, an investment entity
controlled by Mr. Ellison) to NetSuite Restricted Holdings LLC, or the LLC, a limited liability company formed for the limited purpose of holding the NetSuite shares and funding charitable gifts as and when directed by Mr. Ellison. As of
March 31, 2008, those shares represented approximately 53.1% of our outstanding stock. Mr. Ellison is the Chief Executive Officer, a director and a principal stockholder of Oracle. We have been told that Mr. Ellison made the transfer in
view of his position and duties at Oracle, to effectively eliminate his voting control over the election of our directors and certain other matters, to limit the circumstances under which his voting control could be exercised or restored, and to

his death, his membership interest in the LLC will be transferred to the Ellison Medical Foundation or to one or more other charities designated by Mr. Ellison.  As part of these arrangements, the LLC Operating Agreement contains provisions designed to neutralize the voting power of our shares held by the LLC, except as described below. These arrangements require the shares
held by the LLC to be voted in strict proportion to the voting of shares held by all of our other voting stockholders, other than shares beneficially owned by Mr. Ellison or members of his family, shares owned by trusts created for the benefit
of Mr. Ellisons children, and shares beneficially owned by any person or group that makes (or under applicable law is required to make) a filing on Schedule 13D with the SEC. These voting arrangements apply to all matters brought before
our stockholders, except transactions involving a change of control, dissolution, sale of substantially all the assets, or a liquidation of NetSuite, in which case the shares held by the LLC will be voted as directed by Mr. Ellison.

General Ledger
Transform your General Ledger into a dynamic business asset
NetSuite transforms the General Ledger from a static, one-size-fits-all into a dynamic asset that enables companies to tailor the General Ledger to meet their unique business needs and changing conditions. NetSuite's General Ledger gives finance professionals flexibility and visibility, richer reporting functionality, enhanced audit trails and new support for multinational financial management.

Key Capabilities

NetSuite's dynamic General Ledger eliminates the need for manual journal entries by letting users add custom GL impact lines to transactions such as invoices or vendor bills across single or multiple accounting books, reducing the time and effort required for account reconciliation, period close and audit processes.
Finance teams can define unlimited custom General Ledger segments such as profit center, fund, program, product line and more, in addition to the standard subsidiary, class, department and location segments. This improves accuracy and saves time by ensuring that General Ledger financial impact follows double-entry accounting principles and balances across all segment combinations.
NetSuite's Multi-Book accounting capabilities eliminate data entry replication and reduce the need for error-prone manual adjustments to your accounting and reporting processes that are created when managing unique sets of books per accounting standard. With pre-built mapping capabilities between your primary and secondary chart of accounts, as well as book specific functional currencies, the NetSuite Multi-Book engine can record all book-specific activity based on a single business transaction from the General Ledger, revenue recognition, expense amortization, depreciation, P&L allocations and more.

NetSuite Inc. is an American cloud computing company based in San Mateo, California, that sells a group of software services used to manage a business's financials, operations and customer relations.[3] NetSuite's services are aimed at small to medium-sized businesses, although larger enterprises can also benefit from the consolidated ERP, CRM and e-commerce features.[4] Oracle Corporation offered to purchase NetSuite for approximately $9.3 billion USD in July 2016, with the deal finalizing in November 2016.

History[edit]
NetSuite was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg as NetLedger, web-hosted accounting software. Oracle licensed the software under the banner of The Oracle Small Business Suite for a short time before that was cancelled.[5] NetSuite is widely seen as the first cloud computing software company, with the company’s 1999 founding pre-dating that of Salesforce.com by about a month. Goldberg was the chairman and chief technology officer up until the Oracle acquisition.[2]
In July 2002, Zach Nelson was appointed CEO.  Nelson had deep background in sales and marketing, holding a variety of executive positions at Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp.  Prior to joining NetSuite, Nelson ran an early provider of business applications over the Internet called MyCIO.com, a division of McAfee Corp.[6]  This experience led him to the belief that all software would be delivered over the internet, and he left McAfee to join NetSuite.  Nelson led the company from about $1 million in revenue to a billion-dollar run-rate prior to its acquisition by Oracle Corp.[7]
On January 4, 2007, NetSuite named Moneyball General Manager Billy Beane of Major League Baseball's Oakland A's to its board of directors. Evan Goldberg cited Beane's ability to combine facts with instinct as an important factor in the decision to involve him in the company.[8]
NetSuite became a publicly traded company after its initial public offering (IPO) of 6.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2007.[9] Though NetSuite has shown a 149% increase in revenue in the five-year period from 2009 to 2014 [10] it has incurred annual operating losses since inception.[2]
NetSuite had 2,550 employees as of March 31, 2014, a 31% increase over March 31, 2013, when it had 1,953. One quarter of its employees are based in its Philippine office. NetSuite has additional offices in Denver, Las Vegas, Austin, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Boston, Toronto, the UK, Spain, the Czech Republic, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Uruguay.[2]
On July 28, 2016, Oracle announced it had offered to purchase NetSuite for $9.3 billion USD. The deal faces intense scrutiny because Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, owns nearly 40% of NetSuite. This conflict of interest has led the board of both companies to establish independent committees to review the deal from the perspective of independent shareholders. Some major NetSuite shareholders, such as T. Rowe, have notified Oracle they will not be tendering their shares under the current terms of the proposed deal. In early October 2016, Oracle extended the deadline for shareholders of NetSuite to tender their shares to November 4.
Relationship with Oracle Corporation[edit]
Even prior to the July 28, 2016 announcement that Oracle Corporation would acquire NetSuite Inc., the two firms shared a close relationship.[11] Both founder Goldberg and CEO Nelson worked at Oracle Corp. prior to forming NetSuite.[12][13]  Goldberg joined Oracle immediately after graduating from Harvard College in 1987, and held a variety of positions in R&D. Nelson joined Oracle in 1992 as Vice President of Marketing, ultimately working directly for Larry Ellison.
In 1998 Evan Goldberg received approximately $125 million in initial financial backing from Larry Ellison,[14] founder and chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation through Ellison's venture capital entity Tako Ventures.[15] Other initial investors were StarVest Partners[16] ADP and UBS PaineWebber.[17] The NetSuite software also relies on database software licensed from Oracle.[18]
Ellison and family members own approximately 47.4% of NetSuite's common stock as of December 31, 2014. The firm's 10-Q filing on March 2, 2015, states that "Mr. Ellison is able to exercise control over approval of significant corporate transactions, including a change of control or liquidation."[19]
Products[edit]
NetSuite groups its services into four main suites plus NetSuite OneWorld:[citation needed]

NetSuite Inc. is an American cloud computing company based in San Mateo, California, that sells a group of software services used to manage a business's financials, operations and customer relations.[3] NetSuite's services are aimed at small to medium-sized businesses, although larger enterprises can also benefit from the consolidated ERP, CRM and e-commerce features.[4] Oracle Corporation offered to purchase NetSuite for approximately $9.3 billion USD in July 2016, with the deal finalizing in November 2016.

History[edit]
NetSuite was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg as NetLedger, web-hosted accounting software. Oracle licensed the software under the banner of The Oracle Small Business Suite for a short time before that was cancelled.[5] NetSuite is widely seen as the first cloud computing software company, with the company’s 1999 founding pre-dating that of Salesforce.com by about a month. Goldberg was the chairman and chief technology officer up until the Oracle acquisition.[2]
In July 2002, Zach Nelson was appointed CEO.  Nelson had deep background in sales and marketing, holding a variety of executive positions at Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp.  Prior to joining NetSuite, Nelson ran an early provider of business applications over the Internet called MyCIO.com, a division of McAfee Corp.[6]  This experience led him to the belief that all software would be delivered over the internet, and he left McAfee to join NetSuite.  Nelson led the company from about $1 million in revenue to a billion-dollar run-rate prior to its acquisition by Oracle Corp.[7]
On January 4, 2007, NetSuite named Moneyball General Manager Billy Beane of Major League Baseball's Oakland A's to its board of directors. Evan Goldberg cited Beane's ability to combine facts with instinct as an important factor in the decision to involve him in the company.[8]
NetSuite became a publicly traded company after its initial public offering (IPO) of 6.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2007.[9] Though NetSuite has shown a 149% increase in revenue in the five-year period from 2009 to 2014 [10] it has incurred annual operating losses since inception.[2]
NetSuite had 2,550 employees as of March 31, 2014, a 31% increase over March 31, 2013, when it had 1,953. One quarter of its employees are based in its Philippine office. NetSuite has additional offices in Denver, Las Vegas, Austin, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Boston, Toronto, the UK, Spain, the Czech Republic, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Uruguay.[2]
On July 28, 2016, Oracle announced it had offered to purchase NetSuite for $9.3 billion USD. The deal faces intense scrutiny because Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, owns nearly 40% of NetSuite. This conflict of interest has led the board of both companies to establish independent committees to review the deal from the perspective of independent shareholders. Some major NetSuite shareholders, such as T. Rowe, have notified Oracle they will not be tendering their shares under the current terms of the proposed deal. In early October 2016, Oracle extended the deadline for shareholders of NetSuite to tender their shares to November 4.
Relationship with Oracle Corporation[edit]
Even prior to the July 28, 2016 announcement that Oracle Corporation would acquire NetSuite Inc., the two firms shared a close relationship.[11] Both founder Goldberg and CEO Nelson worked at Oracle Corp. prior to forming NetSuite.[12][13]  Goldberg joined Oracle immediately after graduating from Harvard College in 1987, and held a variety of positions in R&D. Nelson joined Oracle in 1992 as Vice President of Marketing, ultimately working directly for Larry Ellison.
In 1998 Evan Goldberg received approximately $125 million in initial financial backing from Larry Ellison,[14] founder and chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation through Ellison's venture capital entity Tako Ventures.[15] Other initial investors were StarVest Partners[16] ADP and UBS PaineWebber.[17] The NetSuite software also relies on database software licensed from Oracle.[18]
Ellison and family members own approximately 47.4% of NetSuite's common stock as of December 31, 2014. The firm's 10-Q filing on March 2, 2015, states that "Mr. Ellison is able to exercise control over approval of significant corporate transactions, including a change of control or liquidation."[19]
Products[edit]
NetSuite groups its services into four main suites plus NetSuite OneWorld:[citation needed]

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) - NetSuite ERP supports back office operations which includes financial, human resources, orders, inventory, shipping and billing. The product earned PC Magazine's Editor's Choice in 2013.[20]
Customer relationship management (CRM) – NetSuite CRM supports sales, marketing operations and customer insights.
E-commerce - SuiteCommerce is intended as a platform for online sales and integration with traditional phone and Point of Sale (POS) tools. SuiteCommerce platform is currently in use by over 1600 websites online.[21]
Professional services automation (PSA) - NetSuite PSA manages the operations of service-based, project-oriented businesses.[22]
Human Capital Management (HCM) - NetSuite SuitePeople securely weaves people data throughout the Suite, giving businesses complete control over their Core HR & payroll processes.[23]
NetSuite OneWorld offers the above services plus additional capabilities for multinational companies such as the ability to manage multiple subsidiaries, currencies, accounting standards and tax requirements.[24]

NetSuite Inc. is an American cloud computing company based in San Mateo, California, that sells a group of software services used to manage a business's financials, operations and customer relations.[3] NetSuite's services are aimed at small to medium-sized businesses, although larger enterprises can also benefit from the consolidated ERP, CRM and e-commerce features.[4] Oracle Corporation offered to purchase NetSuite for approximately $9.3 billion USD in July 2016, with the deal finalizing in November 2016.

History[edit]
NetSuite was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg as NetLedger, web-hosted accounting software. Oracle licensed the software under the banner of The Oracle Small Business Suite for a short time before that was cancelled.[5] NetSuite is widely seen as the first cloud computing software company, with the company’s 1999 founding pre-dating that of Salesforce.com by about a month. Goldberg was the chairman and chief technology officer up until the Oracle acquisition.[2]
In July 2002, Zach Nelson was appointed CEO.  Nelson had deep background in sales and marketing, holding a variety of executive positions at Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp.  Prior to joining NetSuite, Nelson ran an early provider of business applications over the Internet called MyCIO.com, a division of McAfee Corp.[6]  This experience led him to the belief that all software would be delivered over the internet, and he left McAfee to join NetSuite.  Nelson led the company from about $1 million in revenue to a billion-dollar run-rate prior to its acquisition by Oracle Corp.[7]
On January 4, 2007, NetSuite named Moneyball General Manager Billy Beane of Major League Baseball's Oakland A's to its board of directors. Evan Goldberg cited Beane's ability to combine facts with instinct as an important factor in the decision to involve him in the company.[8]
NetSuite became a publicly traded company after its initial public offering (IPO) of 6.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2007.[9] Though NetSuite has shown a 149% increase in revenue in the five-year period from 2009 to 2014 [10] it has incurred annual operating losses since inception.[2]
NetSuite had 2,550 employees as of March 31, 2014, a 31% increase over March 31, 2013, when it had 1,953. One quarter of its employees are based in its Philippine office. NetSuite has additional offices in Denver, Las Vegas, Austin, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Boston, Toronto, the UK, Spain, the Czech Republic, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Uruguay.[2]
On July 28, 2016, Oracle announced it had offered to purchase NetSuite for $9.3 billion USD. The deal faces intense scrutiny because Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, owns nearly 40% of NetSuite. This conflict of interest has led the board of both companies to establish independent committees to review the deal from the perspective of independent shareholders. Some major NetSuite shareholders, such as T. Rowe, have notified Oracle they will not be tendering their shares under the current terms of the proposed deal. In early October 2016, Oracle extended the deadline for shareholders of NetSuite to tender their shares to November 4.
Relationship with Oracle Corporation[edit]
Even prior to the July 28, 2016 announcement that Oracle Corporation would acquire NetSuite Inc., the two firms shared a close relationship.[11] Both founder Goldberg and CEO Nelson worked at Oracle Corp. prior to forming NetSuite.[12][13]  Goldberg joined Oracle immediately after graduating from Harvard College in 1987, and held a variety of positions in R&D. Nelson joined Oracle in 1992 as Vice President of Marketing, ultimately working directly for Larry Ellison.
In 1998 Evan Goldberg received approximately $125 million in initial financial backing from Larry Ellison,[14] founder and chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation through Ellison's venture capital entity Tako Ventures.[15] Other initial investors were StarVest Partners[16] ADP and UBS PaineWebber.[17] The NetSuite software also relies on database software licensed from Oracle.[18]
Ellison and family members own approximately 47.4% of NetSuite's common stock as of December 31, 2014. The firm's 10-Q filing on March 2, 2015, states that "Mr. Ellison is able to exercise control over approval of significant corporate transactions, including a change of control or liquidation."[19]
Products[edit]
NetSuite groups its services into four main suites plus NetSuite OneWorld:[citation needed]

E-commerce - SuiteCommerce is intended as a platform for online sales and integration with traditional phone and Point of Sale (POS) tools. SuiteCommerce platform is currently in use by over 1600 websites online.[21]

Human Capital Management (HCM) - NetSuite SuitePeople securely weaves people data throughout the Suite, giving businesses complete control over their Core HR & payroll processes.[23]
NetSuite OneWorld offers the above services plus additional capabilities for multinational companies such as the ability to manage multiple subsidiaries, currencies, accounting standards and tax requirements.[24]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
