BASEL, Switzerland, July 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Dermavant Sciences, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative therapies in medical dermatology, today announced the appointment of Dr. Jacqualyn "Jackie" Fouse as Executive Chairman.








"I am honored to lead Dermavant and look forward to building the world's leading innovative medical dermatology company," said Dr. Fouse. "For the past decade there has been an 'innovation gap' in medical dermatology, with surprisingly few novel therapies despite a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of many dermatologic conditions. Physicians and patients are eager for better options."
"In less than two years, Dermavant has created a robust pipeline of promising potential therapies targeting multiple indications," Dr. Fouse continued. "I believe the company is well on its way to being the ideal development and commercialization partner for innovative dermatology medicines. I am impressed with the quality of the Dermavant team and the entire Roivant organization."
"We are delighted to welcome Jackie to the helm of Dermavant," said Vivek Ramaswamy, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Roivant Sciences. "She is an exceptional leader and one of the most admired executives in the biopharmaceutical industry. Jackie is emblematic of the caliber of leadership that we seek to attract to the Roivant family of companies."
Dr. Fouse previously served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Celgene Corporation until April 2017, and as a member of Celgene's Board of Directors through June 2017. She joined Celgene in 2010 as Chief Financial Officer and was named president of the company's global Hematology & Oncology franchise in 2014. Her experience at Celgene included working closely with the business unit that launched OTEZLA® for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis. 
Before joining Celgene, Dr. Fouse served as Chief Financial Officer of Bunge Limited, a leading global agribusiness and food company. Prior to Bunge, she served as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Head of Corporate Strategy at Alcon Laboratories, a leading ophthalmic pharmaceutical and medical device company. Prior to her tenure with Alcon, she held a variety of senior leadership roles with international companies, spending almost a decade of her career in Switzerland. Dr. Fouse earned her B.A. and M.A. in Economics and a Ph.D. in Finance from the University of Texas at Arlington.
