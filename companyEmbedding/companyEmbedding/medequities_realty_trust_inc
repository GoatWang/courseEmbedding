Company Description

 

Our Business
Founded in  2014 and based in Nashville, Tennessee, MedEquities Realty Trust is a
    self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust that invests in  a diversified mix of healthcare properties and healthcare-related real estate  debt investments.  Our portfolio is currently  comprised of 24 healthcare facilities that contain a total of 2,345 licensed  beds and are located in Texas, California, Nevada and South Carolina. The  portfolio includes 17 skilled nursing facilities, two acute care hospitals, two  long-term acute care hospitals, one assisted living facility, one inpatient rehabilitation  facility and one medical office building. In addition, we have one healthcare-related  debt investment.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to become an integral capital partner with high-quality, facility based, growth-minded providers of healthcare services, primarily through net leased real estate investments, and to continue to diversify over time based on our facility types, tenants and geographic locations. We invest primarily in real estate across the acute and post-acute spectrum of care, where our management team has extensive experience and relationships and which we believe differentiates us from other healthcare real estate investors. We believe acute and post-acute healthcare facilities have the potential to provide higher risk-adjusted returns compared to other forms of net-leased real estate assets due to the specialized expertise and insight necessary to own, finance and operate these properties, which are factors that tend to limit competition among owners, operators and finance companies. 
We target healthcare providers or operators that provide higher acuity services, are experienced, growth-minded and that we believe have shown an ability to successfully navigate a changing healthcare landscape. We believe that by investing in facilities that span the acute and post-acute spectrum of care, we will be able to adapt to, and capitalize on, changes in the healthcare industry and support, grow and develop long-term relationships with providers that serve the highest number of patients at the highest-yielding end of the healthcare real estate market. 
We expect to invest primarily in the following types of healthcare properties: acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, short-stay surgical and specialty hospitals (such as those focusing on orthopedic, heart, and other dedicated surgeries and specialty procedures), dedicated specialty hospitals (such as inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-term acute care hospitals and facilities providing psychiatric care), large and prominent physician clinics, diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgery centers and facilities that support these services, such as medical office buildings. Over the long term, we expect our portfolio to be balanced equally between acute and post-acute facilities, although the balance may fluctuate from time to time due to the impact of individual transactions.

Properties





GruenePointe/OnPointe Health Texas Portfolio
Leased to wholly owned subsidiaries of GruenePointe and  managed by an affiliate of OnPointe Health, one of the owners of GruenePointe,  this portfolio of 10 skilled nursing facilities is located in areas we believe have less competition  and a stable-to-growing demand for additional patient services, particularly  higher acuity services, that can sustain high occupancy levels, which are  characteristics similar to markets in which OnPointe Health has existing  facilities and experience. We believe that OnPointe Health’s experience and  specialties in higher acuity services can allow these facilities to meet the  needs of growing patient populations in markets previously underserved while  achieving efficiencies within GruenePointe and OnPointe Health’s existing network  of operations that would translate into higher profitability and solid  regulatory compliance.


Life Generations Portfolio
The Life  Generations Portfolio is comprised of six high quality facilities located in  attractive markets in San Diego and the greater Los Angeles, California area.  Each of the five rated facilities in the Life Generations Portfolio are rated  four stars or higher by CMS, which differentiates them from other facilities in  the same markets. In addition, the above average quality of care provided at  the facilities operated by Life Generations, as indicated by the CMS star  ratings, has been a prominent factor in achieving robust patient occupancy levels.  We believe the locations of the facilities in major metropolitan areas and in  close proximity to large population centers will allow the Life Generations  Portfolio to continue to maintain high occupancy levels. The considerable  replacement costs and development within these California markets should limit  future development of competing facilities. Furthermore, the Health and Safety  Code regulations imposed by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning  and Development, or OSHPD, create substantial barriers to the development of  new skilled nursing facilities in California.


Lakeway Hospital

Lakeway  Hospital is leased to Scott & White Hospital – Round Rock, part of the  nationally recognized Baylor Scott & White Health System, which includes 48  hospitals, more than 900 patient access points, and over 6,000 active  physicians and 40,000 employees providing services in the Dallas-Fort Worth  metropolitan area and central Texas region. Lakeway Hospital is part of  Baylor’s central Texas provider network that includes approximately 13  hospitals and over 100 clinics and other provider locations. Lakeway Hospital  is located in the highly affluent area of Lakeway, Texas, which is  approximately 20 miles northwest of Austin, Texas. The population of the  Lakeway area has grown rapidly as the area has experienced strong investment in  residential and commercial development. We anticipate that the limited number  of nearby competing facilities will allow Lakeway Hospital to service the  growing demand for the high-acuity services in the Lakeway area. We believe the  attractive demographic characteristics of the area combined with the need for  both specialized acute care services in the local market will support the  long-term value of Lakeway Hospital.

 
Kentfield Rehabilitation and Specialty Hospital
Leased to a  subsidiary of Vibra Healthcare, Kentfield Hospital is a 40,091 square-foot  facility located in Kentfield, California, within the highly affluent Marin  County in the San Francisco Bay area. Kentfield Hospital, which underwent a $15  million renovation in October 2015, consists of an approximately 29,000  square-foot long term acute care hospital with 60 licensed long-term acute care  hospital beds and an approximately 11,000 square-foot adjoining medical office building.  Kentfield Hospital is one of only two licensed long-term acute care hospitals  in the San Francisco Bay Area market and benefits from a surrounding population  of approximately 7.2 million, according to the 2010 U.S. Census, which supports  its bed demand. Kentfield Hospital has been one of Vibra Healthcare’s top  performing facilities. In addition, we believe Kentfield Hospital receives  referrals from Marin General Hospital, a 235-bed general acute-care hospital  that is approximately one mile from Kentfield Hospital. As a result of this  relationship, Kentfield Hospital has benefitted from a consistent step-down  patient flow.
 
Mountain’s Edge Hospital
Leased to a  wholly owned subsidiary of Fundamental Healthcare, Mountain’s Edge Hospital is  a newly developed 72,140 square foot acute care hospital that began accepting  patients in early July 2015, is licensed for 130 beds and located in Las Vegas,  Nevada. We believe the new state-of-the-art hospital will be a significant upgrade  from existing in-patient rehabilitation facilities in the Las Vegas market.  Mountain’s Edge Hospital replaces an existing hospital, which is expected to be  converted to a skilled nursing facility, with Mountain’s Edge Hospital intended  to be the principal hospitalization site for the Health Plan of Nevada’s  managed care patient population. As a result, Mountain’s Edge Hospital is  expected to benefit from an immediate flow of patients. In addition, Mountain’s  Edge Hospital is expected to benefit from a daily 75-bed minimum guarantee from  a leading national managed care company. Mountain’s Edge Hospital includes  imaging services, an intensive care unit and comprehensive rehabilitation modalities.  We believe that the supportive demographic trends and immediate source of  patient referrals will allow Mountain’s Edge Hospital to quickly ramp up its  operations.]
 
Magnolia Place of Spartanburg
Magnolia  Place is a 32,885 square-foot skilled nursing facility that has recently been developed  by Fundamental Healthcare to expand the facility to approximately 50,397 square  feet and increase the number of licensed beds from 88 to 120. The property is  located in Spartanburg, South Carolina and benefits from significant entry  barriers in the state. The state of South Carolina regulates the supply of certain  healthcare providers through its Certificate of Need Program. The requirement to  receive state authorization before developing new nursing and hospital facilities  or expanding existing facilities creates a substantial barrier for bed  expansion in South Carolina. We believe the expansion at Magnolia Place and  restriction of skilled nursing facility beds related to the Certificate of Need  Program will enhance profitability of the hospital and provide us with a more  financially sound operator for the already successful facility. In addition, we  believe Magnolia Place receives referrals from Spartanburg Regional Hospital, a  540-bed general acute care hospital that is approximately two miles from  Magnolia Place. As a result of this relationship, Magnolia Place has benefitted  from a consistent step-down patient flow.        
 
Horizon Specialty Hospital of  Henderson
Leased to a  subsidiary of Fundamental Healthcare, Horizon Hospital is a 37,209 square-foot  long-term acute care hospital licensed for 39 beds and located in Henderson,  Nevada. Horizon Hospital is located in the affluent eastern section of the Las  Vegas area and began admitting patients in February 2013. Prior to developing  the property, a detailed bed need analysis was performed to estimate potential  demand for a new hospital. Using a census of acute care hospitals and skilled  nursing facilities operating in the Las Vegas market in combination with  zip-code level population and patient discharge data, Fundamental Healthcare determined  areas of the Las Vegas market were currently underserved. The location of the  Horizon Hospital was strategically chosen to take advantage of the unmet demand  in the area, particularly among elderly residents. Importantly, the Nevada State  Demographer estimates 61% growth in people aged 65 and older from 2010 to 2030  in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and Henderson, Nevada. We believe  that current capacity constraints will encourage hospitals to move patients,  once stabilized, out of high cost acute care hospitals to step-down facilities,  such as long-term acute care hospitals, where the cost of continued care is  significantly lower than that of an acute care hospital. In addition,  Fundamental Healthcare has extensive experience in the Las Vegas market, having  operated there for more than 20 years.
 
Vibra Rehabilitation Hospital of  Amarillo
Leased to a  wholly owned subsidiary of Vibra Healthcare, Vibra Rehabilitation Hospital of  Amarillo is a 44-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital located in Amarillo,  Texas. Located within the Amarillo Medical District, we believe Vibra  Rehabilitation Hospital of Amarillo receives referrals from the Northwest Texas  Hospital, Baptist Saint Anthony’s Hospital, as well as Vibra’s own long-term  acute care hospital, Vibra Hospital of Amarillo, and other medical providers  all located within a two-mile radius of its campus. Vibra Rehabilitation  Hospital of Amarillo operates 44 of the 76 rehabilitation beds in the Amarillo  market and has generated strong financial results since being acquired in September  2013. As a result of the level of care being provided to patients and the  facility’s reputation in the Amarillo market, as well as Vibra Rehabilitation  Hospital of Amarillo’s relationships with acute care providers, we believe the  facility will continue to be the provider of choice in the Amarillo market for  patients requiring rehabilitation services.
 
Mira Vista Court
Leased to a  subsidiary of Fundamental Healthcare, Mira Vista is a 51,534 square foot skilled  nursing facility located in the expanding southwest section of Fort Worth, Texas.  Mira Vista is licensed for 142 beds, began admitting patients in January 2014  and provides skilled nursing care and related services for residents who either  need short-term rehabilitation services while recovering from surgery or  require long-term nursing and medical supervision. Mira Vista also operates two  in-house pulmonary designated wings. We believe the new state-of-the-art campus  has been a significant upgrade from existing skilled nursing facilities in the southwest  Fort Worth market. In addition, we believe Mira Vista receives referrals from  Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Southwest, a 222-bed general acute care  hospital, as well as the 62-bed HealthSouth City View Rehabilitation Hospital,  which are both approximately two miles from Mira Vista. As a result of these  relationships, Mira Vista has benefited from a consistent step-down patient  flow.
  
North  Brownsville Medical Plaza

North  Brownsville Medical Plaza is a 67,682-square-foot medical office building located  at 5700 North Expressway, Brownsville, Texas. North Brownsville Medical Plaza  is a state-of-the-art medical office building located in Brownsville, Texas.  The Brownsville metropolitan area population and its sister city of Matamoras, Mexico  has a population in excess of 750,000. We believe the building represents the  latest in healthcare facility design and was planned to meet the high  expectations and demands of the modern healthcare professional, as well as  setting the standard for integrated medicine delivery. Physicians and patients  have access to the latest in modern technology at the on-site surgery center,  full modality diagnostic center, physical therapy center, lab and physician  offices. North Brownsville Medical Plaza also boasts convenient and accessible  parking and first-class amenities. The building is currently leased to leading  physicians and physician groups in the Brownsville medical community.  Approximately 29% of the gross leasable area is leased to VBOA ASC Partners, which  operates a large surgery and diagnostic center within the North Brownsville  Medical Plaza. VBOA ASC Partners is owned by Tenet Healthcare and benefits from  a high volume of patient flow and is one of the premier surgery centers in Brownsville,  which provides us with a strong anchor tenant.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please   
    click here.

    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.

MedEquities Realty Trust Commits $11 Million For Mountain's Edge Hospital Expansion And Negotiates Enhanced Lease Terms On Fundamental Properties









PR Newswire




Apr 27, 2017 4:22 PM EDT













 
















































  NASHVILLE, Tenn., April 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MedEquities Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: MRT) announced it has entered into a new master lease arrangement, effective March 20, 2017, with a subsidiary of Fundamental Healthcare ("Fundamental") for four facilities, which is guaranteed by THI of Baltimore. These facilities were previously leased under separate triple-net leases.  Pursuant to the master lease, MedEquities has also agreed to make available up to a maximum amount of $11.0 million for Fundamental's expansion of the 130-bed Mountain's Edge, an acute care hospital in Las Vegas.     In addition to Mountain's Edge Hospital, the remaining facilities covered by the master lease include the 39-bed Horizon Specialty Hospital of Henderson, a long-term acute care hospital in Las Vegas, the 120-bed Physical Rehabilitation and Wellness Center of Spartanburg, a skilled nursing facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and the 142-bed Mira Vista Court, a skilled nursing facility in Fort Worth, Texas. The new master lease provides for an enhanced initial aggregate annualized base rent of $8.5 million. Base rents will increase by the lesser of CPI or 1.5% on the first three anniversaries of the master lease and 2.0% on each anniversary thereafter. In addition to the enhanced portfolio rent, the initial term of the master lease for each property has been reset and extended, with the Mountain's Edge and Horizon hospitals having an initial term of 15 years with an expiration in 2032, and the two skilled nursing facilities having an initial term of 12 years with an expiration in 2029.  The master lease includes two separate renewal terms of five years.  Fundamental has operated Mountain's Edge Hospital since its opening in 2015. With the continued growth in the market and the need to accommodate additional surgical demand at the hospital, Fundamental is undertaking the construction and equipping of five new surgical suites.  The $11 million maximum funding commitment from MedEquities, which will result in proportionate increases to the existing facility rent as advances are made, is expected to be disbursed through the first of quarter 2018 as construction is completed.  John McRoberts, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of MedEquities, noted, " Las Vegas is a growing and important market for Fundamental. We again are pleased to partner with Fundamental to provide the capital for these improvements at Mountain's Edge, which will allow them to better meet the increased service demand they are experiencing in that market."

The Company's management team has extensive industry experience in acquiring, owning, developing, financing, operating, leasing and monetizing many types of healthcare properties and portfolios.
