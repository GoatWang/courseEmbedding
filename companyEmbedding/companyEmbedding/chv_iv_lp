Ascension Ventures Finalizes Fourth Strategic Healthcare Venture Fund with Expanded Limited Partner Base | Business Wire
























































Ascension Ventures Finalizes Fourth Strategic Healthcare Venture Fund 
      with Expanded Limited Partner Base






December 06, 2016 01:03 PM Eastern Standard Time



ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ascension Ventures (AV) has finalized its latest strategic venture 
      capital fund at $255 million. This fourth fund for AV, CHV IV, L.P., 
      brings the firm’s total assets under management to more than $800 
      million. The new fund is backed by 13 health system partners, which 
      enable AV to continue to add value to its portfolio companies while 
      simultaneously delivering financial and strategic returns to the 
      partners.
    


      AV was launched in 2001 by Ascension, the nation’s largest Catholic and 
      nonprofit health system. Since then, AV has raised three successive 
      funds, while progressively expanding the limited partner base. AV has 
      brought the voice of the customer to the board room of the more than 55 
      companies in which it has invested.
    

      AV invests in healthcare companies that provide services and solutions 
      that help health systems in the areas of healthcare IT, healthcare 
      services, and medical devices. AV seeks portfolio companies that meet 
      the most pressing needs of its partners and their patients.
    

      “Ascension has been an early adopter of innovation investing, having 
      done this for more than 15 years and we are proud of the professional 
      and experienced AV team, its accomplishments, and the new partners who 
      have chosen to collaborate with us,” said Anthony R. Tersigni, EdD, 
      FACHE, President and Chief Executive Officer, Ascension.
    

      “In this time of continuous and monumental change, more health systems 
      are seeking out ways to transform their businesses to be successful for 
      the future healthcare reality,” said Matt Hermann, Senior Managing 
      Director at AV. “Our proven success of delivering benefit to our health 
      system partners and our portfolio companies has enabled AV to become a 
      critical component of the health venture ecosystem.”
    

      Success is measured not just in financial returns, but also by the value 
      added to limited partners. Many of the companies backed by AV have been 
      adopted by the partners and ultimately progressed to successful exits.
    

      Joining Ascension as limited partners in CHV IV are Adventist Health 
      System, Carle Foundation, Catholic Health Initiatives, CentraCare 
      Health, Children’s Medical Center of Dallas, Dignity Health, Inova 
      Health System, Intermountain Healthcare, Mercy, Novant Health, 
      OhioHealth and OSF HealthCare.
    

      “AV has been a great partner in many ways that have informed different 
      aspects of critical strategic decisions we are making every day,” said 
      Jeffrey Graff, Adventist Health System Vice President of Treasury and AV 
      Board member. “We have been exposed to and engaged with management teams 
      and companies that offer solutions that are important to our health 
      system.”
    

      “As Inova thinks about its future, we know that the status quo will not 
      suffice. We recognize that we must innovate to excel,” said Hooks 
      Johnston, Managing Director, Inova Strategic Investments and AV Board 
      member. “Our commitment to AV is a critical and complementary component 
      of our innovation initiative.”

					The CHV-RTHS is a wall-mounted remote temperature and relative humidity sensor designed for use with select Crestron thermostats. Using CAT5 or similar low-capacitance wire, the remote sensor may be mounted up to 500 feet from the thermostat. One-piece mounting and a single non-polarized twisted-pair connection make the CHV-RTHS simple to install. The 1-1/2 inch diameter face protrudes just 1/8 inch from the wall surface and is easily painted or wallpapered to blend into the wall surface. Up to two CHV-RTHS sensors may be connected to a single CHV-THSTAT, CHV-TSTAT or CHV-TSTATEX thermostat.
