	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS







	Certain statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of ZZLL Information Technology, Inc. (F/K/A Green Standard Technologies, Inc.) (the Company) to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Companys plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.










	PART I








	As used throughout this Annual Report, the terms ZZLL, Company, we, us, our or Registrant refer to ZZLL Information Technology Inc. and its subsidiaries.













	Item 1.


	Business



	 




	Background



	 


	ZZLL Information Technology, Inc. (F/K/A Green Standard Technologies, Inc.) (The Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 9, 2005, under the name of JML Holdings, Inc.  The Company merged with Baoshinn International Express, Inc. (BSIE) on March 31, 2006, by acquiring all of the issued and outstanding common stock of BSIE in a share exchange transaction. We issued 16,500,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of BSIE common stock.


	The transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization of BSIE whereby BSIE is deemed to be the accounting acquirer and is deemed to have adopted our capital structure.


	Effective on October 19, 2011, each of ten (10) shares of the Companys Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to that date (the Old Common Stock) were automatically and without any action on the part of the shareholders, reclassified and changed into one (1) share of the Companys outstanding Common Stock (the New Common Stock) with a par value $.0001 per share.


	On June 17, 2015, Baoshinn Corporation had been amended to the name Green Standard Technologies, Inc..


	On May 27, 2016, the Company changed its name with the State of Nevada from Green Standard Technologies, Inc. to ZZLL Information Technology, Inc.


	On March 4, 2013 the Company acquired all the outstanding stock of Olive Oils Direct International Inc. (OODI), a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Wyoming. In accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement between the parties, certain Companys shareholders (the Company Selling Shareholders) transferred 1,485,000 shares of the common stock of the Company (the Company Shares) to the shareholders of OODI (the OODI Shareholders). In return, the OODI Shareholders transferred all the outstanding shares of common stock of OODI to the Company, and they paid $100,000.00 in cash to the Company Selling Shareholders. In addition, immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition, the Company spun off its operating subsidiary, Hong Kong Holdings, Inc., to its shareholders. OODI is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company.


	The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger, since the original stockholders of the OODI own a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company stock immediately following the completion of the transaction on March 4, 2013. OODI was the legal acquiree but deemed to be the accounting acquirer, the Company was the legal acquirer but deemed to be the accounting acquiree in the reverse merger. The historical financial statements prior to the acquisition are those of the accounting acquirer (OODI). Historical stockholders equity of the acquirer prior to the merger was acquirers stockholders equity. Operations prior to the merger are those of the acquirer. After completion of the transaction, the Companys consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries, the operations and cash flow of the Company and its subsidiaries.

	OODI is a development-stage company that plans to develop and operate a retail internet website specializing in gourmet Italian food products. Those products shall include olive oils, pastas, vinegars and other gourmet Italian food items. In addition, in the future OODI may offer cooking items, such as utensils, cooking tools and similar products from other countries. OODI is currently developing an e-commerce website by the name of

	www.OliveOilsDirect.com

	that will sell products inventoried by OliveOilsDirect.com and other products offered by other large well-established retailers. OODI is a development stage company and is subject to compliance under ASC915-15. It is devoting its resources to establishing the new business, and its planned operations have not yet commenced; accordingly, no revenues have been earned during the period from April 15, 2011 (date of inception) to March 31, 2015.


	On March 31, 2015, the Company disposed the operation unit of OODI for US$1,000 to Jet Express Trading Limited, a Hong Kong registered company.


	On April 23, 2013 the Company incorporated a subsidiary company in Hong Kong under the name Syndicore Asia Limited.


	On April 1, 2013, the Board of Directors resolved to pay an officer for a monthly service fee of US$4,250. The fee was raised to US$10,000 per month as of October 1, 2013. The Company has an option to pay the officer by common stock in lieu of cash at a rate of $0.005 per share.  During 2013, the Company issued 1,700,000 shares on June 3, 2013; 850,000 shares on July 2, 2013; 850,000 shares on August 5, 2013 and 850,000 shares on September 6, 2013 with an aggregate of 4,250,000 shares in lieu of $21,250 compensation to the officer. The amounts recorded were about $85,000 at fair price per ASC 718.  


	On May 31, 2013 the Registrant completed an offering of 15,000,000 shares of its common stock. These shares were sold to a total of eighteen (18) shareholders for a total consideration of $75,000. These shares were sold on a private placement basis and the Company paid no commission in connection with such sales.


	On November 15, 2013 we forfeited and canceled 3,365,000 shares common stock which was subscribed by four (4) shareholders on May 31, 2013. However, they did not fulfill their payment obligation on the shares that were valued at $16,825 according to the subscription term. The Company forfeited and canceled such 3,365,000 common shares.


	On May 27, 2016, ZZLL Information Limited acquired 4,992,500 common shares of the Company through a private Common Stock Purchase Agreement for investment purposes in the ordinary course of business. The aggregate number and percentage of common shares of the Issuer beneficially owned by Mr. Wei Liang is 4,992,500 common shares, or approximately 26.662% of the 18,725,003 issued common shares.


	On June 14, 2016, Wei Liang (Mr. Liang) was appointed to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of ZZLL Information Technology, Inc.


	On June 24, 2016, ZZLL Technology Limited acquired 4,895,000 common shares of the Company through a private Common Stock Purchase Agreement for investment purposes in the ordinary course of business. The aggregate number and percentage of common shares of the Issuer beneficially owned by Mr. Wei Zhu is 4,895,000 common shares, or approximately 26.142% of the 18,725,003 issued common shares.


	On August 18, 2016, the Company through SAL entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) with Network Service Management Limited, a Hong Kong company (NSML) in the formation of Z-Line International E-Commerce Company Limited (Z-Line), a Hong Kong based e-Commerce company. The Company through SAL owned 55% of Z-Line that provides consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer and business-to-business-sales services via web portals.


	On August 25, 2016 and September 20, 2016, the Company issued 6,696,500 common shares and 32,000,000 common shares to the officer respectively. The issuance with an aggregate of 38,696,500 common shares in lieu of $193,483 compensation to the officer under an option resolved in 2013 to pay the officer by common stock in lieu of cash at a rate of $0.005 per share.

	Syndicore Asia Limited  Video Syndication



	 


	Syndicore Asia Limited (SAL) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of Hong Kong.  SAL is an online media company that syndicates video in a cloud-based, multimedia conduit serving a growing, global community of content creators, news outlets and leading brands. SAL will be a provider of syndicated video media to news organizations in the Asia Pacific region. In addition, SAL plans to aggregate content from the Asia Pacific region and provide it to news organizations around the world.


	On December 15, 2013, SAL entered into a Distribution Agreement (the Distribution Agreement) with SendtoNews Video, Inc., a British Columbia company (STN). Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, SAL was granted an exclusive license to use, modify, edit, reproduce, distribute, feed, store, communicate, display, and transmit STNs content in the Asia Pacific Territory (the Content). STN is the content provider for various worldwide sporting events. STN would also provide on-going assistance to SAL with regard to technical, administrative, and service-orientated issues relating to the delivery, utilization, transmission, storage and maintenance of the Content.


	On January 20, 2014, SAL entered into a revised Distribution Agreement whereby STN has agreed to provide SAL transferrable rights for the use, reproduction, storage, display, and transmission of certain content subject to pre-approval in writing from STN. In addition, the revised Distribution Agreement includes changes to the revenue sharing terms, and adds a share of advertising revenue directly resulting from aggregated content by SAL within the territory.


	SAL will strive to become a leading digital content provider for the Asia Pacific region, capitalizing on an explosively growing market with local, regional and national content that was previously unavailable in the area. This is a new and exciting market, and offers exciting opportunities for expansion and growth. There is no assurance, however, that SAL will be successful in its efforts.


	On the other side of the distribution chain, we plan to create SALs own proprietary news partnerships to provide guaranteed content distribution in return for a corresponding share of advertising revenues to a news industry looking to supplement their rapidly declining traditional ad revenue with viable digital-age revenue.

	Management believes that SALs customers will be willing to pay a premium CPM because:


	  The ability to sponsor exclusive, highly sought-after short form video content


	  Deep, creative advertising opportunities  other than rudimentary logo/banner overlays and pre-roll


	  Premium positioning


	  Unprecedented transparency and near real-time performance metrics to evaluate their investment


	  Securing sponsorships with related enterprises


	  Stronger control over distribution to help target intended audience.


	  SAL currently has a mobile app in development and hope to move into that segment of the market. SAL has been engineering its own cutting edge, interactive mobile app for smart phones and tablet use. App functionality will also be targeted to allow user uploads of local content for events that have no rights holders but are of local interest. The market potential for mobile apps is increasing.


	  In addition, we also hope to use our website platform and mobile application to expand into other areas of online content such as news clips, amateur video, social media, games or gaming applications, premium direct content sales and live broadcasting. Online applications and mobile platforms may also be used in a multitude of ways including advertising, direct sales, targeted ad campaigns, items or ideas promotions.  These online applications allow the SAL the opportunity to diversify into any number of broad spectrum businesses which rely on communicating with a direct audience across a wide spectrum of media platforms.

	  Other segments of the market are also benefiting.  The high and rapidly increasing popularity of social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are expected to revolutionize the marketing strategies employed in areas such as the pharmaceuticals industry. There, in addition to marketing, an increasing number of pharma players have also begun leveraging these platforms to enhance consumer relationships and improve brand management, based on the market intelligence generated by monitoring and analyzing user-generated content. The ability to incorporate consumer feedback to develop new products is also expected to initiate a strategic shift in the operational model of pharma companies. Social media involvements are expected to increase product sales, especially those of OTC drugs, in the long term. Novartis for instance has already begun using YouTube and Facebook to enhance the sales for its OTC drugs such as Comtrex, Orofar and Bufferin. Johnson &Johnson, one of the first pharma giants to enter the social media space, has used online platforms for crisis management  when the company recalled its products (Tylenol and Benadryl tablets) it used social websites to apologize to consumers for irregularities in its manufacturing plant found during FDA inspection.


	Subsequently, on January 20, 2014, the parties entered into a revised Distribution Agreement whereby STN has agreed to provide SAL transferrable rights for the use, reproduction, storage, display, and transmission of certain content subject to pre-approval in writing from STN.

	Green Standard Technologies Enterprises, Inc. (F/K/A Green Standard Technologies, Inc.)  Service Provider to the Cannabis Industry



	 


	On August 1, 2014 the Company formed Green Standard Technologies, Inc. (F/K/A Green Standard Technologies, Inc.) (GSTE) as a wholly owned incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada.  The Companys second line of business is carried on by this subsidiary.


	On June 6, 2015, Green Standard Technologies Inc. amended their name to Green Standard Technologies Enterprises, Inc.


	GSTE is in the medical and recreation marijuana industry, and the establishment of a website will be used to further its business by providing customers with medical and recreational marijuana resources. Management believes that this online presence is essential in developing and expanding their existing business.


	On October 29, 2014, GSTE entered into a Website Development Agreement with Social Asylum Inc. (SAI). Under the terms of the Agreement SAI has agreed to provide a fully functioning ecommerce website with unique and proprietary functions according to a mutually agreed upon set of features and milestones for a minimum cost of $150,000; however, the cost could potentially be higher depending on the finalized functionality, scope and details. Also included are plans for launch, market and geographic expansion.


	GSTE is developing software and support solutions for the cannabis industry.   The new business model will consist of a website [www.greenNVY.com] and business management software available to cannabis retailers in those states where the sale of cannabis is legal, either for medical purposes or for recreational purposes.  The website will provide a platform for cannabis retailers to interface with retail customers.  It will also allow for the creation of an online community for retailers and the consumer.  The website will feature a clean, uncluttered and professional interface where the consumers can explore menus while researching strains of cannabis and pricing of cannabis from multiple sources.  The website will allow consumers to get discounts and coupons, which will encourage them to try new stores.    It will contain a geographical target map of the closest cannabis retail locations with a full profile of each retail outlet.  In addition, it will contain a social platform which will allow consumers to chat with each other and read and post reviews within the community.  In addition, it will create menu searches that can help the consumer quickly locate their favorite type or brand of cannabis products and services.


	For a retailer the website will provide a cloud based business management system that centralizes and automates every aspect of running their business.  It will provide encrypted communications through GSTEs proprietary whisper email and instant messaging platform.  It will also provide advertising opportunities in order to allow the retailer to develop new customers.  The software will also provide the retailer with global applications which outline menu and review information for each retail location.  It will provide mobile coupons through proximity marketing, email and text messages.  In addition, it will administer customer loyalty programs and customer porting features that include consumers past orders.   For the retailers business, it will offer employee management and human resources applications, payroll management, and employee scheduling.  It will also offer retailers payment processing, integration and inventory management.  The software will also provide the retailer with a sophisticated level of reporting of all the activity in the store, sales reporting by hour, day, etc., and reports of the bestselling products broken down by category, average sale total and spot trends.   


	At the current time, 23 states have legalized the medicinal use of marijuana and another 10 states are currently considering legalization.   In addition, 4 states have made recreational use of cannabis legal, and there are several other states considering legalization of recreational use.  


	Revenues will be generated from retailers based on monthly subscriptions to the management software and placement on the website.  The fees will depend upon what types of features, functionality, marketing, advertising and exposure retailers with to have. In addition, GSTE will generate revenues from banner and text messages, blast advertising, and proximity marketing of email newsletter ads.


	GSTE is currently in the startup stage and has no earnings to date.  Once it becomes fully operational its business will be strictly to provide products and services to the cannabis industry.  GSTE will not be involved in the purchase or sale of cannabis products.


	Managements plans to support GSTEs operations by raising funds through the sale of the Companys securities and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation.  If we do not raise all of the money we need from the sale of securities, we will have to find alternative sources, such as loans from our officers, directors or others.  If we cant raise enough cash, we will either have to suspend operations until the cash is raised, or cease business entirely.

	Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015




	 



	Revenues Composition and Sources of Revenue Growth



	In the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we derived no revenues from our current business operations from SAL and the newly formed Z-Line.


	We anticipate that we will generate revenue from website business and operations, although there is no assurance that this will occur, and we have not started to receive revenues yet from that business.


	 



	Cost of Sale and Gross Profit



	We do not have any revenue, lead to the result that we have no cost of sales and gross profit for the current period.


	Our cost of sales remained the same at 0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. This was due to the fact that current operations have not yet started.


	Our gross profit margin rate remained the same at 0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. This was due to the fact that current operations have not yet started.  


	 



	General and Administrative Expenses




	 




	General and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $242,070 compared to $247,239 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.  







	13







	Other Expenses (Income)




	 




	Other expenses (income) consists of management service income, interest income and interest expenses.  Only the interest expenses amount for $199 is recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $Nil for the year ended December 31, 2015.



	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	There being no income taxes recorded or paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 



	Exchange Gain



	 


	The exchange gain was $Nil for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $Nil in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.


	 



	Net (loss) Income



	 


	Our net loss was $235,737 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to a net loss of $247,239 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.  There was an attribution of loss to non-controlling interest of $6,531 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $Nil for the year ended December 31, 2015.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, 

	Cautionary


	Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies

	 (FRR 60), suggesting companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. In FRR 60, the SEC defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and operating results, and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include: inventory valuation, which affects cost of sales and gross margin; policies for revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, and stock-based compensation. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying these most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on our results we report in our consolidated financial statements.


	 



	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	 


	We account for impairment of property, plant and equipment in accordance with FASB ASC 360. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset. Fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for the cost to dispose. During the reporting years, there was no impairment loss incurred. Competitive pricing pressure and changes in interest rates, could materially and adversely affect our estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by our long-lived assets.


	 





	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	Operating Activities Going Concern



	We had a net loss of $242,269 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and a net loss since inception on April 15, 2011 of $1,095,316. The 2016 and 2015 loss were generated as a result of paying all necessary administrative expenses. On December 31,2016 we had cash on hand of $58,174. The accumulative loss has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These doubts were outlined in Note 14 to our independent auditors report on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. Although our Consolidated Financial Statements raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, they did not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts or classifications of liabilities that might be necessary in the event we cannot continue as a going concern. Certain of our shareholders have verbally agreed to provide financial support to us for losses we may incur in the future.

	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities



	 


	Net cash used in operating activities was $414,464 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $37,747 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash used during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 is mainly due to the settlement of other payables and accrued liabilities..

	Net cash used in investing activities was $Nil for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to net cash generated in investing activities of $22,942 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The changes was due to the disposal of subsidiary OODI in the year 2015.

	Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


	 


	The Companys internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations which may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 


	Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or (COSO). The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a companys internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2016.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys internal control over financial reporting.


	 



	Regulatory Statement



	 


	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. As a Smaller Reporting Company managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm.

	Compliance with Section 16(A) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934



	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our Directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of change in ownership of common stock and other equity securities of the Company. Officers, Directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely upon a review of Forms 3 and 4 and amendments thereto furnished to us under Rule 16a-3(e) during the year ended December 31, 2016, Forms 5 and any amendments thereto furnished to us with respect to the year ended December 31, 2016, and the representations made by the reporting persons to us, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2016, our executive officers and Directors and all persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.


	 



	Code of Business Conduct and Ethics



	Our board of directors adopted an informal Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to, all our officers, directors, employees and agents. Certain provisions of the Code apply specifically to our president and secretary (being our principle executive officer, principle financial officer and principle accounting officer, controller), as well as persons performing similar functions. As adopted, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets forth written standards that are designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote the following:


	1. Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;


	2.  Full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we file with, or submit to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications made by us;


	3.  Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;


	4.  The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to an appropriate person identified in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; and


	5.  Accountability for adherence to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.


	Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires, among other things, that all of our Companys senior officers commit to timely, accurate and consistent disclosure of information; that they maintain confidential information; and that they act with honesty and integrity.


	In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes that all employees, and particularly senior officers, have a responsibility for maintaining financial integrity within our Company, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, and federal and state securities laws. Any senior officer who becomes aware of any incidents involving financial or accounting manipulation or other irregularities, whether by witnessing the incident or being told of it, must report it to our management.


	We will provide a copy of our code of ethics without charge to any person that requests it. Any such request should be made in writing to the attention of Sean Webster, Chief Executive Officer, ZZLL Information Technology, Inc., Room 1307, 13/F., Wellborne Commercial Centre, 8 Java Road, North Point,  Hong Kong.


	 



	Committees of the Board of Directors



	We do not presently have a separately designated standing audit committee, compensation committee, nominating committee, executive committee or any other committees of our Board of Directors. The functions of those committees are currently undertaken by our Board of Directors. Because we have only one Director, we believe that the creation of these committees, at this time, would be cumbersome and constitute more form over substance.



	 




	Audit Committee



	 


	We have not established a separately designated standing audit committee nor do we have an audit committee financial expert serving on our Board of Directors. However, the Company intends to establish a new audit committee of the Board of Directors that shall consist of independent Directors.  The audit committees duties will be to recommend to the Companys Board of Directors the engagement of an independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Companys financial statements and to review the Companys accounting and auditing principles.  The audit committee will review the scope, timing and fees for the annual audit and the results of audit examinations performed by the internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm, including their recommendations to improve the system of accounting and internal controls.  The audit committee shall at all times be composed exclusively of Directors who are, in the opinion of the Companys Board of Directors, free from any relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as a committee member and who possess an understanding of financial statements and generally accepted accounting principles.

	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm








	To: The Board of Directors and Shareholders of


	ZZLL Information Technology, Inc. and Subsidiaries:


	 


	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ZZLL Information Technology, Inc.  and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. These consolidated financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern under the generally accepted accounting principles. As described in Note 3, the Company has recurring comprehensive loss $242,269, has negative working capital $39,999, and has accumulated deficit $1,827,188 and a total stockholders' deficit $353,980, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to this matter are also discussed in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 


	Except the going concern matter as described above, in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and comprehensive loss, and its cash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	(Stated in US Dollars)






	NOTE 1.


	ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION





	ZZLL Information Technology, Inc. (F/K/A Green Standard Technologies, Inc.) (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 9, 2005, under the name of JML Holdings, Inc.


	  


	On March 31, 2006, the Company consummated a merger (the Merger) with Bao Shinn International Express Limited (BSIE) by issuing 16,500,000 shares in the share exchange transaction for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of BSIE common stock.  As a result of the share exchange transaction, BSIE became our wholly-owned subsidiary.  BSIE owns 55% of Bao Shinn Holidays Limited (BSHL).


	 


	During the year ended March 31, 2009, the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Group) issued 2,400,000 restricted common shares of $0.001 per share at a value of $0.3 per share with a net proceeds of approximately $624,000 and redeemed 2,500,000 restricted common shares and these shares are classified as not issued and outstanding.


	 


	Effective on October 19, 2011, each of ten (10) shares of the Companys common stock, par value $.001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the Old Common Stock) shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be reclassified as and changed, pursuant, into one (1) share of the Companys outstanding Common Stock (the New Common Stock).


	 


	On March 4, 2013 the Company acquired all the outstanding stock of Olive Oils Direct International Inc. (OODI), a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Wyoming. In accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement between the parties, certain Companys shareholders (the Company Selling Shareholders) transferred 1,485,000 shares of the common stock of the Company (the Company Shares) to the shareholders of OODI (the OODI Shareholders). In return, the OODI Shareholders transferred all of the outstanding shares of common stock of OODI to the Company, and they paid $100,000.00 in cash to the Company Selling Shareholders. In addition, immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition, the Company spun off its operating subsidiary, Hong Kong Holdings, Inc., to its shareholders. OODI is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.


	 


	The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger, since the original stockholders of the OODI own a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company stock immediately following the completion of the transaction on March 4, 2013. OODI was the legal acquiree but deemed to be the accounting acquirer, the Company was the legal acquirer but deemed to be the accounting acquiree in the reverse merger. The historical financial statements prior to the acquisition are those of the accounting acquirer (OODI). Historical stockholders equity of the acquirer prior to the merger was acquirers stockholders equity. Operations prior to the merger are those of the acquirer. After completion of the transaction, the Companys consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries, the operations and cash flow of the Company and its subsidiaries.


	 


	OODI is a development-stage company that plans to develop and operate a retail internet website specializing in gourmet Italian food products. These products are expected to include olive oils, pastas, vinegars and other gourmet Italian food items. In addition, in the future OODI may offer cooking items, such as utensils, cooking tools and similar products from other countries. OODI is currently developing an e-commerce website by the name of


	www.OliveOilsDirect.com


	that will sell products inventoried by OliveOilsDirect.com and other products offered by other large well-established retailers. OODI is a development stage company and is subject to compliance under ASC915-15. It is devoting its resources to establishing the new business, and its planned operations have not yet commenced; accordingly, no revenues have been earned during the period from April 15, 2011 (date of inception) to March 31, 2015.


	 


	On March 31, 2015, the Company disposed the operation unit of OODI for US$1,000 to Jet Express Trading Limited, a Hong Kong registered company.

	GOING CONCERN



	 



	The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted principles in the United States applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has accumulated deficits of $1,827,188, generated a net loss of $242,269 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and its current liabilities exceed its current assets resulting in negative working capital of $39,999. In view of the matters described above, recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts and realization of the portion of current liabilities into revenue shown in the accompanying balance sheets are dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn are dependent upon the Company's ability to raise additional financing and to succeed in its future operations.  The Company may need additional cash resources to operate during the upcoming 12 months, and the continuation of the Company may be dependent upon the continuing financial support of investors, directors and/or shareholders of the Company. However, there is no assurance that equity or debt offerings will be successful in raising sufficient funds to assure the eventual profitability of the Company. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 


	Management has taken the following steps to revise its operating and financial requirements, which it believes are sufficient to provide the Company with the ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is actively pursuing additional funding which would enhance capital employed and strategic partners which would increase revenue bases or reduce operation expenses. Management believes that the above actions will allow the Company to continue its operations throughout this fiscal year.

	Basis of presentation and consolidation




	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.


	 


	On June 29, 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the single source of authoritative US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for all non-governmental entities Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and also sources of authoritative US GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification does not change US GAAP but takes previously issued FASB standards and other U.S. GAAP authoritative pronouncements, changes the way the standards are referred to, and includes them in specific topic arrears. The adoption of the Codification did not have any impact on the Groups financial statements.


	 


	The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars and include the accounts of the Group and its subsidiaries.  All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

	NOTE 4.


	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)



	 





	Use of estimates




	 


	In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year.  These accounts and estimates include, but are not limited to, the valuation of accounts receivable, deferred income taxes and the estimation on useful lives of plant and equipment.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	Concentrations of credit risk




	 


	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable.  In respect of accounts receivable, the Group extends credit based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral or other security.  In order to minimize the credit risk, the management of the Group has delegated a team responsibility for determination of credit limits, credit approvals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue debts.  Further, the Group reviews the recoverable amount of each individual trade debt at each balance sheet date to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made for irrecoverable amounts.  In this regard, the directors of the Group consider that the Groups credit risk is significantly reduced.  


	 




	Cash and cash equivalents




	 


	Cash and cash equivalents include all cash, deposits in banks and other highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less.


	 


	 


	Accounts receivable




	 


	Accounts receivable are stated at original amount less allowance made for doubtful receivables, if any, based on a review of all outstanding amounts at the year end.  An allowance is also made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to original terms of receivables.  Bad debts are written off when identified.  The Group extends unsecured credit to customers in the normal course of business and believes all accounts receivable in excess of the allowances for doubtful receivables to be fully collectible.  The Group does not accrue interest on trade accounts receivable. The Group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis credit evaluations are preferred on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.  The Group had experienced the bad debts of $nil and $nil during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively.


	 




	Plant and equipment




	 


	Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Cost represents the purchase price of the asset and other costs incurred to bring the asset into its existing use.  Maintenance, repairs and betterments, including replacement of minor items, are charged to expense; major additions to physical properties are capitalized.


	 


	Depreciation of plant and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates:
















	 


	 


	 


	 


	 






	 






	Furniture and fixtures





	20% - 50%





	 





	 






	 





	Office equipment





	20%





	 





	 






	 



	Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.

	NOTE 4.


	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)



	 





	Revenue recognition




	 


	The Group recognizes revenue when it is earned and realizable based on the following criteria: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.


	 


	The Group also evaluates the presentation of revenue on a gross versus a net basis through application of Emerging Issues Task Force No. (EITF) 99-19,

	Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent

	. The consensus of this literature is that the presentation of revenue as the gross amount billed to a customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or services or the net amount retained (that is, the amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to a supplier) because it has earned a commission or fee is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. In making an evaluation of this issue, some of the factors that should be considered are: whether the Group is the primary obligor in the arrangement (strong indicator); whether it has general inventory risk (before customer order is placed or upon customer return) (strong indicator); and whether we have latitude in establishing price. The guidance clearly indicates that the evaluations of these factors, which at times can be contradictory, are subject to significant judgment and subjectivity. If the conclusion drawn is that the Group performs as an agent or a broker without assuming the risks and rewards of ownership of goods, revenue should be reported on a net basis.


	 




	Advertising expenses




	 


	Advertising expenses are charged to expense as incurred. The advertising expenses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $Nil and $293 respectively.


	 


	 


	Income Taxes




	 


	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	The FASB issued Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740) Income Taxes. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This requires that an entity recognized in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The adoption of ASC 740 did not have any impact on the Groups results of operations or financial condition for the year ended 31 December, 2016.  As of the date of the adoption of ASC 740, the Group has no material unrecognized tax benefit which would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods.  The Group has elected to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.


	 




	Comprehensive income




	 


	Other comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under U.S. GAAP are included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net income as these amounts are recorded as a component of stockholders equity.  The Groups other comprehensive income represented foreign currency translation adjustments.

	Foreign currency translation




	 


	The functional currency of the Group is Hong Kong dollars (HK$).  The Group maintains its financial statements in the functional currency.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet dates.  Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchanges rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. In 2015, the exchange rate being used to translate amount in HK$ is fixed at 7.8 to 1 for the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements which is derived from October 17, 1983 monetary policy from Hong Kong Monetary Authority where the Hong Kong dollar was pegged at a rate of 7.8 HK$ = 1 US$, through the currency board system with a limited floating range from 7.85 to 7.75.  Exchange gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of net income for the respective periods.


	 


	For financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Group which are prepared using the functional currency have been translated into United States dollars.  Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates and stockholders equity is translated at historical exchange rates.  Any translation adjustments resulting are not included in determining net income but are included in foreign exchange adjustment to other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity.

	The carrying values of the Groups financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, deposits, trade and other payables approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of such instruments. The carrying amounts of borrowings approximate their fair values because the applicable interest rates approximate current market rates.


	 




	Stock-based Compensation




	 


	Share-based compensation including stock options and common stock awards issued to employees and directors for services and are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 718 "Compensation - Stock Compensation" and share-based compensation including warrants and common stock awards issued to consultants and nonemployees are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50 "Equity-Based Payment to Non-employees.  All grant of common stock awards and stock options/warrants to employees and directors are recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. Awards to consultants and nonemployees are recognized based upon their fair value as of the earlier of a commitment date or completion of services. The grant date(s) of all awards are determined under the guidance of ASC 718-10-25-5. The Company estimates fair value of common stock awards based the quoted price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. The fair value of stock options and warrants is determined using the appropriate option pricing model depends on the applicable of situation.





	On April 1, 2013, the Board of Director resolved to pay an officer for a monthly service fee of US$4,250. The fee was raised to US$10,000 per month as at October 1, 2013. The Company has an option to pay the officer by common stock in lieu of cash at a rate of $0.005 per share.  During 2013, the Company issued 1,700,000 shares on June 3, 2013; 850,000 shares on July 2, 2013; 850,000 shares on August 5, 2013 and 850,000 shares on September 6, 2013 with an aggregate of 4,250,000 shares in lieu of $21,250 compensation to the officer. The amounts recorded were about $85,000 at fair price per ASC 718.

	Basic and diluted earnings per share




	 


	The Group computes earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with FASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 (ASC 260) Earnings Per Share, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98 (SAB 98). ASC 260 requires companies with complex capital structures to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as the income or loss available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g., convertible securities, options, and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.


	 


	The calculation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016 is based on the estimate fair value of the Groups common stock during such periods applied to options using the treasury stock method to determine if they are dilutive.


	  


	Effective on October 19, 2011, each of ten (10) shares of the Companys Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the Old Common Stock) shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be reclassified as and changed, pursuant, into one (1) share of the Companys outstanding Common Stock (the New Common Stock).

	Recently issued accounting pronouncements




	 


	The FASB has issued ASU No. 2015-06 about Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, which contains guidance that addresses master limited partnerships that originated from Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 07-4. This amendment in this Update specify that for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class method, the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. In that circumstance, the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements) would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. Qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method also are required. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted.


	 


	The FASB has issued ASU No. 2015-07 about Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, which permits a reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of certain investments using the net asset value per share of the investment. The amendments in this Update remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The amendments in this Update apply to reporting entities that elect to measure the fair value of an investment within the related scope by using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient.


	 


	The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). The amendments apply to reporting entities that elect to measure the fair value of an investment using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient.


	 


	Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, permits a reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of certain investments using the net asset value per share of the investment. Currently, investments valued using the practical expedient are categorized within the fair value hierarchy on the basis of whether the investment is redeemable with the investee at net asset value on the measurement date, never redeemable with the investee at net asset value, or redeemable with the investee at net asset value at a future date. For investments that are redeemable with the investee at a future date, a reporting entity must consider the length of time until those investments become redeemable to determine the classification within the fair value hierarchy.



	The amendments remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient.


	 


	The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. A reporting entity should apply the amendments retrospectively to all periods presented. The retrospective approach requires that an investment for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient be removed from the fair value hierarchy in all periods presented in an entitys financial statements. Earlier application is permitted.


	 


	The FASB has issued No. 2016-07 Topic 323, InvestmentsEquity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, which aims to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in this Update affect all entities that have an investment that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted.

	The FASB has issued No. 2016-08 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which requires the entity to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide good or service to the customer (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). This determination is based upon whether the entity controls the good or the service before it is transferred to the customer. The amendments in this Update affect entities with transactions included within the scope of Topic 606. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of Update 2014-09. Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year.

The amendments in this Update affect all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments eliminate the guidance in Topic 718 that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period.


	 


	The FASB has issued No. 2016-10 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The amendments in this Update clarify that contractual provisions that, explicitly or implicitly, require an entity to transfer control of additional goods or services to a customer (for example, by requiring the entity to transfer control of additional rights to use or rights to access intellectual property that the customer does not already control) should be distinguished from contractual provisions that, explicitly or implicitly, define the attributes of a single promised license (for example, restrictions of time, geographical region, or use). The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective.


	 


	The Company has considered all new accounting pronouncements and has concluded that there are no new pronouncements that may have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, based on current information.

	PENSION PLANS



	 



	In 2016, the Group participates in a defined contribution pension scheme under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance (MPF Scheme) for all its eligible employees in Hong Kong.


	 


	The MPF Scheme is available to all employees aged 18 to 64 with at least 60 days of service in the employment in Hong Kong.  Contributions are made by the Groups subsidiary operating in Hong Kong at 5% of the participants relevant income with a ceiling of HK$30,000.  The participants are entitled to 100% of the Groups contributions together with accrued returns irrespective of their length of service with the Group, but the benefits are required by law to be preserved until the retirement age of 65.  The only obligation of the Group with respect to MPF Scheme is to make the required contributions under the plan.


	 


	In the year ended December 31, 2016, the assets of the schemes are controlled by trustees and held separately from those of the Group.  In 2016, no assets are allocated to pension. Total pension cost was $Nil during year ended December 31, 2016 (2015: $Nil).


	 



	NOTE 11.


	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS



	 



	The Group adopted FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), related to the Groups financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:


	 


	Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.


	 


	Level 2  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.


	 


	Level 3  unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.


	 


	ASC 820 also provides guidance for determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active, and for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate when a transaction is not orderly.


	 


	The effective date for certain aspects of ASC 820 was deferred and is currently being evaluated by the Group. Areas impacted by the deferral relate to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The effects of these remaining aspects of ASC 820 are to be applied by the Group to fair value measurements prospectively beginning November 1, 2010. The adoption of the remaining aspects of ASC 820 is not expected to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.

included in this Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange
Act”). This information may involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results,
performance or achievements of ZZLL Information Technology, Inc.
(the “Company”), to be materially different from future
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which
involve assumptions and describe future plans, strategies and

the words “may,” “will,”
“should,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “estimate,”
“believe,” “intend,” or
“project” or the negative of these words or other
variations on these words or comparable terminology. These
forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be
incorrect, and there can be no assurance that these projections
included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass.
Actual results of the Company could differ materially from those
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result
of various factors. Except as required by applicable laws, the
Company has no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking
statements for any reason.  This Quarterly Report, and unless
otherwise noted, the words "we," "our," "us," the "Company," "ZZLL"

information

 




ZZLL
Information Technology, Inc. (F/K/A Green Standard Technologies,
Inc.) (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Nevada on September 9, 2005, under the name of JML
Holdings, Inc.

On March
31, 2006, the Company consummated a merger (the
“merger”) with Bao Shinn International Express Limited
(“BSIE”) by issuing 16,500,000 shares in the share
exchange transaction for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares
of BSIE common stock. As a result of the share exchange
transaction, BSIE became our wholly-owned subsidiary. BSIE owns 55%
of Bao Shinn Holidays Limited (“BSHL”)

 

During the
year ended March 31, 2009, the Company and its subsidiaries
(collectively referred to as the “Group”) issued
2,400,000 restricted common shares of $0.001 per share at a value
of $0.3 per share with a net proceeds of approximately $624,000 and
redeemed 2,500,000 restricted common shares and these shares are
classified as not issued and outstanding.

 

Effective
on October 19, 2011, each of ten (10) shares of the Company’s
Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the “Old Common
Stock” shall automatically and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be reclassified as and changed into one (1)
share of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock, the
“New Common Stock”

 

On March
4, 2013 the Company acquired all the outstanding stock of Olive
Oils Direct International, Inc. (“OODI”), a corporation
formed under the laws of the State of Wyoming. In accordance with
the terms of the Exchange Agreement between the parties, certain
Company's shareholders (the “Company Selling
Shareholders”) transferred 1,485,000 shares of the common
stock of the Company (the “Company Shares”) to the
shareholders of OODI (the “OODI Shareholders”). In
return, the OODI Shareholders transferred all of the outstanding
shares of common stock of OODI to the Company, and they paid
$100,000.00 in cash to the Company Selling Shareholders. In
addition, immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition, the
Company spun off its operating subsidiary, Hong Kong Holdings,
Inc., to its shareholders. OODI is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company.

 

The
transaction was accounted for as a “reverse merger,”
since the original stockholders of the OODI own a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Company stock immediately following the
completion of the transaction on March 4, 2013. OODI was the legal
acquiree but deemed to be the accounting acquirer, the Company was
the legal acquirer but deemed to be the accounting acquiree in the
reverse merger. The historical financial statements prior to the
acquisition are those of the accounting acquirer (OODI). Historical
stockholders' equity of the acquirer prior to the merger was
acquirer’s stockholders’ equity. Operations prior to
the merger are those of the acquirer. After completion of the
transaction, the Company’s consolidated financial statements
include the assets and liabilities of the Company and its
subsidiaries, the operations and cash flow of the Company and its
subsidiaries

 

OODI is a
development-stage company that plans to develop and operate a
retail internet website specializing in gourmet Italian food
products. These products are expected to include olive oils,
pastas, vinegars and other gourmet Italian food items. In addition,
in the future OODI may offer cooking items, such as utensils,
cooking tools and similar products from other countries. OODI is
currently developing an e-commerce website by the name of 
www.OliveOilsDirect.com
 that will sell products inventoried by OliveOilsDirect.com
and other products offered by other large well-established
retailers. OODI is a “development stage company” and is
subject to compliance under ASC915-15. It is devoting its resources
to establishing the new business, and its planned operations have
not yet commenced; accordingly, no revenues have been earned during
the period from April 15, 2011 (date of inception) to March 31,
2015.

 

On March
31, 2015, the Company disposed the operation unit of OODI for

company.

Going
concern

 

 

The
financial statements at September 30, 2016, at Dec 31, 2015
and for the period from April 15, 2011 (date of inception), to
September 30, 2016, have been prepared on a going concern basis,
which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of
liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
 The Company incurred an accumulated loss of $1,717,792 for
the period from April 15, 2011 (date of inception), to September
30, 2016. It has not generated any revenues and no revenues are
anticipated until we begin selling inventoried products. These
conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern.

 

Management’s
plans to support the Company in operation and to maintain its
business strategy is to raise funds through public and private
offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform
essential functions with minimal compensation.  If we do not
raise all of the money we need from a public offering, we will have
to find alternative sources, such as a private placement of
securities, or loans from our officers, directors or others.
 If we require additional cash and can’t raise it, we
will either have to suspend operations until the cash is raised, or
cease business entirely.

 

The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the
amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

Summary
of significant accounting policies

 

 

Basis of
presentation and consolidation

 

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim
financial reporting and in accordance with instructions for Form
10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by generally
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial
statements contained in this report reflect all adjustments that
are normal and recurring in nature and considered necessary for a
fair presentation of the financial position and the results of
operations for the interim periods presented. The year-end balance
sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does
not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of
operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of
the results expected for the full year. These unaudited,
consolidated financial statements, footnote disclosures and other
information should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.

 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Group
and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.


The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the
years are included in the consolidated income statement from the
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of
disposal.

  

The
Company has limited operations and is considered to be in the
development stage under ASC 915-15.

 Summary of significant accounting policies
(continued)

 

 

Use of
estimates

 

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

Concentrations
of credit risk

 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Group to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts
receivable. In respect of accounts receivable, the Group extends
credit based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial
condition, generally without requiring collateral or other
security. In order to minimize the credit risk, the management of
the Group has delegated a team responsibility for determination of
credit limits, credit approvals and other monitoring procedures to
ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue debts.
Further, the Group reviews the recoverable amount of each
individual trade debt at each balance sheet date to ensure that
adequate impairment losses are made for irrecoverable amounts. In
this regard, the directors of the Group consider that the
Group’s credit risk is significantly reduced.

 

Cash and
cash equivalents

 

Cash and
cash equivalents include all cash, deposits in banks and other
highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months
or less.

 

Revenue
recognition

 

The Group
recognizes revenue when it is earned and realizable based on the
following criteria: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists,
services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and
collectability is reasonably assured.

 

The Group
also evaluates the presentation of revenue on a gross versus a net
basis through application of Emerging Issues Task Force No.
(“EITF”) 99-19,  Reporting Revenue Gross as a
Principal versus Net as an Agent . The consensus of this
literature is that the presentation of revenue as “the gross
amount billed to a customer because it has earned revenue from the
sale of goods or services or the net amount retained (that is, the
amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to a supplier)
because it has earned a commission or fee” is a matter of
judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. In
making an evaluation of this issue, some of the factors that should
be considered are: whether the Group is the primary obligor in the
arrangement (strong indicator); whether it has general inventory
risk (before customer 1 order is placed under or upon customer
return)(strong indicator); and whether we have latitude in
establishing price. The guidance clearly indicates that the
evaluations of these factors, which at times can be contradictory,
are subject to significant judgment and subjectivity. If the
conclusion drawn is that the Group performs as an agent or a broker
without assuming the risks and rewards of ownership of goods,
revenue should be reported on a net basis.

 

On April
1, 2013, the Board of Director resolved to pay an officer for a
monthly service fee of US$4,250. The fee was raised to US$10,000
per month as at October 1, 2013. The Company has an option to pay
the officer by common stock in lieu of cash at a rate of $0.005 per
share. During 2013, the Company issued 1,700,000 shares on June 3,
2013; 850,000 shares on July 2, 2013; 850,000 shares on August 5,
2013 and 850,000 shares on September 6, 2013 with an aggregate of
4,250,000 shares in lieu of $21,250 compensation to the officer.
The amounts recorded were about $85,000 at fair price per ASC
718.

 

On August
25, 2016 and September 20, 2016, the Company issued 6,696,500
common shares and 32,000,000 common shares to the officer
respectively. The issuance with an aggregate of 38,,696,500 common
shares in lieu of $193,483 compensation to the officer under the
option resolved in 2013.
