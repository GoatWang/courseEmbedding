I disagree with the previous comments. I've had multiple treatments with Cutera products and have had excellent results. The hair removal was much more effective than the previous location I went to. I have also had Tru-Sculpt for body contouring on my lower body, and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone. I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical. I highly recommend Cutera and their products.







I echo the other reviews. Cutera does not stand behind their products. They sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly. They give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty. We have other lasers that we use more and don't break as often and the company works with us.







Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.  I have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that Cutera provides, and the other lasers are much more reliable.  You would think that spending over $70K on a laser that Cutera would want to treat their customers better.  I drive a Mercedes, customer service is impeccable, that is why I continue to buy Mercedes.  The opposite is true for Cutera.  I will never buy again.







I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".  It has been three months since I have the use of this laser between trying to have Qusar laser repair and CUTERA try to fix it.  According to Danny the CUTERA laser technician, it was my fault that I scratched the plug then the fiber broke since I didn't exactly place the plug into the laser.  Look at their financial statement .  They reap 10% of their income on repairs!!! This is another scam company that I hope to see in court.  I have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance.  If you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with!!!!







DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over. They base the need of the repairs through the error codes the Laser flashes at you. Half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges.  They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.  They sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit.  They LIE to you and tell you, "I'm not selling any more lasers in your area." Then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area.  When you go to purchase they don't tell you about the new advances and 2 weeks later your $125,000. equipment in yesterday news.  All their eye wear falls apart.  I've had to replace all mine from China. My suggestion is: Buy another Laser product and check the ability to get parts & service outside of the maker.  You may need to get service from another provider someday and you don't want to be extorted and abused. CUTERA is a monopoly that you don't want to play with.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

I disagree with the previous comments. I've had multiple treatments with Cutera products and have had excellent results. The hair removal was much more effective than the previous location I went to. I have also had Tru-Sculpt for body contouring on my lower body, and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone. I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical. I highly recommend Cutera and their products.







I echo the other reviews. Cutera does not stand behind their products. They sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly. They give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty. We have other lasers that we use more and don't break as often and the company works with us.







Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.  I have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that Cutera provides, and the other lasers are much more reliable.  You would think that spending over $70K on a laser that Cutera would want to treat their customers better.  I drive a Mercedes, customer service is impeccable, that is why I continue to buy Mercedes.  The opposite is true for Cutera.  I will never buy again.







I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".  It has been three months since I have the use of this laser between trying to have Qusar laser repair and CUTERA try to fix it.  According to Danny the CUTERA laser technician, it was my fault that I scratched the plug then the fiber broke since I didn't exactly place the plug into the laser.  Look at their financial statement .  They reap 10% of their income on repairs!!! This is another scam company that I hope to see in court.  I have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance.  If you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with!!!!







DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over. They base the need of the repairs through the error codes the Laser flashes at you. Half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges.  They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.  They sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit.  They LIE to you and tell you, "I'm not selling any more lasers in your area." Then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area.  When you go to purchase they don't tell you about the new advances and 2 weeks later your $125,000. equipment in yesterday news.  All their eye wear falls apart.  I've had to replace all mine from China. My suggestion is: Buy another Laser product and check the ability to get parts & service outside of the maker.  You may need to get service from another provider someday and you don't want to be extorted and abused. CUTERA is a monopoly that you don't want to play with.

I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".  It has been three months since I have the use of this laser between trying to have Qusar laser repair and CUTERA try to fix it.  According to Danny the CUTERA laser technician, it was my fault that I scratched the plug then the fiber broke since I didn't exactly place the plug into the laser.  Look at their financial statement .  They reap 10% of their income on repairs!!! This is another scam company that I hope to see in court.  I have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance.  If you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with!!!!

DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over. They base the need of the repairs through the error codes the Laser flashes at you. Half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges.  They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.  They sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit.  They LIE to you and tell you, "I'm not selling any more lasers in your area." Then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area.  When you go to purchase they don't tell you about the new advances and 2 weeks later your $125,000. equipment in yesterday news.  All their eye wear falls apart.  I've had to replace all mine from China. My suggestion is: Buy another Laser product and check the ability to get parts & service outside of the maker.  You may need to get service from another provider someday and you don't want to be extorted and abused. CUTERA is a monopoly that you don't want to play with.

I disagree with the previous comments. I've had multiple treatments with Cutera products and have had excellent results. The hair removal was much more effective than the previous location I went to. I have also had Tru-Sculpt for body contouring on my lower body, and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone. I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical. I highly recommend Cutera and their products.







I echo the other reviews. Cutera does not stand behind their products. They sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly. They give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty. We have other lasers that we use more and don't break as often and the company works with us.







Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.  I have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that Cutera provides, and the other lasers are much more reliable.  You would think that spending over $70K on a laser that Cutera would want to treat their customers better.  I drive a Mercedes, customer service is impeccable, that is why I continue to buy Mercedes.  The opposite is true for Cutera.  I will never buy again.







I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".

Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.  I have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that Cutera provides, and the other lasers are much more reliable.  You would think that spending over $70K on a laser that Cutera would want to treat their customers better.  I drive a Mercedes, customer service is impeccable, that is why I continue to buy Mercedes.  The opposite is true for Cutera.  I will never buy again.

I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".  It has been three months since I have the use of this laser between trying to have Qusar laser repair and CUTERA try to fix it.  According to Danny the CUTERA laser technician, it was my fault that I scratched the plug then the fiber broke since I didn't exactly place the plug into the laser.  Look at their financial statement .  They reap 10% of their income on repairs!!! This is another scam company that I hope to see in court.  I have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance.  If you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with!!!!

DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over. They base the need of the repairs through the error codes the Laser flashes at you. Half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges.  They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.  They sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit.  They LIE to you and tell you, "I'm not selling any more lasers in your area." Then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area.  When you go to purchase they don't tell you about the new advances and 2 weeks later your $125,000. equipment in yesterday news.  All their eye wear falls apart.  I've had to replace all mine from China. My suggestion is: Buy another Laser product and check the ability to get parts & service outside of the maker.  You may need to get service from another provider someday and you don't want to be extorted and abused. CUTERA is a monopoly that you don't want to play with.

I disagree with the previous comments. I've had multiple treatments with Cutera products and have had excellent results. The hair removal was much more effective than the previous location I went to. I have also had Tru-Sculpt for body contouring on my lower body, and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone. I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical. I highly recommend Cutera and their products.







I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".  It has been three months since I have the use of this laser between trying to have Qusar laser repair and CUTERA try to fix it.  According to Danny the CUTERA laser technician, it was my fault that I scratched the plug then the fiber broke since I didn't exactly place the plug into the laser.  Look at their financial statement .  They reap 10% of their income on repairs!!! This is another scam company that I hope to see in court.  I have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance.  If you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with!!!!







Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.  I have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that Cutera provides, and the other lasers are much more reliable.  You would think that spending over $70K on a laser that Cutera would want to treat their customers better.  I drive a Mercedes, customer service is impeccable, that is why I continue to buy Mercedes.  The opposite is true for Cutera.  I will never buy again.







I echo the other reviews. Cutera does not stand behind their products. They sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly. They give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty. We have other lasers that we use more and don't break as often and the company works with us.







DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over. They base the need of the repairs through the error codes the Laser flashes at you. Half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges.  They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.

Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.  I have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that Cutera provides, and the other lasers are much more reliable.  You would think that spending over $70K on a laser that Cutera would want to treat their customers better.  I drive a Mercedes, customer service is impeccable, that is why I continue to buy Mercedes.  The opposite is true for Cutera.  I will never buy again.

I echo the other reviews. Cutera does not stand behind their products. They sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly. They give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty. We have other lasers that we use more and don't break as often and the company works with us.

DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over. They base the need of the repairs through the error codes the Laser flashes at you. Half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges.  They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.  They sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit.  They LIE to you and tell you, "I'm not selling any more lasers in your area." Then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area.  When you go to purchase they don't tell you about the new advances and 2 weeks later your $125,000. equipment in yesterday news.  All their eye wear falls apart.  I've had to replace all mine from China. My suggestion is: Buy another Laser product and check the ability to get parts & service outside of the maker.  You may need to get service from another provider someday and you don't want to be extorted and abused. CUTERA is a monopoly that you don't want to play with.

I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".  It has been three months since I have the use of this laser between trying to have Qusar laser repair and CUTERA try to fix it.  According to Danny the CUTERA laser technician, it was my fault that I scratched the plug then the fiber broke since I didn't exactly place the plug into the laser.  Look at their financial statement .  They reap 10% of their income on repairs!!! This is another scam company that I hope to see in court.  I have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance.  If you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with!!!!







Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.

DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over.

They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.

You may need to get service from another provider someday and you don't want to be extorted and abused. CUTERA is a monopoly that you don't want to play with.







I disagree with the previous comments. I've had multiple treatments with Cutera products and have had excellent results. The hair removal was much more effective than the previous location I went to. I have also had Tru-Sculpt for body contouring on my lower body, and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone. I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical. I highly recommend Cutera and their products.

Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.  I have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that Cutera provides, and the other lasers are much more reliable.  You would think that spending over $70K on a laser that Cutera would want to treat their customers better.  I drive a Mercedes, customer service is impeccable, that is why I continue to buy Mercedes.  The opposite is true for Cutera.  I will never buy again.

I echo the other reviews. Cutera does not stand behind their products. They sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly. They give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty. We have other lasers that we use more and don't break as often and the company works with us.

DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over. They base the need of the repairs through the error codes the Laser flashes at you. Half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges.  They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.  They sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit.  They LIE to you and tell you, "I'm not selling any more lasers in your area." Then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area.  When you go to purchase they don't tell you about the new advances and 2 weeks later your $125,000. equipment in yesterday news.  All their eye wear falls apart.  I've had to replace all mine from China. My suggestion is: Buy another Laser product and check the ability to get parts & service outside of the maker.  You may need to get service from another provider someday and you don't want to be extorted and abused. CUTERA is a monopoly that you don't want to play with.

I disagree with the previous comments. I've had multiple treatments with Cutera products and have had excellent results. The hair removal was much more effective than the previous location I went to. I have also had Tru-Sculpt for body contouring on my lower body, and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone. I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical. I highly recommend Cutera and their products.

I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical.

I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".  It has been three months since I have the use of this laser between trying to have Qusar laser repair and CUTERA try to fix it.  According to Danny the CUTERA laser technician, it was my fault that I scratched the plug then the fiber broke since I didn't exactly place the plug into the laser.  Look at their financial statement .  They reap 10% of their income on repairs!!! This is another scam company that I hope to see in court.  I have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance.  If you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with!!!!







DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.

With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.

I've had to replace all mine from China. My suggestion is: Buy another Laser product and check the ability to get parts & service outside of the maker.

I echo the other reviews. Cutera does not stand behind their products. They sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly. They give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty. We have other lasers that we use more and don't break as often and the company works with us.

Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.  I have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that Cutera provides, and the other lasers are much more reliable.  You would think that spending over $70K on a laser that Cutera would want to treat their customers better.  I drive a Mercedes, customer service is impeccable, that is why I continue to buy Mercedes.  The opposite is true for Cutera.  I will never buy again.

I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".  It has been three months since I have the use of this laser between trying to have Qusar laser repair and CUTERA try to fix it.  According to Danny the CUTERA laser technician, it was my fault that I scratched the plug then the fiber broke since I didn't exactly place the plug into the laser.  Look at their financial statement .  They reap 10% of their income on repairs!!! This is another scam company that I hope to see in court.  I have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance.  If you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with!!!!

DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over. They base the need of the repairs through the error codes the Laser flashes at you. Half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges.  They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.  They sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit.  They LIE to you and tell you, "I'm not selling any more lasers in your area." Then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area.  When you go to purchase they don't tell you about the new advances and 2 weeks later your $125,000. equipment in yesterday news.  All their eye wear falls apart.  I've had to replace all mine from China. My suggestion is: Buy another Laser product and check the ability to get parts & service outside of the maker.  You may need to get service from another provider someday and you don't want to be extorted and abused. CUTERA is a monopoly that you don't want to play with.

I echo the other reviews. Cutera does not stand behind their products. They sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly. They give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty. We have other lasers that we use more and don't break as often and the company works with us.







I disagree with the previous comments. I've had multiple treatments with Cutera products and have had excellent results. The hair removal was much more effective than the previous location I went to. I have also had Tru-Sculpt for body contouring on my lower body, and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone. I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical. I highly recommend Cutera and their products.

Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.

I echo the other reviews. Cutera does not stand behind their products. They sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly. They give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty. We have other lasers that we use more and don't break as often and the company works with us.

I disagree with the previous comments. I've had multiple treatments with Cutera products and have had excellent results. The hair removal was much more effective than the previous location I went to. I have also had Tru-Sculpt for body contouring on my lower body, and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone. I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical. I highly recommend Cutera and their products.

Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.  I have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that Cutera provides, and the other lasers are much more reliable.  You would think that spending over $70K on a laser that Cutera would want to treat their customers better.  I drive a Mercedes, customer service is impeccable, that is why I continue to buy Mercedes.  The opposite is true for Cutera.  I will never buy again.

I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".  It has been three months since I have the use of this laser between trying to have Qusar laser repair and CUTERA try to fix it.  According to Danny the CUTERA laser technician, it was my fault that I scratched the plug then the fiber broke since I didn't exactly place the plug into the laser.  Look at their financial statement .  They reap 10% of their income on repairs!!! This is another scam company that I hope to see in court.  I have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance.  If you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with!!!!

DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over. They base the need of the repairs through the error codes the Laser flashes at you. Half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges.  They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.  They sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit.  They LIE to you and tell you, "I'm not selling any more lasers in your area." Then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area.  When you go to purchase they don't tell you about the new advances and 2 weeks later your $125,000. equipment in yesterday news.  All their eye wear falls apart.  I've had to replace all mine from China. My suggestion is: Buy another Laser product and check the ability to get parts & service outside of the maker.  You may need to get service from another provider someday and you don't want to be extorted and abused. CUTERA is a monopoly that you don't want to play with.

Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.  I have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that Cutera provides, and the other lasers are much more reliable.  You would think that spending over $70K on a laser that Cutera would want to treat their customers better.  I drive a Mercedes, customer service is impeccable, that is why I continue to buy Mercedes.  The opposite is true for Cutera.  I will never buy again.

I disagree with the previous comments. I've had multiple treatments with Cutera products and have had excellent results. The hair removal was much more effective than the previous location I went to. I have also had Tru-Sculpt for body contouring on my lower body, and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone. I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical. I highly recommend Cutera and their products.

I echo the other reviews. Cutera does not stand behind their products. They sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly. They give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty. We have other lasers that we use more and don't break as often and the company works with us.

I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".  It has been three months since I have the use of this laser between trying to have Qusar laser repair and CUTERA try to fix it.  According to Danny the CUTERA laser technician, it was my fault that I scratched the plug then the fiber broke since I didn't exactly place the plug into the laser.  Look at their financial statement .  They reap 10% of their income on repairs!!! This is another scam company that I hope to see in court.  I have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance.  If you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with!!!!

DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over. They base the need of the repairs through the error codes the Laser flashes at you. Half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges.  They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.  They sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit.  They LIE to you and tell you, "I'm not selling any more lasers in your area." Then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area.  When you go to purchase they don't tell you about the new advances and 2 weeks later your $125,000. equipment in yesterday news.  All their eye wear falls apart.  I've had to replace all mine from China. My suggestion is: Buy another Laser product and check the ability to get parts & service outside of the maker.  You may need to get service from another provider someday and you don't want to be extorted and abused. CUTERA is a monopoly that you don't want to play with.

DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.

With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.

I disagree with the previous comments. I've had multiple treatments with Cutera products and have had excellent results. The hair removal was much more effective than the previous location I went to. I have also had Tru-Sculpt for body contouring on my lower body, and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone. I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical. I highly recommend Cutera and their products.

I echo the other reviews. Cutera does not stand behind their products. They sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly. They give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty. We have other lasers that we use more and don't break as often and the company works with us.

Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.  I have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that Cutera provides, and the other lasers are much more reliable.  You would think that spending over $70K on a laser that Cutera would want to treat their customers better.  I drive a Mercedes, customer service is impeccable, that is why I continue to buy Mercedes.  The opposite is true for Cutera.  I will never buy again.

I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".  It has been three months since I have the use of this laser between trying to have Qusar laser repair and CUTERA try to fix it.  According to Danny the CUTERA laser technician, it was my fault that I scratched the plug then the fiber broke since I didn't exactly place the plug into the laser.  Look at their financial statement .  They reap 10% of their income on repairs!!! This is another scam company that I hope to see in court.  I have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance.  If you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with!!!!

DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over. They base the need of the repairs through the error codes the Laser flashes at you. Half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges.  They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.  They sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit.  They LIE to you and tell you, "I'm not selling any more lasers in your area." Then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area.  When you go to purchase they don't tell you about the new advances and 2 weeks later your $125,000. equipment in yesterday news.  All their eye wear falls apart.  I've had to replace all mine from China. My suggestion is: Buy another Laser product and check the ability to get parts & service outside of the maker.  You may need to get service from another provider someday and you don't want to be extorted and abused. CUTERA is a monopoly that you don't want to play with.

I disagree with the previous comments. I've had multiple treatments with Cutera products and have had excellent results. The hair removal was much more effective than the previous location I went to.

I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical.

Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.

DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over.

They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.

I disagree with the previous comments. I've had multiple treatments with Cutera products and have had excellent results. The hair removal was much more effective than the previous location I went to. I have also had Tru-Sculpt for body contouring on my lower body, and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone. I am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results. The staff at Cutera have been amazing. They are friendly, professional, and ethical. I highly recommend Cutera and their products.

I echo the other reviews. Cutera does not stand behind their products. They sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly. They give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty. We have other lasers that we use more and don't break as often and the company works with us.

Terrible customer service.  I have owned two Cutera lasers in the past.  I would never buy another.  They are prone to malfunction and when they do, the cost to repair is ridiculous.  Over $2500 just to walk in the door.  Even if it is only a minor problem.  I have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that Cutera provides, and the other lasers are much more reliable.  You would think that spending over $70K on a laser that Cutera would want to treat their customers better.  I drive a Mercedes, customer service is impeccable, that is why I continue to buy Mercedes.  The opposite is true for Cutera.  I will never buy again.

I have a CUTERA Excel V that was in "perfect" condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working.  Of course , CUTERA wanted $13 K to repair it as I thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep Chris "these lasers never break down since they're solid state".  It has been three months since I have the use of this laser between trying to have Qusar laser repair and CUTERA try to fix it.  According to Danny the CUTERA laser technician, it was my fault that I scratched the plug then the fiber broke since I didn't exactly place the plug into the laser.  Look at their financial statement .  They reap 10% of their income on repairs!!! This is another scam company that I hope to see in court.  I have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance.  If you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with!!!!

DO NOT BUY A MEDICAL LASER FROM THIS COMPANY! Everything is made very cheaply from the plugs, wires, logos, glasses,  pedals, stands for the wands.  They put  computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulses.The hand pieces are not cheap.  Depending on which you are using  IPL 560 $7k,  Titan $20K. The warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine.  Upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing WELL, they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working. Only then it is up to the discretion, and if time permits, that the technician will do so.  Hopefully,  when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you don't get your service.  If you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out with.The service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over. They base the need of the repairs through the error codes the Laser flashes at you. Half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges.  They told me 6 years ago I need a new MOTHER BOARD and that it would cost $10k urging me to get the warranty.  When I looked into exactly what the warranty covered, I realized this was another up sale attempt.  BOY! was I right.  With a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts.  The best being 50%.  Some of these parts, like a new ND Yag wand is $4800.  They keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts.  You might not think this is a big deal but,  MY Laser COMPUTER BOARD broke down the first 2 months I had it along with the foot pedal.  Of course, the comment  from Cutera was, "Oh,  I've never seen this happen." The reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale.  They sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit.  They LIE to you and tell you, "I'm not selling any more lasers in your area." Then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area.  When you go to purchase they don't tell you about the new advances and 2 weeks later your $125,000. equipment in yesterday news.  All their eye wear falls apart.  I've had to replace all mine from China. My suggestion is: Buy another Laser product and check the ability to get parts & service outside of the maker.  You may need to get service from another provider someday and you don't want to be extorted and abused. CUTERA is a monopoly that you don't want to play with.
