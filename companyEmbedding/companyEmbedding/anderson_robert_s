Who Loves Us
The product itself worked wonders for removing the horrible stains that Cody had, and I only had to use one application. For his entire neck I used ONE CAP full of the product, a little went such a long way!!
jkp.equestrianInstagram Influencer - Tea Tree Mint Shampoo
Used the lemon and lime shampoo, smelt really nice and made dusty’s tail really super clean and was easy to wash as weren’t “bubbly” so didn’t have to use too much to cover a large surface area!
myponydustyInstagram Influencer - Lemon And Lime Shampoo
Completely wiped out the odour! Very refreshing citrus smell, completely wiped out the odour in my numnah, hat, boots and gloves! Leaves no residue and you only use 1-2 sprays so it will last you FOREVER!!
