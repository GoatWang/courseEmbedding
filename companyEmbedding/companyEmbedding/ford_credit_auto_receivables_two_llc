such Receivable under this Agreement would be unlawful, void or
voidable. The terms of the Receivable do not limit the right of the

not entered into any agreement with any Person that prohibits,
restricts or conditions the sale of any Receivable by the
Sponsor.


     (g)

material respects at the time it was originated and as of the

Receivable, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other laws relating to the enforcement of
creditors’ rights or by general equitable principles and
consumer protection laws.


     (i) 
Perfected Security Interest in Financed Vehicle . Each
Receivable is secured by a security interest in the related
Financed Vehicle, in favor of the Sponsor as secured party, which
was validly created and is a perfected, first priority security

in the perfection of a first priority security interest in the
related Financed Vehicle, and said security interest is assignable
by the Sponsor to the Depositor.


     (j)  Good
Title . Immediately before the sale under this Agreement, the
Sponsor had good title to each Receivable free and clear of any
Lien other than Permitted Liens and, immediately upon the sale

This document outlines the terms and conditions of transaction. Information contained in the document includes the names of both parties, the address and description of the property the agreement concerns, and the purchase price. The closing details of the transaction are included in the document outlining where and when closing on the property shall occur. When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.

RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT,
dated as of October 1, 2016 (this “ Agreement
”), between FORD MOTOR CREDIT COMPANY LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, as Sponsor, and FORD CREDIT AUTO RECEIVABLES TWO
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as Depositor.
 
BACKGROUND
 

In the normal course of its
business, Ford Credit purchases retail installment sale contracts
secured by new and used cars, light trucks and utility vehicles
from motor vehicle dealers.
 

In connection with a securitization
transaction sponsored by Ford Credit in which the Issuer will issue
Notes secured by a pool of Receivables consisting of retail
installment sale contracts, Ford Credit has determined to sell a
pool of Receivables and related property to the Depositor, who will
sell them to the Issuer.
 

The parties agree as
follows:
 
ARTICLE I
USAGE AND DEFINITIONS
 

Section 1.1.          
Usage and Definitions .  Capitalized terms used but not
defined in this Agreement are defined in Appendix A to the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2016, among Ford
Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C, as Issuer, Ford Credit Auto
Receivables Two LLC, as Depositor, and Ford Motor Credit Company
LLC, as Servicer.  Appendix A also contains usage
rules that apply to this Agreement.  Appendix A is
incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
 
ARTICLE II
SALE AND PURCHASE OF PURCHASED PROPERTY
 

Section 2.1.          
Sale of Purchased Property .  Effective on the Closing
Date and immediately before the transactions under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Indenture, the
Sponsor sells and assigns to the Depositor, without recourse (other
than the Sponsor’s obligations under this Agreement), all of
the Sponsor’s right, title and interest, whether now owned or
later acquired, in the Purchased Property.  This sale and
assignment does not, and is not intended to, include any obligation
of the Sponsor to the Obligors, the Dealers or any other Person
relating to the Receivables and the other Purchased Property, and
the Depositor does not assume any of these obligations.
 

Section 2.2.          
Payment of Purchase Price .  In consideration for the
Purchased Property, the Depositor will pay to the Sponsor
$1,307,746,617.31 on the Closing Date.  The Depositor and the
Sponsor each represents and warrants to the other that the amount
paid by the Depositor on the Closing Date, together with the
increase in the value of the Sponsor’s capital in the
Depositor, is equal to the fair market value of the Receivables and
the other Purchased Property.
 

Section 2.3.          
Acknowledgement of Further Assignments .  The Sponsor
acknowledges that (a) under the Sale and Servicing Agreement,
the Depositor will sell and assign all of its
 





 
right, title and interest in the Purchased
Property and its rights under this Agreement to the Issuer and
(b) under the Indenture, the Issuer will assign and pledge the
Purchased Property and related property and rights to the Indenture
Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties.
 

Section 2.4.          
Savings Clause .  The Sponsor and the Depositor intend
that the sale and assignment under this Agreement be an absolute
sale and assignment of the Purchased Property, conveying good title
to the Purchased Property free and clear of any Lien, other than
Permitted Liens, from the Sponsor to the Depositor.  The
Sponsor and the Depositor intend that the Purchased Property not be
a part of the Sponsor’s estate if there is a bankruptcy or
insolvency of the Sponsor.  If, despite the intent of the
Sponsor and the Depositor, the transfer of the Purchased Property
under this Agreement is determined to be a pledge for a financing
or is determined not to be an absolute sale and assignment, the
Sponsor Grants to the Depositor a security interest in the
Sponsor’s right, title and interest in the Purchased
Property, whether now owned or later acquired, to secure a loan in
an amount equal to all amounts payable by the Sponsor under this
Agreement, all amounts payable as principal or interest on the
Notes, all amounts payable as Servicing Fees under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement and all other amounts payable by the Issuer
under the Transaction Documents.  In that case, this Agreement
is a security agreement under law and the Depositor will have the
rights and remedies of a secured party and creditor under the
UCC.
 
ARTICLE III
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 

Section 3.1.          
Sponsor’s Representations and Warranties .  The
Sponsor makes the following representations and warranties on which
the Depositor is relying in purchasing the Purchased
Property.  The representations and warranties are made as of
the Closing Date and will survive the sale and assignment of the
Purchased Property by the Sponsor to the Depositor under this
Agreement and by the Depositor to the Issuer under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement and the pledge of the Purchased Property by the
Issuer to the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture:
 

(a)          
Organization and Qualification .  The Sponsor is duly
organized and validly existing as a limited liability company in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.  The
Sponsor is qualified as a foreign limited liability company in good
standing and has obtained all necessary licenses and approvals in
all jurisdictions in which the ownership or lease of its properties
or the conduct of its activities requires qualification, license or
approval, unless the failure to obtain the qualifications, licenses
or approvals would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Sponsor’s ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.
 

(b)          
Power, Authority and Enforceability .  The Sponsor has
the power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement.  The Sponsor has authorized
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. 
This Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Sponsor, enforceable against the Sponsor, except as may be limited
by insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar laws
relating to the enforcement of creditors’ rights or by
general equitable principles.

(c)          
No Conflicts and No Violation .  The completion of the
transactions under this Agreement, and the performance of its

or be a breach or default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust, loan agreement, guarantee or similar document under which
the Sponsor is a debtor or guarantor, (ii) result in the
creation or imposition of a Lien on the Sponsor’s properties
or assets under the terms of any indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust, loan agreement, guarantee or similar document (other than
this Agreement), (iii) violate the Sponsor’s certificate
of formation or limited liability company agreement or
(iv) violate a law or, to the Sponsor’s knowledge, an
order, rule or regulation of a federal or State court,

instrumentality having jurisdiction over the Sponsor or its
properties that applies to the Sponsor, which, in each case, would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the

Agreement.
 

(d)          
No Proceedings .  To the Sponsor’s knowledge,
there are no proceedings or investigations pending or threatened in
writing before a federal or State court, regulatory body,
administrative agency or other governmental instrumentality having
jurisdiction over the Sponsor or its properties (i) asserting
the invalidity of this Agreement, (ii) seeking to prevent the
completion of the transactions under this Agreement,
(iii) seeking a determination or ruling that would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Sponsor’s ability to perform its obligations under, or the
validity or enforceability of, this Agreement or (iv) that
would reasonably be expected to (A) affect the treatment of
the Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal income or Applicable Tax
State income or franchise tax purposes, (B) be deemed to cause
a taxable exchange of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes or (C) cause the Issuer to be treated as an
association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in each case, other than
proceedings that would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Sponsor, the performance by the
Sponsor of its obligations under, or the validity and
enforceability of, the Transaction Documents or the Notes or the
tax treatment of the Issuer or the Notes.
