Commentary


Fixing Judicial RecusalsRecently, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito recused himself in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Electric Power Supply Association, a case with important implications for the power industry, while Justice Stephen Breyer failed to do so, apparently in error. This misstep illustrates some of the problems with the judicial recusal system.Feb 10, 2016 Inside Sources
What if Distracted Driving Was Safe?According to consumer research, the ability to consume media, write an email, or even sleep during transport is a key selling point for autonomous vehicles (self-driving cars), which could be widely available in the fairly near future. Autonomous vehicle technology could also produce a wide range of public benefits.Jul 1, 2014 The RAND Blog
With Self-Driving Cars, Promise Outweighs PerilThe promise of autonomous vehicles is finally near to being realized and the substantial benefits to society in terms of safety, mobility, and fuel economy cannot be ignored. It is not too early for policy makers to begin to think about the challenges that lie ahead.Jan 29, 2014 The Detroit News

What Our Experts Are Saying
This isn't neo-colonialism by the Chinese or an attempt at world domination by spreading their ideology. They are expanding a bit in Africa to gather resources to build their economy. Their extension to East Africa and Latin America is an economic move...John Gordon IV Senior Policy ResearcherSource: Clearance Jobs News
Iraq does have a strategic importance for the United States. I don't think it requires a large number of U.S. conventional forces but it does require the U.S. to remain and have access to Iraqi bases, to continue to train Iraq's counterterrorism service... to train Iraqi police forces.Seth G. Jones Director, International Security and Defense Policy CenterSource: Fox News

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
