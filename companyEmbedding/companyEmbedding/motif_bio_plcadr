The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM) N/A     Market Cap N/A     Shares Outstanding 13.14 M     Public Float N/A     Yield MTFB has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.38      Net Money Flow ()  -6,824    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

      NEW YORK, May 10, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Motif Bio plc
      (NASDAQ:MTFB) (AIM:MTFB.LN), a clinical stage
      biopharmaceutical company specializing in developing novel
      antibiotics, today announced the appointment of Dr. Thomas
      Lodise, Dr. Thomas Holland and Dr. William O’Riordan to the
      Clinical Advisory Board.


      The three new advisory board members are medical and
      scientific leaders in their fields:
    

Thomas Lodise, Pharm.D., Ph.D. is a
      Professor at Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences,
      Albany, New York and an infectious diseases clinical pharmacy
      specialist at the Stratton VA Medical Center, Albany, New
      York. His specific research objectives are to develop
      “personalized” patient care strategies that improve outcomes;
      reduce the likelihood of drug-induced toxicities; minimize
      the emergence of antibiotic resistant infections; and reduce
      healthcare costs.  He has published over 110
      peer-reviewed articles and is an editorial board member for
      Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,
      Pharmacotherapy, and Diagnostic Microbiology and
      Infectious Diseases.  He is the current chair of
      the PK Special Emphasis Panel for the Antibacterial
      Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG), an initiative funded by
      the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
      (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
    

Thomas L. Holland, M.D., MSc-GH is an
      Assistant Professor at Duke University School of Medicine.
      Board certified in infectious disease, Dr. Holland has held a
      number of clinical positions at Duke University School of
      Medicine and is currently Assistant Professor in the
      Department of Infectious Diseases. With over 30 publications,
      Dr. Holland is an expert in antibacterial resistance with a
      focus on Gram-positive bacteria and is a member of ARLG.
    

William D. O’Riordan, M.D. is the founder
      and CEO of eStudy Sites, one of the pre-eminent networks of
      clinical trial sites in the U.S. He is certified with the
      American Board of Emergency Medicine and is the lead
      investigator at the Chula Vista Research Site in
      California.  Dr. O’Riordan has held a number of clinical
      positions at the UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles)
      Medical Center and works at the Department of Emergency
      Medicine at the Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center. As a
      clinical trial investigator at the eStudy Site at the Chula
      Vista Research Site, he has overseen numerous clinical trials
      with antibacterial agents at all stages of clinical
      development.
    

      Dr. David Huang, CMO of Motif Bio, commented: “We are
      delighted to welcome these three outstanding scientific
      leaders to our Clinical Advisory Board. Each of them brings
      specific expertise that will be invaluable as we develop and
      prepare to commercialize iclaprim for patients with serious
      and life-threatening infections.”


About Motif Bio plc www.motifbio.com


      Motif Bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company,
      engaged in the research and development of novel antibiotics
      designed to be effective against serious and life-threatening
      infections in hospitalized patients caused by multi-drug
      resistant bacteria. Our lead product candidate, iclaprim, is
      being developed for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and
      skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and hospital acquired
      bacterial pneumonia (HABP), including ventilator associated
      bacterial pneumonia (VABP), infections often caused by MRSA
      (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus).
      Having completed the REVIVE-1 trial, patients are currently
      being enrolled and dosed in a second global Phase 3 clinical
      trial (REVIVE-2) with an intravenous formulation of iclaprim,
      for the treatment of ABSSSI. Data readout for REVIVE-2 is
      expected in the second half of 2017.

					Our entire line, starting at $49, is Tag based.

					Innovative Features

					We’ve developed some great features to help you get things done quicker and more reliably.

					Subroutines:

					Break projects up into manageable chunks, and allow program reuse.

					Objects:

					Isolate data and create logic components to greatly improve development efficiency,

					maintainability and reliability.

					Linked Subroutines:

					Specify that multiple subroutines should use the same Objects.  Maybe you’ve

					got an initialization routine you’d like in one subroutine, and a process you want in another.  

					They can share an object, so you don’t have to pass data between the two.




					View your data and create operator controls with

					Awesome, Free HMI




					We’re serious about delivering the easiest to use, most productive PLC software.

					We could go on about our features, but seeing is believing, so Check out our vBuilder page,

vFactory page or Download vBuilder and vFactory. They're

					Expansion has a vLink input port instead of USB. 

					Expansions are otherwise physically identical to Branch Main. 

					Your Sensors and Actuators are Branched Out, 

					Your PLC Should Branch With Them!

Margin trading involves risks and is not suitable for all investors. Rates are subject to change without notice. Rates are set at the discretion of E*TRADE Securities with reference to commercially recognized interest rates, such as the broker call loan rate.
Trading on margin involves risk, including the possible loss of more money than you have deposited. In addition, E*TRADE Securities can force the sale of any securities in your account without contacting you if your equity falls below required levels, and you are not entitled to an extension of time in the event of a margin call. For more information, please read the risks of trading on margin at www.etrade.com/margin.
The base rate is set at E*TRADE Securities' discretion with reference to commercially recognized interest rates, such as the broker call loan rate. Base rates are subject to change without prior notice.
Transactions in futures carry a high degree of risk. The amount of initial margin is small relative to the value of the futures contract. A relatively small market movement will have a proportionately larger impact on the funds you have deposited or will have to deposit: this may work against you as well as for you. You may sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and any additional funds deposited with the Firm to maintain your position. If the market moves against your positions or margin levels are increased, you may be called upon by the Firm to pay substantial additional funds on short notice to maintain your position. If you fail to comply with a request for additional funds immediately, regardless of the requested due date, your position may be liquidated at a loss by the Firm and you will be liable for any resulting deficit.
