09.15.2014

 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Alnylam

      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY), a leading RNAi therapeutics

      appointments of Karen Anderson as Senior Vice President, Chief Human

      Resources Officer; Laurie Keating as Senior Vice President, General

      Counsel, and Secretary; and Marko Kozul, M.D., as Vice President,

      Strategy.

    


      "We are delighted to welcome Karen, Laurie, and Marko to the Alnylam

      team," said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam.

      "The experience and expertise these individuals bring to Alnylam will be

      tremendously valuable as we continue to expand our capabilities and

      Prior to Millennium, Ms. Keating was co-founder and the first CEO of

      Hydra Biosciences, Inc. Before co-founding Hydra, Ms. Keating served as

      an executive at high growth technology companies, including serving as

      Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Iomega

      Corporation, and Sybase, Inc., a software company that grew from a few

      hundred to 6,000 employees during Ms. Keating's tenure on the management

      team. Based on her leadership at Sybase, Ms. Keating was named as one of

      the 45 most influential in-house lawyers in the United States under the

      age of 45. Upon graduating from law school, Ms. Keating practiced law at

      McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and Enersen (now Bingham McCutchen) in San

      Francisco. Ms. Keating has a Doctor of Jurisprudence from the University

      BIO General Counsels Committee. At Alnylam, Ms. Keating will lead the

      company's legal function, including corporate and intellectual property

      activities, and will lead the Alnylam's government affairs efforts. She

      will also serve as the Board secretary.

About RNAi



      RNAi (RNA interference) is a revolution in biology, representing a

      breakthrough in understanding how genes are turned on and off in cells,

      and a completely new approach to drug discovery and development. Its

      discovery has been heralded as "a major scientific breakthrough that

      happens once every decade or so," and represents one of the most

      promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery

      today which was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

      RNAi is a natural process of gene silencing that occurs in organisms

      ranging from plants to mammals. By harnessing the natural biological

      process of RNAi occurring in our cells, the creation of a major new

      class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is on the horizon. Small

      interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise

      Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, target the cause of diseases by

      potently silencing specific mRNAs, thereby preventing disease-causing

      proteins from being made. RNAi therapeutics have the potential to treat

      disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way.

    

About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals



      Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics

      based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the

      translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines with a core

      focus on RNAi therapeutics as genetic medicines, including programs as

      part of the company's "Alnylam 5x15™" product strategy. Alnylam's

      genetic medicine programs are RNAi therapeutics directed toward

      genetically defined targets for the treatment of serious,

      life-threatening diseases with limited treatment options for patients

      and their caregivers. These include: patisiran (ALN-TTR02), an

      intravenously delivered RNAi therapeutic targeting transthyretin (TTR)

      for the treatment of TTR-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) in patients with

      familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP); ALN-TTRsc, a subcutaneously

      delivered RNAi therapeutic targeting TTR for the treatment of ATTR in

      patients with TTR cardiac amyloidosis, including familial amyloidotic

      cardiomyopathy (FAC) and senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA); ALN-AT3, an

      RNAi therapeutic targeting antithrombin (AT) for the treatment of

      hemophilia and rare bleeding disorders (RBD); ALN-CC5, an RNAi

      therapeutic targeting complement component C5 for the treatment of

      complement-mediated diseases; ALN-AS1, an RNAi therapeutic targeting

      aminolevulinic acid synthase-1 (ALAS-1) for the treatment of hepatic

      porphyrias including acute intermittent porphyria (AIP); ALN-PCS, an

      RNAi therapeutic targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of

      hypercholesterolemia; ALN-AAT, an RNAi therapeutic targeting alpha-1

      antitrypsin (AAT) for the treatment of AAT deficiency-associated liver

      disease; ALN-HBV, an RNAi therapeutic targeting the hepatitis B virus

      (HBV) genome for the treatment of HBV infection; ALN-TMP, an RNAi

      therapeutic targeting TMPRSS6 for the treatment of beta-thalassemia and

      iron-overload disorders; ALN-ANG, an RNAi therapeutic targeting

      angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) for the treatment of genetic forms of

      mixed hyperlipidemia and severe hypertriglyceridemia; ALN-AC3, an RNAi

      therapeutic targeting apolipoprotein C-III (apoCIII) for the treatment

      of hypertriglyceridemia; ALN-AGT, an RNAi therapeutic targeting

      angiotensinogen (AGT) for the treatment of hypertensive disorders of

      pregnancy (HDP), including preeclampsia; and other programs yet to be

      disclosed. As part of its "Alnylam 5x15" strategy, as updated in early

      2014, the company expects to have six to seven genetic medicine product

      candidates in clinical development - including at least two programs in

      Phase 3 and five to six programs with human proof of concept - by the

      end of 2015. The company's demonstrated commitment to RNAi therapeutics

      has enabled it to form major alliances with leading companies including

      Merck, Medtronic, Novartis, Biogen Idec, Roche, Takeda, Kyowa Hakko

      Kirin, Cubist, GlaxoSmithKline, Ascletis, Monsanto, and The Medicines

      Company. In early 2014, Alnylam and Genzyme, a Sanofi company, formed a

      multi-product geographic alliance on Alnylam's genetic medicine programs

      in the rare disease field. Specifically, Alnylam will lead development

      and commercialization of programs in North America and Europe, while

      Genzyme will develop and commercialize products in the rest of world. In

      addition, Alnylam and Genzyme will co-develop and co-commercialize

      ALN-TTRsc in North America and Europe. In March 2014, Alnylam acquired

      Sirna Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck. In addition,

      Alnylam holds an equity position in Regulus Therapeutics Inc., a company

      focused on discovery, development, and commercialization of microRNA

      therapeutics. Alnylam scientists and collaborators have published their

      research on RNAi therapeutics in over 200 peer-reviewed papers,

      including many in the world's top scientific journals such as Nature,

      Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology, Cell, New England Journal of

      Medicine, and The Lancet. Founded in 2002, Alnylam maintains

      headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information, please
