New Customers. Better Cash Flow.Welcome to the BizX Community












What Is BizX?Our purpose is to improve the lives and businesses of our members.  At our core is a deep passion for local business, and a personal understanding of the experience of the business owner.
BizX is a community of thousands of local business owners who engage and leverage one another within the BizX network, and a tool called the BizX dollar, which enables them to buy from and sell to one another without spending cash.
The BizX team hosts this diverse network of over 5,000 businesses, and manages the BizX currency, but the engagement and transactions are fueled by the membership.  At BizX, it’s all about the members.
BizX is totally free to join and to be a part of, and members only pay a small fee when they choose to transact with one another.  Nearly all do – because the result is universally positive: New customers, and better cash flow.

New Customers
We deliver incremental, loyal, high-value customers to you through the network.Better Cash Flow

The heartbeat of BizX is the local business owner, but companies large and small have chosen to grow their network in our community.

1.  Identify How Many New Customers You Can TakeEvery business can take at least one more customer. That spare capacity is valuable! Successful members leverage BizX to turn that waste into profit. How many more customers could you accept using only the unused parts of your business?
Hear it from Priceless GraniteIdentify your current revenue
The simple way to find out your performance is to use the one number every business owner knows – their topline revenue. This is your current business performance.
How much could you earn if you were 100% full?
Now imagine you are running at 100% – a line out the door 7 days a week. Given your current staff and resources how much revenue would you be doing if that was the case? Just ballpark it…
Put a value on your extra capacity
Subtract the difference between your 100% number and your current revenue. This is how much more business you could be doing. BizX delivers new customers that cost you only the variable costs to serve a new customer while maintaining your fixed costs (staff, rent, etc).
























2. Accept New BizX CustomersBizX delivers new, loyal, high-value customers you wouldn’t have had before. These are business owners, like you, that prefer to buy and sell with BizX (¤) instead of cash. These customers fill the extra capacity you have in your business today.
We promote your business through multiple channels including:

Online marketplace
Mobile app
Account managers
Phone & email promotions
and much, much more

Hear it from Crystal Mountain HotelsSetup your BizX store
Set up your store with a photo, description and location information so you can be promoted within the community to start accepting BizX customers.
Markets We Serve

Bob Bagga is president and CEO of BizXchange Inc., a barter association with offices in Oakland, Seattle and Dubai.





Why barter? Barter allows you to pay for business expenditures without having to write a check. You pay with your product or service in exchange. BizXchange brings our members new customers. They get paid in BizX trade dollars and can use those dollars to pay for something they normally would have written a check for. It doesn't cost nearly as much as paying with cash, just what your products and services actually cost.

                            Bob Bagga, BizXchange Inc.                        










 


How do you address skepticism about the ease and value of bartering? Bartering has been going on since before money was created. It's done formally or informally. Handling skepticism is one of the reasons we exist. We're a third-party record keeper of barter transactions - a formal barter organization. Our goal is to make sure all parties get a fair shake. There's a common myth that bartering is illegal. It's not. It's accounted for just like cash, reported just like cash and it's as easy to use with our credit card as cash is.
What's the cost to barter goods or services through BizXchange? Our clients pay a one-time membership fee of between $595 and $795, depending on which plan they choose. You pay us a 6 percent commission on purchases and sales, a total of 12 percent. It's like a sales fee. You're paying to get a new customer you wouldn't have had. On the flip side, you're paying us to help you acquire a product or service you normally would have paid cash for.

BizX is an American financial technology company that operates a digital private currency (the BizX dollar) that facilitates business-to-business exchange of goods and services.[1]
Originally designed as a barter exchange, BizX has been upgraded to the digital private currency model, one that facilitates indirect trade by allowing members to earn BizX dollars from one member and spend them with another.[2]
The BizX community consists of more than 4,000 members who conduct more than $80 million in transactions per year.[1]
The company is headquartered in Seattle, Washington, with offices in Oakland, California and Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Company History[edit]
BizX was founded in 2002 by Bob Bagga, Chris Haddawy, and Raj Kapoor. All three partners had previous experience in the barter exchange industry. Before founding BizX, Bagga was the founder of Barter Business Exchange (BBE).[1] Later, BBE merged to create UBarter.com, which was sold to Network Commerce in 2001.[3] Haddawy was previously president of the Barter Business Network, and general manager of BarterTrust, overseeing West Coast operations.[4]
Acquisition of Dibspace[edit]
In 2010, BizX acquired Dibspace, an online marketplace that facilitated business-to-business and business-to-consumer exchanges of products and services using a private currency called Dibits.[5]
Office Locations[edit]
Seattle, Washington
Head office opened in 2002, serving the greater Seattle metropolitan area.
Oakland, California
Satellite office opened in 2002, serving the greater San Francisco metropolitan area.
Dubai, UAE
Satellite office opened in 2007, operating large arbitrage deals unique to the UAE market.
Business Model[edit]
The BizX network is a private economy comprising 4000 member businesses that monetize excess inventory or capacity at full market rate in BizX dollars. Businesses then use their earned BizX currency to offset cash expenses such as advertising, travel, entertainment, etc. The model produced more than $81,000,000 BizX dollars in transactions in 2015.
BizX primarily earns its revenue from transaction fees, typically 7.5% when selling and 7.5% when buying within the BizX network. Sometimes confused with credit card fees, BizX fees are more comparable to sales or marketing channel fees such as those from HotelTonight, Groupon, or other business sales channels.[6]
BizX dollars are a private currency not exchangeable for cash. They do not take possession of money for transmission, have stored value, earn interest, or act as securities.[7] Nor are BizX dollars a cryptocurrency, as the company is not a money transmitter.[8] BizX dollars simply denote a member’s right to receive from (or obligation to pay) another member in the network. Such member rights are held between the members. BizX serves as an arms-length third-party record keeper. BizX does not hold collateral or guarantee trades between members.[9]
Barter Exchange[edit]
BizX was initially built as a barter exchange, and therefore retains many elements familiar to barter exchanges. Now a digital private currency operator, BizX facilitates the exchange of goods and services between more than 4,000 businesses within the BizX community.
Unlike many traditional barter exchanges, BizX pairs its currency to the value of the US dollar, ensuring that the BizX currency retains the strongest spending power possible.
Additionally, BizX differentiates itself from other barter exchanges by targeting an extremely diverse range of business types, as well as investing deeply in their financial technology software.
Transaction Platform[edit]
BizX acts as a transaction processor and 3rd party record keeper for all buyers and sellers. Sellers can charge buyers’ BizX accounts by phone or online portal. Funds are available to the seller immediately when the transaction is run, with zero processing or holding time.
Customer Relationship Management System[edit]
BizX assists its members in identifying how to monetize their excess capacity, by marketing to other members looking for the same service.[10]
Lending Facility[edit]
BizX offers lines of credit to member businesses at the rate of 1.5% per month (18% annually), payable in BizX dollars.
Marketplace[edit]
The BizX marketplace features listings for all members businesses, as well as individual product and service listings. Members can create individual listings for products and services without cost.
BizX App[edit]
BizX launched its mobile app in 2016. The app is designed to help BizX Members find each other, send payments, as well as stores digital BizX card, Members balance and transactional history.[11]
Community[edit]
BizX comprises more than 4000 member businesses that operate in more than 120 different categories, including advertising, construction, event planning, food & beverage, technology, web services, etc.
Regulations[edit]
IRS Regulation[edit]
BizX is classified as a barter exchange and therefore subject to IRS regulations pertaining to such exchanges. The model complies with TEFRA-based IRS 1099B reporting requirements.[12]
IRS Reporting[edit]
BizX is required by the IRS to act as a third-party record keeper of transactions made through the exchange. All sales made using BizX dollars are reported to the IRS via a 1099-B.[13]

Registered Trademark[edit]
BizX is a registered trademark of BizXchange.
Differences from Cryptocurrencies[edit]
Unlike cryptocurrencies, BizX transactions are not anonymous. BizX keeps record of every transaction between members, and reports them to the IRS at year-end. Additionally, BizX dollars are merely an accounting unit; no cryptocurrency technology is involved. Finally, BizX transactions do not involve “mining,” or the process by which new units of cryptocurrencies are generated by computers solving complex algorithms.[29]

Company History[edit]
BizX was founded in 2002 by Bob Bagga, Chris Haddawy, and Raj Kapoor. All three partners had previous experience in the barter exchange industry. Before founding BizX, Bagga was the founder of Barter Business Exchange (BBE).[1] Later, BBE merged to create UBarter.com, which was sold to Network Commerce in 2001.[3] Haddawy was previously president of the Barter Business Network, and general manager of BarterTrust, overseeing West Coast operations.[4]
Acquisition of Dibspace[edit]
In 2010, BizX acquired Dibspace, an online marketplace that facilitated business-to-business and business-to-consumer exchanges of products and services using a private currency called Dibits.[5]
Office Locations[edit]
Seattle, Washington
Head office opened in 2002, serving the greater Seattle metropolitan area.
Oakland, California
Satellite office opened in 2002, serving the greater San Francisco metropolitan area.
Dubai, UAE
Satellite office opened in 2007, operating large arbitrage deals unique to the UAE market.
Business Model[edit]
The BizX network is a private economy comprising 4000 member businesses that monetize excess inventory or capacity at full market rate in BizX dollars. Businesses then use their earned BizX currency to offset cash expenses such as advertising, travel, entertainment, etc. The model produced more than $81,000,000 BizX dollars in transactions in 2015.
BizX primarily earns its revenue from transaction fees, typically 7.5% when selling and 7.5% when buying within the BizX network. Sometimes confused with credit card fees, BizX fees are more comparable to sales or marketing channel fees such as those from HotelTonight, Groupon, or other business sales channels.[6]
BizX dollars are a private currency not exchangeable for cash. They do not take possession of money for transmission, have stored value, earn interest, or act as securities.[7] Nor are BizX dollars a cryptocurrency, as the company is not a money transmitter.[8] BizX dollars simply denote a member’s right to receive from (or obligation to pay) another member in the network. Such member rights are held between the members. BizX serves as an arms-length third-party record keeper. BizX does not hold collateral or guarantee trades between members.[9]
Barter Exchange[edit]
BizX was initially built as a barter exchange, and therefore retains many elements familiar to barter exchanges. Now a digital private currency operator, BizX facilitates the exchange of goods and services between more than 4,000 businesses within the BizX community.
Unlike many traditional barter exchanges, BizX pairs its currency to the value of the US dollar, ensuring that the BizX currency retains the strongest spending power possible.
Additionally, BizX differentiates itself from other barter exchanges by targeting an extremely diverse range of business types, as well as investing deeply in their financial technology software.
Transaction Platform[edit]
BizX acts as a transaction processor and 3rd party record keeper for all buyers and sellers. Sellers can charge buyers’ BizX accounts by phone or online portal. Funds are available to the seller immediately when the transaction is run, with zero processing or holding time.
Customer Relationship Management System[edit]
BizX assists its members in identifying how to monetize their excess capacity, by marketing to other members looking for the same service.[10]
Lending Facility[edit]
BizX offers lines of credit to member businesses at the rate of 1.5% per month (18% annually), payable in BizX dollars.
Marketplace[edit]
The BizX marketplace features listings for all members businesses, as well as individual product and service listings. Members can create individual listings for products and services without cost.
BizX App[edit]
BizX launched its mobile app in 2016. The app is designed to help BizX Members find each other, send payments, as well as stores digital BizX card, Members balance and transactional history.[11]
Community[edit]
BizX comprises more than 4000 member businesses that operate in more than 120 different categories, including advertising, construction, event planning, food & beverage, technology, web services, etc.
Regulations[edit]
IRS Regulation[edit]
BizX is classified as a barter exchange and therefore subject to IRS regulations pertaining to such exchanges. The model complies with TEFRA-based IRS 1099B reporting requirements.[12]
IRS Reporting[edit]
BizX is required by the IRS to act as a third-party record keeper of transactions made through the exchange. All sales made using BizX dollars are reported to the IRS via a 1099-B.[13]

Registered Trademark[edit]
BizX is a registered trademark of BizXchange.
Differences from Cryptocurrencies[edit]
Unlike cryptocurrencies, BizX transactions are not anonymous. BizX keeps record of every transaction between members, and reports them to the IRS at year-end. Additionally, BizX dollars are merely an accounting unit; no cryptocurrency technology is involved. Finally, BizX transactions do not involve “mining,” or the process by which new units of cryptocurrencies are generated by computers solving complex algorithms.[29]

Company History[edit]
BizX was founded in 2002 by Bob Bagga, Chris Haddawy, and Raj Kapoor. All three partners had previous experience in the barter exchange industry. Before founding BizX, Bagga was the founder of Barter Business Exchange (BBE).[1] Later, BBE merged to create UBarter.com, which was sold to Network Commerce in 2001.[3] Haddawy was previously president of the Barter Business Network, and general manager of BarterTrust, overseeing West Coast operations.[4]
Acquisition of Dibspace[edit]
In 2010, BizX acquired Dibspace, an online marketplace that facilitated business-to-business and business-to-consumer exchanges of products and services using a private currency called Dibits.[5]
Office Locations[edit]
Seattle, Washington
Head office opened in 2002, serving the greater Seattle metropolitan area.
Oakland, California
Satellite office opened in 2002, serving the greater San Francisco metropolitan area.
Dubai, UAE
Satellite office opened in 2007, operating large arbitrage deals unique to the UAE market.
Business Model[edit]
The BizX network is a private economy comprising 4000 member businesses that monetize excess inventory or capacity at full market rate in BizX dollars. Businesses then use their earned BizX currency to offset cash expenses such as advertising, travel, entertainment, etc. The model produced more than $81,000,000 BizX dollars in transactions in 2015.
BizX primarily earns its revenue from transaction fees, typically 7.5% when selling and 7.5% when buying within the BizX network. Sometimes confused with credit card fees, BizX fees are more comparable to sales or marketing channel fees such as those from HotelTonight, Groupon, or other business sales channels.[6]
BizX dollars are a private currency not exchangeable for cash. They do not take possession of money for transmission, have stored value, earn interest, or act as securities.[7] Nor are BizX dollars a cryptocurrency, as the company is not a money transmitter.[8] BizX dollars simply denote a member’s right to receive from (or obligation to pay) another member in the network. Such member rights are held between the members. BizX serves as an arms-length third-party record keeper. BizX does not hold collateral or guarantee trades between members.[9]
Barter Exchange[edit]
BizX was initially built as a barter exchange, and therefore retains many elements familiar to barter exchanges. Now a digital private currency operator, BizX facilitates the exchange of goods and services between more than 4,000 businesses within the BizX community.
Unlike many traditional barter exchanges, BizX pairs its currency to the value of the US dollar, ensuring that the BizX currency retains the strongest spending power possible.
Additionally, BizX differentiates itself from other barter exchanges by targeting an extremely diverse range of business types, as well as investing deeply in their financial technology software.
Transaction Platform[edit]
BizX acts as a transaction processor and 3rd party record keeper for all buyers and sellers. Sellers can charge buyers’ BizX accounts by phone or online portal. Funds are available to the seller immediately when the transaction is run, with zero processing or holding time.
Customer Relationship Management System[edit]
BizX assists its members in identifying how to monetize their excess capacity, by marketing to other members looking for the same service.[10]
Lending Facility[edit]
BizX offers lines of credit to member businesses at the rate of 1.5% per month (18% annually), payable in BizX dollars.
Marketplace[edit]
The BizX marketplace features listings for all members businesses, as well as individual product and service listings. Members can create individual listings for products and services without cost.
BizX App[edit]
BizX launched its mobile app in 2016. The app is designed to help BizX Members find each other, send payments, as well as stores digital BizX card, Members balance and transactional history.[11]
Community[edit]
BizX comprises more than 4000 member businesses that operate in more than 120 different categories, including advertising, construction, event planning, food & beverage, technology, web services, etc.
Regulations[edit]
IRS Regulation[edit]
BizX is classified as a barter exchange and therefore subject to IRS regulations pertaining to such exchanges. The model complies with TEFRA-based IRS 1099B reporting requirements.[12]
IRS Reporting[edit]
BizX is required by the IRS to act as a third-party record keeper of transactions made through the exchange. All sales made using BizX dollars are reported to the IRS via a 1099-B.[13]

Registered Trademark[edit]
BizX is a registered trademark of BizXchange.
Differences from Cryptocurrencies[edit]
Unlike cryptocurrencies, BizX transactions are not anonymous. BizX keeps record of every transaction between members, and reports them to the IRS at year-end. Additionally, BizX dollars are merely an accounting unit; no cryptocurrency technology is involved. Finally, BizX transactions do not involve “mining,” or the process by which new units of cryptocurrencies are generated by computers solving complex algorithms.[29]

Business Model[edit]
The BizX network is a private economy comprising 4000 member businesses that monetize excess inventory or capacity at full market rate in BizX dollars. Businesses then use their earned BizX currency to offset cash expenses such as advertising, travel, entertainment, etc. The model produced more than $81,000,000 BizX dollars in transactions in 2015.
BizX primarily earns its revenue from transaction fees, typically 7.5% when selling and 7.5% when buying within the BizX network. Sometimes confused with credit card fees, BizX fees are more comparable to sales or marketing channel fees such as those from HotelTonight, Groupon, or other business sales channels.[6]
BizX dollars are a private currency not exchangeable for cash. They do not take possession of money for transmission, have stored value, earn interest, or act as securities.[7] Nor are BizX dollars a cryptocurrency, as the company is not a money transmitter.[8] BizX dollars simply denote a member’s right to receive from (or obligation to pay) another member in the network. Such member rights are held between the members. BizX serves as an arms-length third-party record keeper. BizX does not hold collateral or guarantee trades between members.[9]
Barter Exchange[edit]
BizX was initially built as a barter exchange, and therefore retains many elements familiar to barter exchanges. Now a digital private currency operator, BizX facilitates the exchange of goods and services between more than 4,000 businesses within the BizX community.
Unlike many traditional barter exchanges, BizX pairs its currency to the value of the US dollar, ensuring that the BizX currency retains the strongest spending power possible.
Additionally, BizX differentiates itself from other barter exchanges by targeting an extremely diverse range of business types, as well as investing deeply in their financial technology software.
Transaction Platform[edit]
BizX acts as a transaction processor and 3rd party record keeper for all buyers and sellers. Sellers can charge buyers’ BizX accounts by phone or online portal. Funds are available to the seller immediately when the transaction is run, with zero processing or holding time.
Customer Relationship Management System[edit]
BizX assists its members in identifying how to monetize their excess capacity, by marketing to other members looking for the same service.[10]
Lending Facility[edit]
BizX offers lines of credit to member businesses at the rate of 1.5% per month (18% annually), payable in BizX dollars.
Marketplace[edit]
The BizX marketplace features listings for all members businesses, as well as individual product and service listings. Members can create individual listings for products and services without cost.
BizX App[edit]
BizX launched its mobile app in 2016. The app is designed to help BizX Members find each other, send payments, as well as stores digital BizX card, Members balance and transactional history.[11]
Community[edit]
BizX comprises more than 4000 member businesses that operate in more than 120 different categories, including advertising, construction, event planning, food & beverage, technology, web services, etc.
Regulations[edit]
IRS Regulation[edit]
BizX is classified as a barter exchange and therefore subject to IRS regulations pertaining to such exchanges. The model complies with TEFRA-based IRS 1099B reporting requirements.[12]
IRS Reporting[edit]
BizX is required by the IRS to act as a third-party record keeper of transactions made through the exchange. All sales made using BizX dollars are reported to the IRS via a 1099-B.[13]

Registered Trademark[edit]
BizX is a registered trademark of BizXchange.
Differences from Cryptocurrencies[edit]
Unlike cryptocurrencies, BizX transactions are not anonymous. BizX keeps record of every transaction between members, and reports them to the IRS at year-end. Additionally, BizX dollars are merely an accounting unit; no cryptocurrency technology is involved. Finally, BizX transactions do not involve “mining,” or the process by which new units of cryptocurrencies are generated by computers solving complex algorithms.[29]

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

New Customers. Better Cash Flow.Welcome to the BizX Community












What Is BizX?Our purpose is to improve the lives and businesses of our members.  At our core is a deep passion for local business, and a personal understanding of the experience of the business owner.
BizX is a community of thousands of local business owners who engage and leverage one another within the BizX network, and a tool called the BizX dollar, which enables them to buy from and sell to one another without spending cash.
The BizX team hosts this diverse network of over 5,000 businesses, and manages the BizX currency, but the engagement and transactions are fueled by the membership.  At BizX, it’s all about the members.
BizX is totally free to join and to be a part of, and members only pay a small fee when they choose to transact with one another.  Nearly all do – because the result is universally positive: New customers, and better cash flow.

New Customers
We deliver incremental, loyal, high-value customers to you through the network.Better Cash Flow
Spend BizX dollars on what you need and save your cash.


All Kinds of Companies Are a Part of the BizX CommunitySince inception, BizX has delivered over $350 million in new revenue to our members, and preserved over $309 million in cash. Our community is diverse and growing every day. The heartbeat of BizX is the local business owner, but companies large and small have chosen to grow their network in our community.
