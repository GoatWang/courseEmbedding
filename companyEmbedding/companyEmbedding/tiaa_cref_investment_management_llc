				What is a Traditional IRA? 
Contributions You can contribute up to $5500 into your IRA in 2017 —and $6500 if you’re over 50. Contributions are often tax deductible. Anyone with earned income can contribute until age 70½. To Contribute Now




 

Withdrawals Must begin taking money out by age 70½. Pay no taxes until you take money out. Withdrawals are penalty free at age 59½. More about Traditional IRAs

						      				More about Traditional IRAs
						      			



Are contributions to a Traditional IRA tax deductible? If you (or your spouse) are not covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan, then your contributions are fully deductible. But if either of you are covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan, your contributions are deductible only if your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is less than $71,000 (single filer) or less than $118,000 for joint filers. If your income is near these limits, your contributions may be only partially deductible. Try our IRA Finder Tool for more information.  If you are covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan and your AGI is above these limits, you can still contribute to a Traditional IRA, but your contributions will not be deductible.Is there an age limit for contributions? Yes. Contributions to a Traditional IRA are not allowed after age 70½.

Get the basics
				IRA rollover basics 
Rollovers move retirement savings from one retirement account to another. There’s no limit on how much money you can roll over.2 The easiest way to roll over is to transfer directly from one institution to another.

If you take money directly out of your retirement plan or IRA (for example, you receive a check made out to you) you can still roll it into a new IRA, but things get more complicated.For example, you’ll need to roll over within 60 days and you may be faced with tax withholding or penalties.

						      				More about what makes TIAA IRAs different
						      			



Wherever you are in life, a TIAA IRA may be a smart way to help manage your retirement goals. Our IRAs can help complement your workplace plan and offer a variety of benefits, including: Advice and support. You can choose a TIAA IRA that offers advice and support to help you figure it all out — which investments are right for you, how much to put in each, and how to receive income in retirement.* A wide array of investments. You can access thousands of investments — both TIAA and non-TIAA mutual funds, stocks, bonds, annuities, FDIC-insured certificates of deposit (CDs) and ETFs through a brokerage IRA. Low costs. Expenses on our mutual funds and annuities are generally less than half the mutual fund industry average, so more money stays in your account.1Have you, or a family member, ever worked for a nonprofit organization?If so, we offer even more IRA investment options.If you or a family member currently work for (or once worked for) a nonprofit organization, you can invest in TIAA's annuities and additional TIAA mutual funds. You’ll be able to select these investments as you go through the process of opening your account.  (Note: If not currently employed at a nonprofit, you or your family member must have either: worked at a nonprofit for at least three years or have worked at a nonprofit since turning 55 years of age.) Eligible family members include: spouses, domestic partners, parents, parents-in-law, step-parents, siblings, step-siblings, children, adopted children, and step-children. Examples of eligible nonprofit organizations include: Nonprofit colleges and universities, public and private elementary and secondary schools, teaching hospitals, charities, museums, libraries, state or municipal agencies (e.g., transit or sanitation departments), municipal fire departments, state and municipal police departments, state parks departments, The U.S. Postal Service, and The U.S. Forest Service. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.  Please call 877-518-9161 or log on to TIAA.org for product and fund prospectuses that contain this and other information.  Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing. 


* Some IRAs may be eligible for support only, and not advice services. Advice services use a methodology from Morningstar Investment Management, LLC. 1 Applies to mutual fund and variable annuity expense ratios. Source: Morningstar Direct, March 31, 2017. The expense ratio on all mutual fund products and variable annuity accounts managed by TIAA is generally less than half the mutual fund industry average. 60% are less than half their respective Morningstar Universe average and 50% are less than half their respective Morningstar Universe median. Our mutual fund and variable annuity products are subject to various fees and expenses, including but not limited to management, administrative, and distribution fees; our variable annuity products have an additional mortality and expense risk charge.
