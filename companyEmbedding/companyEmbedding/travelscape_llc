										I placed order on hotels.com for a room in Orlando. I paid by Paypal who instantly sent me an email confirming the payment sent and is now pending. It took me back to hotels.com to a page saying was having problems but if i didn't receive confirmation email within 5 minutes to call. I waited 30 then called. It took me probably 45 minutest to talk to their customer service because they didn't have a direct link to them the first time i transferred, they hung up on me. The foreign customer service person asked me the same questions probably 3 times before telling me that reservations take 4 hours to get into their computers so I'd get an email by then. By next day I still had not received anything from then.
I tried to just cancel the payment, since I couldn't cancel the reservation since they we're still trying to tell me I didn't make one. However since they have yet to accept the payment, and I have no doubt that they will at since point since they are already screwing me over, Paypal won't let me cancel it.  I left a bad review of web site and got an email back pretty quickly from a Debra H. who asked for my information so she could help. I thought this might be fixed. 5 days later I received an email from her again saying that the reservation was placed with an affiliate and there is nothing can do about it. I never left hotels.com's web site and the payment confirmation has Travelscape LLC as who I paid and hotels.com as their web site. I asked Debra H. who the affiliate was and why would the payment be to hotels.com. I received a reply saying the affiliate (i have yet to find out who is) can only fix this problem and they were "working"  on it. Three days later and nothing from this so called affiliate.

negative experience
I booked a holidays in turkey with this company. Two months before the trip I cancelled my booking because of several problems I had. This company never paid me a refund and this was absolutely unreasonable! They have fraudulent terms and conditions and they don't respect their customers. After this experience I will never recommend this company to anyone!

Friedel Carlton
I paid for two nights at Smokeyland Motel for 06/20/13-06/22/13 by paypal and you didn't send me a confirmation. I had an emergency and needed to cancel these dates and "NO WAY".
I called Travelscape,LLC and Motels.com and never got any satisfaction.
This is bad business on your part.....

EXPEDIA
I never have experience in my life such a faulty and disrespect to customers as I had experience that lasted 5days. Trying to use our tickets we had cancelled for a death, and reuse them, first it cost A$400. to issue them again, ok with that, then the nightmare, trying to tell them that we want to use them to go to Florida again, well they had us going to Chicago and I tried to tell her that I am not going there!! After 2times I asked for english person, she hung up on me, so i had to wait the 2hrs on hold, till my phone went dead and it was nearly midnight, so I will try again and explain, got hung up on and then  finally after a new day, I started to tell them and they promise to correct it, NOT!! So I wait again this time 3hrs and 34min, then I thought to myself they have our number and they dont want to fix it, so I try my cell phone, till it ran dead, I sent my emails and saved them too, to hear that they are sorry but to call those numbers to talk to customer service, and I told them that I used everyone of those numbers and I am on day 4 now trying to get it fixed, finally they dropped my name of the itenarary, and that made me really upset, so I call AMEX and they have on hold not yet charged two tickets, I tell them NOT to let that go through and called Delta and cancelled it, still trying to get a person to handle this from Expedia and not one person could get it right, how disappointing is that, I have used them for years,but this was horrible treatment, I really became ill, and finally used another Credit card and made new res. with another company and the tickets now became so much more expensive, waiting on these nuts, I had to get a new Amex card hoping to start over,well 3 weeks now thinking this is over, I get a bill for 1 airline ticket!! They still havent got it right and I have a charge and now ticket for me. What is wrong with these people, We just wanted to use are old tickets, can you see this picture? and now we have to get new cards, 2 new airline tickets that cost more with some other company and another ticket just for 1person not my wife, what do I need that for. can you help us

Would never recommend Travelscape
Travelscape has such poor customer service that I wouldn't recommend them.  There has been 8+ hours on the phone and on-line to get a refund for one night's reservation out of 24 nights.  Travelscape (or so we thought it was Travelscape, you are never quite sure who you are speaking with, Travelscape or Expedia) was notified five days prior to the check-in date that one of six rooms should only be reserved for three nights instead of four.  For whatever reason that communication never got to Embassy Suites, so they didn't honor the one night refund upon check-in.  Trying to correct the error is a nightmare.  Like I said, there's been 8+ hours put into trying to 'right' the 'wrong' and we're no closer to resolution than when we started.  So frustrating.  I'm asking for $150.78 for a room that was not used and notification was given 5 days in advance.  

To help avoid these problems in the future we have found out if you want to make reservations with Embassy Suites directly, be sure to go through http://embassysuites3.hilton.com/en/index.html or through the Hilton.com website.  Hopefully this review will help us an others like us to have a better experience travellng in the future.

Buyer Beware of Travelscape
I've just spent 8+ hours trying to get a refund for one night's hotel room cancellation ($150.78) that Travelscape apparently did not communicate to Embassy Suites.  Talk about the run around.  Embassy won't help as they weren't the ones who took the reservation.  Travelscape won't help as they don't have record of the call-in.  Lesson Learned:  Make sure you have a cancellation number when you cancel a reservation!

The good news is, I have learned that to make sure you are booking with Embassy Suites directly, be sure to go start through Hilton.com.  Our reservations were made by mistake through Travelscape as they had made themselves look like they were Embassy.  Hopefully our bad experience will help you to avoid Travelscape.com  and avoid travel nightmares in the future.

Travelscape
I've had the worst time trying to first of all get confirmation of a reservation at the Iberostar Rose Hall in Montego Bay Jamaica. It took more than a week to get a confirmation faxed, not even emailed, to me. I'm now having the hardest time cancelling this mess. STAY AWAY FROM TRAVELSCAPE. I'm ashamed of expedia for being affiliated with them and on top of that so far not helpful in resolving issues related to this affiliate.

hotel cancelled
We booked through travel republic for April, who then go through travelscape for the hotel, to be called two days before we were due to fly out they had told us the hotel has been cancelled due to maintenance work been carried out, so we booked another hotel that was offered to us. And to get there the hotel we had actually booked with had people staying there and to this day they are saying we will be not getting compensation as the hotel was having maintenance been done which it wasn't. Never will be booking with these again.

Delta and Travelscape
I booked a room through Delta Airlines for a room at the Embassy Suites in Minneapolis and had to cancel the room. I called to cancel the room but the receptionist said I had to cancel it with a third party which I assumed was Delta Airlines. After what I thought was the right process the bill shows up on my credit card. This marriage between Delta and this company (Travelscape) looks more like a scam waiting to happen. Trying to find out who to talk to has taken me all day and still have not resolved it. 
If you are in the market to get screwed go with Travelscape. If not use someone else. I would not recommend this company to anyone.

Holiday on Crete
I holidayed on Crete with my partner booking through a UK company.

but they use Travelscape to provide accomodation.

We stayed half board as we have many times in Crete previously- although experiences obviously have differed

we have never had such inadequate arrangements before. Breakfast was very basic and dinner was 10 euro towards

dinner in a nearby restaurant which was overpriced. Despite complaining in resort and speaking to an Expedia representative,

who agreed the evening meal provision was inadequate nothing was done. Now having complained to the UK travel agent-

Travelscape have not anwsered the questions asked wilfuly misunderstanding the situation. I am just disgusted with the whole

incient and the complete lack of respect or professionalism from Travelscape- I will be sure to check they are not providers on

future holidays.

Booked us at a crack house
On March 16 2017, we pulled into Phoenix from Fort Stockton Tx. very tired and needing a room. We usually use Choice hotels but believe it, they were all sold out (spring break). Somehow we connected with this Travelscape LLC # 800-916-4339 thinking we were calling Red Roof Inn. The lady (foreign accent) found us a room at the Crossland Phoenix West 4861 W. McDowell Rd. a few blocks from I 10 at the cost of $165.18. It sounded OK so I took a chance and paid up with my VISA. 
When we pulled in it did not look safe, unsavory characters milling about smoking, ladies with back packs waiting out front, etc. After the desk clerk IDed me I asked to check the room out. Reluctantly she complied. My wife waited in the car. When I got back My wife told me that she just watched a drug deal go down. We had been booked at a DRUG HOUSE. I imeditatly went in to get a refund, "Oh we can't do that, you have to contact the booking agency". SCREWED. I am waiting on Travelscape to contact me for my refund which I don't plan to receive. My next call is to the Arizona Attorney Genneral's Consumer Protection Office. Every state has one and that is what everyone who has been SCREWED by this LLC should do. Use the WWW/ to file a complaint. 
I pray we all receive refunds and Travelscape LLC gets shut down.
Sincerely, Retired Nuclear Worker from Kansas, Bert.

Extremely Frustrated
My husband and I booked two rooms for a month and a half out.  We used this website and NOWHERE was it stated that the room was non-refundable.  We don't book a room EVER if it's non-refundable.  We didn't check a box, weren't told at all.  We received a confirmation and we looked at the dates and the amount to ensure it was correct.  It was.  We printed out one of the room confirmations to give it to the party we were travelling with and at the very bottom on the third page, it stated the cancellation policy...... I have spent numerous hours on the phone and they were not willing to even listen to me, couldn't prove to me that on the page that we made the reservation it said non-refundable, NOTHING.  Very, very unconcerned on the phone and I intend to take it up w/the credit card company.  I will never forget this and it has taught me to be even more cautious because it is TOTALLY WRONG what they are doing to people.

Don't trust this company, they try to get your money first. If something goes wrong with the reservation they never will return the money.

Travelscape LLC --Non Refundable not mentioned
I made what I thought was a reservation, only to find that it was billed to my . 
credit card immediately and said it was non changeable and non- refundable.   This was not stated before making the reservation.   This is not an acceptable way to do business.

Pet friendly
Booked a room at what said was a pet friendly motel--small print said no cats--Yes, I did not see that--But to not be able to get a refund for a room 1 month in the future is ridiculous  I thought I was dealing with VRBO, but that and Homeaway all belong to expedia, who I would normally not deal with.  this is got to be a business model that cannot be sustainable--you can just call the business itself and can cancel with no problem--now the motel has a pissed-off guest--how is that good for business
