YOUNG, DENNIS - REEL TO REEL (CD)    


 "Dennis Young is best known as the marimba player/percussionist for the legendary early 80s NYC band LIQUID LIQUID. "Reel to Real" is a lovingly assembled archive collection of his rare and unreleased solo recordings from 1982-1983." (label info) "Back in 1982 at the age of 24 I bought my first recording equipment a - 2 track Teac reel-to-reel-tape-recorder. I already owned a number of analog synthesizers, an electric & acoustic guitar, various effect boxes, and a full drum set. The music was recorded live over a two year period (1982-1983) when I was still playing in LIQUID LIQUID. I was busy with the band but I still found time at home to experiment with my own sound using various instruments & vocal effects. In early 1984 I bought my first 4 track cassette machine which ended my live reel-to-reel recording phase. The tapes were boxed up and put into storage for the next 30 years. About six months ago I was going thru some old boxes and happened to find the tapes again. I was curious to hear what I had on those tapes so I purchased another Teac reel-to-reel-tape- recorder. To my surprise there was a lot of music to choose from these recordings, so after hours of listening I came up with a set of songs that I thought was the best representation of my work from this period. Thanks to Staubgold I am able to share this unique recording experience with you, the listener." (label info) CD includes four bonus tracks

Description by OLDIES.com:

You Can Change the World (1950):Jack Benny and his valet, Eddie "Rochester" Anderson, invites a who's who of Hollywood luminaries to hear the good word of Father James Keller, founder of the religious group The Christophers. The guests include Loretta Young, William Holden, Irene Dunne, Ann Blyth, Paul Douglas, Bing Crosby, and by telephone, Bob Hope. The Christophers' goal is to use movies and TV to inspire young people to change the world for the better and combat the growing spread of Communism. By film's end, Father Keller is regaling the enraptured stars with the story of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. You Can Change the World originally was shown in church groups and then on television, its half-hour format meaning it could masquerade as an episode of The Jack Benny Show on programming schedules. As such it served as a 'backdoor pilot' for a Christophers TV series on ABC which began in 1952, and still airs on local cable stations to this day as Christopher Closeup. The film was directed by Leo McCarey, who made the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup (1933) and some of Laurel & Hardy's best work, but became increasingly conservative with movies like Going My Way (1944) and The Bell of St. Mary's (1945). The participation of so many big names was most likely due to the House Un-American Activities Committee's ongoing investigations into suspected red sympathizers in Hollywood. Since the Christophers were devoutly anti-Communist, anyone supporting them would appear to be a patriotic American by default.Let George Do It (1952): A regular episode of The Christophers series, "Let George Do It" features beloved TV dads Danny Thomas and Robert Young learning about the dangers of political corruption from Father Keller. Dennis Day also appears to sing "God Bless America".On The Right Side (1949): Ann Savage (Detour) must turn her addicted husband away from a life of gambling in this Christian parable made in New York. Ironically, Ann Savage was a regular at gangster Meyer Lansky's casinos. Family Affair (1952): Iconic "tough guy" actor Steve McQueen, in the days before he fought The Blob (1958), plays a lovestruck sailor desperately trying to get his girl on the phone in this rare color film also starring J. Pat O'Malley. Produced by Bell Telephone, it was meant to emphasize the importance of having multiple phones in the house. Shopping Around (1954): I Love Lucy's William Frawley plays a beleaguered salesman who learns "the human touch" in this promotional film for Chevrolet auto dealers. PLUS: Rare Commercials and Public Service Announcements with Bette Davis, Shirley Temple, Spanky McFarland, & Joan Crawford!
