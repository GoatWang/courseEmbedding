                Overstock Invests in Symbiont Via Blockchain Branch            


    By Nathan Reiff | July 20, 2017 — 3:23 PM EDT    






Share





















































Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK), the online retail giant, has entered the blockchain game in a significant way. Overstock's Medici Ventures has been quietly playing out of the focus of the media, but now the company announced that it has made an initial investment in Symbiont, a startup that is working to streamline the methods by which financial instruments are traded.
A report by Coin Desk suggests that both Overstock and Symbiont are presenting the deal as the start of a loner collaborative project which will aim to enhance the possibilities of securities trading on the blockchain. The investment is for undisclosed terms as of this writing. What are the details of the deal, and how might this impact the blockchain technology space going forward?
Symbiont Investment Almost Didn't Happen
Medici Ventures' investment in Symbiont came close to falling through, according to the report. Jonathan Johnson, the president of the blockchain arm of Overstock, had previously considered joining the company's list of investors in an earlier round, although he ultimately decided to pass for the time being. About that earlier decision, he explained that his company "made a mistake." Fortunately, in the next round of funding, Johnson was able to include his assets in the mix.
Symbiont was founded in 2015 and has raised roughly $7 million in funding to launch its private blockchain solutions so far. Hundsun, the tech firm with support by Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, is one of Symbiont's most recent investors.
Earlier in July, Symbiont worked alongside a number of other organizations to push for blockchain regulation in Delaware. Symbiont is among a number of companies that stand to benefit from the Delaware state amendments which successfully passed. These stipulations will recognize the corporation's right use blockchain ledger systems to track stock shares.
Strategic Involvement
Johnson described Medici's involvement with Symbiont as strategic in nature. Caitlin Long, the president of Symbiont, explained further, indicating that the opportunity for Medici's investment came back on the table in the lead-up to the passage of Delaware's amendments.
Long indicated that Symbiont is seeking to be the first private company to move the entirety of its shares to a blockchain, while Medici's parent company Overstock would like to be the first public company to do the same thing. In this way, the two organizations are similarly focused. Long said "[Overstock] put a proposal on the table about three weeks ago, and moved very quickly once we both realized we wanted to do this."
The exact nature of the partnership between Medici and Symbiont remains to be seen, but it is clear that the involvement will most likely push toward the goal of shifting those specified stocks to a blockchain system.

These chairs are for my downstairs tv room.  They go well with the rest of the furniture but I would not use them for my main dining table.  They look good and the fact that they stack is a big plus!  But, that being said, they are not super comfy and are light.  I don't know how much weight they will take.  Cute though and great for an extra room.

The only complaint I would have is that when they were delivered, they were left on my front walk in the rain and the box was completely soaked by the time I got home. They could have put them on the front steps where they would nave been somewhat protected

Let me begin by saying that I just got this bed today.  It was delivered in two separate boxes. The bed frame was delivered yesterday. The remaining parts were delivered today. The boxes were damaged during shipping. I took pictures of this just in case it was needed.  The directions were short & sweet. I checked to make sure and the screws and bolts were accounted for..and I was able to put the bed together without any assistance. My only suggestion would be to use a socket wrench instead of the dinky wrench that comes with it. Bed is very sturdy!!

Pretty but not sturdy
















Verified Purchase


This bed seemed sturdy until I had to share it with my 6'4" 200lb husband and 20lb cat. Two of the three center support legs bent within months. We currently have the slats supported with blocks of wood nailed in where the support legs used to be which is tiding us over for now.

Bed shopping tip: always check the weight capacity. These cheap metal bed frames all seem to be rated for around 500lbs. Add a couple people, a mattress, and box spring and that easily pushes you over 2/3 of the weight limit, which is not a good place to be.

Head board loose
















Verified Purchase


This user earned $2.00 Club O Rewards for writing this review.Learn More 


I really like the look of this bed. However the head board does not secure to the the base very well. It feels wobbly. Right now it's a guest bed but I wouldn't know how it would hold up for everyday use.

Great value for the money

Beautiful BUT.....
















Verified Purchase


So I bought this a full year ago and I'm going to let you know everything... ok so I'm 5'1 and 120 lbs and I sleep on this by myself.. Very shortly after getting the bed I realized that the three support "feet" that go down the center of the bed bent. No matter how hard you try they just keep bending. Well obviously gravity takes effect and the 3 beams those "feet" support start to bow out. That eventually caused my box spring to crack on all 4 sides from the weight of the bed and me on the bowing wood. I'm very disappointed as I really loved the look of this bed. My best advice is to look online for an actual antique bed frame if that's what u are interested in. -also i would like to add in response to an email question about this bed for a toddler, besides the problems I've had, I wouldn't have trusted my toddler boys to not get their heads stuck between the bars. Definitely not a toddler friendly bed. I hope this helps! Good luck

My grandson did it for me but I'm pretty sure they bolted on. It's very well constructed and stable. It was far superior to the bed frame I had previously. I think it's beautiful and I'm picky.

It is only about 6.5" inches high. Have to be careful when looking at under bed storage, many are taller than that so I don't think any trundle would fit.

The full and queen size beds feature center support legs and cannot be used with a trundle. The twin size can be used with a trundle, however, the trundle would have to fit under the 6.7 inch clearance under the bed.

This is a Trial Version of Social Share & Locker Pro plugin. Please add your purchase code into Licence section to enable the Full Social Share & Locker Pro Version.Overstock Executive: It’s Crazy That Retailers Still Don’t Accept Bitcoin
Recently, as reported by CCN, Morgan Stanley published a report that showed that out of the top 500 online retailers, only three accept bitcoin, down from five in 2016. The report outlined a few motives that led to the decline, including a rise in bitcoin’s price, scalability issues, and according to the bank a lack of pressure from bitcoiners for retailers to start accepting bitcoin.
Get exclusive analysis of bitcoin and learn from our trading tutorials. Join Hacked.com for just $39 now.
The reduction in the number of retailers that accept bitcoin has baffled Overstock executive Jonathan Johnson, president of Medici Ventures, who played a crucial role in Overstock accepting bitcoin back in 2014. At the time, CCN reported that in the first 21 hours the retailer processed $124,000 in bitcoin orders.
Speaking to Business Insider, Jonathan stated that Overstock has throughout the years seen a “modest uptick in the number of bitcoin transactions”, and that as such he believes it’s crazy that most retailers still don’t accept bitcoin payments.
One of the reasons Morgan Stanley stated is holding back bitcoin adoption are costly transactions. Johnson doesn’t see this as a valid point. He stated:
The cost of accepting bitcoin is very low. It’s actually cheaper for us to complete a bitcoin transaction than it is to complete a credit card.




Since the cost of accepting bitcoin transactions doesn’t fall on the retailer, according to Johnson, it makes no sense not to let customers pay for the cost, if they are willing to do so and are given the option.
Another point used to argue against bitcoin adoption is price volatility. Business Insider pointed out Ethereum’s flash crash on GDAX, in which the cryptocurrency’s price plummeted to about $0.10 before regaining its near $300 value, as an example. Retailers, as pointed out, don’t want to accept a currency that can in a matter of minutes lose all its value.
Jonathan Johnson opined this doesn’t make any sense, as it is easy for a business to turn a cryptocurrency into fiat at the time of transaction, effectively avoiding the risks associated with volatility. Johnson even pointed out that, when Overstock started accepting bitcoin, it kept 90% of the bitcoins and only converted 10% to fiat. Nowadays, Overstock converts 50%.
Bitcoiners Trying to Get Retailers on Board
Bitcoiners have recently been trying to get retailers to accept the cryptocurrency with, for example, a Change.org petition that urged Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos for the marketplace to start accepting bitcoin that got over 2,100 signatures.
Moreover, CoinGeek recently sent the Financial Directors of the top 20 online retailers $100 in bitcoin via a QR coda and, so far, only Laurence Tosi from Airbnb decided to accept the free bitcoin.
Johnson believes that the companies should accept the cryptocurrency. Per his own words:
I don’t know why a CEO wouldn’t want to make it easier for folks to spend money.
Overstock’s Support for Bitcoin
Overstock wasn’t just the first major online retailer to start accepting bitcoin; it is also one of the biggest organizations supporting the cryptocurrency. Overstock’s CEO Patrick Byrne has in the past stated that he “loves bitcoin” and that he truly believes in the cryptocurrency.
Moreover, he added that he hopes one day bitcoin will destroy central banking. As if that wasn’t enough, in the past Overstock even announced that it was going to donate 4% of its bitcoin revenue to organizations promoting the adoption of the cryptocurrency.

Medici Ventures Invests in Symbiont, Aims to Lead Delaware Blockchain Form Registration
 Tweet Share3 Share +11 Reddit Pin EmailShares 4

July 20, 2017 @ 11:51 am By Erin Hobey 


Medici Ventures, a major blockchain tech investor, completed its strategic investment in Symbiont. As part of the new relationship, the two companies will collaborate on strategic projects involving both Medici Ventures and its parent company, Overstock.com Common Shares (NASDAQ:OSTK) / Series A Preferred (Medici Ventures’ t0 platform : OSTKP) / Series B Preferred (OTCQX:OSTBP).
In addition to strategic collaboration on blockchain efforts, Medici intends to be the first to register corporate ownership shares using blockchain—under a newly passed Delaware law. The move is a critical one for the use of blockchain to change the way shares are created, owned and traded.
“We look forward to Medici Ventures becoming one of the first Delaware entities to convert its registration to blockchain form at the State of Delaware using the new Delaware blockchain amendments, which take effect August 1, 2017 pending Governor John Carney’s signature,” stated  President of Medici Ventures and Overstock.com Director Jonathan Johnson. “We also anticipate using blockchain to administer Medici Ventures’ fund interests from inception, thereby providing our investors with end-to-end recordkeeping on a blockchain and administration of investor interests using smart contracts.  We expect to deliver best-in-class investor transparency.”
Symbiont, a smart contracts platform for institutional applications of distributed ledger technology, counts nineteen disclosed financial institutions for Smart Loans™, arranged by Credit Suisse and executed via Synaps, its syndicated loans joint venture with Ipreo; the State of Delaware for Smart Records™; a major European insurance company for Smart Swaps™ in the catastrophe insurance market; and Orebits, a provider of asset digitization services; PrivateMarket.io, an alternative assets platform.
“We welcome Medici Ventures as an investor in Symbiont and as a partner for Medici’s blockchain registration with the State of Delaware,” commented CEO and co-founder Symbiont Mark Smith. “Management of fund interests is a logical extension of Symbiont’s Smart Securities® capabilities, and we welcome a partner that is equally committed to the principle of ensuring accuracy of shareholder records at all times during a company’s life cycle.”
Overstock’s CEO and founder Dr. Patrick Byrne added:
“When Overstock went public in our IPO in 2002, I had no choice but to sign over ownership of my personal shares to the DTC’s Cede & Co. Thanks to Delaware’s new law, entrepreneurs won’t be forced into such a Faustian bargain anymore as the admission ticket into the club of publicly-traded companies because Delaware is giving entrepreneurs a path to retaining direct ownership of their shares after their IPOs. We are studying opportunities opened by Delaware’s new law for Overstock’s shareholders to gain direct ownership of our OSTK shares at some point. One thing is for sure — the Dole Food case, where investors presented brokerage statements evidencing ownership of roughly 33% more Dole shares than were legally outstanding — is Exhibit A to prove the existing system doesn’t always keep accurate track of who owns what. Thanks to Delaware, accuracy in securities ownership records can be achieved.”

The founder of what could be Nigeria’s first online store that accepts Bitcoin has described an experience of buying from US-based retail giant Overstock as a major factor that made him proceed with the idea of an e-commerce site. Nigeria bitcoin store site launches this month and only accepts cryptocurrency. Emmanuel Olorunisola says:
Shopnow.ng came to mind precisely in April when I got a list of websites that accept BTC and I was trying them out to see how they work. I stumbled on overstock.com and saw a wristwatch selling for $28 and I was excited and decided to place an order.
Enthusiastic at the opportunity presented by Overstock, it struck him as a platform that would be useful to him, as well as other Nigerians who may want to use the digital currency for payment.  There is no reliable study on the actual number of Nigerians using the currency and their pattern of usage, and Olorunisola found the shipping fee to be five times higher than the actual price of the product he had wanted to order.
However, rather than let his disappointment at the situation weigh him down, Olorunisola thought of how to create a similar platform where people in Nigeria can pay with Bitcoin. He is aware that there will be several other Nigerians who have Bitcoin and would, at some point, want to shop and pay with the digital currency without having to worry about first converting it to Naira.
Several factors have drawn Nigerians to Bitcoin, especially in the past year. According to Chris Ani, who provides education for newbies in the Nigerian cryptocurrency space, the current banking system “has left a lot of Nigerians unsatisfied” and the economic recession that recently shook the country has drawn Nigerians to digital currencies such as Bitcoin. He is of the view that addressing inadequate information about digital currencies is key to boosting users’ confidence for online transactions as in the case of shopnow.ng.
However, despite the possibilities and the potentials of the e-commerce industry in Nigeria, it is not clear whether Nigeria bitcoin store shopnow.ng will gain traction immediately with its new approach to the market.
Several big guns such as Konga, Jumia, OLX and Jiji already dominate the market. The acceptance and promotion of the use of Bitcoin is the niche that could make the difference.

Medici Ventures Announces Strategic Investment in Symbiont

SALT LAKE CITY, July  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Medici Ventures and Symbiont today announced the completion of a strategic investment in Symbiont by Medici Ventures, a major investor in blockchain technology. As part of the new relationship, the two companies will collaborate on strategic projects involving both Medici Ventures and its parent company, Overstock.com Common Shares (NASDAQ:OSTK) / Series A Preferred (Medici Ventures’ t0 platform : OSTKP) / Series B Preferred (OTCQX:OSTBP).

Thanks to Delaware’s new law, entrepreneurs won’t be forced into such a Faustian bargain anymore as the admission ticket into the club of publicly-traded companies because Delaware is giving entrepreneurs a path to retaining direct ownership of their shares after their IPOs.

The blockchain branch of retail giant Overstock today announced its first investment in Symbiont, a startup aimed at streamlining the way financial instruments are traded.
The investment by Overstock's Medici Ventures in Symbiont, for undisclosed terms, is being positioned by both firms as the beginning of a collaborative effort to bring to life a new era of securities traded directly on a blockchain.
But the investment almost didn't happen. Earlier this year, Medici president Jonathan Johnson had considered joining an earlier round, only to pass on the opportunity — it turns out, temporarily.
Medici Ventures president Jonathan Johnson explained how Symbiont fits into the company’s portfolio, and why they decided to pass on the company the first time around.
He told CoinDesk:
"We made a mistake."
Founded in 2015, Symbiont has raised a total of about $7 million to build out private blockchain solutions, including most recently an undisclosed amount from Hundsun, a tech firm backed by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.
Earlier this month, Symbiont was among several organizations involved in helping push for blockchain regulation in the State of Delaware, which celebrated the successful passage of the amendments.
Both Symboint and fellow Medici Ventures portfolio company T0 stand to benefit from the amendments that explicitly recognized a corporation’s right to use a blockchain to track stock shares.
Even as Johnson acknowledged that the companies' work with stocks was "somewhat competitive," he distinguished Symbiont’s Orebits work with selling gold on a blockchain and other initiatives as potentially being of use to each other.
"There's some overlap," said Johnson. "But we see them as mostly complimentary."
Blockchain strategy
In contrast to Medici Ventures investments in Bitt and T0, which Johnson described as involving a "significant role," he said his firm’s work with Symbiont is of a more strategic nature.
Symbiont president Caitlin Long elaborated on what that means when she told CoinDesk the investment conversation was "resurrected" in the build-up to the passage of the Delaware amendments.
In conversation, Long said that while Symbiont wants to be the first private company to move all its shares to a blockchain, Medici parent Overstock wants to be the first public company to do so.
She concluded:
"They put a proposal on the table about three weeks ago, and moved very quickly once we both realized we wanted to do this."

More Information about Clearance Bins
When we need to liquidate products, we give them additional mark downs, sometimes up to 65 percent off. Then we put them here, in the Overstock.com clearance bins. This is the best place to find serious savings on clothing, shoes, jewelry, housewares, bedding, electronics, and more. We have some of the lowest prices in online shopping every day, so you know the discounts you'll find here will be incredible. But these closeouts are going fast!
If you don’t want to wait for a sale, then check out our clearance section any time you get the itch to shop for deals online. Products go on clearance all the time, so it’s worth checking back often. You may find brand-name and designer goods. You can finish holiday shopping months ahead of time by coming here regularly. You may even find all the basics you need for your home. There are limited quantities, so if there's something you like, you won’t want to hesitate.






















OGlobal™


                Shop Overstock™ and find the best online deals on everything for your home and your family. We work every day to bring you discounts on new products across our entire store. Whether you're looking for memorable gifts or everyday essentials, you can buy them here for less. Not just anyone’s mobile outlet, your mobile outlet.

This can be misleading. I asked the manufacturer and received the following:"The hulls are sourced from a specialty processing facility that provides a variety of buckwheat products to the food services industry.  As a result, the buckwheat it purchases is subject to stringent requirements and the mill is certified USDA food grade. The hulls are an important byproduct of buckwheat and are carefully processed for the buckwheat pillow markets.  I understand that the cleaning process includes screen sifting to remove small particles and electrostatically charging and tumbling the hulls prior to cleaning, followed by a negative air-flow process to remove any residual flour or dust.  Having sold thousands of pillows over the years we have yet to hear of a complaint about the hulls.  They are the best on the market.  The reference to sterilization is a generic comment that relates to any buckwheat hull pillow: It is not intended to suggest that the pillow needs to be sterilized for any reason." -Bret Randall, Manager, Pur-Sleep, IncThe Website **** states: "Our premium buckwheat hulls are sourced from the finest North American suppliers.  They are clean, dust free, and hypoallergenic."Great pillow!A+++++++++++++ product!This wonderful acrylic roller works just great for my needs. It rolls smooth and the products I roll with it dont stick....BIG PLUS.Great ProductI converted a den into a small bedroom, the entry way is wide, 59 inc, so I bought 2 doors and it worked GREAT.  Trimming it to the right height is a little bit tricky, I have to look on line on how to do it, but overall, it is very easy to install.  I will buy another one for my next project.Like tableI decorate my living room with modern style, so I am looking for something stuning, shining, but good size  within budget. I found this table on O'stock, other sells sell it over at least 200, so I gave it a try. very fast shipping, table arrived within 3 days, and I follow the instruction to install it. But two end caps of side frame were missing, I called manufacturer first. Installation instruction & parts form in the box, and ask buyer contact manufacturer first instead to return it to retailer.  Manufacturer is called southern enterprises Inc in TX, very easy to get hold of the customer service, and I just told model# and what parts need. Customer service confirmed the parts with parts guy right away to make sure she wrote down right part #, and told me parts would arrive with 3-5 business days. after 5 days, parts arrive by UPS ,and I just put them on the table, That's It ! I am very happy with the product and easy smooth customer service.KevinVery good product. 
However it would be nice if there are more drilled holes on the adjustable extension bar for user to adjust to any lenght as wish. Currently it only has 3 holes. it would ince to have 4 or 5 holes.Shoe storageUsing in a retail store for product display.  Looks ince.
Building directions could be clearer.An eye catching modern look table.Once the table is assembled it's beautiful! I have received many compliments on the look and quality. The only drawback is the installation directions are vague, not all steps are explained. The customer service at Overstock.com Inc. is great, they back there products and strive for customer satisfaction. I highly recommend this table. The table brings a modern flair to your decor.Good productAn excellent choice for a gift. I will buy this product againIf it's good enough for HTI....My old company, Hutchinson Technology, Inc. used this product all over the plant. As a world leader in hard-disc drive suspensions, manufacturing demands are critical, so these inexpensive surge protectors are used throughout the company to protect valuable manufacturing equipment and meters. Hundreds are in use.

So when I needed some surge protection for my home stereo system, this was the system for me. Now my Audio by Van Alstine Ultravalve tube amp is fully protected from all bad things coming in from the power grid. Not much to pay for security.

Overstock.com, Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Provides Capital Expenditure Guidance for the Year 2017
May 4 17
Overstock.com, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company's total net revenue was $432,435,000 against total net revenue of $413,677,000 a year ago. The growth in revenue was primarily due to a 10% increase in average order size. This increase was partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to its driving a higher proportion of its sales using such promotions. Operating loss was $2,313,000 against operating income of $17,813,000 a year ago. Loss before income taxes was $6,622,000 against income before income taxes of $22,058,000 a year ago. Net loss was $6,282,000 against net income of $13,094,000 a year ago. Net loss attributable to stockholders of the company was $5,903,000 or $0.23 per basic and diluted share against net income attributable to stockholders of the company of $13,429,000 or $0.53 per basic and diluted share a year ago. Net cash used in operating activities was $23,097,000 against net cash used in operating activities of $34,503,000 a year ago. The $12.1 million decrease is primarily due to decreased net income. Expenditures for fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development was $11,344,000 against expenditures for fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development of $19,592,000 a year ago. 

For the year 2017, the company expects capex of $25 million in 2017.

Although we believe that our expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee or offer any assurance of future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements or other future events.  Table of Contents  Our forward-looking statements contained in this report speak only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or any changes in our expectations or any change in any events, conditions or circumstances on which any of our forward-looking statements are based.  Available Information  Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our main website www.overstock.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not a part of or incorporated into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Overview  We are an online retailer and advancer of blockchain technology. Through our online retail business we offer a broad range of price-competitive brand name, non-brand name and closeout products, including furniture, home decor, bedding and bath, housewares, jewelry and watches, apparel and designer accessories, health and beauty products, electronics and computers, and sporting goods, among other products. We also sell hundreds of thousands of best seller and current run books, magazines, CDs, DVDs and video games ("BMMG"). We sell these products and services through our Internet websites located at www.overstock.com, www.o.co and www.o.biz (referred to collectively as the "Website"). Although our three websites are located at different domain addresses, the technology and equipment and processes supporting the Website and the process of order fulfillment described herein are the same for all three websites.  In late 2014, we began working on initiatives to develop and advance blockchain technology, which we refer to collectively as Medici, and which includes our majority-owned subsidiary t�.com, Inc. (formerly Medici, Inc.). As part of our Medici initiatives, we have formed a wholly-owned subsidiary Medici Ventures, Inc. and acquired a majority interest in a financial technology company and two related registered broker dealers. We have also made minority investments in several blockchain technology companies. In 2015, we were the first public company to issue a private security using blockchain technology and in December 2016, as a successful demonstration of our technology, we issued publicly traded blockchain preferred shares of Overstock.com, Inc.  Our company, based near Salt Lake City, Utah, was founded in 1997. We launched our initial website in March 1999 and were re-incorporated in Delaware in 2002. As used herein, "Overstock," "Overstock.com,", "O.co," "we," "our" and similar terms include Overstock.com, Inc. and our majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.  Our Business  In our retail business, we deal primarily in price-competitive, new and replenishable merchandise and use the Internet to aggregate both supply and demand to create an efficient marketplace for selling these products. We provide our customers an opportunity to conveniently shop for a broad range of price-competitive products. We continually add new, and sometimes limited, inventory to our Website in order to create an atmosphere that encourages customers to visit frequently and purchase products before our inventory sells out. We provide suppliers with access to a large customer base and convenient services for order fulfillment, customer service, returns handling, and other services. The merchandise offered on our Website is from a variety of sources including well-known, brand-name manufacturers. We have organized our retail business (sales of product offered through the Shopping Section of our Website) into two principal segments-a "direct" business and a "partner" business. Consumers and businesses are able to access and purchase our products 24 hours a day from the convenience of a computer, Internet-enabled mobile telephone or other Internet-enabled device. Our team of customer service representatives assists customers by telephone, instant online chat and e-mail. We also derive revenue from other businesses advertising products or services on our Website. Our sales are primarily to customers located in the United States.  Our retail direct business includes sales made to individual consumers and businesses from our owned inventory and that are fulfilled primarily from our warehouse in Salt Lake City, Utah.  For our retail partner business, we sell merchandise from manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers ("partners") primarily through our Website. We are considered to be the primary obligor for the majority of these sales transactions and we record revenue from the majority of these sales transactions on a gross basis. Our use of the term "partner" does not mean that  Table of Contents  we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our partners. These third party partners generally perform the same fulfillment operations as our warehouses, such as order picking and shipping; however, we handle returns and customer service related to substantially all orders placed through our Website. Revenue generated from sales on our Shopping site from both the direct and partner businesses is recorded net of returns, coupons and other discounts.  Both direct and partner revenues are seasonal, with revenues historically being the highest in the fourth quarter, which ends December 31, reflecting higher consumer holiday spending. We anticipate this will continue for the foreseeable future. To the extent possible we maintain supplier relationships, and seek new supplier relationships, for both our direct and partner businesses, and also use our working capital, to ensure a continuous allotment of product offerings for our customers. Because a portion of our product offerings are closeout merchandise, some of our suppliers cannot supply products to us on a continuous basis.  Medici business  Our Medici business initiatives leverage the security, transparency and immutability of cryptographically protected, distributed ledgers, such as the blockchain, and are focused on solving important problems, including financial transaction issues, particularly in the area of securities settlement. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medici Ventures, Inc., we hold minority investments in several technology companies which, at March 31, 2017, included PeerNova, Bitt, IdentityMind, Factom, SettleMint and Ripio, whose focus include commercial blockchain applications, digital currency solutions, Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering compliance, voting and land. Medici Ventures, Inc.'s primary business is its majority interest in t�.com, Inc., which includes a financial technology company and two related registered broker dealers.  As described further in Item 1 of Part I, "Financial Statements (Unaudited)"-Note 9. Business Segments, we determined our segments based on how we manage our business, which, in our view, consists primarily of our Retail and Medici businesses. As described above, our Retail business consists of our Direct and Partner reportable segments. We use gross profit as the measure to determine our reportable segments because there is not discrete financial information available below gross profit for our Direct and Partner segments. As a result, our Medici business is not significant as compared to our Direct and Partner segments and is included in Other. Our Other segment consists of Medici.  Executive Commentary  This executive commentary is intended to provide investors with a view of our business through the eyes of our management. As an executive commentary, it necessarily focuses on selected aspects of our business. This executive commentary is intended as a supplement to, but not a substitute for, the more detailed discussion of our business included elsewhere herein. Investors are cautioned to read our entire "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," as well as our interim and audited financial statements, and the discussion of our business and risk factors and other information included elsewhere or incorporated in this report. This executive commentary includes forward-looking statements, and investors are cautioned to read "Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."  Revenues in Q1 2017 increased 5% compared to Q1 2016. The growth in revenue was primarily due to a 10% increase in average order size. This increase was partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. In addition, the percentage of revenue we defer from orders taken but not delivered was higher due to increased sales volume at quarter end. These decreases to revenue were partially offset by a decrease in Club O Rewards earned due to discontinuing rewards on the Club O Silver program in Q4 2016 and a decrease in returns. Our average order size has increased in recent years due primarily to a sales mix shift into home and garden products. We are uncertain how long this trend will continue.  Gross profit in Q1 2017 increased 12% compared to Q1 2016 primarily as a result of revenue growth. Gross margin increased to 20.1% in Q1 2017 compared to 18.7% in Q1 2016. Gross margin increased due a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products, but that increase was partially offset by increased promotional activities.  Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 7.6% to 8.7% during Q1 2017 as compared to Q1 2016, primarily due to increased spending in the sponsored search marketing channels and increased staff related costs.  Table of Contents  As a result of these factors, our contribution was virtually flat in Q1 2017 compared to Q1 2016 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Contribution to Gross Profit). Contribution margin was 11.6% in Q1 2017 compared to 12.1% in Q1 2016.  Technology expenses in Q1 2017 increased $3.3 million compared to Q1 2016, primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $1.0 million, an increase of $958,000 in technology licenses and maintenance, and an increase in depreciation of $902,000.  General and administrative expenses in Q1 2017 increased $762,000 compared to Q1 2016, primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million in staff related costs, . . .

Overstock.com, Inc. is an American internet retailer headquartered in Midvale, Utah,[1] near Salt Lake City.[2] Patrick M. Byrne founded the company in 1997 and launched the company in May 1999. Overstock.com initially sold exclusively surplus and returned merchandise on an online e-commerce marketplace, liquidating the inventories of at least 18 failed dot-com companies at below-wholesale prices.[3] The company continues to sell home decor, furniture, bedding, and many other goods that are closeout merchandise,[4] however, it also sells new merchandise.[5]
In May 2002, Overstock held an IPO at a per-share price of $13, and after achieving significant growth and profits in some early quarters, achieved a profit of $7.7 million in 2009[6] and reported its first billion-dollar year in 2010. The business started rebranding in early 2011, as "O.co", to simplify and unify its international operations[7] but interrupted this effort a few months later, citing consumer confusion over the new name.[8]
Byrne took an indefinite leave of absence in April 2016, because of Hepatitis C complications. The general counsel, Mitch Edwards, was named acting CEO.[9] In July 2016, Byrne returned as CEO.

Business model, management and figures[edit]
Part of Overstock.com's merchandise is purchased by or manufactured specifically for the company. Among their products are handmade goods produced for Overstock by workers in developing nations.[10][11] The company also manages the inventory supply for other retailers. In addition to its direct retail sales, Overstock.com began offering online auctions on its website in 2004, known as Overstock.com Marketplace and later O.co Marketplace. This service was retired in July 2011.[12]
After initially relying solely on word-of-mouth marketing from customers,[13] the company turned to distinctive television advertisements starring German actress Sabine Ehrenfeld.[14][15] Later, they would employ other advertising spokespersons.
In July 2006, John J. Byrne, the father of Overstock's chief executive, resigned from the board of directors after a public airing of the elder Byrne's unhappiness with his son's actions against naked short-selling.[16] In August 2008, Jack Byrne said that after "much initial skepticism" he believed his son was "right all along" about the battle and lawsuits with short-sellers and analysts.[17] In 2010 the elder Byrne returned to the Overstock.com board of directors.
In early 2007, John A. Fisher and Ray Groves resigned from the Overstock board of directors over disagreement with the company's prime broker suit.[18][19]
On January 2, 2008,[20] Overstock announced that cofounder Jason Lindsey had resigned as President, COO, and as a Director of Overstock effective from December 31, 2007. Byrne said Lindsey had "played a decisive role getting [Overstock] back on track" after "I screwed it up a couple years ago".[21] Overstock stock dropped to a four-year low following the announcement,[22] which an analyst for investment bank Broadpoint Capital described as a "key loss".[23]
In 2011, revenues dropped 5 percent over a two-month penalty period imposed by Google. According to the Associated Press, Overstock set up fake websites linking back to its own site. Overstock said it was penalized in part for a practice of encouraging college and university websites to post links to Overstock pages so that students and faculty could receive discounts. As a result of the Google penalty, search results for certain products dropped in Google rankings.[24][25] During the same year, Overstock.com acquired naming rights to the former Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, renaming it Overstock.com Coliseum.[26] The Coliseum was later rebranded O.co Coliseum, in keeping with Overstock's then-rebranding as O.co (in April 2016, the name O.co Coliseum was dropped in favor of Oakland-Alameda Coliseum).
In 2013, Overstock began promoting increased immigration. Overstock president Jonathan Johnson told the Los Angeles Times that his firm had struggled to hire enough computer programmers and software developers to expand the business. "We pay more, and they are still hard to fill", he said. "We need to be more free in letting people in. That helps us solve our border problem. No one goes through the window of a house if they can ring the doorbell and come in the front door."[27]
In 2014, Overstock began developing software that would allow it to distribute corporate stock online instead of using traditional methods like the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ.[28]
Overstock.com's Board of Directors on January 9, 2014, was Patrick Byrne, Jonathan E. Johnson III, Allison H. Abraham, Barclay F. Corbus, Samuel A. Mitchell, Stormy D. Simon, Joseph J. Tabacco, Jr. and Dr. Kirthi Kalyanam [29]
Bitcoin[edit]
On January 9, 2014, Overstock.com became the first major retailer to start accepting bitcoin as payments for its goods.[30] On the first day, they made sales worth US$126,000 in bitcoin.[31] This represents a 4.33% increase in sales from their normal income of $3 million per day.[32]
As of March 13, 2014, Overstock bitcoin income had shrunk to under 1% of their normal daily cash intake.[33]
In a community interview with social media site Reddit on May 3, 2014, in response to a question to the Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne about the percentage of revenue and transactions paid for in bitcoin, Byrne responded that the percentage was "Tiny. <.1%".[34] In mid-2014 Overstock.com announced that bitcoin sales were averaging $300,000 per month and that the company expected bitcoin sales to add 4 cents to the company's 2014 earnings per share.[35]
On September 14, 2014, Overstock announced it would begin donating 4% of bitcoin revenue to foundations that were advocating for cryptocurrency.[36]
Naked short selling campaign[edit]
The company has received attention stemming from CEO Patrick Byrne's battle against alleged naked short selling of his company's shares. Beginning in 2005, Byrne has contended that a number of companies, including Overstock.com, have been the targets of this practice, which involves selling a stock short but without the usual step of initially borrowing or locating the shares. Byrne alleges that the practice circumvents safeguards of conventional shorting, and has been used in large schemes devised to profit from driving down the prices of companies' shares, in many cases leading to these companies' failure. With Overstock, Byrne contends that the company's longstanding appearance on the Regulation SHO Threshold Security list, an SEC-mandated list showing companies with a high number of "fails to deliver", along with high trading volumes that sometimes surpass total quantity of the company's stock, establish that it has been targeted by this practice.[37] Byrne's campaign has been controversial, including criticism in the financial press that Byrne is seeking to divert attention from Overstock's share price declines and failure to turn a profit.[38] New York Times columnist Joseph Nocera has said in 2006 that, "Except for a few fellow-traveling Web sites, where Mr. Byrne is viewed as a heroic figure, most people who understand the issue or have looked into it think it's pretty bogus."[39] Others have suggested that the problem is real, but that the SEC acts to prevent it and that it does not happen on any scale such as Byrne suggests. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox called abusive naked short selling "a fraud that the commission is bound to prevent and to punish."[40]
Overstock filed a lawsuit against the hedge fund Rocker Partners in 2005, for libel, unfair business practices and tortious interference, saying it colluded with a research firm, Gradient Analytics, in short-selling the company while paying Gradient Analytics to publish negative reports about Overstock.com and supplying pre-publication copies to Rocker. Naked short-selling was not alleged in that suit.[41] In a conference call with analysts in August 2005, a day after the suit was filed, Byrne said that "there's been a plan since we were in our teens to destroy our stock, drive it down to $6--$10 ... and even a plan for how the company would then get whacked up." He said that the conspirators were part of a "Miscreants Ball", headed by a "Sith Lord", who he refused to identify but said "he's one of the master criminals from the 1980s." Byrne said the conspiracy included hedge funds, journalists, investigators, trial lawyers, the SEC, and Eliot Spitzer."[42] Gradient countersued, alleging Byrne waged a smear campaign.[43]
Rocker Partners, renamed Copper River Management, filed a counterclaim against Overstock in November 2007, alleging overstatement of profits, false projections, and misrepresentations about the company's ventures.[44] Copper River also alleges that Byrne tried to silence critics by suing them.[45][46][47][48] A portion of this suit was settled out of court on October 13, 2008, when Overstock.com and Gradient dropped the claims against each other after Gradient retracted allegations that Overstock's reporting methods did not comply with rules established by the FASB, stated they believed Overstock.com complied with GAAP standards, and that three directors were independent according to NASD standards, and apologized.[49][50] Byrne has said the apology and settlement "represents a great step forward in our case",[50] while Copper River's attorney stated that "If somehow this improved Overstock's case, then Gradient would admit to doing something wrong and they haven’t.", and that he expected the settlement to help Copper River's case.[51]
On December 8, 2009, it was announced that Copper River had reached an out of court settlement with Overstock. As part of the agreement, Copper River, which closed in December 2008, agreed to pay Overstock $5 million.[52] In a letter to his shareholders, Patrick Byrne said, "The good guys won". Copper River said in a statement that it continued to deny Overstock's allegations. Copper River managing general partner Marc Cohodes said "Although settlement deprives us of the ability to disprove Overstock's case and prosecute our counterclaims, we decided that the litigation costs did not justify passing up a practical way to end four-and-half years of meritless litigation by Overstock."[53][54]
In February 2007, Overstock.com launched a $3.5 billion lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and other large Wall Street firms, alleging a "massive illegal stock market manipulation scheme" involving naked short selling. Among its allegations, Overstock stated that since at least January 2005, naked short selling has accounted for large portions of Overstock stock, in some cases exceeding the 23.4 million total shares outstanding.[55] The lawsuit alleged that this had created "immense downward pressure" on share prices over time. Kerry Fields, associate professor of law and business ethics at the University of Southern California, said, "Byrne may be able to help set new law if he handles this right." Fields said, Byrne's "best approach now is probably to persuade the SEC, which continues to wander around the issue, or the government to serve subpoenas and let them decide whether or not his company was wronged."[56] John Coffee, director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia University Law School, described it as overly ambitious and "extremely unpromising."[55] Two members of the Overstock.com board of directors, John Fisher and Ray Groves, resigned in disagreement over the lawsuit.[57][58]
In December 2010, all but two of the prime broker defendants settled out of court with Overstock for $4.4 million.[59] That same month, the company filed a motion seeking to amend its lawsuit against the remaining defendants—Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch—to include claims of RICO violations. The enhanced claims were based on evidence gained through discovery in the case.[60]

Overstock.com, Inc. is an American internet retailer headquartered in Midvale, Utah,[1] near Salt Lake City.[2] Patrick M. Byrne founded the company in 1997 and launched the company in May 1999. Overstock.com initially sold exclusively surplus and returned merchandise on an online e-commerce marketplace, liquidating the inventories of at least 18 failed dot-com companies at below-wholesale prices.[3] The company continues to sell home decor, furniture, bedding, and many other goods that are closeout merchandise,[4] however, it also sells new merchandise.[5]
In May 2002, Overstock held an IPO at a per-share price of $13, and after achieving significant growth and profits in some early quarters, achieved a profit of $7.7 million in 2009[6] and reported its first billion-dollar year in 2010. The business started rebranding in early 2011, as "O.co", to simplify and unify its international operations[7] but interrupted this effort a few months later, citing consumer confusion over the new name.[8]
Byrne took an indefinite leave of absence in April 2016, because of Hepatitis C complications. The general counsel, Mitch Edwards, was named acting CEO.[9] In July 2016, Byrne returned as CEO.

Business model, management and figures[edit]
Part of Overstock.com's merchandise is purchased by or manufactured specifically for the company. Among their products are handmade goods produced for Overstock by workers in developing nations.[10][11] The company also manages the inventory supply for other retailers. In addition to its direct retail sales, Overstock.com began offering online auctions on its website in 2004, known as Overstock.com Marketplace and later O.co Marketplace. This service was retired in July 2011.[12]
After initially relying solely on word-of-mouth marketing from customers,[13] the company turned to distinctive television advertisements starring German actress Sabine Ehrenfeld.[14][15] Later, they would employ other advertising spokespersons.
In July 2006, John J. Byrne, the father of Overstock's chief executive, resigned from the board of directors after a public airing of the elder Byrne's unhappiness with his son's actions against naked short-selling.[16] In August 2008, Jack Byrne said that after "much initial skepticism" he believed his son was "right all along" about the battle and lawsuits with short-sellers and analysts.[17] In 2010 the elder Byrne returned to the Overstock.com board of directors.
In early 2007, John A. Fisher and Ray Groves resigned from the Overstock board of directors over disagreement with the company's prime broker suit.[18][19]
On January 2, 2008,[20] Overstock announced that cofounder Jason Lindsey had resigned as President, COO, and as a Director of Overstock effective from December 31, 2007. Byrne said Lindsey had "played a decisive role getting [Overstock] back on track" after "I screwed it up a couple years ago".[21] Overstock stock dropped to a four-year low following the announcement,[22] which an analyst for investment bank Broadpoint Capital described as a "key loss".[23]
In 2011, revenues dropped 5 percent over a two-month penalty period imposed by Google. According to the Associated Press, Overstock set up fake websites linking back to its own site. Overstock said it was penalized in part for a practice of encouraging college and university websites to post links to Overstock pages so that students and faculty could receive discounts. As a result of the Google penalty, search results for certain products dropped in Google rankings.[24][25] During the same year, Overstock.com acquired naming rights to the former Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, renaming it Overstock.com Coliseum.[26] The Coliseum was later rebranded O.co Coliseum, in keeping with Overstock's then-rebranding as O.co (in April 2016, the name O.co Coliseum was dropped in favor of Oakland-Alameda Coliseum).
In 2013, Overstock began promoting increased immigration. Overstock president Jonathan Johnson told the Los Angeles Times that his firm had struggled to hire enough computer programmers and software developers to expand the business. "We pay more, and they are still hard to fill", he said. "We need to be more free in letting people in. That helps us solve our border problem. No one goes through the window of a house if they can ring the doorbell and come in the front door."[27]
In 2014, Overstock began developing software that would allow it to distribute corporate stock online instead of using traditional methods like the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ.[28]
Overstock.com's Board of Directors on January 9, 2014, was Patrick Byrne, Jonathan E. Johnson III, Allison H. Abraham, Barclay F. Corbus, Samuel A. Mitchell, Stormy D. Simon, Joseph J. Tabacco, Jr. and Dr. Kirthi Kalyanam [29]
Bitcoin[edit]
On January 9, 2014, Overstock.com became the first major retailer to start accepting bitcoin as payments for its goods.[30] On the first day, they made sales worth US$126,000 in bitcoin.[31] This represents a 4.33% increase in sales from their normal income of $3 million per day.[32]
As of March 13, 2014, Overstock bitcoin income had shrunk to under 1% of their normal daily cash intake.[33]
In a community interview with social media site Reddit on May 3, 2014, in response to a question to the Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne about the percentage of revenue and transactions paid for in bitcoin, Byrne responded that the percentage was "Tiny. <.1%".[34] In mid-2014 Overstock.com announced that bitcoin sales were averaging $300,000 per month and that the company expected bitcoin sales to add 4 cents to the company's 2014 earnings per share.[35]
On September 14, 2014, Overstock announced it would begin donating 4% of bitcoin revenue to foundations that were advocating for cryptocurrency.[36]
Naked short selling campaign[edit]
The company has received attention stemming from CEO Patrick Byrne's battle against alleged naked short selling of his company's shares. Beginning in 2005, Byrne has contended that a number of companies, including Overstock.com, have been the targets of this practice, which involves selling a stock short but without the usual step of initially borrowing or locating the shares. Byrne alleges that the practice circumvents safeguards of conventional shorting, and has been used in large schemes devised to profit from driving down the prices of companies' shares, in many cases leading to these companies' failure. With Overstock, Byrne contends that the company's longstanding appearance on the Regulation SHO Threshold Security list, an SEC-mandated list showing companies with a high number of "fails to deliver", along with high trading volumes that sometimes surpass total quantity of the company's stock, establish that it has been targeted by this practice.[37] Byrne's campaign has been controversial, including criticism in the financial press that Byrne is seeking to divert attention from Overstock's share price declines and failure to turn a profit.[38] New York Times columnist Joseph Nocera has said in 2006 that, "Except for a few fellow-traveling Web sites, where Mr. Byrne is viewed as a heroic figure, most people who understand the issue or have looked into it think it's pretty bogus."[39] Others have suggested that the problem is real, but that the SEC acts to prevent it and that it does not happen on any scale such as Byrne suggests. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox called abusive naked short selling "a fraud that the commission is bound to prevent and to punish."[40]
Overstock filed a lawsuit against the hedge fund Rocker Partners in 2005, for libel, unfair business practices and tortious interference, saying it colluded with a research firm, Gradient Analytics, in short-selling the company while paying Gradient Analytics to publish negative reports about Overstock.com and supplying pre-publication copies to Rocker. Naked short-selling was not alleged in that suit.[41] In a conference call with analysts in August 2005, a day after the suit was filed, Byrne said that "there's been a plan since we were in our teens to destroy our stock, drive it down to $6--$10 ... and even a plan for how the company would then get whacked up." He said that the conspirators were part of a "Miscreants Ball", headed by a "Sith Lord", who he refused to identify but said "he's one of the master criminals from the 1980s." Byrne said the conspiracy included hedge funds, journalists, investigators, trial lawyers, the SEC, and Eliot Spitzer."[42] Gradient countersued, alleging Byrne waged a smear campaign.[43]
Rocker Partners, renamed Copper River Management, filed a counterclaim against Overstock in November 2007, alleging overstatement of profits, false projections, and misrepresentations about the company's ventures.[44] Copper River also alleges that Byrne tried to silence critics by suing them.[45][46][47][48] A portion of this suit was settled out of court on October 13, 2008, when Overstock.com and Gradient dropped the claims against each other after Gradient retracted allegations that Overstock's reporting methods did not comply with rules established by the FASB, stated they believed Overstock.com complied with GAAP standards, and that three directors were independent according to NASD standards, and apologized.[49][50] Byrne has said the apology and settlement "represents a great step forward in our case",[50] while Copper River's attorney stated that "If somehow this improved Overstock's case, then Gradient would admit to doing something wrong and they haven’t.", and that he expected the settlement to help Copper River's case.[51]
On December 8, 2009, it was announced that Copper River had reached an out of court settlement with Overstock. As part of the agreement, Copper River, which closed in December 2008, agreed to pay Overstock $5 million.[52] In a letter to his shareholders, Patrick Byrne said, "The good guys won". Copper River said in a statement that it continued to deny Overstock's allegations. Copper River managing general partner Marc Cohodes said "Although settlement deprives us of the ability to disprove Overstock's case and prosecute our counterclaims, we decided that the litigation costs did not justify passing up a practical way to end four-and-half years of meritless litigation by Overstock."[53][54]
In February 2007, Overstock.com launched a $3.5 billion lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and other large Wall Street firms, alleging a "massive illegal stock market manipulation scheme" involving naked short selling. Among its allegations, Overstock stated that since at least January 2005, naked short selling has accounted for large portions of Overstock stock, in some cases exceeding the 23.4 million total shares outstanding.[55] The lawsuit alleged that this had created "immense downward pressure" on share prices over time. Kerry Fields, associate professor of law and business ethics at the University of Southern California, said, "Byrne may be able to help set new law if he handles this right." Fields said, Byrne's "best approach now is probably to persuade the SEC, which continues to wander around the issue, or the government to serve subpoenas and let them decide whether or not his company was wronged."[56] John Coffee, director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia University Law School, described it as overly ambitious and "extremely unpromising."[55] Two members of the Overstock.com board of directors, John Fisher and Ray Groves, resigned in disagreement over the lawsuit.[57][58]
In December 2010, all but two of the prime broker defendants settled out of court with Overstock for $4.4 million.[59] That same month, the company filed a motion seeking to amend its lawsuit against the remaining defendants—Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch—to include claims of RICO violations. The enhanced claims were based on evidence gained through discovery in the case.[60]

Overstock Coupon Code: 10% Off Your Entire Order | GrouponSearch GrouponZip Code, Neighborhood, City SearchShop overstock.com 45Coupons AvailableFilter byAll Coupons (45)Promo Codes (6)Sales (39)In-Store Offers (0)Coupon AlertsNever miss a great Overstock coupon and get our best coupons every week! About OverstockEach Overstock coupon from Groupon Freebies disproves the notion that you can have too much of a good thing. That’s because Overstock.com uses the laws of supply and demand to turn surpluses of merchandise into savings for customers. When other companies make too much of a product or go out of business, Overstock.com scoops up their goods at a discount and passes them on to shoppers. Not every product on Overstock.com is surplus, however. The company also commissions designers to craft new products, which range from home furnishings to jewelry and clothing. Groupon is sweetening the already great deal with added savings, just grab an Overstock coupon code below.Overstock.com started out as a sort of antimall. Lamenting the remote locations and claustrophobic crowds of traditional outlet malls, founder Patrick Byrne had an idea: move closeout and excess merchandise to the Internet. Now, instead of devoting a whole day to driving and squinting at price tags, customers log on for discounted furniture, bedding, electronics, clothes, and jewelry. Shop the housewares categories for items that range from lighting fixtures to decorative sculptures and hand-painted artwork.Overstock.com made its name by connecting shoppers with surplus merchandise from around the world. In recent years, however, the company has expanded its business model to cater to a wider audience, including socially conscious shoppers. Shop the Worldstock line for handmade clothing, Boho-chic jewelry, natural beauty products, and other items crafted by artisans from across the globe. Those artisans are paid fair-trade prices, and carbon-neutral shipping ensures that orders arrive via eco-friendly transport. For savings on these products and more, grab an Overstock coupon before you check out.Are you ready to get your hands on jewelry, clothing, kitchenware, or perhaps a piece of furniture to add to your living-room fort? Grab an Overstock promo code for savings on these products and more.Read moreShare these coupons    Related StoresAmazon Neiman Marcus Nordstrom Kohl's Macy's Saks OFF 5TH Sears Walmart Target Saks Fifth Avenue JCPenney Nordstrom Rack Bloomingdale's QVC Sam's Club Kmart BJ's Wholesale Club Hayneedle Woot Belk Boscov'sTmart LightInTheBox Stein Mart Groupon Goods Big Lots Bealls Florida HSN SmartBargains Boston Store Bon-Ton Department Stores SHOP.CA Carson's Bobs Stores Herberger's WalMart Canada Younkers Marks and Spencer US Pulse TV - Show less+ Show moreFeatured StoresAmerican Eagle Aeropostale Walgreens PetSmart Forever 21 Finish Line eBay Payless Shoes Victoria's Secret 6pm.com Best Buy CheapOair.com AT&T Wireless Priceline GoDaddy.com FTD American Apparel Gap Ann Taylor Namecheap Staples Merrell Restaurant.com AbtCheryl's Biltmore Puritans Pride Home Decorators Collection Backcountry.com Swarovski Lands' End Lane Bryant Footaction Disney Store BH Cosmetics Bellacor Acronis Bodybuilding.com drugstore.com NJOY Adorama Hawaiian Airlines - Show less+ Show moreOverstock Promo Codes & Coupon Codes10%offSale 263 used today10% Off Your Entire OrderOnly through this link.

Overstock.com, Inc. is an American internet retailer headquartered in Midvale, Utah,[1] near Salt Lake City.[2] Patrick M. Byrne founded the company in 1997 and launched the company in May 1999. Overstock.com initially sold exclusively surplus and returned merchandise on an online e-commerce marketplace, liquidating the inventories of at least 18 failed dot-com companies at below-wholesale prices.[3] The company continues to sell home decor, furniture, bedding, and many other goods that are closeout merchandise,[4] however, it also sells new merchandise.[5]
In May 2002, Overstock held an IPO at a per-share price of $13, and after achieving significant growth and profits in some early quarters, achieved a profit of $7.7 million in 2009[6] and reported its first billion-dollar year in 2010. The business started rebranding in early 2011, as "O.co", to simplify and unify its international operations[7] but interrupted this effort a few months later, citing consumer confusion over the new name.[8]
Byrne took an indefinite leave of absence in April 2016, because of Hepatitis C complications. The general counsel, Mitch Edwards, was named acting CEO.[9] In July 2016, Byrne returned as CEO.

Business model, management and figures[edit]
Part of Overstock.com's merchandise is purchased by or manufactured specifically for the company. Among their products are handmade goods produced for Overstock by workers in developing nations.[10][11] The company also manages the inventory supply for other retailers. In addition to its direct retail sales, Overstock.com began offering online auctions on its website in 2004, known as Overstock.com Marketplace and later O.co Marketplace. This service was retired in July 2011.[12]
After initially relying solely on word-of-mouth marketing from customers,[13] the company turned to distinctive television advertisements starring German actress Sabine Ehrenfeld.[14][15] Later, they would employ other advertising spokespersons.
In July 2006, John J. Byrne, the father of Overstock's chief executive, resigned from the board of directors after a public airing of the elder Byrne's unhappiness with his son's actions against naked short-selling.[16] In August 2008, Jack Byrne said that after "much initial skepticism" he believed his son was "right all along" about the battle and lawsuits with short-sellers and analysts.[17] In 2010 the elder Byrne returned to the Overstock.com board of directors.
In early 2007, John A. Fisher and Ray Groves resigned from the Overstock board of directors over disagreement with the company's prime broker suit.[18][19]
On January 2, 2008,[20] Overstock announced that cofounder Jason Lindsey had resigned as President, COO, and as a Director of Overstock effective from December 31, 2007. Byrne said Lindsey had "played a decisive role getting [Overstock] back on track" after "I screwed it up a couple years ago".[21] Overstock stock dropped to a four-year low following the announcement,[22] which an analyst for investment bank Broadpoint Capital described as a "key loss".[23]
In 2011, revenues dropped 5 percent over a two-month penalty period imposed by Google. According to the Associated Press, Overstock set up fake websites linking back to its own site. Overstock said it was penalized in part for a practice of encouraging college and university websites to post links to Overstock pages so that students and faculty could receive discounts. As a result of the Google penalty, search results for certain products dropped in Google rankings.[24][25] During the same year, Overstock.com acquired naming rights to the former Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, renaming it Overstock.com Coliseum.[26] The Coliseum was later rebranded O.co Coliseum, in keeping with Overstock's then-rebranding as O.co (in April 2016, the name O.co Coliseum was dropped in favor of Oakland-Alameda Coliseum).
In 2013, Overstock began promoting increased immigration. Overstock president Jonathan Johnson told the Los Angeles Times that his firm had struggled to hire enough computer programmers and software developers to expand the business. "We pay more, and they are still hard to fill", he said. "We need to be more free in letting people in. That helps us solve our border problem. No one goes through the window of a house if they can ring the doorbell and come in the front door."[27]
In 2014, Overstock began developing software that would allow it to distribute corporate stock online instead of using traditional methods like the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ.[28]
Overstock.com's Board of Directors on January 9, 2014, was Patrick Byrne, Jonathan E. Johnson III, Allison H. Abraham, Barclay F. Corbus, Samuel A. Mitchell, Stormy D. Simon, Joseph J. Tabacco, Jr. and Dr. Kirthi Kalyanam [29]
Bitcoin[edit]
On January 9, 2014, Overstock.com became the first major retailer to start accepting bitcoin as payments for its goods.[30] On the first day, they made sales worth US$126,000 in bitcoin.[31] This represents a 4.33% increase in sales from their normal income of $3 million per day.[32]
As of March 13, 2014, Overstock bitcoin income had shrunk to under 1% of their normal daily cash intake.[33]
In a community interview with social media site Reddit on May 3, 2014, in response to a question to the Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne about the percentage of revenue and transactions paid for in bitcoin, Byrne responded that the percentage was "Tiny. <.1%".[34] In mid-2014 Overstock.com announced that bitcoin sales were averaging $300,000 per month and that the company expected bitcoin sales to add 4 cents to the company's 2014 earnings per share.[35]
On September 14, 2014, Overstock announced it would begin donating 4% of bitcoin revenue to foundations that were advocating for cryptocurrency.[36]
Naked short selling campaign[edit]
The company has received attention stemming from CEO Patrick Byrne's battle against alleged naked short selling of his company's shares. Beginning in 2005, Byrne has contended that a number of companies, including Overstock.com, have been the targets of this practice, which involves selling a stock short but without the usual step of initially borrowing or locating the shares. Byrne alleges that the practice circumvents safeguards of conventional shorting, and has been used in large schemes devised to profit from driving down the prices of companies' shares, in many cases leading to these companies' failure. With Overstock, Byrne contends that the company's longstanding appearance on the Regulation SHO Threshold Security list, an SEC-mandated list showing companies with a high number of "fails to deliver", along with high trading volumes that sometimes surpass total quantity of the company's stock, establish that it has been targeted by this practice.[37] Byrne's campaign has been controversial, including criticism in the financial press that Byrne is seeking to divert attention from Overstock's share price declines and failure to turn a profit.[38] New York Times columnist Joseph Nocera has said in 2006 that, "Except for a few fellow-traveling Web sites, where Mr. Byrne is viewed as a heroic figure, most people who understand the issue or have looked into it think it's pretty bogus."[39] Others have suggested that the problem is real, but that the SEC acts to prevent it and that it does not happen on any scale such as Byrne suggests. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox called abusive naked short selling "a fraud that the commission is bound to prevent and to punish."[40]
Overstock filed a lawsuit against the hedge fund Rocker Partners in 2005, for libel, unfair business practices and tortious interference, saying it colluded with a research firm, Gradient Analytics, in short-selling the company while paying Gradient Analytics to publish negative reports about Overstock.com and supplying pre-publication copies to Rocker. Naked short-selling was not alleged in that suit.[41] In a conference call with analysts in August 2005, a day after the suit was filed, Byrne said that "there's been a plan since we were in our teens to destroy our stock, drive it down to $6--$10 ... and even a plan for how the company would then get whacked up." He said that the conspirators were part of a "Miscreants Ball", headed by a "Sith Lord", who he refused to identify but said "he's one of the master criminals from the 1980s." Byrne said the conspiracy included hedge funds, journalists, investigators, trial lawyers, the SEC, and Eliot Spitzer."[42] Gradient countersued, alleging Byrne waged a smear campaign.[43]
Rocker Partners, renamed Copper River Management, filed a counterclaim against Overstock in November 2007, alleging overstatement of profits, false projections, and misrepresentations about the company's ventures.[44] Copper River also alleges that Byrne tried to silence critics by suing them.[45][46][47][48] A portion of this suit was settled out of court on October 13, 2008, when Overstock.com and Gradient dropped the claims against each other after Gradient retracted allegations that Overstock's reporting methods did not comply with rules established by the FASB, stated they believed Overstock.com complied with GAAP standards, and that three directors were independent according to NASD standards, and apologized.[49][50] Byrne has said the apology and settlement "represents a great step forward in our case",[50] while Copper River's attorney stated that "If somehow this improved Overstock's case, then Gradient would admit to doing something wrong and they haven’t.", and that he expected the settlement to help Copper River's case.[51]
On December 8, 2009, it was announced that Copper River had reached an out of court settlement with Overstock. As part of the agreement, Copper River, which closed in December 2008, agreed to pay Overstock $5 million.[52] In a letter to his shareholders, Patrick Byrne said, "The good guys won". Copper River said in a statement that it continued to deny Overstock's allegations. Copper River managing general partner Marc Cohodes said "Although settlement deprives us of the ability to disprove Overstock's case and prosecute our counterclaims, we decided that the litigation costs did not justify passing up a practical way to end four-and-half years of meritless litigation by Overstock."[53][54]
In February 2007, Overstock.com launched a $3.5 billion lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and other large Wall Street firms, alleging a "massive illegal stock market manipulation scheme" involving naked short selling. Among its allegations, Overstock stated that since at least January 2005, naked short selling has accounted for large portions of Overstock stock, in some cases exceeding the 23.4 million total shares outstanding.[55] The lawsuit alleged that this had created "immense downward pressure" on share prices over time. Kerry Fields, associate professor of law and business ethics at the University of Southern California, said, "Byrne may be able to help set new law if he handles this right." Fields said, Byrne's "best approach now is probably to persuade the SEC, which continues to wander around the issue, or the government to serve subpoenas and let them decide whether or not his company was wronged."[56] John Coffee, director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia University Law School, described it as overly ambitious and "extremely unpromising."[55] Two members of the Overstock.com board of directors, John Fisher and Ray Groves, resigned in disagreement over the lawsuit.[57][58]
In December 2010, all but two of the prime broker defendants settled out of court with Overstock for $4.4 million.[59] That same month, the company filed a motion seeking to amend its lawsuit against the remaining defendants—Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch—to include claims of RICO violations. The enhanced claims were based on evidence gained through discovery in the case.[60]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
