Veteran Dental Executive Harold C. Flynn Jr. to Become President and CEO of BIOLASE


 BIOLASE, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIOL), the global leader in dental lasers, today 
 announced that veteran dental industry executive Harold C. Flynn Jr. 
 will become President and Chief Executive Officer, effective July 13, 
 2015. The current President and CEO Jeffrey M. Nugent will step down at 
 that time.
 

 Flynn, 50, has more than 25 years of senior executive experience in the 
 dental, hematology and diagnostics markets. Since 2007, he has been 
 President of Zimmer Dental, a leading manufacturer and provider of 
 medical devices for the dental market including dental implants, 
 prosthetics, and a range of other oral rehabilitation products. Zimmer 
 Dental is a division of Zimmer Holdings Inc. (NYSE and SIX: ZMH).
 

 "Harold's dental industry and medical device experience make him a 
 natural fit to lead BIOLASE," said Chairman Paul N. Clark. "He is a 
 strategic thinker who has successfully managed global functions at 
 Zimmer, much like he will do at BIOLASE. Harold has demonstrated an 
 ability to build successful management teams, drive growth, and spur 
 innovation at a number of companies, large and small. We are confident 
 he is the right choice to continue the transformation of BIOLASE and we 
 look forward to him joining the team."
 

 Clark added, "Jeff agreed as a Board member last summer to step in to 
 help us, and I would like to thank him for the leadership and commitment 
 he has shown in beginning the transformation of BIOLASE. He strengthened 
 our leadership team and improved quality. We are grateful for his 
 continued support and work with BIOLASE through the transition."
 

 Prior to Zimmer, from 2004-2007, Flynn was Divisional Vice President and 
 General Manager at Abbott Hematology, a division of Abbott Laboratories, 
 where he provided strategic leadership, strengthened the product 
 pipeline, and rebuilt the leadership team.
 

 Previously, Flynn spent 14 years in a variety of positions of increasing 
 responsibility at IDEXX Laboratories, a global leader in veterinary, 
 food and environmental diagnostics.
 

 "This is a very important and exciting time of transformation at 
 BIOLASE. I look forward to helping BIOLASE achieve its considerable 
 potential," Flynn said. "With a demonstrated legacy of market-leading 
 innovation providing patient-centric solutions and new laser-based 
 treatment modalities, BIOLASE is well positioned to significantly expand 
 its penetration and share in the markets it serves."
 

 Flynn has a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from 
 the University of Maine at Orono. He holds patents in hematology and 
 implantable devices for dentistry. He lives with his family in 
 Encinitas, CA.
