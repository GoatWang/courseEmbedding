6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

30-DAY SEC YIELD

The 30-Day SEC Yield is computed in accordance with a standardized method prescribed by rules of the SEC. The 30-day SEC Yield is computed by dividing the fund's investment income per share earned during a particular 30-day base period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the base period, and then annualizing the result. The 30-day SEC Yield is calculated at each month end and updated within the first ten business days of the following month. These yields reflect the reimbursements or waivers of certain expense. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed, the yields would have been lower. 

12-MONTH DISTRIBUTION YIELD

The 12-Month distribution yield is calculated by taking the sum of all distributions occurring over the previous twelve calendar months and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The distribution yield represents a 12-month historical distribution and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. For Funds that have been in operation for less than one year, an annualized distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the Fund's historical distributions to date and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The annualized distribution yield represents an estimated 12-month distribution from the Fund based on the limited distribution history of the Fund to date and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

FUND PERFORMANCE

*Expense ratios are as-of the most recent prospectus. Contractual arrangements have been made with the fund’s investment manager, Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. (“TAM”), through March 1, 2017.

**Reflects average annual returns. Returns for funds that are less than one year old are not annualized.
The performance data presented here represents past performance; Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance may not be available for all periods indicated. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but do not reflect any sales charges. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. Public Offering Price (POP) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, and reflect the maximum sales charge.Maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 5.50%.Purchases of Class C Shares are subject to a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge if redeemed during the first 12 months of purchase.
There are no sales charges on Class I. Class I shares are currently primarily offered for investment to institutional investors including, but not limited to, fee-based programs, pension plans, and certain endowment plans and foundations.Advisor Class shares are intended for purchase through self-directed accounts on transaction-based platforms that may or may not charge a transaction fee, broker-dealer sponsored fee-based wrap programs, fee-based advisory platforms and bank/trust products where fees are being charged.

Performance figures reflect any fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the Investment Manager. Without such waivers and/or reimbursements, the performance would be lower. Future waivers and/or reimbursements are at the discretion of the Investment Manager.

1 Year returns reflect total return. 

RISK MEASURES

Risk measures are in comparison to a blended benchmark made up of 50% Alerian MLP Total Return Index and 50% Bloomberg Barclays Investment-Grade Credit Index. Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement that helps to gauge the fund's historical volatility. Historical Beta illustrates a fund's sensitivity to price movements in relation to a benchmark index. Alpha is a coefficient measuring the portion of a fund's return arising from specific (non-market) risk. Tracking Error is the difference between the price behavior of a fund and the price behavior of a benchmark. R-Squared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund's movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated by using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Information Ratio is a ratio of portfolio returns above those of a benchmark compared to the volatility of those returns.U.S. allocations may include U.S. territories and possessions.The Net Other Assets (Liabilities) category may include, but is not limited to, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending collateral, forward foreign currency contracts, and cash collateral. 



The S&P 500® and Transamerica MLP & Energy Income Blended Benchmark (50% Alerian MLP Total Return Index and 50% Bloomberg Barclays Investment-Grade Credit Index) are unmanaged indices used as general measures of market performance. It is not possible to invest directly into an index. Calculations assume dividends and capital gains are reinvested and do not include any managerial expenses.Investing in MLPs involve risks related to limited control, cash flow changes, dilution risks and risk linked to the general partner’s right to require unit holders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price. The energy industries can be significantly affected by fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of energy fuels, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, and tax and other government regulations.The fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. As the fund is registered as a Regulated Investment Company, the fund does not pay taxes. Changes to government regulations may impact future returns.The fund is classified as “non-diversified”, which means it may invest a larger percentage of its assets in a smaller number of issuers or sectors than a diversified fund. To the extent the fund invests its assets in fewer issuers, the fund will be more susceptible to negative events affecting those issuers.Shares may be sold (or “redeemed”) on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Proceeds from the redemption of shares will usually be sent to the redeeming shareholder within three business days after receipt in good order of a request for redemption. However, Transamerica Funds has the right to take up to seven days to pay redemption proceeds, and may postpone payment under certain circumstances, as authorized by law.Due to rounding, not all of the percentages will equal 100%.Mutual funds are subject to market risk, including the loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results.Shares of the funds may only be sold by offering the funds’ prospectus. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and additional important information regarding the fund. To obtain the prospectus and/or summary prospectus, please contact your financial professional or click here. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.Transamerica Funds are advised by Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. and distributed by Transamerica Capital, Inc.Not insured by FDIC or any federal government agency. May lose value. Not a deposit of or guaranteed by any bank, bank affiliate, or credit union.

Master Limited Partnership - MLP









Share










































Loading the player...
















 

What is a 'Master Limited Partnership - MLP'
A master limited partnership (MLP) is a type of business venture that exists in the form of a publicly traded limited partnership. As such, it combines the tax benefits of a partnership – profits are taxed only when investors actually receive distributions – with the liquidity of a public company.
MLPs have two classes of partners:
Limited partners: investors who purchase shares in the MLP that provide the capital for the entity's operations. They receive periodic distributions from the MLP, typically on a quarterly basis.
General partners: are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the MLP. They receive compensation based on the partnership's business performance.


BREAKING DOWN 'Master Limited Partnership - MLP'
An MLP is a partnership that is traded on a national exchange, which offers significant tax advantages to both the general and limited partners. MLPs are situated to take advantage of cash flow, as they are required to distribute all available cash to investors. MLPs can help reduce the cost of capital in capital-intensive businesses, such as the energy sector.
And in fact, by law most MLPs currently operate in the energy industry, providing and managing resources: One example is Genesis Energy L.P., which provides pipeline transportation, refinery services, and supply and logistics support services for oil companies.
Many oil and gas companies issue MLPs instead of corporate stock. With this structure, corporations or individuals can own a stake. A company is likely to own interest in its own MLP. Subsequently, separate stock-issuing corporations are also set up, with the sole business being to own shares (officially, units) of the company MLP, redistributing the passive income through the corporation as a regular dividend.
A good example of this structure is Linn Energy, which has both an MLP (LINE) and a corporation that owns an interest in the MLP (LNCO). Investors then have the option to choose, for tax purposes, how they would like to receive the income the company generates.
History of Master Limited Partnerships
The first MLP was organized in 1981.
In 1987, Congress effectively limited the use of MLPs to real estate and energy companies. These limitations were put into place as a result of the perceived loss of corporate tax, since MLPs do not pay federal taxes. To qualify for the pass-through status, at least 90% of the MLP's income must be qualifying income, which is generally defined as income realized from the exploration, production or transportation of natural resources or real estate. In other words, to qualify as an master limited partnership, a company must have all but 10% of its revenues be from commodities, natural resources or real estate activities. This definition of "qualifying income" reduces the sectors in which MLPs can operate.
Characteristics of an MLP
The MLP is a unique hybrid legal structure that combines elements of a partnership with elements of a corporation. First of all, it is considered the aggregate of its partners rather than a separate legal entity (as a corporation would be). Second, it technically has no employees; the general partners are responsible for providing all necessary operational services. GPs hold a 2% stake (usually) in the venture, and have the option to increase their ownership.
Like a partnership, an MLP issues units instead of shares. However, these units are often traded on national stock exchanges, offering significant liquidity – a liquidity that traditional partnerships do not offer. Those who buy into an MLP are called limited partners; they are allocated a share of the MLP's income, deductions, losses and credits. These are in the form of publicly traded units, not shares of stock, and so investors are commonly referred to as unitholders, rather than shareholders.
Tax Advantages of MLPs
A MLP is treated as a limited partnership for tax purposes.  A limited partnership has a pass-through, or flow-through, tax structure, meaning that all profits and losses are passed through to the limited partners. In other words, the MLP itself is not liable for corporate taxes on its revenues, as most incorporated businesses are; instead, its owners/unitholders/investors are only personally liable for income taxes on their portions of the MLP's earnings. This offers a significant tax advantage; profits are not subject to the double taxation scenario in which corporations pay corporate income taxes, and then shareholders must also pay personal taxes on the income from their stocks. Further, deductions such as depreciation and depletion are also passed on to the limited partners. Limited partners can use these deductions to reduce their taxable income.
Quarterly distributions from the MLP are not unlike quarterly stock dividends. But they are treated as a return of capital, as opposed to income, and so the unitholder doesn't pay income tax on them. Most of the earnings are tax-deferred until the units are actually sold; and then, they're taxed at the lower capital gains rate rather than at the higher personal income rate. This offers significant additional tax benefits.
More MLP Plusses
MLPs are known for offering slow investment opportunities (though they've been subjected to a bit more volatility lately), which stems from the fact that they’re often in slow-growing industries, like pipeline construction. This means low risk. Because they earn a stable income that is often based on long-term service contracts, MLPs  are conducive to offering steady cash flows, which lead to consistent cash distributions. Those cash distributions usually grow slightly faster than inflation, and for limited partners, 80%-90% of them are often tax-deferred. Overall, this enables MLPs to offer attractive income yields (commonly substantially higher than the average dividend yield of equities). And the flow-through entity status, by avoiding double taxation, leads to more capital being available for future projects, which then makes the MLP firm more competitive in its industry. 
For the limited partner, cumulative cash distributions usually exceed the capital gains taxes required to be paid once all units are sold.
There are benefits for using MLPs for estate planning, too. If a unitholder gifts or transfers the MLP unit to beneficiaries, both will avoid paying taxes during the time of transfer; the cost basis will be readjusted based on the market price during the time of the transfer. If the unitholder dies and the units pass to heirs, their fair market value is determined to be the value as of the date of death, and the prior distributions are not taxed.
MLP Downsides
Perhaps the biggest disadvantage to being a limited partner in an MLP is that you will have to file the infamous Schedule K-1 form. This is a much more complicated animal than a 1099-DIV, which means you will have to pay your accountant more on an annual basis, even if you didn’t sell any units (for cash distributions). And K-1 forms are notorious for arriving late, to the despair of many a tax preparer. An added problem: Some MLPs operate in more than one state, which means you might have to file in several states, which will increase your costs.
Another tax-related negative is that you can’t use a net loss to offset other income. Any net losses must be carried forward to the following year. When you eventually sell all your units, a net loss can then be used as a deduction against other income.
A final negative is limited upside potential (historically), but this is to be expected from an investment that’s going to produce a gradual but reliable income stream.

Recent events at Boardwalk Pipeline Partners offers a cautionary tale for investors seeking higher-yielding investment opportunities in today’s low-rate environment. There’s no doubt that master-limited partnerships (MLPs), like Boardwalk Pipeline Partners

                                         have tempted many retirees and other investors who depend on their investment portfolio for income. This extended period of rock-bottom interest rates orchestrated by the Federal Reserve to support the post-bubble economic recovery is a real nail biter for income investors who based their financial planning on a normal interest-rate environment. With MLPs typically trading at higher yields averaging between 5% and 6%, they offer such investors the promise of relief, and they sound like a solid investment at a time when the U.S. is experiencing a domestic energy renaissance thanks to new shale-drilling technologies and the resulting natural-gas boom. But events at Boardwalk Pipeline Partners highlight the underlying risks and complexities in these investments, raising the question of whether these higher yields are really worth it.







Shares of Boardwalk lost nearly half their value in one trading session back in February after the company, which is based in Houston and operates 14,450 miles of natural-gas pipelines and underground storage caverns, cut its cash payouts to unit holders by 80%. The company said its cash flows were under pressure due to a variety of macro factors. It now sports a dividend yield of 2.8% — little more than a 10-year Treasury. So, investors who were lured into the company by the promise of an attractive yield are now wishing they had settled for that plain-vanilla corporate bond. Investors should first understand that MLPs aren’t corporations. They’re publicly traded partnerships that pass along most of their income to investors and enjoy a tax-exempt status granted by Congress, but limited only to companies operating cash-generating energy-infrastructure assets, like oil and gas pipelines and storage tanks. Last year, there was a record-breaking 21 initial public offerings of MLPs, and according to Morningstar, nearly $12 billion flowed into funds investing in MLPs — an all-time high.

In other words, MLPs are a hot product these days. The financial industry always seems to come up with that mousetrap that too perfectly addresses the needs of the average investor in whatever investment climate comes along, and inevitably, things get out of control. In this case, investors are starved for higher-yielding investment options, and there’s little to no interest-rate relief in sight for these people. Meanwhile, a recent report by Bloomberg News showed that Wall Street loves peddling MLPs, with all but five of 114 MLPs recommended by a majority of the research analysts offering coverage.  It’s never a good sign when such rosy sentiments become so widespread on Wall Street, but it all starts to make sense when you consider that MLPs have to borrow money and sell shares to grow, so they’re a boon to the banks and brokerages that employ most of the analysts recommending them. According to Bloomberg, bank fees for MLP deals last year totaled $890.3 million, led by Barclays Plc

For the sake of all those yield-seeking retirees who have bought into these things, I hope this performance continues. Some MLPs are no doubt solid businesses that will continue to be good investments for their partners, but I suspect that many investors are buying these products without a full understanding of their risks, and the recent gold rush in this sector may end badly for many. For example, due to their structure, MLPs often pay out a higher dividend than they actually earn by issuing more stock and debt, which can lead to disaster. Sure enough, the number of MLPs with a distribution-coverage ratio below 1 — which suggests they’re distributing more cash to unit holders than they’re taking in — is growing, and this well-established trend is a major red flag. MLPs that currently have distribution-coverage ratios below 1 include Linn Energy

                                         according to MLPData.com. Another aspect to consider is the fact that there’s a lack of standard accounting rules for MLPs when it comes to reporting important financial metrics, which has been the source of a heated controversy at Kinder Morgan Energy Partners

                                         one of the largest MLPs. As a result, MLPs have adopted many different approaches to reporting their maintenance capital expenditures — the cost of maintaining assets they own and operate. This is a key figure for determining MLPs’ distribution-coverage ratios, which helps gauge the size of a company’s financial cushion for maintaining its cash payouts to unit holders. Investors are fooling themselves in assuming that dividend payouts from MLPs are safe and sustainable, and Boardwalk is a case in point. Demand for the company’s pipelines shifted upon renewal of their contracts, and their revenue and earnings plummeted, illustrating the real business risks facing these assets. It is an example that show that investors need to fully understand a space before investing in it, or they may find themselves facing unwanted surprises.

Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Assets of $20,000 to $49,999 in cash and/or securities receive $100; for $50,000-$99,999 receive $150; for $100,000-$199,999 receive $250; for $200,000 or more receive $600. You must have the qualifying balance 90 days after funding.
Your one-time cash reward will be deposited into your IRA or CMA within two weeks after you meet qualifying criteria.

If your new account is a Merrill Edge self-directed IRA or CMA account, you also qualify for the following benefits:

Commission-free trades begin within 5 business days of account opening and must be used within 90 calendar days; up to 300 trades per account. Commission-free trades are only applicable in the new self directed account and are limited to online equity and ETF trades. Brokerage fees associated with, but not limited to, margin transactions, option trading, special stock registration/gifting, account transfer and processing, research request and termination apply. Trades are not transferable and are not available for Merrill Edge Advisory Center accounts or other Merrill Lynch Wealth Management accounts. Merrill Edge does not, and this offer is not meant to, promote day trading or solicit engagement in day trading activities. Day trading can be extremely risky. Investors are solely responsible for their own investment decisions, and should research any investment strategy carefully before investing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
