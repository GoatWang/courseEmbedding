 - posted on 6/14/2016 11:12:38 AM
I purchased a black leather with gold medal accented handles & detachable straps Sorrentino purse on 02/23/16 from a local shop The Gift Gallery in Webster MA for $40. I bought the purse because I love the shape of the handles & its styling. I was replacing a leather purse that I had for several years. Only 3 1/2 months later, one of the medal handles broke! I called Gift Gallery for a replacement or vendor info and they would not offer any help.  I love the look of the purse (minus the broken handle) but I'm very disappointing that it broke after such a short time.  I would like to receive some customer service satisfaction & be contacted with a resolution.  Thank you

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
