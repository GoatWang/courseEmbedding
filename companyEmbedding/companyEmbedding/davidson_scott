Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the RAIT Financial Trust Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Andres Viroslav. You may begin.
Andres Viroslav
Thank you, Lian, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review RAIT Financial Trust first quarter 2017 financial results. On the call with me today are Scott Davidson, RAIT’s Chief Executive Officer; Paul Kopsky, RAIT’s Chief Financial Officer; and Glenn Riis, RAIT’s Chief Risk Officer.
This morning’s call is being webcast on our website at www.rait.com. There will be a replay of the call available via webcast on our website and telephonically beginning at approximately 12:00 PM Eastern Time today. The dial-in for the replay is 855-859-2056 with a confirmation code of 6293691.
Before I turn the call over to Scott, I would like to remind everyone that there may be forward-looking statements made in this call that involve risk and uncertainty. These forward-looking statements reflect RAIT’s current views with respect to future events and financial and operational performance. Actual results could differ substantially and materially from what RAIT has projected. Such statements are made in good faith pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please refer to the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in RAIT’s earnings release issued earlier today and RAIT’s other filings with the SEC for factors that could affect the accuracy of our expectations or cause our future results to differ materially from those expectations.
Participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures in this call. A copy of RAIT’s earnings release issued earlier today containing financial information, other statistical information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is attached to RAIT’s most recent current report on Form 8-K available at RAIT’s website, www.rait.com, under Investor Relations. RAIT’s other SEC filings are also available through this link. RAIT does not undertake to update forward-looking statements in this call or with respect to matters described herein, except as may be required by law.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to RAIT’s Chief Executive Officer, Scott Davidson. Scott?
Scott Davidson
Thanks, Andreas. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As we previously have communicated in detail in the investor presentation available on the RAIT website, we’re in the midst of transitioning rate to a streamlined business model that’s focused on our core commercial real estate lending business. We began implementing the strategy in 2016 and will continue to pursue through 2017 as we transform rate into a pure play commercial real estate lender.
Our transformational strategy remains focused on divesting our legacy REO portfolio and ultimately minimizing our REO holdings, opportunistically divesting our property management operations, optimizing our capital structure and reducing our outstanding indebtedness, reducing our total expense base and most importantly reallocating capital into and growing our core middle-market CRE lending activities.

Once the transformation is complete, we’re confident we will be better positioned to grow shareholder value. We’re looking forward to delivering stable and repeatable returns with a significantly lower expense base that matches our lending focused strategy to an appropriate capital structure with lower levels of debt.
During the first quarter, we continue to make significant progress executing on our transformative business strategy.
First, we closed $120 million worth of senior floating-rate loans during the quarter. Our lending pipeline continues to be strong and we’re seeing consistent quality in our originations on our first lien middle market focused loan product. We are in the process of aggregating loans for our seventh RAIT sponsored floating-rate securitization.
Second, our non-lending asset dispositions remain on track. During the quarter, we sold six properties for $95 million and divested out of five industrial properties part of a 10 property industrial portfolio, which Paul will discuss shortly. Discussions around the disposition of our commercial real estate focused property manager Urban Retail continue in our ongoing.
Third, as the balance sheet transitioning contracts during 2017, our overall debt levels are also decreasing. During the quarter, RAIT’s total indebtedness based on principal amount declined by a $133.6 million to $1.6 billion. And since January 1st of 2016, our total indebtedness have declined by about $798 million.
As of this call, total recourse debt, excluding our secured credit facilities declined by $42 million since the beginning of the year. And since January 1st of 2016, our total recourse debt declined by about $99 million. We currently have no recourse debt maturities due in 2017 other than our secured warehouse facilities.
And fourth, as we execute on our plan base compensation and G&A expenses continue to trend down. First quarter expenses of $6.2 million were 35% lower than the previous quarter and when annualized represent approximately 22% decrease in compensation G&A from the year ended 2016.
Lastly, as we alluded to on our prior – on our year-end earnings call, the Board declared a $0.09 dividend in our common shares for the first quarter.
Before turning the call over to Paul, I’d like to remind everyone that 2017 is a transitional year for RAIT, and the cumulative near-term effects of our strategy will cause RAIT’s CAD to compress throughout the year. We do expect CAD will rebound in 2018.
At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Paul Kopsky, our Chief Financial Officer to report on our financial results.
Paul Kopsky
Thanks, Scott. RAIT reported a net – a GAAP net loss of $0.33 and CAD of $0.06 per share for the first quarter. As Scott highlighted, we are in the midst of our transformation to a pure play commercial real estate lender. The process of reducing and deleveraging the balance sheet through asset sales, debt paydowns, and loan payoffs continues as we take time this year to unlock capital to reinvest over time.
As a result of this process, CAD was lower this quarter. The result of successfully unlocking capital this quarter, we originated $120 million of new loans, which compares favorably to the $156 million of loan originations for all of 2016. As Scott mentioned, we’re in the working on our seventh floating-rate non-recourse securitization, which we expect to complete in the near future.
Our loan portfolio stands at $1.3 billion as of March 31, demonstrating net loan growth of $23 million from year-end. The loan portfolio did experience levels of loan payoffs consistent with the credit quality we expect to achieve in our floating-rate portfolios, as strong borrowers are taking advantage of the healthy real estate markets to either sell or refinance with longer-term RAIT financing.

Loan repayments were approximately $90 million in Q1 compared to $117 million in the fourth quarter 2016. The combination of loan repayments and an increase in our cost of funds from ongoing deleveraging during the quarter caused our net interest margin or NIM to decline from the previous quarter.
From a credit perspective, all of our post financial crisis originated loans continue to perform as expected. Our nonaccrual loans declined from the year-end to $115 million, down from $121 million, all relating to the same pre-crisis loans. We recorded a provision for loan loss of $1.5 million relating to two legacy loans, the commercial loan portfolio ended the quarter with an allowance for loan loss of $13.5 million.
We continue to make good progress in divesting out the real estate portfolio that we have. During the quarter, the gross portfolio declined by $160 million to $694 million. We generated a GAAP gain relating to the property sales of $8.9 million and also record a $7.4 million impairment. The impairment relates to four properties in the portfolio, which are in varying stages of the selling process. Additionally, the GAAP loss this quarter reflects a $15.9 million, or $0.17 per share non-cash item, which we reflected in as loss on deconsolidation properties in our statement of operations.
As described in our earnings release, the source of this non-cash loss, which is expected to reverse in future periods relates to a legacy portfolio of 10 industrial properties acquired in 2015 through rate exercising its rights in its investment of non-performing mezzanine loan by $11 million. The portfolio was encumbered by a third-party cross-collateralized non-recourse senior debt.
Late in the first quarter, the senior lender began divesting to an auction process of approximately half of the assets generating a non-cash loss to our financials. A gain is expected to be recognized in the future periods, which will offset this loss from the remaining five properties in the portfolio are fully divested.
We continue to actively work on divesting and monetizing remained properties in our real estate portfolio as efficiently and prudently as possible. We’re using the proceeds from our real estate sales to reduce our overall leverage and reinvest in our lending activities. Our overall indebtedness declined by a $133 million in the first quarter and total recourse debt, excluding warehouse lines was reduced by $32 million in the first quarter and an additional $10 million was reduced in April.
Since January 1, 2016, we – as Scott mentioned, we reduced our recourse debt, excluding, excluding warehouse lines by $99 million. We have no more corporate recourse debt maturities remaining in 2017, excluding our warehouse lines and are now focused on our 2018 obligations. Our cash balance remains strong at $96 million at March 31, even after the progress we’ve made to the corporate debt paydowns.
Overall, the transformation is ongoing. We’re well on our way to fully implementing our strategic plan. I look forward as new CFO to completing this process with the team simplifying our financials and continuing to enhance transparency of our new vision for our stakeholders.
That concludes the financial report. Scott, back to you.
Scott Davidson
Thanks, Paul. Operator, at this time I’d like to open up the call for any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jessica Levi-Ribner with FBR. Your line is open.
Tim Hayes
Hey, guys, this is Tim for Jessica. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott Davidson
Hey, Tim.
Tim Hayes
Hey. So, you had mentioned that you expect CAD to rebound in 2018. And as you think about earnings power at that point once you’re largely through these strategic initiatives, do you expect to cover the current dividend on a CAD basis at that point? If so, are you comfortable maintaining that dividend as you under earned over the next few quarters potentially?

Scott Davidson
Sure. Well, as the Board thinks about setting the dividend, the three metrics that it uses are; one, CAD, current CAD; second, asset sales and gains associated with losses, but gains associated with those, as well as if you highlighted the future earnings power of the firm, what we’re looking forward to is selling all of the assets that we have unlocking that capital and setting the dividend based on where we are at that point.
So we know that dividends are important to our shareholders. The Board feels that very strongly. We care about shareholder returns and we look forward to discussing on our next earnings call what our dividend policy and setting is at that point in time.
Tim Hayes
Okay great. And then as it stands today, what is your capacity to make or to originate loans at this point? And what type of liquidity do you have on hand and kind of what assumptions you use in terms of expected loan repayments there, and then the type of leverage you put on that?
Scott Davidson
Sure. Bunch of questions there, and if I don’t hit all of them, please remind me. But I think that, as you know, we ended the quarter with about $90 million or so of cash. What we’re striving to do is make sure we’re a consistent originator consistently in the markets throughout the year and not be in a period, where we originate a lot of loans and then are not able to access and deal with our borrowers for other periods.
So we’re very much in the process of timing our cash on hand with the loans that we want to make in doing that, as I said, throughout the year. As we previously disclosed, we have plans to make about $600 million worth of loans this year, anywhere from 600 to 800 We’ve got capital on hand and our miles tell us to give in the loan repayments we see for the balance of the year and the cash that will return to us that we should be able to do that as well as meet some of our targets around debt repayments. So we’ve got a balance between both of those uses of cash.
And as a general rule, we’ve kind of targeted about a 20% equity target for the company. As we’ve disclosed, it maybe 17 or maybe 22. But we think about it somewhere between that 17 to 22, which is why when you look at our floating-rate securitizations, you’ll see that that’s about the amount of equity we keep in each of those transactions, which matches our long-term goals.
Tim Hayes
Got it. Thanks for the color.
Scott Davidson
You’re welcome.
Operator
And your next question comes from Steve DeLaney with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Steve DeLaney
Good morning and thanks for taking the question. So I’d like to ask a series of questions, if I may, about Urban Retail. I believe that you have commented in the past that that operation as it exists today with respect to the property management contracts and the headcount, I believe, I’ve heard you describe it as being a drag on current results and current earnings, that’s why you’re looking to dispose it. But can you estimate for us the – is there a way to estimate what the negative impact was to CAD in the first quarter from the Urban Retail operation?
Scott Davidson
Sure. Well, Steve, I’ll turn it over to Paul to talk about some of that, but just so we’re all on the same page.
Steve DeLaney
Yes.
Scott Davidson
Urban has been a great benefit to the firm as its managed properties that we’ve owned. As we’re selling those properties, we no longer need that expertise. I think it provided us significant benefits in the early days and it’s….
Steve DeLaney
Right.
Scott Davidson
…reduced. I think we disclosed in our last earnings call, it was a little bit closer to break-even, and then, of course, there are financing. I said break-even, I think about it from a top line perspective, Paul thinks about it from a GAAP perspective. And so I’ll let him talk about that.

Steve DeLaney
Okay, thanks.
Paul Kopsky
On a standalone basis, Steve, the company did have better than break-even numbers on a standalone basis. As they continue to work on our properties, obviously, you have their consolidation of revenues and expenses come into play. But overall, the business has on a standalone basis is making money for us.
Scott Davidson
On a GAAP basis.
Paul Kopsky
On a GAAP basis.
Steve DeLaney
Okay, got it. Thanks. Okay, thank you for clarifying that. I’m sorry, if I misstated it initially. Is there a formal process in place, where you’ve engaged advisors to attempt to sell this, or are you doing it more from a networking standpoint?
Paul Kopsky
We are – we have a number of interested parties that we have done on our own….
Steve DeLaney
Okay.
Paul Kopsky
…that that we’re working with, and we look forward to trying to finalizing that here in the very near future.
Steve DeLaney
Okay. And could you estimate the – if it were to be sold, what the headcount reduction would be to your end possibly the expense, I know, you’re trying to lower expenses, so if you could comment on headcount reductions and expenses if you were successful in selling it, that would be helpful?
Paul Kopsky
Well, the urban team has about 250-plus people in the overall group. So that would be the overall headcount reduction. I think we’ve been laying out this $7 million to $10 million of revenues and expense would be also eliminating other as well.
Steve DeLaney
Okay, great, that’s very helpful. Okay, and then a final thing, if I may. So, good continued progress for plan in terms of selling the – selling off the legacy and real estate looks like, we’re down to $690-some-million. Do you have – can you share any type of timeframe for – or let’s put it this way, because I know this is sort of a best efforts thing. Do you have a goal that you have in mind for being able to complete the full disposition of that, or how much over the next one to two years might we see in additional sales or dispositions? Thanks.
Scott Davidson
Well, yes, no, as you know, we identified the specific portfolio and classified them as available for sale at the end of the year. We expect all of those assets or we’re intending all of those assets that we sold in this calendar year. In terms of our goal, my view would be at rather sell everything at an appropriate price as quickly as possible. So we’re going to continue on the assets that that we can to accelerate that process as much as possible. I think our first quarter production in terms of selling assets was representative of sort of a normal quarter.
I’m hopeful that it’s a little bit higher in the second quarter and that we can continue that progress into the third and fourth quarter. But it is an active process. We’re engaging with lots of buyers. We’ve got contracts signed, and we’re working in hard. We do feel very good about the progress. There are a couple of assets that have some – the reason we have identified every asset to sellers, there’s a couple not only do we feel there are some significant upside in, but there are also a couple of that for various contractual reasons we can’t sell as quickly as we would like. And once those contractual reasons end, we will move forward in selling them.
Steve DeLaney
Right. I believe you’ve got one project, I believe you described it is in redevelopment. So, obviously, that’s something you’re trying to do some value-add work to, I guess, before you try to liquidate. Of the $695 million, can you remind me what the actual amount that you had classified as available for sale is currently? Do you have that figure handy?
Paul Kopsky
All of it.
Steve DeLaney
Oh, all of it?
Scott Davidson
No, it dose not. There was originally $540 million, right?
Steve DeLaney

Okay.
Scott Davidson
Of that $540 million, we reduced it by a $100 million this quarter, correct?
Paul Kopsky
Correct.
Scott Davidson
So it’s $440 million…
Steve DeLaney
Okay, wonderful. Okay, well, guys, thank you for the time this morning. That’s helpful.
Scott Davidson
You’re welcome.
Operator
And your next question comes from George Bahamondes with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
George Bahamondes
Hi, good morning. I’m just wondering if you could provide additional detail both, including terms location at the use of proceeds, if any color you can provide on the five loans you’ve originated in the first quarter?
Scott Davidson
Yes. Glenn Riis, who is here and Head of our Credit Department, I have never called him before talking to one of these calls. So Glenn, you want to give us some high-level discussions, I’d say, with the loans?
Glenn Riis
Well, yes, we like I said, we had a pretty decent quarter this first quarter and I look forward to continuing the rest of the year. One of the larger asset there we did was a portfolio of high-quality real estate assets here in Philadelphia in our backyard. The $63 million loan on a combination of seven properties, combination of retail office and small multi-family component, and it’s for a repeat bar for us for all three properties. So that that’s kind of at a high-level of the largest asset that we did.
George Bahamondes
Okay.
Glenn Riis
And then we had four other assets that kind of have any like [Multiple Speakers]
Scott Davidson
They’re all quite consistent with our transitional loan product.
Glenn Riis
Right.
Scott Davidson
All in good markets, a large variety of asset classes that are within our core product types. So there’s no outlier. There was no new market for us very, very consistent when you see FL-7, you’ll see those loans in there. And I think FL-7 the perspectives that put forward with that transaction with [new dramatic detail] [ph] associated with each loan will do a good job of highlighting that for you.
George Bahamondes
Okay, that…
Glenn Riis
Go ahead.
George Bahamondes
So that was there, I’m sorry if I cut you off there.
Glenn Riis
Okay. And I just wanted to refine that Steve’s comment made earlier about what was remaining in the $694 million. We do reflect that in page 19 of our supplement, reflecting $377 million in held for available for sale and $316 million in held for investment, representing that $694 million remaining in the real estate portfolio.
George Bahamondes
Okay. I think, that was it for me. Thanks, guys.
Operator
And I’m showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Scott Davidson for any further remarks.
Scott Davidson
Thank you all for joining, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Have a wonderful day, everybody.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A., and the Republicans’ Bargain with Trump | The New YorkerShopSign in|Link your subscriptionAmy Davidson SorkinScott Pruitt, the E.P.A., and the Republicans’ Bargain with TrumpBy Amy Davidson SorkinFebruary 17, 2017Almost no one in the G.O.P. seems to question the wisdom of putting Scott Pruitt, who doubts the reality of climate change, in charge of the environmental agency most associated with efforts to combat it.PHOTOGRAPH BY ZACH GIBSON / AFP / GETTYGiven that a cache of documents that might show whether Scott Pruitt, President Donald Trump’s choice to run the Environmental Protection Agency, ought to get the job is due to be released next Tuesday, why did Senate Republicans insist, over Democratic protests, on holding a confirmation vote on Friday? Since there was only a holiday weekend in between, not much time would have been lost. And the documents, including e-mails on the contacts that Pruitt had with oil and gas companies in Oklahoma during a period in which, as that state’s attorney general, he repeatedly sued the E.P.A. and sought to block policies designed to address climate change, are directly relevant. (As Elizabeth Kolbert has written, the existing paper trail is already pretty damning.) This wasn’t some fishing expedition into an obscure or long-closed chapter of Pruitt’s life. Nor was it a last-minute one: a judge in Oklahoma ordered that the state produce the papers in response to a long-stalled freedom-of-information request from a citizens’ group, first filed in 2015, before anyone thought that Trump might win the election. Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, who introduced the measure that would have delayed the vote, called the unwillingness to examine the e-mails “an egregious cover-up,” and it might well have been just that. The e-mails could show a conflict between Pruitt’s private ties to an industry whose activities he would help regulate and his duty to the public.But the Republicans, it turned out, weren’t interested in any of that. After a session in which they mostly complained that the Democrats didn’t seem to like anyone whom President Trump had come up with, they pushed the vote through, and Pruitt was confirmed, fifty-two to forty-six. Only one Republican, Susan Collins, of Maine, voted against him. (Two Democrats—Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, and Heidi Heitkamp, of North Dakota—voted yes, presumably for reasons related to their states’ fossil-fuel industries and the tough reëlection campaigns that they face next year. John McCain missed the vote because he was travelling.) No one else in the Republican Party seemed to question the wisdom of putting a man who has openly doubted the reality of climate change in charge of the agency most associated with efforts to combat it. Why not?There are two answers to the question of why Republicans rushed Pruitt through, not mutually exclusive. One is that this is just another instance of something that has been seen repeatedly in the weeks since Donald Trump took office: the Republicans’ floppy pose of deference to Trump. They have let him do what he wants, for the most part, unless a shocking “Oprah” tape from the past comes back to haunt an already unfit nominee. (As William Finnegan has written, in that case, involving Andrew Puzder, the failed Labor Secretary nominee, the tape only stopped the senators when combined with his illegal household help and his crudely expressed disdain for working Americans.) They hadn’t stood up to Trump on his executive order barring entry to people from seven countries and to all refugees, despite the direct risk it posed to many residents of red states, not to mention to the Constitution. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan hadn’t managed to say much more than that “regrettably, the rollout was confusing,” as if he might have erased the insult to American values with a PowerPoint presentation and a can-do smile. Their hurt speeches, on Friday morning, about how the Democrats didn’t respect Trump’s choices, came less than twenty-four hours after their President spoke casually about blowing Russian boats out of the water; accused his opponents of staging fake anti-Semitic attacks; questioned the legitimacy of the electoral system, the courts, and the media; and asked a black journalist, April Ryan, if the legislators in the Congressional Black Caucus were “friends” of hers, and if she could maybe set them up with a meeting with him.This is a weak answer, in part because of what is at stake: not only America’s air and water and its children’s health but the future of the planet. Pruitt is so shameless a choice that former E.P.A. employees who have served under Presidents from both parties sent a letter to the Senate expressing concern about his appointment, noting his demonstrated lack of interest in enforcing environmental laws, his stance on climate change, and his failure to demonstrate that he would “put the public’s welfare ahead of private interests.”Then again, why would this Republican Party want to block Pruitt? This is the other answer: the senators pushed him through because they wanted to, for their own non-Trump reasons. He is, in many ways, more typical of where many congressional Republicans stand than Trump is, though Pruitt might express his views more crudely and with fewer circumlocutions than some. His ties to industry are, in many cases, their ties to industry, too. (Jane Mayer has covered the influence of the Koch brothers, for example, in this regard.) When Ryan talks about dismantling the regulatory state, he is not far from Pruitt. Indeed, when asked about the influence of human activity on climate change, Ryan has said that he just didn’t know what it all added up to, “and I don’t think science does, either.” In a statement that Ryan issued in December, 2009, he accused certain scientists who did recognize the effect of using “statistical tricks to distort their findings and intentionally mislead the public on the issue of climate change.” He added that any rules restricting American industry in the name of fighting climate change would be a “tough sell” in Wisconsin, “where much of the state is buried under snow.” Similarly, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, tends to deal with climate change by saying that he is not a scientist. In the opportunistic calculations of the congressional Republicans, Pruitt may not even count as a price they have to pay, or a Trumpian burden to bear. To the contrary: he is their reward.Most Popular1.Ryan LizzaAnthony Scaramucci Called Me to Unload About White House Leakers, Reince Priebus, and Steve BannonBy Ryan Lizza2.Daily CommentDonald Trump’s State of Mind, and OursBy Evan Osnos3.Daily ShoutsNewly Discovered Very Illegal Thing Will Finally Bring Down Trump (Or Be Another Cute Tile in the Mosaic of Democracy’s Demise, I Guess)By Broti Gupta4.Satire from The Borowitz ReportGirl Scouts Obtain Restraining Order Against TrumpBy Andy Borowitz5.Amy Davidson SorkinWhen Anthony Scaramucci Fell in Love with Donald TrumpBy Amy Davidson Sorkinour thirty most popularRecommended StoriesNews DeskScott Pruitt, Trump’s Industry Pick for the E.P.A.Trump’s choice of Scott Pruitt can be seen as a decision to outsource environmental policy to the Republican Party’s most powerful private donors.By Jane MayerDec. 08, 2016Daily CommentEarth to Pruitt: At a Confirmation Hearing, Denialism Stands While Temperatures RiseDenying climate change, even at the very highest levels of government, isn’t going to alter the fact that it’s happening.By Elizabeth KolbertJan. 19, 2017Amy DavidsonScott Pruitt Rejects Climate-Change RealityBy Amy DavidsonMar. 10, 2017Amy DavidsonPaul Ryan’s Quest to Really, Truly Unify with Donald TrumpBy Amy DavidsonMay 12, 2016NewsCultureBooksBusiness & TechHumorCartoonsMagazineVideoPodcastsArchiveGoings OnShopSign inLink your subscription

Three years after Harley-Davidson Inc.’s LiveWire first debuted, CEO Matt Levatich says progress continues to be made on the electric motorcycle that he says is receiving tremendous feedback.
“Three years ago, we had a team within Harley that developed (LiveWire),” he said. “They had the mandate to create a no excuses electric Harley-Davidson motorcycle. And they did. Everything else in the marketplace out there feels like a two-wheel golf cart — without the golf club carrying capacity.”

Levatich spoke enthusiastically about the electric motorcycle at the Milwaukee Business Journal's Power Breakfast June 23 at The Pfister Hotel.
“I would say it’s the most exciting automotive two- or four-wheel product that I’ve ever experienced," he told the crowd. "We were very excited about it, and we are very excited about it.”
Levatich said the company is working on a five-year plan with LiveWire expected to arrive before the end of the decade. But there is technology that still needs to be developed to find the right balance for its cost and its range per battery charge.




 


“We’ve had about 15,000 demo rides around the world, and the feedback is tremendous,” he said. “Basically it is: this is perfect; I want it now; when can I get it? Then we ask practical things like: how far do you need it to go? And they say things like: Double the distance it will go. And (we ask), how much do you need it to cost? And they say things like: Half as much as it would cost. And this is just the reality of the technology at this stage — battery energy density primarily that we needed to have evolve so we can get closer to where that sweet spot is for price and range. It’s evolving.”
Despite the goal of having it arrive by 2020, the priority is more on getting it right than meeting any self-imposed deadlines.
“Product development is an uncertain business,” he said. “We need technology to develop. We’re expecting things to sort of be there when we need them. And we’re not going to launch a compromised product. We have to deliver all the things that customers want for a no excuses electric Harley. And when we do it’s going to be awesome.”
