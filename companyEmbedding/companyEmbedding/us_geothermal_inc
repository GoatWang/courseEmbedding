          Join Roy Mink for a field trip to the plant, located west of Vale, Ore. Because it’s an active industrial site, sturdy hiking boots and full-length pants are required (no T-shirts). The noise level will be high, so earplugs are provided. Take lunch and water. Meet at the WinCo parking lot on Meridian Road at I-84 at 7:30 a.m. for a prompt departure at 8 a.m. Return to Boise by 6 p.m. Visit idahomuseum.org for critical details about the trip. Sponsored by the Idaho Museum of Mining and Geology. Call Steve at 208-853-1678 to preregister.

US Geothermal stock analysis involves checking at least a few of the important things like: Revenue: The money received by selling of goods or services comes under this line item.  A YoY growth (See: US Geothermal revenue chart) implies that the company is growing, which has been the case with US Geothermal.  One must stay away from stocks whose revenues are declining.  Bottom line: The word bottom line comes because it is usually the last line of the income statement and refers to the actual profits after deducting all expenses from the revenues.  HTM stock had a healthy bottom line growth.  The income statement is also called statement of revenue and expense.  The financials along with US Geothermal historical stock prices provides a lot of details about the firm.  .

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors;
          Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain
          Officers.
Appointment of Douglas Glaspey as Interim Chief Executive Officer
On July 13, 2017 the Company announced the appointment of Douglas J. Glaspey to
serve as the Company's Interim Chief Executive Officer, effective July 19, 2017.
The Company's Board of Directors appointed Mr. Glaspey to serve as the Interim
Chief Executive Officer on July 6, 2017 and in connection with his appointment
to the position of Interim Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Glaspey's annual salary
will increase to $284,180.
Mr. Glaspey will continue to serve as the Company's President and Chief
Operating Officer. Mr. Glaspey, age 64, was the co-founder and also serves as a
director of the Company. He has served as a director of the Company since March
2000, President of the Company since September 2011, and Chief Operating Officer
of the Company since December 2003. Mr. Glaspey served from March 2000 until
December 2004 as the President and Chief Executive Officer for the TSX Venture
Exchange listed U.S. Cobalt Inc. until the acquisition of Geo-Idaho in December
2003. He also served as a director and the Chief Executive Officer of Geo-Idaho
from February 2002 until the acquisition of Geo-Idaho in December 2003. During
his prior career in the mining industry, he has held operating positions with
ASARCO, Earth Resources Company, Asamera Minerals, Atlanta Gold Corporation and
Twin Gold Corporation. Mr. Glaspey has 38 years of operating and management
experience, 14 of which are in geothermal. He holds a Bachelor of Science in

in the United States, including Drumlummon Gold Mines Corporation and Black
Diamond Corporation. He is currently a director of TSX Venture Exchange listed
Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc., which is also quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board.
The Board of Directors has established an Executive Committee that, in addition
to overseeing the search for a new CEO, will guide the company on key strategic
initiatives and capital allocation.
Dennis Gilles Advisory Agreement
As previously reported on a Form 8-K, on April 19, 2017, the Company determined
not to extend its employment agreement with Dennis Gilles, the Company's Chief
Executive Officer, beyond its current term expiring on July 18, 2017. In
accordance with the terms of the employment agreement, the Company delivered a
notice of non-renewal to Mr. Gilles. At the time, the Company reported that it
and Mr. Gilles were discussing a role for Mr. Gilles as an outside advisor to
the Company after his employment agreement expired.
On July 12, 2017, the Company entered into an advisory agreement for executive
management advisory services (the "Advisory Agreement") with Mr. Gilles. The
Advisory Agreement is effective July 19, 2017, and will remain in effect until
January 18, 2018 unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms or
renewed by agreement of both parties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay to Mr.
Gilles$10,000 per month during the term of the Advisory Agreement. Mr. Gilles
will provide no more than an average of one hundred hours per month of services
to the Company under the Advisory Agreement. In addition, Mr. Gilles will be
eligible to receive stock option awards under the Company's 2009 Stock Incentive
Plan at the discretion of the Board. The Company will also reimburse Mr. Gilles
for reasonable incidental, or Chief Executive Officer pre-approved, expenses
incurred in connection with its engagement.
Under the Advisory Agreement, Mr. Gilles will perform such duties communicated
to him by the President, CEO or Chair of the Board or Chair of any Board
Committee.
The Company has agreed to pay Mr. Gilles a performance bonus in the following
circumstances:

     (a)  If Mr. Gilles is specifically tasked by the Company to provide
          consulting services relating to the negotiation of a Power Purchase
          Agreement for the Company's Geysers project in California, Mr. Gilles
          would receive a performance bonus in the amount of $100,000 upon the
          execution of the Power Purchase Agreement by both parties, provided it
          occurs during the term of the Advisory Agreement, or within 6 months
          after the expiration or termination of the Advisory Agreement other than
          for Cause.

     (b)  If Mr. Gilles is specifically tasked by the Company to provide
          consulting services relating to the negotiation of a Power Purchase
          Agreement for the Company's San Emidio II project in Nevada, Mr. Gilles
          would receive a performance bonus in the amount of $100,000 upon the
          execution of the Power Purchase Agreement by both parties, provided it
          occurs during the term of the Advisory Agreement, or within 6 months
          after the expiration or termination of the Advisory Agreement other than
          for Cause.


The Advisory Agreement may be terminated without notice for Cause or upon 30
days prior written notice without Cause. The Advisory Agreement will otherwise
terminate upon completion of a Change of Control or upon expiration of the term
of the Advisory Agreement.
The Advisory Agreement also includes covenants by Mr. Gilles with respect to the
treatment of confidential information, non-competition, non-solicitation and
non-change of control activities, and provides for equitable relief in the event
of breach.
Pursuant to Mr. Gilles' employment agreement with the Company dated April 19,
2013 and, as amended on January 1, 2017, Mr. Gilles is entitled to severance
payments under specified circumstances (see the Company's most recent definitive
proxy statement for a description of his termination payments). However, payment
of such amounts is not due until after he experiences a termination of his
employment, which is determined in a manner consistent with the definition of
"separation from service" under Code Section 409A. Based on the anticipated
level of services to be provided under the Advisory Agreement, the parties do
not intend that Mr. Gilles' service under the Advisory Agreement will constitute
a "separation from service" until his services under the Advisory Agreement
terminate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
A copy of the press release announcing the appointment of Mr. Glaspey as the
Company's Interim Chief Executive Officer is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this
Current Report on Form 8-K.
The information furnished herewith pursuant to Item 7.01 of this Current Report
is being "furnished" in accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K and
shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or
otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed to
be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any
general incorporation language in such filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Nationwide Geothermal Heating andCooling Sales, Service and Support
Geothermal heating and cooling (or geothermal heat pumps) provides a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly solution to homeowners and building owners alike. Yet many shy away from geothermal heating and cooling from either a lack of understanding, an absence of support, or the inaccessibility to quality products and information.
Geothermal Products offers geothermal consultation, sales, and service and support — guided by some of the geothermal industry’s top experts. We support homeowners who do it themselves and small to mid-size contractors who work on residential or commercial projects.

Why geothermal?
Geothermal heating and cooling delivers high efficiency and low operating costs to homeowners and building owners. Systems boast long operational lives, low maintenance — as well as low environmental impact.Learn more >


What is geothermal?
Geothermal heating and cooling — or geothermal heat pumps — is a central air solution that uses the constant temperature of the earth’s crust as a temperature exchange medium instead of the varying outside air.Learn more >


How can Geothermal Products help?
Geothermal Products experts have decades of experience in the geothermal industry. We provide our expertise, customer service and geothermal solutions to DIY homeowners and small to mid-size contractors. Your need is our knowledge.Learn more >


"I have dealt with many contractors and suppliers. Geothermal Products was the absolute best provider both in product and service. The owner of the company provided his cell phone and was encourage to call anytime for assistance with installation or questions. Top rated supplier. Highly recommend!"
- Jim L. / Virginia
"I found Geothermal Products via a Google search when looking to replace my 3 ton geothermal heat pump that was almost 20 years old when it finally failed. From the very beginning Gary was great about answering questions both via email, text, and phone. I have been in construction for my entire life, but I am not an HVAC mechanic. I'm a General Contractor with a good working knowledge of all the trades, and thought I could handle the system change out, and with Gary's help I was right. By purchasing from Geothermal Products I was able to buy a high quality, high efficiency unit at a very reasonable price. By handling the install myself I saved thousands in labor and ended up with a cleaner installation than I likely would have gotten otherwise (I'm picky, what can I say?). Roughly one year later another one of my heat pumps went down, this one was a newer unit installed in an addition. I quickly diagnosed a bad compressor and fired off an email to Gary about a new 2 ton unit to replace it. Another great experience and with Gary's help I had that unit up an running in short order too. My electric bills have plummeted due to the great increase in efficiency of my new units. I am a very satisfied customer, and will continue to do business with Gary whenever the need arises."
- Tom / General Contractor / Ohio
"Couldn't be happier with Gary and the job he did. He replaced my old furnace, (only needed one) checked my lines and rerouted the piping that had been installed when we got our first units. We also added an additional water heater (he will explain) to preheat water and replaced the thermostats (We have a unit for upstairs and another for downstairs). The level of comfort and the ability of the new unit to function with-out the electric backup has dramatically improved. If you are not considering a geothermal system, they are definitely worth looking at. If you have a system and are considering a replacement I would strongly encourage you to give Gary a call. We contacted most of the major suppliers in the city before we chose Gary. He was more knowledgeable, more professional, and more competitive."
- Paul G. / Iowa

Provides Update on Development and Expansion ProjectsMarketwiredFebruary 6, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareBOISE, IDAHO--(Marketwired - Feb 6, 2017) -  U.S. Geothermal Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE MKT:HTM), a leading and profitable renewable energy company focused on the development, production and sale of electricity from geothermal energy, is pleased to provide an update on its development and expansion projects."During 2016 we were able to advance many of our development projects," said Dennis Gilles, Chief Executive Officer. "Through a combination of an excellent pipeline of projects and a favorable legislative environment, we believe that we will improve our year-over-year performance and advance the Company to achieve our 2021 goal of over 200 MWs."DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (90 Megawatts)WGP Geysers, California (30 Megawatts) The Conditional Use Permit from Sonoma County, which approves the construction plan for the WGP Geysers power plant, was received on December 16, 2016. Combined with the Large Generator Interconnection Agreement that was received from the California Independent System Operator and Pacific Gas & Electric, this completes the long lead permits and agreements that are needed for the project. Once final engineering design is finished, and a PPA is executed, an air quality permit and building permit will be needed before on site construction will begin.Engineering optimization of the new, hybrid power plant design is continuing and budgetary quotes for the major equipment have been received. Our engineers and consultants are working in concert with EPC contractors to examine all aspects of the construction cycle with a focus on reducing construction costs. The hybrid design will dramatically increase the volume of water available for injection back into the reservoir, which will result in increased power generation over the life of the project.Recent discussions have been held with a number of potential power purchasers in California for the generation from the WGP Geysers plant and are continuing. Interest has been expressed by a number of them for base load, renewable power to replace fossil fuel based power generation that is being phased out of their portfolios.San Emidio Phase II, Nevada (35 Megawatts) The updated reservoir model (announced January 11th) resulted in a significant increase in the potential size of the San Emidio Phase II reservoir of up to 47 net megawatts. Data from flow tests that took place in late 2016 from two wells were incorporated into a Probabilistic Power Density model, which estimates the Net generation potential of a reservoir. The power density model is not a Monte Carlo style "heat in place" estimate. Based on the flow rate and temperature produced by the two wells, and by measurement of pressure response both in the wells and across the wellfield, the model estimates that the Most Likely Outcome (50% probability) is 47 net megawatts of generation capacity within a 1.4 square mile area. The Minimum level of generation capacity (90% probability) occurs in a 0.18 square mile area, and has 18.8 net megawatts of generation capacity.These two wells are approximately 1,700 feet apart, along the new structural trend identified in the Southwest Zone which is still open for expansion. Temperature gradient well data and seismic information indicate a potential strike length for the Southwest Zone of up to 2,700 feet. This compares to a strike length for the primary producing wellfield at San Emidio Phase I of 800 feet, suggesting the potential for a much larger resource in this Southwest Zone. Permits to deepen three remaining temperature gradient wells were received from the Bureau of Land Management in December 2016. These three wells will be deepened to the targeted reservoir depth to further explore the Southwest Zone when weather allows. If successful, it will extend the length of the productive reservoir by 1,000 feet.The three power plant units that were purchased in 2016 are available to provide this project with the major, long lead equipment requirements for 35-45 net megawatts of power (depending upon cooling system used). The increased San Emidio II reservoir capacity with a 320°F+ temperature fits the design range of the equipment. These new, unused components represent approximately 70% of the equipment needed for a complete facility similar to the Company's Neal Hot Springs operation.Read MoreGiven the larger resource capacity at San Emidio II, we have cancelled our Small Generator Interconnection Agreement that was completed in 2016, and are preparing to apply for a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement in support of the higher expected output. Additionally, transmission studies that contemplate power sales into Southern California will also be conducted, since there is now a transmission path from Northern Nevada going south on the new 500KV, 800 megawatt transmission line that was completed in January 2014.In July 2016, the Company was awarded a $1.5 million Department of Energy cost share grant under the "Development of Technologies for Sensing, Analyzing, and Utilizing Novel Subsurface Signals in Support of the Subsurface Technology and Engineering ('SubTER') Crosscut Initiative." The program approved under the grant includes using new subsurface technologies at both San Emidio and Crescent Valley to identify fluid flow paths in the geothermal resource. The data collection phase of the program was completed at San Emidio in December. The data is being interpreted to determine whether viable targets have been identified. Upon approval from the DOE, a second phase of the grant program is designed to confirm the findings by drilling. The total program cost is $1.9 million with the Company providing $400,000 in cost share.El Ceibillo, Guatemala (25 Megawatts) On January 10, 2017, the Guatemalan government, through the National Electrical Energy Commission (COMISIÓN NACIONAL DE ENERGÍA ELÉCTRICA-"CNEE"), announced that it is preparing to issue an RFP later this year for 420 megawatts of power, of which 40 megawatts is to be reserved specifically for geothermal energy. When the RFP is issued, the El Ceibillo project will be bid into the process.With the commercial shallow resource now proven, in 2017, a deep well to test the producing structure down dip from well EC-5 is planned to a projected depth of 1,970 to 2,300 feet (600-800 meters). EC-5 was completed to a depth of 1,450 feet (442 meters) and intersected a high permeability zone at 1,299 feet (396 meters) with a temperature of 388°F (198°C). Chemical analysis of fluid samples taken from EC-5 at the end of a flow test indicate a potential, deep reservoir temperature of 450 to 523°F (232 to 273°C). A deeper intersection in the reservoir could increase the reservoir capacity and production temperature, and change the design of the power plant. Well EC-1, which was drilled in 2013 to a depth of 5,650 feet (1,722 meters) found a measured bottom-hole temperature of 526°F (274°C), but did not intersect permeability. The comparative geology between EC-5 and EC-1 suggests a fault or other structure feeding the reservoir may be located in the area between the two wells.EXPANSION PROJECTS (4-6 Megawatts)Neal Hot Springs, Oregon - Hybrid Cooling (3 Megawatts) A third water supply well for the project was drilled in December, but due to extreme winter weather, the well has not been completed and tested to date. Productive water zones were intersected in the well, but a liner must be installed before the well can be flow tested. A fourth site has been selected and will be drilled once weather allows. The project currently has one well available from drilling in 2015 that can supply approximately 170 gallons per minute. The minimum amount of water needed for a hybrid cooling system is approximately 200-300 gallons per minute for each unit.The ability to use water cooling during the 5-6 months of summer and fall would increase power generation, when current air cooling results in a lower plant output. An initial engineering evaluation of various hybrid cooling methods was completed by Power Engineers Inc., which confirms the economic viability of hybrid cooling if enough water can be found.Raft River, Idaho - Wellfield Optimization (1-3 Megawatts) Additional production is now planned from well RRG-5, an idle well with significant permeability that has been used for injection in the past. Flow testing and reservoir modeling was performed during the 4th quarter 2016 to evaluate the well for conversion to production. Flow test results showed an initial flowing temperature of over 249°F, which is expected to increase once under production to approximately 265°F. Reservoir modeling shows that RRG-5 is capable of producing up to 1,000 gpm, yielding approximately 1.5 to 2 additional net megawatts of generation from the plant. A production pump has been ordered, and is expected to be installed by the end of the first quarter 2017. Generation is expected to ramp up during the second quarter as the production wellfield is rebalanced to maximize its output. Additional sources of geothermal fluid from other wells on the project are also under study to further increase the generation level of the plant.The initial effort to expand the output of Raft River from its current 10 megawatts to its maximum contracted level of 13 megawatts began with the drilling of a second production leg at RRG-2 in June 2016. The second production leg was drilled to a depth of 5,605 feet and was completed at the end of July. Several small zones of permeability were encountered in the new production leg. After testing the well, a new pump was installed and the well resumed production in early September. The well temperature has plateaued at approximately 277°F, down from the original production temperature of 283°F, and the well is now producing approximately 180 gallons per minute less flow than before drilling. It is believed that during drilling operations, the original production leg of the well was damaged by scale formation, which blinded off its producing fractures. Despite these results, the overall production at the plant has returned to normal levels and current production is believed to be coming mostly from the newly drilled production leg. Operations to recover the damaged production leg with an industry standard chemical treatment will be considered in the future.Well RRG-9, which has been used as part of an $11.4 million thermal stimulation grant primarily funded by the Department of Energy, has significantly increased the injection capacity to 1,200 gallons per minute from an original level of 20 gallons per minute. This increase in injection capacity provides all of the additional volume needed to accept the flow from well RRG-5 without requiring any new drilling.About U.S. Geothermal Inc.: U.S. Geothermal Inc. is a leading and profitable renewable energy company focused on the development, production and sale of electricity from geothermal energy.

Geothermal, the most reliable renewable[edit]
Why Geothermal?[edit]
Vs. Traditional Power Generation[edit]
Clean and renewable. No commodity risk and/or price volatility from fuel inputs. Negligible emissions. Easier permitting process in Western US. High availability versus all technologies. Qualifies for renewable incentives.
Why Geothermal?[edit]
Vs. Wind & Solar[edit]
Geothermal provides base load power (24 hours/day). Wind - 34% installed capacity*
(8.2 hours/day) and Solar - 25% installed capacity* (6.0 hours/day). Efficient use of transmission. Smaller footprint/reduced visual impact. Minimal impact to wildlife. Geothermal does have: longer development lead times; higher exploration risk/cost.
