Jackson National, one of the largest variable annuity
    providers in the U.S., is planning to remove PIMCOs total
    return strategy, made famous by Bill Gross until his
    high-profile departure in 2014, and replace it with
    DoubleLines core fixed income fund.
With a variable annuity, which is a tax-advantaged form of
    insurance, individuals get to choose money managers to oversee
    their underlying investments in the annuity. Insurance
    companies vet money managers and then create an authorized list
    of investments for clients to pick from. Jackson National will
    change the subadvisor for its JNL/Total Return Bond Fund from
    the PIMCO fund, which now has $3.4 billion in assets from the
    insurers clients, to DoubleLine Capital, according to a
    Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Jackson National has offered the PIMCO total return strategy
    since 1998. The insurance company offers the investment
    strategy within a separate account created specifically for the
    variable annuity product. Since Grosss departure, the
    PIMCO Total Return Fund has been overseen by Mark Kiesel, Mihir
    Worah and Scott Mather.
DoubleLines $8 billion Core Fixed Income Fund is
    co-managed by co-founder Jeffrey Gundlach and Jeffrey Sherman,
    the firms deputy chief investment officer. A PIMCO
    spokesman declined to comment. A spokesman for DoubleLine also
    declined to comment and referred questions to Jackson National.
    Jackson National did not return calls by press time.
Jackson National will continue to offer other PIMCO
    strategies, including PIMCO Real Return and PIMCO Credit
    Income, and is also planning to begin offering the PIMCO Income
    Fund, according to the SEC filing. PIMCO Income is one of the
    money managers best performing funds and its largest. The
    life insurance company is also planning to add other funds,
    including ten portfolios from the Vanguard Group, as well as
    funds from Invesco and other asset managers.
DoubleLine has been offering other funds in Jackson
    Nationals variable annuity series, including the Total
    Return Bond strategy, which is focused on mortgage-backed
    securities; Emerging Markets Fixed Income; and the DoubleLine
    Shiller Enhanced CAPE fund, a smart beta equity fund. 
Since Grosss departure from PIMCO, clients have been
    draining assets from the total return fund. At its peak the
    fund managed more than $200 billion. Now it has $73.8 billion,
    according to Morningstar.
PIMCOs Total Return Fund returned 2.88 percent
    annually over the past five years as of June 5, compared
    with the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate bond
    indexs return of 2.27 percent. The DoubleLine Core Fixed
    Income Fund generated a 3.54 percent return annually over the
    same time period.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

VIEW MORE



Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

A presentation on the fund strategy will be given by DoubleLine Equity partners Husam Nazer, portfolio manager of the fund, and Brendt Stallings, portfolio manager of other equity strategies at the firm.

The DoubleLine Equities Small Cap Growth Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation. DoubleLine Equity LP intends to invest the fund's assets principally in equity securities of small capitalization U.S. companies or foreign companies whose shares trade on a U.S. exchange or are otherwise actively traded in the U.S., including in the form of American Depository Receipts (ADRs) and American Depository Shares (ADSs). The fund may invest in some securities that may trade principally or only outside the U.S.
Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of the value of its net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities issued by companies with market capitalizations1, at the time of acquisition, within the capitalization range of the companies included in the Russell 2000® Growth Index2.
In addition to the DoubleLine Equities Small Cap Growth Fund, DoubleLine has registered two other open-end mutual funds that the firm plans to open to the public in the coming months, the DoubleLine Equities Growth Fund (I shares DBEGX/N shares DLEGX) and the DoubleLine Equities Technology Fund (I shares DBETX/N shares DLETX).



1.


Market Capitalization is the market price of an entire company, calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the price per share.



2.


Russell 2000 Growth Index measures the performance of the small-cap growth segment of the U.S. equity universe. You cannot invest directly in an index. 



* The adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and reimburse expenses through 04/01/2014.

About DoubleLine Capital LP and DoubleLine Equity LP
DoubleLine Capital LP and DoubleLine Equity LP (together with affiliates, "DoubleLine") are registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. DoubleLine manages more than $56 billion in asset allocation, fixed income and equities strategies. DoubleLine's headquarters is in Los Angeles, CA. Its offices can be reached by telephone at (213) 633-8200 or by e-mail at info@doubleline.com. Media can reach DoubleLine by e-mail at media@doubleline.com. 
The fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company, and it may be obtained by calling 1 (877) 354-6311/ 1 (877) DLINE11. Read it carefully before investing.
The information in this communication is not complete and may be changed.  We may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is effective.  This communication is not an offer to sell these securities and is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where the offer or sale is not permitted.
References to other mutual funds should not be interpreted as an offer of these securities.
The DoubleLine Equities Small Cap Growth Fund, DoubleLine Equities Growth Fund and DoubleLine Equities Technology Fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods.  These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets.  In order to achieve its investment objectives, the Fund may use certain types of exchange traded funds or investment derivatives.  Derivatives involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments.
ETF investments involve additional risks such as the market price trading at a discount to its net asset value, an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact a fund's ability to sell its shares.
The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility.  Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise.  This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities.  Investment by the Fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities.  Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions.
The DoubleLine Equities Small Cap Growth Fund and DoubleLine Equities Technology Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility.  
The DoubleLine Equities Technology Fund invests in technology companies.  Investments in technology companies may be highly volatile.  Their values may be adversely affected by such factors as, for example, rapid technological change, changes in management personnel, changes in competitive environment, and changes in investor sentiment.  Many technology companies are small or mid-sized companies any may be newly organized.  The fund may also experience concentration risk.  Concentrating investments in information technology-related companies increases the risk of loss because the stocks of many or all of those companies may decline in value due to developments adversely affecting the industries in which they operate. 
DoubleLine Group includes DoubleLine Capital, LP and DoubleLine Equity, LP.
DoubleLine Equity, LP is the advisor for the DoubleLine Equity Funds. The DoubleLine Equity Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
