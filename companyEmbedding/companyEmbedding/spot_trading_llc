13F Filings



The Security, Class, and CUSIP columns in the table below are shown exactly as filed by the investor.
        We do our best to track continuity of investments through acquisitions, and this will be reflected in
        the table as changes in names and cusips.
In addition to descriptive data, performance of the investment
        is shown over time. To calculate quarterly performance, we first calculate cost basis of the shares purchased during the quarter, then use
            that to calculate gross profit. Quarterly return is Gross Profit / Starting Portfolio value.
Note that cost basis is calculated and stored in thousands, so small quarterly changes in shares frequently
            result in a cost basis of zero.
