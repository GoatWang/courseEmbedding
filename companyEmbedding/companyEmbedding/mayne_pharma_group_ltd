Specialty Technologies
Mayne Pharma’s oral drug delivery technology experience has been established across a number of therapeutic classes. Through specialist material science skills, processes and proprietary technologies, clients are provided with products that have developmental, regulatory and marketing exclusivity.
Mayne Pharma’s oral drug delivery technologies and skills can be applied to reformulate solid oral dose forms of branded prescription products, generic prescription products, branded over the counter products and value added active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Proprietary pharmaceutical technologies include:

Customized controlled-release drug delivery
Bioavailability enhancement 
Taste masking (liquid and solid presentations)

Through our collaboration with our commercial partners, these technologies are utilized to develop and distribute novel prescription and OTC products which offer advantages over existing products, in order to meet unmet medical needs.
When applied appropriately, these technologies can potentially deliver the following therapeutic and convenience benefits to patients:

Reduced dosing frequency
Increased patient compliance
Improved side effect profile
More constant therapeutic effect

Benefits of Improved Drug Delivery:
Improving clinical outcomes & maximizing returns
Drug reformulation of existing molecules plays a key role in improving patient compliance and improving clinical outcomes. It also enables a molecule’s full commercial potential to be recognized. As such it is vital in maximizing returns on investment.
Key objectives of drug reformulation include:

Extending the scope of the drug (i.e. indication, routes of administration)
Improving efficacy
Improving ease of administration
Extending patent life
Improving the product’s competitive profile 

Revitalizing your Product
Drug reformulation reveals a number of marketing opportunities at different stages of the product lifecycle that help to achieve strategic goals. Employing Mayne Pharma’s proprietary technology to manage the product life cycle may allow opportunities for new regulatory exclusivity and intellectual property, and hence extend the period of marketing exclusivity for the product while providing additional patient benefits.
Product lifecycle opportunities include:

Increased commercial potential of a molecule is enabled through expanding the scope (i.e. new indications, accessing new segments of patient populations).
New sales opportunities enabled by new and differentiated formulations.
Extended patent protection for a competitively differentiated formulation.
Reformulation of an off patent drug to capture market share and/or grow the market for the drug.

Maximizing returns on new chemical entities (NCE)
Many NCEs fail to reach the market as an oral dose form due to inadequate physicochemical or biopharmaceutical properties (e.g. high variability and/or low absorption, short half life etc). This results in candidate failure or development of the NCE in a less preferred route.
Such deficiencies may be addressed with the application of Mayne Pharma’s drug delivery technologies, which can help to diminish such inadequacies, formulate a NCE into a preferred route and allow for NCE optimization.

US Compliance Notices
California Annual Declaration of Compliance
Mayne Pharma (“Mayne”) has adopted a Comprehensive Compliance Program in accordance with California Health and Safety Code, § 119402. Mayne’s Comprehensive Compliance Program is in accordance with the April 2003 “Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers” developed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) and incorporates policies that comply with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America “Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals” as revised from time to time.
Mayne is committed to ensuring compliance with its company policies and with applicable laws and regulations. The Comprehensive Compliance Program represents Mayne’s commitment to the highest standards of corporate conduct. The OIG Guidance acknowledges that the implementation of a compliance program, such as the Comprehensive Compliance Program, cannot ensure that improper employee conduct will never occur. Nonetheless, Mayne expects and requires its employees to abide by Mayne’s Business Code of Conduct and the other policies described in its Comprehensive Compliance Program.
Mayne declares, to the best of its knowledge and based on its good faith understanding of the statutory requirements that Mayne is in compliance with Comprehensive Compliance Program and Chapter 8, Part 15, Division 104 of the California Health and Safety Code.
Mayne has set the annual aggregate limit on covered promotional expenditures at $1,500 per covered medical or healthcare professional for annual periods commencing on July 1, 2015. This limit may be revised by Mayne from time to time. The foregoing limit does not represent any usual, customary, average, or typical amount for medical or health care professionals.
This program became effective as of July 1, 2015.
Mayne will assess its Comprehensive Compliance Program at least annually.
A copy of the Comprehensive Compliance Program may be obtained by calling (in the U.S.) +1 984 242 1397 or by downloading the file Comprehensive Compliance Program.

An established sales and marketing capability to bring new specialty brands and generic products into the US and Australian markets
A management team and corporate culture committed to partnering
A proven product development, manufacturing, quality, regulatory and supply chain logistics capability
A flexible and creative approach to collaborations
The ability to respond rapidly to opportunities
A track record of successful partnering (some of our current partners include Pfizer, Boryung, ISDIN, Mylan, Meda and Teva)

Our Corporate and Business Development Department is a team of business development and alliance management experts who oversee the selection and review of in-licensing and acquisition opportunities, manage the out-licensing process and actively pursue strategic alliances, to build strong relationships that are mutually beneficial to all parties.

"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

Elevated Garden Beds
Elevated gardens can truly facilitate an individual’s lifelong passion for gardening all while respecting the physical limitations of the gardener them self. A standing garden or elevated raised garden can significantly increase vegetable or plant yield. By lifting the garden off the ground, the elevated planter acts as a plant protector while also allowing the garden to warm up more quickly extending your gardening season. While DIY raised beds are a popular home project and building your own raised bed is quite rewarding, our high quality selection has the grit and reliability to immediately innovate and improve your vegetable gardening experience today. It includes the reputable and popular VegTrug, the perfect elevated trough for your plant, vegetable or flower gardening needs. 


Our selection elevated garden beds and planters eliminate the need to bend or kneel and make it convenient to plant, tend and harvest plants. Enjoy pain-free gardening by growing vegetables and flowers in these fine and high quality planters.
