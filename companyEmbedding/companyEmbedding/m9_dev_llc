Upload and download speeds also depend on the mobile operator.Available storage is less due to phone software. Approximately 21 GB storage available for user content. Available storage is subject to change based on phone software updates and apps usage.
Battery times (talk time, standby time and more) are subject to network and phone usage.
A Standby time specification ("specification") is an industry standard that is only intended to allow comparison of different mobile devices under the same circumstances.  Power consumption in a standby state is strongly dependent on factors including but not limited to network, settings, location, movement, signal strength and mobile traffic.  Comparisons of different mobile devices using such a specification can therefore only be done in a controlled laboratory environment.  When using any mobile device in real life circumstances for which the mobile device is intended, the standby time could be considerably lower and will be strongly dependent on the factors mentioned above.
Note: Specifications are subject to change without prior notice.

Welcome to EKS Research and Development, LLC
At EKS, our mission is to produce safe, all natural products that contain no dangerous chemicals. Our company was founded on the basis that all-natural is better.
We have a solid foundation of using natural products in our own homes. Our products are doctor-tested and only presented to you for purchase if they meet our high standards for safety.
EKS Research and Development, LLC was founded on family principals, with trust in our products being a major component of the company.
 

 

Wanda Joy Smith, President and CEO
“On a personal level, I believe in keeping things as close to nature as possible.
As President and CEO of EKS, I feel an obligation to ensure that every product we turn out meets very high standards for quality. My own family uses our products, so quality and safety are very important to me. I’m comfortable recommending these products to anyone.”


Lynn E. Smith, Partner and CFO
“I spend a great deal of time researching the effectiveness of the ingredients we use. I won’t recommend something that isn’t safe and effective. All natural is the way to go.”
