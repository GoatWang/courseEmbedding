In the left pane, click the plus sign to expand the Local Users and Groups branch, and then click the Groups folder in the left pane.





In the right pane, double click the Administrators entry. The Administrators Properties dialog appears to list all users with administrator login access to this computer.





If your Windows Username is on the Members list, you have the needed access. If not, you must be added to this list by a Local Administrator or you must use a different (administrators) login prior to installing Sage ACT!.




 To ensure that File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks is an installed Service:



Right-click My Network Places, and then click Properties from the shortcut menu. The Network Connection window appears.
Right-click Local Area Connections, and then click Properties from the shortcut menu. The Local Area Connection Properties dialog box appears:

Click Install, the Select Network Component Type dialog box appears:





Click Service, and then click the Add button. The Select Network Service dialog box appears:





Click File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks, and then click OK.

The Service will be installed. You must restart you computer.


This will add a new service to your computer that is needed for Sage ACT! to install and run correctly. To verify that the service was installed and is running use the following steps:

Click the Windows Start button, and then click Run. The Run dialog box appears.
In the Open field, enter services.msc, and then click OK. The Services dialog box appears.





Locate Server under the Name column, ensure the Status is Started and the Startup Type is Automatic. Make any needed changes and close.



Upgrading from Earlier Version:

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Sage ACT!, please refer to the following Knowledgebase Answer:


Title: How To Upgrade To Sage ACT! 2012 From a Previous Version

Answer ID:
28235

Additional Installation Notes:

Sage ACT! 2012 automatically installs Microsoft SQL Server® 2008 Express R2, 
which requires Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 and Windows Installer 4.5 components. These components are installed for you if they are not already on 
your computer.

If you would like to check for the components before installing Sage ACT!:

Windows Installer: Through Windows Explorer, browse to the location C:\Windows\System32, locate file MSI.DLL, right click on the file, select Properties, and check the Version tab.
Microsoft .NET Framework: In XP, this will be listed under the Windows Add/Remove Programs screen.  In Windows Vista and Windows 7 this can be found in the Programs and Features option by selecting Turn Windows Features On or Off.

Sage ACT! 2012 integrates with Microsoft Outlook®, Word, and Excel®. If you plan to use the 
integration features, ensure Outlook, Word, and Excel are installed and working correctly before you install Sage ACT! 2012.
If you plan to have two or more Sage ACT! users, all connected to the same database, and the database 
is on a separate server, you do not need to install Microsoft SQL Server Express on every computer. However, be aware that SQL Server Express is needed to create 
or synchronize a database. If you opt to skip the SQL Server Express install and your organization needs to synchronize or cut remote databases, make sure 
that SQL Server Express is installed on the computer that will host the database
Sage ACT! installs its default database folder under the currently logged in user's 
My Documents folder. If you are logged into Windows® as the user named Administrator, you may want your database folder located in a more 
secure folder on your server.


Note: If you purchased Sage ACT! online or have been sent a download link and you need assistance on extracting the installation files, please refer to the following Knowledgebase Answer:

Title: How to Install ACT! when Purchased Online or when Sent a Download Link

Installing Sage ACT! 2012 Pro

If not present, the InstallShield Wizard will install the Microsoft Visual C++2005 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86).





The InstallShield Wizard continues.





If Internet Explorer® 7 or higher is not detected on the computer, you will be prompted with the following dialog box to install the prerequisite before the Sage ACT! installation will continue.





When prepared to install, the following Sage ACT! dialog box appears if you do not have Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 installed. This is required to install Sage ACT!, so you will need to click Yes to install .NET 3.5 SP1 at this time. Otherwise, proceed to Step 5.





Click Yes. The following progress indicator appears.


Note: For more Information on installing Microsoft .NET 3.5 contact Microsoft.





When the installation of .NET 3.5 is completed, You will get a prompt to reboot your computer. This message box will appear under the following conditions:

Microsoft .NET is being installed during the Sage ACT! installation
Windows Installer 4.5 is being installed during the Sage ACT! installation
You have just uninstalled a previous version of Sage ACT! prior to installing Sage ACT! 2012





Click Yes to reboot your machine. After you have logged back into your machine, the InstallShield Wizard pictured in Step 2 will appear and the Sage ACT! installation will continue. Clicking No to the reboot prompt may potentially cause errors with the installation. If none of the reboot conditions apply, then there is no need to reboot and you can proceed to Step 6.


 
The Checking SQL Server Status dialog box appears.




The Installation Requirements dialog box will then be presented, providing an estimated time necessary to install the necessary components.



If your computer does not have the recommended 1GB of RAM, the following dialog box will be displayed.



If the Installation Requirements screen indicated a reboot pending for Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2, the following dialog box will be displayed.



Ensure all other programs are closed and click Yes to initiate the reboot.
When the reboot is complete and you have signed back into the Windows user profile, the installation will begin again and you will be presented with 
the steps beginning with the Installation Requirements dialog box.


Next, the Regional Version dialog box will appear:





Select the appropriate country, and then click Next. The License Agreement dialog box appears:





Read through the License Agreement.  Select the Accept option and the Type of Install 
dialog box appears:





If you select Typical, Sage ACT! will install with the default settings most commonly used 
and you can skip down to Step 24. If you choose Custom, then proceed to the next step to customize 
your installation.





For a Custom installation, you can install Sage ACT! without installing SQL Server Express. This option is for database sharing environments, where the Sage ACT! database will be hosted on a server computer elsewhere. To do this, clear the Install SQL Server Express check box and click Yes to confirm.





Important Note: Several Sage ACT! features will not function when you install without SQL Server Express such as:

Creating/Saving/Restoring databases
Database synchronization.
Import/Export
Sage ACT! Diagnostics Utility (ACTDIAG)
Sage ACT! Internet Mail


Click Next to accept the default directory. You may click the Browse button to install Sage ACT! or the SQL Server Express (if applicable) into a different location if desired, however, this is not recommended. The Who Can Use Sage ACT! dialog box appears:

Only me - only the current user logged into Windows will be able to use Sage ACT!. The Select Program Folder dialog box appears.

Click Next. The Start Menu dialog box appears.



Take note the Program Folder name. Although you can enter a different folder name or choose from a list of Existing Folders, it is recommended 
that you simply note the default folder and click Next.

Choose the desired option and click Next to continue
The Sage ACT! Icons dialog box appears:





Enable the options that are best for you (defaults are recommended) and then click Next.
 The following SQL Server 2008 R2 progress indicator appears.





The following SQL Server 2008 R2 Setup dialog boxes will appear as SQL Server is installed:





Note: If you had previous version of Sage ACT! installed using SQL Server 2005, and the ACT7 SQL Server instance is still present on the computer, the Sage ACT! 
installation process at this step will upgrade the instance from SQL Server 2005 to SQL Server 2008 R2. The screenshot below will display "Upgrade Progress" 
instead of "Installation Progress".





Once SQL Server is successfully installed, the following progress indicator will appear and the Sage ACT! portion of the installation will proceed:





When the installation is near completion, the following message appears:





When the installation is completed, the Sage ACT! Install Complete dialog box appears:





Check the desired options and click Finish to complete the installation process. When the installation menu reappears, you can choose to install other Sage ACT! applications or click Exit to close the installation menu.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
