HMS Income Fund
  



HMS Income Fund: Created With You andAmerican Businesses in Mind.
Public offering expected to close to new investors on or about September 30, 2017.
HMS Income Fund is a public, non-traded business development company (BDC) that focuses on income and capital appreciation. The company’s strategy is to make debt investments in syndicated middle-market companies as well as self-originated debt and equity investments in lower middle-market companies.
HMS Income Fund taps the experience and resources of Main Street Capital Corporation (“Main Street”), a publicly-traded BDC (NYSE: MAIN), through MSC Adviser I, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is the sub-adviser to the fund. The sub-adviser recommends and monitors all of HMS Income Fund’s investments, targeting investment opportunities that arise from ownership transitions, strategic acquisitions, business expansions and other growth initiatives, primarily for later stage businesses. Since its inception, Main Street has specialized in providing long-term loans and equity capital to middle-market and lower middle-market U.S. companies.
There are substantial costs associated with an investment in this offering. An investor must review the fees and expenses in the prospectus prior to investing.
Click here for information on sales charges, fees and expenses.
Please note: Investors are not acquiring an interest in Main Street.1There is no assurance that the Fund will pay distributions. The amount and timing of distributions are not guaranteed. Investment income has been insufficient to fund distributions due to the incentive fee on income, which the Adviser and Sub-Adviser have agreed to waive. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of distributions were paid from net realized income from operations (before the waiver of the incentive fee on income), 0.0% came from the waiver of the incentive fee on income, and 0.0% came from distributions in excess of net investment income, which represents adjustments made to GAAP basis net investment income to arrive at taxable income available for distributions. If the advisors had not agreed to waive their fees, these distributions would have come from investors' paid in capital. Paying distributions from sources other than net realized income lowers an investor's overall return. 
2Price effective as of the Company's January 19, 2017 weekly closing. Based upon the calculated NAV, the pricing committee reviews the offering price to ensure that shares are not being offered at a price, after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, below NAV per share. Periodic valuations will cause offering price to fluctuate.

1Information about portfolio holdings and business sector diversification is as of March 31, 2017 and is subject to change.
2Senior secured loans, second lien loans, mezzanine debt and selected equity investments may be risky, and we could lose all or part of our investment. Most loans in which we invest will not be rated, or would be if they were rated by a rating agency, as "below investment grade" quality. Below investment-grade quality securities are commonly known as "junk" and may be considered more speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal.

Sales charges, fees and expenses

An investment is subject to certain transaction expenses, including sales load, dealer manager fees and offering expenses which total 11.5% and reduce the amount available for investment. An investment is also subject to management fees, incentive fees, interest on borrowed funds and other expenses which may vary based on the amount of capital raised, but could equal 6.39% annually.7
1There is no guarantee that the Fund will pay distributions. The amount and timing of distributions are not guaranteed. 2Investment income has been insufficient to fund distributions due to the incentive fee on income, which the Adviser and Sub-Adviser have agreed to waive. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of distributions were paid from net realized income from operations (before the waiver of the incentive fee on income), 0.0% came from the waiver of the incentive fee on income, and 0.0% came from distributions in excess of net investment income, which represents adjustments made to GAAP basis net investment income to arrive at taxable income available for distributions. If the advisors had not agreed to waive their fees, these distributions would have come from investors' paid in capital. Paying distributions from sources other than net realized income lowers an investor's overall return. 
3The Company may fund its cash distributions from all sources of funds legally available, including stock offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to it on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies, and fee and expense waivers from its Advisers. The Company expects that for the foreseeable future, a portion of the distributions may be paid from sources other than net realized income from operations, which may include stock offering proceeds, borrowings, and fee and expense waivers from the Advisers. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of distributions were paid from net realized income from operations.
4Past performance does not guarantee future results. Returns reflect reinvestment of distributions and the deduction of ongoing expenses that are borne by the investors and deducted from NAV such as management fees, incentive fees, interest charges and general and administrative expenses. Shareholder returns without sales charge do not include selling commissions and dealer manager fees, which could total up to 10% of the public offering price. Had such selling commissions and dealer manager fees been included, returns would have be lower. 
5The maximum sales load is 10%. An investment is subject to certain transaction expenses, including sales load, dealer manager fees and offering expenses which total 11.5% and reduce the amount available for investment. An investment is also subject to management fees, incentive fees, interest on borrowed funds and other expenses which will vary based on the amount of capital raised. 
6June 4, 2012 through March 31, 2017. Measures changes in NAV per share and assumes reinvestment of distributions. Returns are net of management, incentive, interest charges and general and administrative expenses. Returns do not represent an actual return to shareholders, rather they provide performance in conformity with GAAP.
 7Amount assumes the Fund sells $200.0 million worth of common stock and borrows funds equal to 50% of its net assets. Actual expenses will depend on the number of shares sold in this Offering and the amount of leverage employed. Expenses as a percentage of the offering price will increase proportionally to the extent less than $200.0 million of common stock is sold in the Offering. There can be no assurance that $200.0 million of common stock will be sold.

Tax reporting

1099

Minimum investment

$2,500 minimum initial investment; $500 subsequent

Investor suitability

$70,000 gross annual income and $70,000 net worth or $250,000 net worth (in each case, excluding an investor’s home, home furnishings and autos); see prospectus for specific state requirements

Sales charges, fees and expenses

An investment is subject to certain transaction expenses, including sales load, dealer manager fees and offering expenses which total 11.5% and reduce the amount available for investment. An investment is also subject to management fees, incentive fees, interest on borrowed funds and other expenses which may vary based on the amount of capital raised, but could equal 6.39% annually.3

1We do not intend to list the shares on any securities exchange during the offering period, and we do not expect a secondary market in the shares to develop in the near future. Therefore, if you purchase shares you will likely have limited ability to sell your shares. We may explore a potential liquidity event.2The board of directors has the discretion to suspend or terminate the share repurchase program to the extent that it determines that it is in our best interest to do so.3Amount assumes the Fund sells $200.0 million worth of common stock and borrows funds equal to 50% of its net assets. Actual expenses will depend on the number of shares sold in this Offering and the amount of leverage employed. Expenses as a percentage of the offering price will increase proportionally to the extent less than $200.0 million of common stock is sold in the Offering. There can be no assurance that $200.0 million of common stock will be sold. 4There is no assurance that the Fund will pay distributions. The amount and timing of distributions are not guaranteed. Investment income has been insufficient to fund distributions due to the incentive fee on income, which the Adviser and Sub-Adviser have agreed to waive. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of distributions were paid from net realized income from operations (before the waiver of the incentive fee on income), 0.0% came from the waiver of the incentive fee on income, and 0.0% came from distributions in excess of net investment income, which represents adjustments made to GAAP basis net investment income to arrive at taxable income available for distributions. If the advisors had not agreed to waive their fees, these distributions would have come from investors' paid in capital. Paying distributions from sources other than net realized income lowers an investor's overall return. 5Price effective as of the Company's January 19, 2017 weekly closing. Based upon the calculated NAV, the pricing committee reviews the offering price to ensure that shares are not being offered at a price, after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, below NAV per share. Periodic valuations will cause offering price to fluctuate.For more information, read the prospectus for HMS Income Fund. Copies of the prospectus may be obtained from Hines Securities, Inc., 2800 Post Oak Blvd., Suite 4700, Houston, Texas 77056 or by calling 888.446.3773. You should read the prospectus carefully in order to fully understand the objectives, risks, sales charges, fees and expenses of HMS Income Fund before investing or sending money.

How Main Street Capital Corporation Will Mimic Its High-Yield Peers
Main Street Capital is becoming a full-blown asset manager, following in the footsteps of larger rivals American Capital Ltd. and Ares Capital.











                Jordan Wathen
            

                (TMFValueMagnet)



            
            Mar 5, 2014 at 7:00AM
            
            





Main Street Capital (NYSE:MAIN) is the darling of the BDC industry, posting the highest total returns since it went public in 2007.
On the company's conference call, managers pointed to a new future for Main Street Capital, one that would have it following in the footsteps of larger BDC rivals.
A new way to make moneyMain Street Capital runs a number of investment funds, rolling up several of its previously nonpublic funds into one company. A diagram in its annual report helps explain the complexity of Main Street Capital -- and most BDCs, for that matter.

Source: Page 2 of Main Street Capital's 2013 annual report
But there's something brewing behind the scenes at Main Street. Whereas it has previously invested its own money in middle-market companies, it's working hard to build out an asset management business.





Main Street Capital wouldn't be the first BDC to manage other people's money for its own profits. American Capital Ltd. (NASDAQ:ACAS) owns a sizable asset manager that manages public mREITs, American Capital Agency (NASDAQ:AGNC), and American Capital Mortgage (NASDAQ:MTGE). Ares Capital (NASDAQ:ARCC), the largest BDC, owns Ivy Hill Asset Management, a company that manages its own and clients' capital.
Main Street's dealMain Street Capital signed a deal in May 2012 to manage the HMS Income Fund as a subadvisor, collecting 1% of assets, plus 10% of returns when the fund clears a hurdle of 7.5% per year. Thus, Main Street Capital is rewarded handsomely for managing the fund, which invests in substantially similar assets as Main Street Capital.
In effect, the company earns money on other people's money, which is arguably one of the best businesses in the world.
So, what's the HMS Income Fund? Some Google-fu reveals it's a nontraded BDC sold by financial advisors to their clients. The HMS Income Fund isn't something you'd want to own. The fund has all the attributes of a nontraded BDC, including illiquidity, exorbitant transaction fees totaling 11.5% of the purchase price, and an on-going, 2-and-20-style management fee. This is the fund you've read warnings about.





But for Main Street Capital, the fund couldn't be better. The high transaction fees encourage financial advisors to sell the product. Thus far, assets under management have totaled $80 million in equity capital, according to the conference call. Main Street management implied that is levered to about $120 million in total assets, which will generate roughly $0.02-0.03 in annual income per share for Main Street Capital investors.
It gets betterThe assumptions of $0.02-$0.03 in per-share earnings from its agreement with the HMS Income Fund is based on today's asset level. Main Street Capital's CEO, Vince Foster, noted that the HMS Income Fund is in a "big fund raising mood right now."
This shouldn't be surprising. Incentives are aligned to grow the fund. Financial advisors can make a killing selling it, so assets should only rise over time. Besides, Hines Securities has its own economic interest in promoting the fund, as it will generate larger management and administrative fees as HMS Income Fund grows.
On the second-quarter 2013 call, HMS was said to be raising about $5 to $6 million a month in equity capital.





The Foolish bottom lineThis fund could be spectacular for Main Street Capital, providing a new source of revenue without any investment requirements. Additionally, it could serve as a way for Main Street Capital to grow without diluting equity holders of the BDC. Previously, I noted that future growth in Main Street Capital's balance sheet may increase its cost of funds, as its low-cost, government-backed debt would be diluted with additional equity and debt.
It'll be interesting to see how Main Street Capital grows its asset management arm. CEO Vince Foster alluded that this isn't the last asset management product we'll see, saying, "It wouldn't surprise me by this time next year there wasn't another entity out there like some of our competitors are doing."
