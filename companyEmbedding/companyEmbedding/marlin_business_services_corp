			Equipment Financing
 








Equipment financing: Why it’s right for you.
Marlin is here to help support and grow your business. Since 1997, Marlin has provided customized equipment financing solutions to over 300,000 small businesses allowing them to update software, replace obsolete equipment, secure their business capital and grow their businesses.
No matter the size of a business, effectively managing cash flow is crucial for success. By using equipment financing, you can procure the right equipment through a financing plan that fits your budget, rather than whatever capital or cash is currently available to you.






In addition to the ease of acquiring new equipment, financing also offers several other benefits.
In the current economic climate, purchasing through a financing program means taking advantage of tax incentives. When you buy through lease-to-purchase options, the amount that is saved on taxes has the potential to be even more than what is paid in the first year of the lease. In other words, businesses can make money from the first day of the lease.
Equipment financing is also beneficial for asset management. Such programs provide the use of equipment for specified periods at fixed rates. If the you choose to return the equipment at the end of the period, the financing company disposes of the equipment upon the equipment’s return.
As the business environment continues to change, you can use equipment financing to better manage cash flow, ultimately resulting in lower costs, and allowing you to preserve capital using the most up-to-date technology available.



Manage your account with MyMarlin.
MyMarlin is our online account manager that allows customers to access account information, pay bills, chat with representatives (and much more) all in one easy-to-use online location 24/7. MyMarlin offers exclusive benefits to members and will also give you a sneak peek on upcoming noteworthy financing specials.

Better off somewhere that doesn't use this company


                If I had known the type of service I would have received from this company I would have taken out a private loan and purchased my machine outright rather than have to deal with them. They have an extremely slow review process; I had less issues buying a $40,000 car than I did a $4,000 used copier. Their customer service is atrocious. I received misleading and deceptive emails regarding invoicing, I requested a call back on three separate occasions and never received any calls and would get condescending and rude emails back.

Months of waiting and still not corrected


                I have tried multiple times to have our account updated/corrected and finally had to get our vendor involved because I did not received a return email or call.  The wrong lease was removed from our account and it has taken months (since Feb) to get this taken care of and is still in the process of being fixed.  Of course now I get calls asking where payment is several times last week and the week before.  Trying to be patient as Marlin gets this mistake corrected but I almost want to just go back to the the old lease and be done with this.  Really don't understand why it is taking this long to get corrected.

                It all started with the salesperson who got me the Copier and then sent my application to Marlin from there everything went well. They are on top of everything. Any questions you call and actually talk to someone.

Woud not recommend!


                The process is really easy to "lease" but its not really a lease. Theyre not upfront about cost, example: $565 loan processing fee. Rep never metioned about fee and that you cant make extra payments on the loan. Also, if you want to payoff loan early, you have to payoff the whole amount regardless of how long youve had loan.

I've had a very good experience working …


                I've had a very good experience working with Marlin Business Services.  I was opening a new business so some financing for equipment was needed and they were very helpful.  The only improvement would be that it would have been easier if I knew all the information required in the beginning of the application process.  Extra information was needed which prolonged the process.

Everything seemed easy and simple


                Everything seemed easy and simple. The I received the invoice, I was charged for Insurance on the equipment. I was not informed that insurance was needed. When I tried to contact via email I did not get a satisfactory response. Since then, I have placed insurance on the equipment, sent the information in with a payment and deducted the insurance payment from the statement. I think a little more communication was needed in regards to this issue.

Loan was not properly handled


                Loan was not properly handled.  The check that was sent to me to deposit had a stop payment issued the day we deposited it.  It took several days to resolve the problems with the equipment loan, and I am not sure it is really resolved yet.  I know it has not been resolved to my satisfaction.

It is the 21st century


                Why are your account balances not accurate when I make a payment? Also why can't I setup an auto pay using an American Express Card or at least a Visa card. You are hard to work with in this day of age.

Statement Arrival


                Our first statement didn't arrive until it was past due and now I have been charged a late fee.  I am trying to get customer service to respond to my request to waive the late fee since I received my first invoice late.

Marlin Business Services Enters Oversold Territory
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Marlin Business Services Corp presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.
