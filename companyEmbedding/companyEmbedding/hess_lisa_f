Taylor, Feil, Harper, Lumsden & Hess, P.C. is a full service Atlanta law firm that provides a wide range of commercial legal services. The Firm provides corporate and transactional, litigation, regulatory, and real estate services to a diversified business community ranging from entrepreneurs to Fortune 500 companies of all types.  Although many of the Firm's clients are located in Georgia, we also serve clients located in other states, as well as national and international companies.

The Firm was formed by John Taylor and Otto Feil, along with their longstanding partners, Lisa Harper, David Lumsden, and Max Hess,  who have all worked together for many years. Quality service, personal attention, and efficiency remain the standards that have long been associated with John, Otto, and their colleagues. As such, the Firm continues to avoid the highly leveraged law firm model adopted by some firms. Instead, we provide our clients with hands-on service by experienced attorneys who are responsive and accessible, and who work shoulder to shoulder with our clients to meet their needs and goals.

We used Hess Tent Rental for our tables, chairs, and linens. Our venue had a contract with them. They were so easy to work with and flexible. I was making changes up until the day before the wedding. They wanted to make us happy with what we wanted and worked with us instead of... Read More
 making their own recommendations/decisions. They made everything about us and our special day. They are a little expensive but they did a great job with accommodating our needs such last minute for our rain back up plan! My parents appreciated that the final payment was not due until after the wedding which worked out well because every other vendor expected final payments the week before the wedding. They were very quick to respond if I had a question or wanted to change the layout of the reception. We were all very pleased!

 Mike is great and made me feel very safe as far as the items they were proving for us, since I knew that he was going to deliver. They provided me with all the small things as well as the big ones (the biggest tent I have seen). They even did the lighting for me and it was exactly what I had dreamt up. Don’t go with anyone else if you want peace of mind on your wedding day.

Hess Tent Rental was awesome! Mike was extremely helpful and super flexible with all of our rental needs. He was very easy to work with and willing to make major changes up to a few days before the wedding when we completely changed the layout for the tent and tables/chairs.... Read More
 Mike was very prompt at returning phone calls and messages even when he was out of the office (to include the night before the wedding when he even called the tent manufacturer regarding the impending snow!). And at the last minute because of the snow, they came down the morning of the wedding to make sure the tent was secure. Hess Tent Rental handled all of the linens and portable restrooms. I will certainly recommend Hess Tent Rental in the future!
