    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs, and that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.  Unless otherwise indicated, all results presented are prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Additionally, unless otherwise indicated, all changes identified for the current-period results represent comparisons to results for the prior corresponding fiscal period.  Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday nearest January 31. We refer to our fiscal years ended February 3, 2017, January 29, 2016, and January 30, 2015 as "Fiscal 2017," "Fiscal 2016," and "Fiscal 2015," respectively. Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 included 52 weeks. Fiscal 2017 included 53 weeks, with the extra week included in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017.  On September 7, 2016, we completed our acquisition by merger of EMC Corporation. The consolidated results of EMC are included in Dell Technologies' consolidated results for the Fiscal 2017 periods presented. Revenues of approximately $9.2 billion and net loss of approximately $2.1 billion attributable to EMC were included in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) for the period from September 7, 2016 through February 3, 2017.  During Fiscal 2017, we closed the Dell Services, DSG, and ECD divestiture transactions. We received total cash consideration of approximately $7.0 billion from the divestitures and recorded a gain on sale, net of tax, of approximately $1.9 billion. Accordingly, the results of operations of Dell Services, DSG, and ECD, as well as the related gains or losses on sale, have been excluded from the results of continuing operations in the periods presented in this management's discussion and analysis, except as otherwise indicated.  INTRODUCTION  Dell Technologies is a strategically aligned family of businesses that brings together the entire infrastructure from hardware to software to services - from the edge to the data center to the cloud. Dell Technologies is a leader in the traditional technology of today and a leader in the cloud-native infrastructure of tomorrow. We are a leading provider of scalable IT solutions enabling customers to be more efficient, mobile, informed, and secure. Through our recent combination with EMC, Dell Technologies now encompasses the businesses of Dell, which includes our Client Solutions Group, Dell EMC, which includes our Infrastructure Solutions Group, VMware, Pivotal, RSA, and SecureWorks. We are focused on providing technology solutions and services that accelerate digital transformation. We believe technology exists to drive human progress on a global scale - to create new markets, reshape industries, and improve lives. We are positioned to help customers of any size build the essential infrastructure to modernize IT and enable digital business, and are differentiated by our practical innovation and efficient, simple, and affordable solutions.  Dell Technologies is committed to our customers. We believe our products, solutions, and services will help power digital transformation. As we innovate to make our customers' existing IT increasingly productive, we help them reinvest their savings into the next generation of technologies that they need to succeed in the digital economy. Our next-generation solutions which enable digital transformation include software-defined data centers, all flash arrays, hybrid cloud, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure, mobile, and security solutions. In addition, our extended warranty and delivery offerings, and software and peripherals, which are closely tied to the sale of our hardware products, are important value differentiators that we are able to offer our customers.  We believe the combined strength of Dell and EMC will benefit our customers through complementary product portfolios, sales teams, and research and development strategies. We are actively working on the integration of EMC acquired businesses, including developing a combined go-to-market strategy. During this period of transition and integration, we remain focused on supporting our customers with outstanding solutions, products, and services. We will continue our focus on building superior customer relationships through our direct model and our network of channel partners, which includes value-added resellers,  Table of Contents  system integrators, distributors, and retailers. We also will continue investing in strategic solutions and enhancing our go-to-market sales and marketing capabilities as we seek to create a leading global technology company poised for long-term sustainable growth and innovation.  As we stay focused on our customers, we will pursue the following strategic initiatives:   To extend our market leading position through our Client and Infrastructure Solutions Groups offerings   To grow our strong position in IT infrastructure for cloud-native workloads, both on- and off-premises   To innovate with winning technology that spans and unites on- and off-premises applications and infrastructure and that enables workforce transformation required by our customers  As part of this strategy, we may supplement organic growth with strategic investments and disciplined acquisitions targeting businesses that will complement our existing portfolio of solutions.  We operate a diversified business model with the majority of our net revenue and operating income derived from commercial clients that consist of large enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses, and public sector customers.  Products and Services  We design, develop, manufacture, market, sell and support a wide range of products and services. We are organized into the following business units, which are our reportable segments: Client Solutions Group; Infrastructure Solutions Group; and VMware. Due to our divestitures of Dell Services, Dell Software Group, and Dell EMC Enterprise Content Division, the results of these businesses, as well as the related gains or losses on sale, have been excluded from this management's discussion and analysis for all periods presented, except as otherwise indicated. See "Divestitures" below for more information regarding the sale of Dell Services, Dell Software Group, and ECD.   Client Solutions Group (CSG) - Offerings by CSG (formerly referred to as Client Solutions) include branded hardware, such as desktop PCs, notebooks, and tablets, and branded peripherals, such as monitors, printers, and projectors. CSG also offers attached software, peripherals and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services.  Approximately 50% of CSG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in EMEA and APJ.   Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) - EMC's Information Storage segment and our existing Enterprise Solutions Group were merged to create the Infrastructure Solutions Group, or ISG. The comprehensive portfolio of advanced storage solutions includes traditional storage solutions as well as next-generation storage solutions (including all flash arrays, scale-out file and object platforms). The server portfolio includes high-performance rack, blade, tower, and hyperscale servers. The networking portfolio will help our business customers transform and modernize their infrastructure, mobilize and enrich end-user experiences, and accelerate business applications and processes. Similar to CSG, ISG also offers attached software, peripherals, and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services.  Approximately 50% of ISG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in EMEA and APJ.   VMware - The VMware reportable segment ("VMware") reflects the operations of VMware, Inc.

See Exhibit 99.1 filed with this report for further details on the differences between VMware reportable segment results and VMware, Inc. results.  VMware is a leader in virtualization and cloud infrastructure solutions, which enable organizations to manage IT resources across complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments. VMware offers a broad portfolio of virtualization technologies across three main product groups: software-defined data center; hybrid cloud computing; and end-user computing.  Approximately half of VMware revenue is generated by sales to customers in the United States.  Table of Contents  Our other businesses, described below, consist of product and service offerings of RSA Information Security, SecureWorks, Pivotal, and Boomi. These businesses are not classified as reportable segments, either individually or collectively, as the results of the businesses are not material to our overall results and the businesses do not meet the criteria for reportable segments.   RSA Information Security provides essential cybersecurity solutions engineered to enable organizations to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks, confirm and manage identities, and, ultimately, help reduce IP theft, fraud, and cybercrime.   SecureWorks

                                         is a leading global provider of intelligence-driven information security solutions singularly focused on protecting its clients from cyber attacks.   Pivotal is a leading provider of application and data infrastructure software, agile development services, and data science consulting. Pivotal's cloud-native platform enables leading companies to transform their operations with an approach that is focused on building software, rather than buying it.   Boomi specializes in cloud-based integration, connecting information between existing on-premise and cloud-based applications to ensure business processes are optimized, data is accurate and workflow is reliable.  See Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information about our other businesses.  For further discussion regarding our current reportable segments, see "Results of Operations - Business Unit Results."  Dell Financial Services  We also offer or arrange various financing options and services for our commercial and consumer customers in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Mexico through Dell Financial Services ("DFS") and its affiliates. DFS services include originating, collecting, and servicing customer receivables primarily related to the purchase of Dell Technologies products. The results of these operations are allocated to our segments based on the underlying product or service financed. For additional information about our financing arrangements, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report  Business Trends and Challenges  We are seeing an unprecedented rate of change in the IT industry. Organizations of all kinds are embracing digital technology to achieve their business objectives. Our vision is to be the essential infrastructure company and leader in end-user computing, data center infrastructure solutions, virtualization, and cloud software that our customers continue to trust and rely on for their IT solutions. We accelerate results for our customers by enabling them to be more efficient, mobile, informed, and secure. We continue to invest in R&D, sales, and other key areas of our business to deliver superior products and solutions capabilities and to drive execution of long-term profitable growth. We believe that our results will benefit from an integrated go-to-market strategy and the result of our differentiated products and solutions capabilities. We intend to continue to execute on our business model and seek to balance liquidity, profitability, and growth to position our company for long-term success.  We are able to leverage our traditional strength in the PC market to offer solutions and services that provide higher value recurring revenue streams. Given the macroeconomic environment and computing trends, we expect that the demand environment will continue to be uneven and cyclical and that market competition in our Client Solutions Group business will intensify. However, we are committed to a long-term growth strategy that we believe will benefit from the consolidation trends that are occurring in our markets. Our Client Solutions Group offerings remain an important element of our strategy, generating strong cash flow and opportunities for cross-selling of complementary solutions.  We expect that our Infrastructure Solutions Group will continue to be adversely affected by declines in the traditional storage and server markets. Cloud-native applications are expected to continue as a primary growth driver in the infrastructure market as IT organizations increasingly become multi-cloud environments. We believe the complementary cloud solutions across our business, created through our combination with EMC, strongly position us to meet these demands for our customers who are increasingly looking to leverage cloud-based computing. Further, we will be able to provide new and more robust storage and data center solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We also continue to be impacted by the emerging trends of enterprises deploying software-defined storage, hyper-converged, and modular solutions based on server-centric architectures.  Table of Contents  We have leading solutions in these categories through our Dell EMC and VMware data center offerings. In addition, through our research and development efforts, we expect to develop new solutions in this rapidly changing industry that we believe will enable us to continue to provide superior solutions to our customers.  We manage our business on a U.S. dollar basis. However, we have a large global presence, generating approximately 50% of our revenue by sales to customers outside of the United States during Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016. Our revenues, therefore, can be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We utilize a comprehensive hedging strategy intended to mitigate the impact of foreign currency volatility over time, and we adjust pricing when possible to further minimize foreign currency impacts. The percentage of our revenues generated in regions outside of the United States did not change substantially as a result of the EMC merger transaction.  EMC Merger Transaction  As described in Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, on September 7, 2016, a merger subsidiary of Dell Technologies merged with and into EMC Corporation, with EMC Corporation surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dell Technologies.  At the effective time of the EMC merger transaction, each share of EMC common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the EMC merger transaction (other than shares owned by Dell Technologies, our merger subsidiary, EMC, or any of EMC's wholly-owned subsidiaries, and other than shares with respect to which EMC's shareholders are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights) was converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, consisting of (1) $24.05 in cash, without interest, and (2) 0.11146 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of Dell Technologies designated as Class V Common Stock equal to the quotient  Each currently outstanding EMC stock option vested and became fully exercisable prior to 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last trading day prior to the effective time of the EMC merger transaction, referred to as the vesting effective time of the merger. Each EMC stock option that remained outstanding immediately prior to the vesting effective time of the merger was automatically exercised immediately prior to the vesting effective time of the merger on a net exercise basis, such that shares of EMC common stock with a value equal to the aggregate exercise price and applicable tax withholding reduced the number of shares of EMC common stock otherwise issuable. Except for any restricted stock units that were granted following the date of the merger agreement and that continued in effect as cash awards following the effective time of the EMC merger transaction, each EMC restricted stock unit outstanding immediately prior to the vesting effective time of the merger became fully vested immediately prior to the vesting effective time of the merger (with performance vesting units vesting at the target level of performance) and the holder hereof became entitled to receive the merger consideration with respect to the shares of EMC common stock subject to the award (which was calculated net of the number of shares withheld in respect of taxes upon the vesting of the award).  In connection with the EMC merger transaction and in accordance with the merger agreement, certain executives holding unvested restricted stock units of EMC, or EMC RSUs, were given the opportunity to elect to exchange each unvested EMC RSU held by such executives that would otherwise have vested in the ordinary course on or after January 1, 2017 for (a) a deferred cash award having a cash value equal to the closing price of a share of EMC common stock on the last trading day before the closing date of the EMC merger transaction, or $29.05, and (b) an option, referred to as a rollover option, to purchase a share of Class C Common Stock of Dell Technologies, referred to as the rollover opportunity. The rollover options have a three-year term and a per share exercise price equal to the fair market value of a share of Class C Common Stock on the date of grant, or $27.50, and, to the extent vested, may be exercised using a cashless exercise method for both the exercise price and the applicable minimum required tax withholding (subject to certain limitations). Each deferred cash award will vest, and each rollover option will vest and thereby become exercisable, on the same schedule as the EMC RSU for which they were exchanged (with any performance-vesting condition deemed satisfied at the target level of performance upon the closing of the EMC merger transaction). We issued, pursuant to the rollover opportunity, options to purchase 1,779,072 shares of Class C Common Stock.  In addition, in connection with the EMC merger transaction and in accordance with the merger agreement, certain EMC executives were given the opportunity to purchase, for cash and at fair market value, shares of Class C Common Stock. We issued, pursuant to this cash investment opportunity, 152,724 shares of Class C Common Stock, for a purchase price equal to $27.50 per share, resulting in aggregate cash consideration to us of approximately $4.2 million.  Table of Contents  In connection with the EMC merger transaction, all principal, accrued but unpaid interest, fees, and other amounts (other than certain contingent obligations) outstanding at the effective time of the EMC merger transaction under EMC's unsecured revolving credit facility, Dell's asset-based revolving credit facility, and Dell's term facilities were repaid in full substantially concurrently with the closing, and all commitments to lend and guarantees and security interests, as applicable, in connection therewith were terminated or released. The aggregate amounts of principal, interest, and premium necessary to redeem in full the outstanding $1.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior First Lien Notes due 2020 co-issued by Dell International and Denali Finance Corp. were deposited with the trustee for such notes, and such notes were thereby satisfied and discharged, substantially concurrently with the effective time of the EMC merger transaction. All of Dell's other outstanding senior notes and all of EMC's outstanding senior notes remained outstanding after the effective time of the EMC merger transaction in accordance with their respective terms.  Dell Technologies financed the EMC merger transaction, repayment of the foregoing indebtedness of EMC and Dell outstanding as of the closing of the EMC merger transaction, and the payment of related fees and expenses with debt financing arrangements in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $45.9 billion, equity financing arrangements of approximately $4.4 billion, and cash on hand of approximately $7.8 billion.  See Note 3, Note 5, and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding the EMC merger transaction and the related financing transactions.  Divestitures  Dell Services Divestiture - On March 27, 2016, Dell Inc. entered into a definitive agreement with NTT Data International L.L.C. to divest substantially all of Dell Services. On November 2, 2016, the parties closed substantially all of the transaction. At the completion of the sale, we received total cash consideration of approximately $3.0 billion, resulting in a gain on sale, net of tax, of approximately $1.7 billion.  Dell Software Group Divestiture - On June 19, 2016, Dell Inc. entered into a definitive agreement with Francisco Partners and Elliot Management Corporation to divest substantially all of DSG. On October 31, 2016, the parties closed the transaction. At the completion of the sale, we received total cash consideration of approximately $2.4 billion, resulting in a gain on sale, net of tax, of approximately $0.6 billion.  ECD Divestiture - On September 12, 2016, EMC Corporation entered into a definitive agreement with OpenText Corporation to divest the Dell EMC Enterprise Content Division. On January 23, 2017, the parties closed the transaction. At the completion of the sale, we received total cash consideration of approximately $1.6 billion, resulting in a loss on sale, net of tax, of approximately $0.4 billion.  Discontinued Operations Presentation - The results of Dell Services, DSG, and ECD, as well as the related gains or losses on sale, are presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), and as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented, except as otherwise indicated. Further, we have reclassified the related assets and liabilities as held for sale in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of January 29, 2016. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding these discontinued operations.  Going-Private Transaction  On October 29, 2013, Dell was acquired by Dell Technologies in a merger transaction pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of February 5, 2013, as amended. Dell Technologies is a Delaware corporation owned by Michael S. Dell, a separate property trust for the benefit of Mr. Dell's wife, investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake Partners (a global private equity firm), investment funds affiliated with MSD Partners, L.P., members of Dell's management, and other investors. Mr. Dell serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dell Technologies and Dell.  Table of Contents  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  In this management's discussion and analysis we use supplemental measures of our performance which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP product net revenue; non-GAAP services net revenue; non-GAAP net revenue; non-GAAP product gross margin; non-GAAP services gross margin; non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP operating expenses; non-GAAP operating income; non-GAAP net income from continuing operations; earnings before interest and other, net, taxes, depreciation and amortization, referred to as EBITDA; and adjusted EBITDA.  We use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons.  There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.  Non-GAAP product net revenue, non-GAAP services net revenue, non-GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP product gross margin, non-GAAP services gross margin, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP net income from continuing operations, as defined by us, exclude the impact of purchase accounting, amortization of intangible assets, transaction-related expenses, other corporate expenses, and for non-GAAP net income, an aggregate adjustment for income taxes. As the excluded items have a material impact on our financial results, our management compensates for this limitation by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures supplementally or for projections when comparable GAAP financial measures are not available. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for net revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, or net income prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis.  Reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented below. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. See the discussion below for more information on each of the excluded items as well as our reasons for excluding them from our non-GAAP results. In future fiscal periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items. Accordingly, the exclusion of these items and other similar items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual.  The following is a summary of the items excluded from the most comparable GAAP financial measures to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures:  . . .

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2016 included in the proxy statement/prospectus dated June 6, 2016 forming part of our registration statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-208529) and the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs, and that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.  Unless otherwise indicated, all results presented are prepared in in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. Additionally, unless otherwise indicated, all changes identified for the current-period results represent comparisons to results for the prior corresponding fiscal period.  Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday nearest January 31. We refer to our fiscal years ended February 3, 2017 and January 29, 2016 as "Fiscal 2017" and "Fiscal 2016", respectively. Fiscal 2016 included 52 weeks. Fiscal 2017 will include 53 weeks, with the extra week to be included in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017.  We changed our name from Denali Holding Inc. to Dell Technologies Inc. on August 25, 2016. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this management's discussion and analysis to "we," "us," "our," and "Dell Technologies" mean Dell Technologies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, and references to "Dell" mean Dell Inc. and Dell Inc.'s consolidated subsidiaries.  On March 27, 2016, Dell entered into a definitive agreement with NTT Data International L.L.C. to sell substantially all of Dell Services for cash consideration of approximately $3.1 billion. On June 19, 2016, Dell entered into a definitive agreement with Francisco Partners and Elliot Management Corporation to sell substantially all of Dell Software Group for cash consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. Accordingly, the results of operations of Dell Services and Dell Software Group have been excluded from the results of continuing operations in the periods presented in this management's discussion and analysis.  INTRODUCTION  We are a leading provider of scalable IT solutions enabling customers to be more efficient, mobile, informed, and secure. We built our reputation through listening to customers and developing solutions that meet their needs. Several years ago, we initiated a broad transformation of our company to become the leading provider of scalable information technology solutions. We are positioned to help customers of any size with the essential infrastructure to modernize IT and enable digital business, differentiated by our practical innovation and efficient, simple, and affordable solutions.  Our announcement in October 2015 of our agreement to combine with EMC evidences our intention to accelerate this strategy. The combined strength of Dell and EMC will benefit our customers through complementary product portfolios, sales teams, and research and development strategies. During this time of transition, we remain focused on supporting our customers with outstanding products, services and solutions. We will continue to build superior customer relationships through our direct model and our network of channel partners, which includes value-added resellers, system integrators, distributors, and retailers. We will invest in strategic solutions and enhance our go-to-market sales and marketing capabilities to create a leading global technology company poised for long-term sustainable growth and innovation.  A key component of our strategic transformation is to shift our product and solutions portfolio to offerings that provide higher-value and recurring revenue streams over time. As part of this strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our offerings through strategic investments and acquisitions that will complement our existing portfolio of solutions. As we innovate to make our customers' existing IT increasingly productive, we help them reinvest their savings into the next generation of technologies that they need to succeed in the digital economy of a hyper-connected world. These solutions include digital transformation, software-defined data centers, hybrid cloud, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure, mobile, and security. In addition, our extended warranty and delivery offerings, and software and peripherals, which are closely tied to the sale of our hardware  Table of Contents  products, are important value differentiators that we are able to offer our customers. Our Client Solutions offerings are an important element of our strategy, and we believe the strategic expansion of this business is critical to our long-term success.  We operate a diversified business model with the majority of our net revenue and operating income derived from commercial clients (large enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses, and public sector customers). We have a large global presence across the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Asia, and other geographic regions with approximately 50% of our revenue generated by sales to customers outside of the United States during the first six months of Fiscal 2017 and the first six months of Fiscal 2016. We continue to view emerging markets, which include the vast majority of the world's population, as a long-term growth opportunity. Accordingly, we continue to pursue the development of technology solutions that meet the needs of these markets.  Products and Services Before the EMC Merger  We design, develop, manufacture, market, sell and support a wide range of products and services. We are organized into the following product and services business units, which are our reportable segments: Client Solutions and Enterprise Solutions Group. Due to our pending divestitures of Dell Services and Dell Software Group, the results of these businesses have been excluded from this Management's Discussion and Analysis for all periods presented, except as otherwise indicated. See "Divestitures" below for more information regarding the sale of Dell Services and Dell Software Group.   Client Solutions - Client Solutions offerings include branded hardware, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and tablets, and branded peripherals, such as monitors, printers and projectors, as well as third-party software and peripherals. Our computing devices are designed with our commercial and consumer customers' needs in mind, and we seek to optimize performance, reliability, manageability, design, and security. In addition to the traditional PC business, we also have a portfolio of end-to-end thin client offerings that is well-positioned to benefit from the growth trends in cloud computing. Client Solutions hardware and services also provide the architecture required for connected ecosystems to securely and efficiently capture massive amounts of data for analytics and actionable insights for commercial customers, as the "Internet of things" (IoT) becomes an increasing part of the IT environment.  Generally, over half of Client Solutions revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, referred to as EMEA, and Asia Pacific and Japan, referred to as APJ.   Enterprise Solutions Group - Enterprise Solutions Group, or ESG, includes servers, networking, and storage, as well as services and third-party software and peripherals that are closely tied to the sale of ESG hardware. Generally, over half of ESG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in EMEA and APJ.  We also offer or arrange various financing options and services for our commercial and consumer customers in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Mexico through DFS and its affiliates. DFS services include originating, collecting, and servicing customer receivables primarily related to the purchase of Dell products. The results of these operations are allocated to our segments based on the underlying product or service financed.  On April 27, 2016, SecureWorks completed a registered underwritten initial public offering, or IPO, of its Class A common stock. As of July 29, 2016, Dell Technologies held approximately 86.8% of the outstanding equity interest in SecureWorks, which represented approximately 98.5% of the combined voting power of both classes of the SecureWorks common stock outstanding. The results of the SecureWorks operations are recorded in Corporate. See Note 12 and Note 15 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information.  For further discussion regarding our current reportable segments, see "Results of Operations - Product and Services Business Units."  Table of Contents  Products and Services After the EMC Merger  We describe below what we currently expect will be the product and services business units, and reportable segments, of our company after the EMC merger is completed.   Client Solutions -The Client Solutions business will consist of our existing Client Solutions business unit. Client Solutions offerings include branded hardware, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and tablets, and branded peripherals, such as monitors, printers and projectors, as well as third-party software and peripherals. Our computing devices are designed with our commercial and consumer customers' needs in mind, and we seek to optimize performance, reliability, manageability, design and security. In addition to the traditional PC business, we also have a portfolio of end-to-end thin client offerings that is well-positioned to benefit from the growth trends in cloud computing. Client Solutions hardware and services also provide the architecture to enable the IoT and connected ecosystems to securely and efficiently capture massive amounts of data for analytics and actionable insights for commercial customers. We will also offer attached software, peripherals and services, including support and deployment, configuration and extended warranty services as well as financing options and services offered by Dell Financial Services.   Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) - EMC's Information Storage segment and our existing Enterprise Solutions Group will be merged to create the Infrastructure Solutions Group. The Infrastructure Solutions Group will enable the digital transformation of our enterprise customers through our trusted hybrid cloud and big data solutions which are built upon a modern data center infrastructure that incorporates industry-leading converged infrastructure and storage technologies. The comprehensive portfolio of advanced storage solutions will include traditional storage solutions as well as next-generation storage solutions (including all flash arrays, scale out file and object platforms and other solutions). The server portfolio will include high-performance rack, blade, tower, and hyperscale servers. The networking portfolio will help business customers transform and modernize their infrastructure, mobilize and enrich end-user experiences, and accelerate business applications and processes. In addition, combining in the Infrastructure Solutions Group the strengths of our Enterprise Solutions Group and EMC's strengths in core server and storage solutions will enable us to offer leading converged and hyper-converged solutions, which will allow our customers to accelerate their IT transformation by buying scalable integrated IT solutions instead of building and assembling their own IT platforms. Similar to Client Solutions, the Infrastructure Solutions Group will also offer attached software, peripherals and services, including support and deployment, configuration and extended warranty services as well as financing options and services offered by Dell Financial Services.  The Infrastructure Solutions Group will also include Virtustream product and service offerings. Virtustream's cloud software and infrastructure-as-a-service solutions enable customers to migrate, run and manage mission-critical applications in cloud-based IT environments, and represents a critical element of our strategy to help customers move their applications to a cloud-based IT infrastructure.

                                         is a leader in virtualization and cloud infrastructure solutions, which enable organizations to leverage synergies and manage IT resources across complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments. VMware has expanded beyond its core business of compute virtualization to offer a broad portfolio of virtualization technologies across three main product groups: software-defined data center, hybrid cloud computing and end-user computing. VMware's software-defined data center includes the fundamental compute layer for the data center (vSphere); storage and availability to offer cost-effective holistic data storage and protection options (Virtual SAN); network and security (VMware NSX); and management and automation (vRealize) products. VMware provides two offerings, VMware vCloud Air Network Service Providers (vCAN) and VMware vCloud Air, that enable companies to consume off-premise vSphere-based computing capacity. VMware's end-user computing offerings (such as AirWatch mobile solutions and Horizon application and desktop virtualization solutions) enable IT organizations to efficiently deliver more secure access to applications, data and devices for their end users by leveraging VMware's software-defined data center solutions to extend the value of virtualization from data centers to devices.  After the EMC merger is completed, our other businesses, described below, will primarily consist of product and service offerings of RSA, Enterprise Content Division, SecureWorks, Pivotal, and Boomi. These businesses will not be classified as reportable segments, either individually or collectively, as the results of the businesses do not meet the criteria for reportable segments and are not material to our overall results.   RSA provides essential cybersecurity solutions engineered to enable organizations to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks, confirm and manage identities, and, ultimately, help reduce IP theft, fraud, and cybercrime.   Enterprise Content Division provides enterprise software and cloud solutions that help organizations leverage their business content throughout its lifecycle.

                                         is a leading global provider of intelligence-driven information security solutions exclusively focused on protecting its clients from cyber attacks.   Pivotal is a leading provider of application and data infrastructure software, agile development services, and data science consulting.   Boomi specializes in cloud-based integration, connecting information between existing on-premise and cloud-based applications to ensure business processes are optimized, data is accurate and workflow is reliable.  Business Trends and Challenges  We are seeing an unprecedented rate of change in the IT industry, but our strategy remains focused on being a leading provider of scalable end-to-end technology solutions. We accelerate results for our customers by enabling them to be more efficient, mobile, informed, and secure. We continue to invest in R&D, sales, and other key areas of our business to deliver superior products and solution capabilities and to drive execution of long-term profitable growth. We believe that our results will improve over time in connection with the productivity initiatives directed at our salesforce and as a result of our differentiated products and solutions capabilities. We intend to continue to execute on our business model and seek to balance liquidity, profitability, and growth to position our company for long-term success.  We are able to leverage our traditional strength in the PC market to offer solutions and services that provide higher value recurring revenue streams. We anticipate that the demand environment will continue to be uneven and expect intensifying market competition in our Client Solutions business, given the macroeconomic environment and computing trends. However, we are committed to a long-term growth strategy that we believe will benefit from the consolidation trends that are occurring in the market. Our Client Solutions offerings remain an important element of our strategy, generating strong cash flow and opportunities for cross-selling of complementary solutions.  We expect that our ESG business, which will be referred to as ISG after the EMC merger, will continue to be adversely affected by declines in the traditional storage market. Through our combination with EMC, we will be able to provide new and more robust storage and data center solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We also anticipate significant growth in demand for cloud offerings. We believe the complementary cloud solutions of Dell and EMC strongly position us to meet these demands for our customers who are increasingly looking to leverage the cloud. In addition, we also continue to be impacted by the emerging trends of enterprises deploying software-defined storage, hyper-converged, and modular solutions based on server-centric architectures. We believe that combining with EMC will complement and accelerate our overall position and strengthen our data center offerings. Additionally, through combined research and development efforts of Dell and EMC, we will actively develop new solutions in this rapidly changing industry that will enable us to continue to provide superior solutions to our customers.  We manage our business on a U.S. dollar basis. However, we have a large global presence, generating approximately 50% of our revenue by sales to customers outside of the United States during the first six months of Fiscal 2017 and the first six months of Fiscal 2016. Our revenues, therefore, can be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We utilize a comprehensive hedging strategy intended to mitigate the impact of foreign currency volatility over time, and we adjust pricing when possible to further minimize foreign currency impacts.  EMC Merger Transaction  As described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, on October 12, 2015, EMC, Dell Technologies, Dell, and Merger Sub entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into EMC, with EMC surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dell Technologies.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the EMC merger, each share of EMC common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the EMC merger (other than shares owned by Dell Technologies, Merger Sub, EMC, or any of EMC's wholly owned subsidiaries, and other than shares with respect to which EMC's shareholders are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights) automatically will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, consisting of  The merger agreement provides that each currently outstanding EMC stock option will vest and become fully exercisable for a reasonable period of time prior to 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last trading day prior to the effective time of the EMC merger, referred to as the vesting effective time of the merger. Each EMC stock option that remains outstanding  Table of Contents  immediately prior to the vesting effective time of the merger will be automatically exercised immediately prior to the vesting effective time of the merger on a net exercise basis, such that shares of EMC common stock with a value equal to the aggregate exercise price and applicable tax withholding will reduce the number of shares of EMC common stock otherwise issuable. The merger agreement also provides that, except for a limited number of restricted stock units that may be granted following the date of the merger agreement and that will continue in effect as cash awards following the effective time of the merger, each EMC restricted stock unit outstanding immediately prior to the vesting effective time of the merger will become fully vested immediately prior to the vesting effective time of the merger (with performance vesting units vesting at the target level of performance) and the holder will become entitled to receive the merger consideration with respect to the shares of EMC common stock subject to the award (which will be calculated net of the number of shares withheld in respect of taxes upon the vesting of the award). The merger agreement provides that Dell Technologies may agree with individual award recipients to different equity treatment. As of the date of this report, agreements for different equity treatment have been reached with certain members of management.  Also, in connection with the EMC merger, all principal, accrued but unpaid interest, fees, and other amounts (other than certain contingent obligations) outstanding at the effective time of the EMC merger under EMC's unsecured revolving credit facility, Dell International's asset-based revolving credit facility, and Dell International's term facilities will be repaid in full substantially concurrently with the closing, and all commitments to lend and guarantees and security interests, as applicable, in connection therewith will be terminated and/or released. In connection with the EMC merger, Dell expects that the aggregate amounts of principal, interest and premium necessary to redeem in full the outstanding $1.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior First Lien Notes due 2020 co-issued by Dell International and Denali Finance Corp. will be deposited with the trustee for such notes, and that such notes will thereby be satisfied and discharged, substantially concurrently with the effective time of the EMC merger. Dell further expects that all of Dell's and EMC's other outstanding senior notes and senior debentures will remain outstanding after the effective time of the EMC merger in accordance with their respective terms.  Dell Technologies expects to finance the EMC merger, the refinancing of certain of Dell International's and EMC's indebtedness outstanding as of the closing of the EMC merger, and the payment of related fees and expenses with up to $26.3 billion from debt financings and up to $4.4 billion of committed equity financing. In the second quarter of Fiscal 2017, subsidiaries of Dell Technologies issued a total of $20 billion of First Lien Notes and $3.25 billion of Senior Unsecured Notes, the proceeds of which will be applied to finance the EMC merger.  Other than the recognition of certain expenses related to the EMC merger and interest expense associated with the issuance of the First Lien Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes referred to above, the proceeds of which are held in escrow, there was no impact of the EMC merger on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information.  Divestitures  Dell Services Divestiture - On March 27, 2016, Dell entered into a definitive agreement with NTT Data International L.L.C. to sell substantially all of Dell Services, including the Dell Services Federal Government business, for cash consideration of approximately $3.1 billion. Dell Services includes business process outsourcing, application management, and infrastructure services. The pending transaction does not include the global support, deployment, and professional services offerings. We anticipate that the transaction will close in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approvals from regulatory authorities.  Dell Software Group Divestiture - On June 19, 2016, Dell entered into a definitive agreement with Francisco Partners and Elliot Management Corporation to divest substantially all of DSG for cash consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. The pending transaction includes DSG's systems and information management, security solutions, and Statistica businesses. The pending transaction does not include our cloud integration business. We anticipate that the transaction will close in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approvals from regulatory authorities.  Discontinued Operations Presentation - The results of Dell Services and DSG are presented as discontinued operations in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), and as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Further, we have reclassified the related assets and liabilities as held for sale in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding these discontinued operations.  Table of Contents  Going-Private Transaction  On October 29, 2013, Dell was acquired by Dell Technologies in a merger transaction pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of February 5, 2013, as amended. Dell Technologies is a Delaware corporation owned by Michael S. Dell and a separate property trust for the benefit of Mr. Dell's wife, investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake Partners, the MSD Partners Funds, and certain members of Dell's management and other investors. Mr. Dell serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dell Technologies and Dell.  Table of Contents  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  In this management's discussion and analysis we use supplemental measures of our performance which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP product net revenue; non-GAAP services net revenue; non-GAAP net revenue; non-GAAP product gross margin; non-GAAP services gross margin; non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP operating expenses; non-GAAP operating income; non-GAAP net income from continuing operations; non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. per share - diluted; earnings before interest and other, net, taxes, depreciation and amortization, referred to as EBITDA; and adjusted EBITDA.  We use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance . . .

Current operations[edit]
Approximately 50% of the company's revenue is derived in the United States.[1]
Dell operates under 3 divisions as follows:[1]

Dell Client Solutions Group (60% of 2016 revenues) – produces desktop PCs, notebooks, tablets, and peripherals, such as monitors, printers, and projectors under the Dell brand name
Dell EMC Infrastructure Solutions Group (35% of 2016 revenues) – storage solutions
VMware (5% of 2016 revenues) – a publicly traded company focused on virtualization and cloud infrastructure

Dell also owns 4 separate businesses: RSA, Pivotal Software, SecureWorks, and Boomi, Inc.[1]
History[edit]




Dell–EMC merger wordmark introduced in 2016


On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation in a $67 billion transaction.[3] It was labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[4]
In addition to Michael Dell, Singapore's Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners were major Dell shareholders that supported the transaction.[5]
On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the merger with EMC Corp., which involved the issuance of $45.9 billion in debt and $4.4 billion common stock.[1][6]
The Dell Services, Dell Software Group, and the Dell EMC Enterprise Content Divisions were sold shortly thereafter for proceeds of $7.0 billion, which was used to repay debt.[1]
Dell acquisition of EMC[edit]
The announcement came two years after Dell Inc. returned to private ownership, claiming that it faced bleak prospects and would need several years out of the public eye to rebuild its business.[7] It's thought that the company's value has roughly doubled since then.[8] EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize their unusual "Federation" structure, in which EMC's divisions were effectively being run as independent companies. Elliott argued[9] this structure deeply undervalued EMC's core "EMC II" data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies. The Wall Street Journal estimated that in 2014 Dell had revenue of $27.3 billion from personal computers and $8.9 billion from servers, while EMC had $16.5 billion from EMC II, $1bn from RSA Security, $6bn from VMware, and $230 million from Pivotal Software.[10] EMC owns around 80% of the stock of VMware.[11] The proposed acquisition will maintain VMware as a separate company, held via a new tracking stock, while the other parts of EMC will be rolled into Dell.[12] Once the acquisition closes Dell will again publish quarterly financial results, having ceased these on going private in 2013.[13]
The combined business is expected to address the markets for scale-out architecture, converged infrastructure and private cloud computing, playing to the strengths of both EMC and Dell.[10][14] Commentators have questioned the deal, with FBR Capital Markets saying that though it makes a "ton of sense" for Dell, it's a "nightmare scenario that would lack strategic synergies" for EMC.[15] Fortune said there was a lot for Dell to like in EMC's portfolio, but "does it all add up enough to justify tens of billions of dollars for the entire package? Probably not."[16] The Register reported the view of William Blair & Company that the merger would "blow up the current IT chess board", forcing other IT infrastructure vendors to restructure to achieve scale and vertical integration.[17] The value of VMware stock fell 10% after the announcement, valuing the deal at around $63–64bn rather than the $67bn originally reported.[18]

Current operations[edit]
Approximately 50% of the company's revenue is derived in the United States.[1]
Dell operates under 3 divisions as follows:[1]

Dell Client Solutions Group (60% of 2016 revenues) – produces desktop PCs, notebooks, tablets, and peripherals, such as monitors, printers, and projectors under the Dell brand name
Dell EMC Infrastructure Solutions Group (35% of 2016 revenues) – storage solutions
VMware (5% of 2016 revenues) – a publicly traded company focused on virtualization and cloud infrastructure

Dell also owns 4 separate businesses: RSA, Pivotal Software, SecureWorks, and Boomi, Inc.[1]
History[edit]




Dell–EMC merger wordmark introduced in 2016


On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation in a $67 billion transaction.[3] It was labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[4]
In addition to Michael Dell, Singapore's Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners were major Dell shareholders that supported the transaction.[5]
On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the merger with EMC Corp., which involved the issuance of $45.9 billion in debt and $4.4 billion common stock.[1][6]
The Dell Services, Dell Software Group, and the Dell EMC Enterprise Content Divisions were sold shortly thereafter for proceeds of $7.0 billion, which was used to repay debt.[1]
Dell acquisition of EMC[edit]
The announcement came two years after Dell Inc. returned to private ownership, claiming that it faced bleak prospects and would need several years out of the public eye to rebuild its business.[7] It's thought that the company's value has roughly doubled since then.[8] EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize their unusual "Federation" structure, in which EMC's divisions were effectively being run as independent companies. Elliott argued[9] this structure deeply undervalued EMC's core "EMC II" data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies. The Wall Street Journal estimated that in 2014 Dell had revenue of $27.3 billion from personal computers and $8.9 billion from servers, while EMC had $16.5 billion from EMC II, $1bn from RSA Security, $6bn from VMware, and $230 million from Pivotal Software.[10] EMC owns around 80% of the stock of VMware.[11] The proposed acquisition will maintain VMware as a separate company, held via a new tracking stock, while the other parts of EMC will be rolled into Dell.[12] Once the acquisition closes Dell will again publish quarterly financial results, having ceased these on going private in 2013.[13]
The combined business is expected to address the markets for scale-out architecture, converged infrastructure and private cloud computing, playing to the strengths of both EMC and Dell.[10][14] Commentators have questioned the deal, with FBR Capital Markets saying that though it makes a "ton of sense" for Dell, it's a "nightmare scenario that would lack strategic synergies" for EMC.[15] Fortune said there was a lot for Dell to like in EMC's portfolio, but "does it all add up enough to justify tens of billions of dollars for the entire package? Probably not."[16] The Register reported the view of William Blair & Company that the merger would "blow up the current IT chess board", forcing other IT infrastructure vendors to restructure to achieve scale and vertical integration.[17] The value of VMware stock fell 10% after the announcement, valuing the deal at around $63–64bn rather than the $67bn originally reported.[18]

History[edit]
Main article: History of Dell




Dell's first logo from 1984 to 1989






Dell's former logo from 1989 to 2010


In 1984, at the age of 19, with $1,000 in capital from his family, Michael Dell founded PC's Limited, a seller of IBM PC compatible computers, while a student of the University of Texas at Austin and operated the company from his dormitory room.[25][26] In July 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the 10 megabyte Turbo PC, which sold for $795, undercutting IBM.[27][28] After a positive article in PC Week, the company was selling 1,000 machines per month.[28] Michael Dell appeared in PC's Limited advertisements in national magazines, asking readers to "give us a chance to show you what [its products] can do".[29] Dell's family went on to lend him $500,000 to fund the growth of the company, but the loans were repaid in 1986.[28] In late 1986, the company began operations from an 82,000 square foot factory in North Austin.[28]
In 1986, Michael Dell hired Lee Walker, a 44-year-old retired investment banker and venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as mentor and to implement Dell's ideas for growing the company.[28] Walker reorganized the management staff, was instrumental in securing the company's first line of credit from a bank of $10 million, and was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988 such as George Kozmetsky and Bobby Ray Inman.[28] Walker retired in 1990 due to ill health, and Michael Dell hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of Electronic Data Systems to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise.[30]
By early 1987, Dell's factory was producing 7,000 computers per month, each built to customers' specifications.[28] In 1987, the company had $70 million in annual sales and $2.1 million in net income.[28] This represented approximately a market share of 1%, compared to 30% for IBM, 8.2% for Apple Inc., 5.2% for Compaq, 5% for Olivetti, and 4.4% for Zenith Electronics.[28] The company spent $3 million, or 4% of sales, on advertising. Dell also offered journalists from major computer magazines the opportunity to test its products, which gave it further good publicity when positive articles were written in these publications.[28] Dell was known for its excellent customer service, with 90% of complaints resolved in a single phone call.[28] In early 1987, Dell began offering a computer service/repair plan by Honeywell for $35 per year.[28] Dell raised capital in a private placement in 1987.[28]
In 1988, The company changed its name from PC’s Limited to Dell Computer Corporation.[27] In June 1988, Dell raised $30 million of new capital, issuing 3.5 million shares at $8.50 each, becoming a public company via an initial public offering.[27]
In 1989, the company introduced its first laptop computer, the 316LT.[27] In 1990, the company opened a manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland to serve clients in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.[27]
In 1992, Fortune magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell, at 27 years old, the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.[31][27]
By 1993, the company had 5,000 employees.[28]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, sales of computers at retail stores by competitors increased significantly.[28] To complement its own direct sales channel, Dell signed agreements to have its computers sold at CompUSA and Staples Inc. stores.[28] However, selling via middlemen was not very profitable for Dell. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals.[32] Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994.[33] In 1996, Rollins joined Dell full-time.[34]
Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s[edit]
Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed in 1996, when Dell.com reached $1 million in daily sales within 6 months of its launch.[27] While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.[33]
Dell originally had its headquarters at 9505 Arboretum Blvd., in the Arboretum complex in northern Austin, Texas. In 1996, the company moved its headquarters to Round Rock, Texas.[35]
From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, Inc., IBM Aptiva, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out. The company attained and maintained the #1 rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to Consumer Reports, year after year, during the mid-to-late 90s through 2001. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999, with 16% market share.[36] Operating costs made up only 10% of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21% of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25% at Gateway, and 46% at Cisco.[37] In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.[5]
In the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers. The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built more cheaply than its competitors.[38] Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13% of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31% of the market. Dell's first business acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.[37]
Dell opened plants in Penang, Malaysia in 1995 and 2002,[39][40] and in Xiamen, China in 1999.[41] These facilities serve the Asian market and assemble 95% of Dell notebooks. In 1997, the company opened its second manufacturing facility in Texas and shipped its 10 millionth computer.
In May 1999, Dell opened a 260,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42]
Dell's first European manufacturing facility opened in 1990 in the Raheen Industrial Estate near Limerick, Ireland.[43] The plant was expanded in 1996 and again in 1999 with a $90 million expansion that brought the total workforce there to 5,800 people.[44]
By 2000, the Dell.com website was generating $40 million in sales per day and Dell's sales reached $25 billion per year.[28][27] Rollins became President and COO in 2001.[34]
In 2000, Dell moved its corporate headquarters and executive offices to the Las Cimas office complex in Travis County, Texas, between Austin and West Lake Hills.[45] The company leased 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) there, but in early 2002, the company announced that it would move its headquarters back to Round Rock and would sublease its offices in Las Cimas.[46] The subleases were completed in May 2003.[47]
In 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins's attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation.[48] In 2002, Dell started the Dell Direct Store model, opening kiosks in malls and airports in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company, eventually opening 140 kiosks.[49]
In 2003, the company changed its name from Dell Computer Corporation to Dell Inc. to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.[27]
In 2003, Dell consolidated its operations at its Castletroy facility, formerly occupied by Wang Laboratories and Flextronics into its Limerick facility and the Castletroy facility now operates as a movie studio.[50]
In 2004, Michael Dell resigned as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman, handing the CEO title to Kevin Rollins, who had been President and COO since 2001.[27] Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.[48]
In December 2004, Dell announced that it would build a new 750,000 square foot assembly-plant near Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million in incentives and tax breaks.[51] The facility opened in October 2005 after much controversy due to the government subsidies.[52]
Under Rollins, Dell began to loosen its ties to Microsoft and Intel. In March 2006, Dell acquired Alienware, which introduced several new items to Dell products, including processors by Advanced Micro Devices.[53] To prevent cross-market products, Dell continues to run Alienware as a separate entity, but still a wholly owned subsidiary.
Disappointing growth and Dell 2.0 (2005-2006)[edit]
In 2005, Dell came under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its revenue recognition practices.[54] Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by Donald Carty in January 2007.[55]
In 2005, sales growth slowed.[27] At its low point in 2006, the stock price had declined 40% in a year.[56] This led to management changes.[57]
The slowing sales growth was attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs,[58] but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.[59]
In 2006, despite expansions into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on U.S. corporate PC market, and desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32% of its revenue, 85% of its revenue comes from businesses, and 64% of its revenue came from North and South America. U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market was not buying pending the release of Microsoft's Windows Vista in 2007.[57][60] Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.[48]
Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in computer performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to engage in upselling. As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. Dell's customer service worsened as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure. Although, Dell originally was known for high levels of customer service, the decline in computer prices led to the company cutting costs.[61] Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting "got in the way," aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve customer service, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional "bloatware" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the "Dell Hell" prominent on Internet search engines.[56][62]
In 2006, Dell's reputation and earnings suffered when it was discovered that the company sold 12 million of computers between 2003 and 2005 that suffered from bad capacitors and leaked chemicals.[27][63][64] In August 2006, a battery recall as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire caused much negative attention for the company although eventually, Sony was found responsible for the faulty batteries.[65][66]
Dell 2.0 and downsizing[edit]
In the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell's shipments declined and it lost its market share lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard, whose Personal Systems Group was invigorated due to a restructuring initiated by CEO Mark Hurd.[37][67][27] At the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share was 13.9%, compared to 17.4% for Hewlett Packard.[68]
In 2006, Dell announced a change campaign called "Dell 2.0," reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company's products.[59][69][70] While chairman of the board after relinquishing his CEO position, Michael Dell still had significant input in the company during Rollins' years as CEO. With the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw immediate changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company.[71] As part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative, in February 2007, Michael Dell announced several initiatives and plans to improve the company's financial performance. These included elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of "bureaucracy".[72]
Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon its supply chain efficiency to sell established products at low prices, instead of being an innovator.[48][73] By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's relatively low spending on research and development as a percentage of its sales prevented it from developing products in more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and mobile devices.[74] Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized.[5]
In 2006, Dell established its Performance Analytics Group, originally known as Dell Analytics, in Bangalore, India. This division supports pricing, web analytics and supply chain operations.[75]
In late 2006, Dell opened a manufacturing facility in Chennai, India.[76]
Rollins resigns[edit]
On January 31, 2007, After 4 of 5 quarterly earnings reports were below expectations, Rollins resigned as President and CEO, receiving a $5 million severance package, and founder Michael Dell assumed the role of CEO again.[77][78][69]
Retail expansion overseas and closures in the United States[edit]
Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model, which was now cited as a disadvantage compared to rivals such as HP and Acer that also sold computers via retail stores. The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer certain electronics items that customers wanted to see before buying.[58] In early 2007, the company moved away from its direct-only sales model and experimented with mall kiosks and quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.[71][79][80]
In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Budapest and in October 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.[81] HMV's flagship Trocadero store sold Dell PCs beginning in December 2007.[82] From January 2008 the UK stores of DSGi have sold Dell products (in particular, through Currys and PC World stores).[83] Beginning in 2008, Tesco sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.[84]
In May 2007, Dell announced plans to sell its products via existing retail chains in the United States, such as Walmart.[85][86] In February 2008, Dell closed its retail locations in the United States, including its 140 kiosks and concentrated its retail presence on stores such as Walmart and Best Buy.[87][88]
In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, Officeworks (part of Coles Group), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range.[89] In October 2008, Dell opened its first stores in India.[90] Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with now defunct Harris Technology in October 2009.[91] In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for "Slashing Prices".[92] In May 2009, Dell and Dick Smith Electronics (owned by Woolworths Limited) reached an agreement to sell Dell computers within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand.[93][94] In April 2010, Dell announced the closure of the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.[95] In Germany, Dell began selling selected smartphones and notebooks via Media Markt and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.[96]
In December 2007, Dell launched, "Dell Partner Direct", a formal partner program for value-added resellers.[97]
Plant closures and competition from Asian manufacturers (2007-2008)[edit]
Dell originally manufactured computers in house and was a pioneer in the "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.[98] In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.[99][100] As PCs became more commoditized, Dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers.
In 2007, the laptop segment was the fastest-growing segment of the PC market, but Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing laptop sales in big box stores.[101][56] Dell was getting trapped in the commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.[58]
In May 2007, Dell moved desktop and PowerEdge server manufacturing for the South American market from the Eldorado do Sul, Brazil plant opened in 1999, to a new plant in Hortolândia.[102][103]
In January 2008, the company announced the shutdown of its Edmonton, Alberta office, laying off 900 workers.[104] In total, Dell announced 8,800 layoffs in 2007–2008, or 10% of its workforce.[105][106]
In March 2008, Dell closed its manufacturing facilities in Austin, Texas.[107][108]
On April 23, 2008, as part of a cost-cutting measure, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in Ottawa, Ontario, reducing staff by approximately 1,100 employees. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the City of Ottawa won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers and add a new building. These plans were reversed, due to a high Canadian dollar that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell's turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs.[109]
By September 2008, the company desired to outsource manufacturing.[110] In September 2008, Dell approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell manufacturing facilities, with the plan of closing the sales within 18 months.[111][112]
On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to a new plant in Łódź, Poland by January 2010.[113] The European Union gave Dell a €55 million incentive package in conjunction with the move.[114] In December 2009, Dell announced the sale of the facility to Foxconn and outsourced manufacturing, becoming a customer of Foxconn.[115] The closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland resulted in the loss of 1,900 jobs.[116]
In July 2009, Dell closed its manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42][117]
In November 2010, Dell ceased operations at its plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which received $280 million in incentives from the state, and Dell's contract with the state required it to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions. The facility was sold to Herbalife.[118][119][120]
Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's factories overseas. The Miami, Florida facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation.
Acquisition and sale of Perot Systems[edit]
In 2009, Dell acquired Perot Systems and entered the market for IT services. Perot Systems was sold to NTT Data in 2016 at an $800 million loss.[121][122][123]
Competition from tablet computers (2010-2012)[edit]
In 2009, Dell entered the smartphone market with the launch of the Mini 3i in Brazil and China.[27][124]
In April 2010, the release of Apple's iPad tablet computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs.[125] Dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android.[126] The Dell Streak tablet, introduced in 2010, was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated operating system, numerous software bugs, and low resolution screen.[127][27] InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers.[128] Dell responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets.[48] Dell also went on an acquisition spree in 2010-2011, acquiring companies in the storage and software markets including Boomi, Exanet, InSite One, KACE, Ocarina Networks, Scalent, Compellent, Secure Works, RNA Networks, and Force10 Networks.[27]
Loss of market share and expansion to other products[edit]
In 2011, with a shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo to fall to #3 in market share.[129]
The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to a $65 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2012.[130][131] In December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.[132]
In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell and Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design, Dell's customer service and reputation had been slipping.[133][134] In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13% of operating profits in the PC industry, behind Apple Inc.'s Macintosh that took 45%, 7% at Hewlett Packard, 6% at Lenovo and Asus, and 1% for Acer.[135]
Dell attempted to offset its declining PC business, which still accounted for half of its revenue and generated steady cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2012,[136] by expanding into the enterprise market with servers, networking, software, and services.[137] It avoided many of the acquisition writedowns and management turnover that plagued its chief rival Hewlett Packard.[138]
Despite spending $13 billion on acquisitions to diversify its portfolio beyond hardware between 2009 and 2012,[139] the company was unable to convince the market that it could thrive in the post-PC world,[138] and the company suffered continued declines in revenue and share price.[140][141][142][143] Dell's market share in the corporate segment was no longer the "moat" against rivals that it was previously.[144]
2013 buyout[edit]
On February 5, 2013, Dell announced that Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners, aided by a $2 billion loan from Microsoft, would take the company private in a $24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal, the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007 financial crisis.[145][146][147]
In March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn offered to buy the company;[148] however, in April 2013, Blackstone withdrew its offer, citing deteriorating business conditions.[149][150] Other private equity firms such as KKR & Co. and TPG Capital declined to submit alternative bids for Dell, citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures, and a bidding war never materialized.[139] Michael Dell and Silver Lake later increased their offer to $25 billion and closed the acquisition.[151][152][153]
After the buyout, Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Program that was expected to reduce the workforce by up to 7%. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that it was speculated that Dell might be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.[154]
India website and expansion[edit]
In June 2013, Dell India started an e-commerce website, enabling customers to order online.[155][156]
In 2015, Dell announced plans to expand its the capacity its facility in Chennai of 3 million PCs per year.[157]
Partnership with EMC (2001-2011) and 2016 merger with EMC[edit]




Dell–EMC merger wordmark introduced in 2016.

In 2001, Dell and EMC entered into a partnership whereby both companies jointly design products and Dell provided support for certain EMC products including midrange storage systems, such as fibre channel and iSCSI storage area networks. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.[158]
On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of the strategic partnership with EMC. In addition, Dell expanded its product line-up by adding the EMC Celerra NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems and partnered on a new line of data deduplication products as part of its TierDisk family of data storage devices.[159]
On October 17, 2011, Dell discontinued reselling all EMC storage products, ending the partnership 2 years early.[160][161]
On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire EMC for $67 billion, in the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[162][163][164]
EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management Corporation, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize.[165][166][167][168][169]
The deal was approved by major investors including Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners.[170]
On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the acquisition of EMC Corp., the largest technology merger in history and became a subsidiary of Dell Technologies.[171][166][172][173][174][175][176]

Marketing[edit]




The company sponsors Dell Diamond, the home stadium of the Round Rock Express, the AAA minor league baseball affiliate of the Texas Rangers major league baseball team


Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, mail-order catalogs, and newspapers. Some of Dell's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors.
A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor Ben Curtis playing the part of "Steven", a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!"[240]
A subsequent advertising campaign featured interns at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).
In 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from BBDO to Working Mother Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from The Flaming Lips and Devo who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad "Work it Out". Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan "Yours is here" to say that it customizes computers to fit customers' requirements.[241]
Beginning in 2011, Dell began hosting a conference in Austin, Texas at the Austin Convention Center titled "Dell World". The event featured new technology and services provided by Dell and Dell's partners. In 2017, the event was moved to Las Vegas.[242]
Dell slogans[edit]

Get more out of now (1984–1989)
Easy as Dell (1989-2001)
Dell. Purely You (2001–2006)
Be direct (2006-2007)
Yours is Here (2007–2011)
The power to do more (2011–present)[243]

Environmental record[edit]
Dell reports its environmental performance in an annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report that follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) protocol.[244]
All of Dell's facilities have permanent recycling centers and in 2005, the company had a reuse/recycle rate of 85%.[245] In 2006, Dell launched a free electronics recycling program.[245]
On February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its "Recycling Works" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.[246]
On June 5, 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company.[247]
On July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009. The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.[248]
On October 19, 2007, the company introduced the term "The Re-Generation" during a round table in London commemorating World Environment Day. "The Re-Generation" refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to make a difference in improving the world's environment. Dell also planned to lead in setting an environmental standard for the technology industry.[249]
In 2008, the company achieved carbon neutrality by purchasing renewable energy credits.[245]
In 2008, Dell announced that its Round Rock headquarters would be 100% powered by green energy, with 60% of energy needs powered by wind farms from TXU Energy and 40% of energy needs powered by the Austin Community Landfill gas-to-energy plant operated by Waste Management.[250]
In 2009, the company was recognized as the top brand for environmental technology in the information technology sector.[245]
In 2012, Dell ranked 5th on Greenpeace's ranking of electronics makers, with a score of 4.6/10, with the low score due in part to the non-removal of polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and Brominated flame retardants from Dell's products, as promised.[251]
In March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen calling for Dell’s founder and CEO Michael Dell to ‘drop the toxics’ and claiming that Dell’s aspiration to be ‘the greenest technology company on the planet’ was ‘hypocritical’.[252][253][254]
In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Dell the 8th highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.[255]
Criticism[edit]

Upgrade requirements[edit]
In the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily ATX motherboards and PSU to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).[256][257]
Customer service complaints[edit]
In 2005, customer complaints about Dell more than doubled to 1,533, after earnings grew 52% that year.[74] In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service. Issues included call transfers of more than 45% of calls and long wait times.[258] Later in 2006, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150 million.[259]
Accounting practices[edit]
On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of $50–150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share.[260] The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted.[261][262] It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices. In 2010, Dell paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.[263][264]
Error pricing on Taiwanese website[edit]
In July 2009, Dell apologized after drawing the ire of the Taiwanese Consumer Protection Commission for twice refusing to honor a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its Taiwanese website, which Dell claims was in error. In the first instance, Dell offered a 19" LCD panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1,900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honor the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) per customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1 million (US$31,250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price. The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes, as Dell said the company mis-priced its products twice in Taiwanese website within 3 weeks.[265][266]
Lawsuit by Carl Icahn regarding bid by Michael Dell[edit]
After Michael Dell made a $24.4 billion buyout bid in August 2013, activist shareholder Carl Icahn sued the company and its board in an attempt to derail the bid and promote his own forthcoming offer.[267]
Criticism of Dell's claims regarding laptop security[edit]
In 2008, Dell received criticism for marketing its laptop computers as the "World's Most Secure Commercial Laptops". At Lenovo's request, the Better Business Bureau evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support such claim.[268]
Self-signed root certificate[edit]
In November 2015 it emerged that several Dell computers had shipped with an identical pre-installed root certificate known as "eDellRoot".[269] This raised such security risks as attackers impersonating HTTPS-protected websites such as Google and Bank of America and malware being signed with the certificate to bypass Microsoft software filtering.[269] Dell apologised and offered a removal tool.[270][271]
Tracking of customers using Dell Foundation Services[edit]
Also in November 2015, a researcher discovered that customers with diagnostic program Dell Foundation Services could be digitally tracked using the unique service tag number assigned to them by the program, even if a customer enabled private browsing and deleted their browser cookies.[272]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
A Dell employee, Guy Chapman, who is formerly a Wikipedia administrator (JzG), was found to have been removing references on Wikipedia to competitors of Dell Research.[273]

History[edit]
Main article: History of Dell




Dell's first logo from 1984 to 1989






Dell's former logo from 1989 to 2010


In 1984, at the age of 19, with $1,000 in capital from his family, Michael Dell founded PC's Limited, a seller of IBM PC compatible computers, while a student of the University of Texas at Austin and operated the company from his dormitory room.[25][26] In July 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the 10 megabyte Turbo PC, which sold for $795, undercutting IBM.[27][28] After a positive article in PC Week, the company was selling 1,000 machines per month.[28] Michael Dell appeared in PC's Limited advertisements in national magazines, asking readers to "give us a chance to show you what [its products] can do".[29] Dell's family went on to lend him $500,000 to fund the growth of the company, but the loans were repaid in 1986.[28] In late 1986, the company began operations from an 82,000 square foot factory in North Austin.[28]
In 1986, Michael Dell hired Lee Walker, a 44-year-old retired investment banker and venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as mentor and to implement Dell's ideas for growing the company.[28] Walker reorganized the management staff, was instrumental in securing the company's first line of credit from a bank of $10 million, and was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988 such as George Kozmetsky and Bobby Ray Inman.[28] Walker retired in 1990 due to ill health, and Michael Dell hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of Electronic Data Systems to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise.[30]
By early 1987, Dell's factory was producing 7,000 computers per month, each built to customers' specifications.[28] In 1987, the company had $70 million in annual sales and $2.1 million in net income.[28] This represented approximately a market share of 1%, compared to 30% for IBM, 8.2% for Apple Inc., 5.2% for Compaq, 5% for Olivetti, and 4.4% for Zenith Electronics.[28] The company spent $3 million, or 4% of sales, on advertising. Dell also offered journalists from major computer magazines the opportunity to test its products, which gave it further good publicity when positive articles were written in these publications.[28] Dell was known for its excellent customer service, with 90% of complaints resolved in a single phone call.[28] In early 1987, Dell began offering a computer service/repair plan by Honeywell for $35 per year.[28] Dell raised capital in a private placement in 1987.[28]
In 1988, The company changed its name from PC’s Limited to Dell Computer Corporation.[27] In June 1988, Dell raised $30 million of new capital, issuing 3.5 million shares at $8.50 each, becoming a public company via an initial public offering.[27]
In 1989, the company introduced its first laptop computer, the 316LT.[27] In 1990, the company opened a manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland to serve clients in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.[27]
In 1992, Fortune magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell, at 27 years old, the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.[31][27]
By 1993, the company had 5,000 employees.[28]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, sales of computers at retail stores by competitors increased significantly.[28] To complement its own direct sales channel, Dell signed agreements to have its computers sold at CompUSA and Staples Inc. stores.[28] However, selling via middlemen was not very profitable for Dell. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals.[32] Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994.[33] In 1996, Rollins joined Dell full-time.[34]
Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s[edit]
Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed in 1996, when Dell.com reached $1 million in daily sales within 6 months of its launch.[27] While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.[33]
Dell originally had its headquarters at 9505 Arboretum Blvd., in the Arboretum complex in northern Austin, Texas. In 1996, the company moved its headquarters to Round Rock, Texas.[35]
From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, Inc., IBM Aptiva, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out. The company attained and maintained the #1 rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to Consumer Reports, year after year, during the mid-to-late 90s through 2001. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999, with 16% market share.[36] Operating costs made up only 10% of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21% of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25% at Gateway, and 46% at Cisco.[37] In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.[5]
In the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers. The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built more cheaply than its competitors.[38] Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13% of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31% of the market. Dell's first business acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.[37]
Dell opened plants in Penang, Malaysia in 1995 and 2002,[39][40] and in Xiamen, China in 1999.[41] These facilities serve the Asian market and assemble 95% of Dell notebooks. In 1997, the company opened its second manufacturing facility in Texas and shipped its 10 millionth computer.
In May 1999, Dell opened a 260,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42]
Dell's first European manufacturing facility opened in 1990 in the Raheen Industrial Estate near Limerick, Ireland.[43] The plant was expanded in 1996 and again in 1999 with a $90 million expansion that brought the total workforce there to 5,800 people.[44]
By 2000, the Dell.com website was generating $40 million in sales per day and Dell's sales reached $25 billion per year.[28][27] Rollins became President and COO in 2001.[34]
In 2000, Dell moved its corporate headquarters and executive offices to the Las Cimas office complex in Travis County, Texas, between Austin and West Lake Hills.[45] The company leased 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) there, but in early 2002, the company announced that it would move its headquarters back to Round Rock and would sublease its offices in Las Cimas.[46] The subleases were completed in May 2003.[47]
In 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins's attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation.[48] In 2002, Dell started the Dell Direct Store model, opening kiosks in malls and airports in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company, eventually opening 140 kiosks.[49]
In 2003, the company changed its name from Dell Computer Corporation to Dell Inc. to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.[27]
In 2003, Dell consolidated its operations at its Castletroy facility, formerly occupied by Wang Laboratories and Flextronics into its Limerick facility and the Castletroy facility now operates as a movie studio.[50]
In 2004, Michael Dell resigned as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman, handing the CEO title to Kevin Rollins, who had been President and COO since 2001.[27] Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.[48]
In December 2004, Dell announced that it would build a new 750,000 square foot assembly-plant near Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million in incentives and tax breaks.[51] The facility opened in October 2005 after much controversy due to the government subsidies.[52]
Under Rollins, Dell began to loosen its ties to Microsoft and Intel. In March 2006, Dell acquired Alienware, which introduced several new items to Dell products, including processors by Advanced Micro Devices.[53] To prevent cross-market products, Dell continues to run Alienware as a separate entity, but still a wholly owned subsidiary.
Disappointing growth and Dell 2.0 (2005-2006)[edit]
In 2005, Dell came under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its revenue recognition practices.[54] Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by Donald Carty in January 2007.[55]
In 2005, sales growth slowed.[27] At its low point in 2006, the stock price had declined 40% in a year.[56] This led to management changes.[57]
The slowing sales growth was attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs,[58] but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.[59]
In 2006, despite expansions into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on U.S. corporate PC market, and desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32% of its revenue, 85% of its revenue comes from businesses, and 64% of its revenue came from North and South America. U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market was not buying pending the release of Microsoft's Windows Vista in 2007.[57][60] Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.[48]
Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in computer performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to engage in upselling. As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. Dell's customer service worsened as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure. Although, Dell originally was known for high levels of customer service, the decline in computer prices led to the company cutting costs.[61] Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting "got in the way," aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve customer service, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional "bloatware" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the "Dell Hell" prominent on Internet search engines.[56][62]
In 2006, Dell's reputation and earnings suffered when it was discovered that the company sold 12 million of computers between 2003 and 2005 that suffered from bad capacitors and leaked chemicals.[27][63][64] In August 2006, a battery recall as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire caused much negative attention for the company although eventually, Sony was found responsible for the faulty batteries.[65][66]
Dell 2.0 and downsizing[edit]
In the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell's shipments declined and it lost its market share lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard, whose Personal Systems Group was invigorated due to a restructuring initiated by CEO Mark Hurd.[37][67][27] At the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share was 13.9%, compared to 17.4% for Hewlett Packard.[68]
In 2006, Dell announced a change campaign called "Dell 2.0," reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company's products.[59][69][70] While chairman of the board after relinquishing his CEO position, Michael Dell still had significant input in the company during Rollins' years as CEO. With the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw immediate changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company.[71] As part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative, in February 2007, Michael Dell announced several initiatives and plans to improve the company's financial performance. These included elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of "bureaucracy".[72]
Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon its supply chain efficiency to sell established products at low prices, instead of being an innovator.[48][73] By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's relatively low spending on research and development as a percentage of its sales prevented it from developing products in more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and mobile devices.[74] Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized.[5]
In 2006, Dell established its Performance Analytics Group, originally known as Dell Analytics, in Bangalore, India. This division supports pricing, web analytics and supply chain operations.[75]
In late 2006, Dell opened a manufacturing facility in Chennai, India.[76]
Rollins resigns[edit]
On January 31, 2007, After 4 of 5 quarterly earnings reports were below expectations, Rollins resigned as President and CEO, receiving a $5 million severance package, and founder Michael Dell assumed the role of CEO again.[77][78][69]
Retail expansion overseas and closures in the United States[edit]
Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model, which was now cited as a disadvantage compared to rivals such as HP and Acer that also sold computers via retail stores. The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer certain electronics items that customers wanted to see before buying.[58] In early 2007, the company moved away from its direct-only sales model and experimented with mall kiosks and quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.[71][79][80]
In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Budapest and in October 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.[81] HMV's flagship Trocadero store sold Dell PCs beginning in December 2007.[82] From January 2008 the UK stores of DSGi have sold Dell products (in particular, through Currys and PC World stores).[83] Beginning in 2008, Tesco sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.[84]
In May 2007, Dell announced plans to sell its products via existing retail chains in the United States, such as Walmart.[85][86] In February 2008, Dell closed its retail locations in the United States, including its 140 kiosks and concentrated its retail presence on stores such as Walmart and Best Buy.[87][88]
In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, Officeworks (part of Coles Group), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range.[89] In October 2008, Dell opened its first stores in India.[90] Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with now defunct Harris Technology in October 2009.[91] In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for "Slashing Prices".[92] In May 2009, Dell and Dick Smith Electronics (owned by Woolworths Limited) reached an agreement to sell Dell computers within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand.[93][94] In April 2010, Dell announced the closure of the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.[95] In Germany, Dell began selling selected smartphones and notebooks via Media Markt and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.[96]
In December 2007, Dell launched, "Dell Partner Direct", a formal partner program for value-added resellers.[97]
Plant closures and competition from Asian manufacturers (2007-2008)[edit]
Dell originally manufactured computers in house and was a pioneer in the "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.[98] In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.[99][100] As PCs became more commoditized, Dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers.
In 2007, the laptop segment was the fastest-growing segment of the PC market, but Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing laptop sales in big box stores.[101][56] Dell was getting trapped in the commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.[58]
In May 2007, Dell moved desktop and PowerEdge server manufacturing for the South American market from the Eldorado do Sul, Brazil plant opened in 1999, to a new plant in Hortolândia.[102][103]
In January 2008, the company announced the shutdown of its Edmonton, Alberta office, laying off 900 workers.[104] In total, Dell announced 8,800 layoffs in 2007–2008, or 10% of its workforce.[105][106]
In March 2008, Dell closed its manufacturing facilities in Austin, Texas.[107][108]
On April 23, 2008, as part of a cost-cutting measure, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in Ottawa, Ontario, reducing staff by approximately 1,100 employees. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the City of Ottawa won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers and add a new building. These plans were reversed, due to a high Canadian dollar that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell's turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs.[109]
By September 2008, the company desired to outsource manufacturing.[110] In September 2008, Dell approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell manufacturing facilities, with the plan of closing the sales within 18 months.[111][112]
On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to a new plant in Łódź, Poland by January 2010.[113] The European Union gave Dell a €55 million incentive package in conjunction with the move.[114] In December 2009, Dell announced the sale of the facility to Foxconn and outsourced manufacturing, becoming a customer of Foxconn.[115] The closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland resulted in the loss of 1,900 jobs.[116]
In July 2009, Dell closed its manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42][117]
In November 2010, Dell ceased operations at its plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which received $280 million in incentives from the state, and Dell's contract with the state required it to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions. The facility was sold to Herbalife.[118][119][120]
Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's factories overseas. The Miami, Florida facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation.
Acquisition and sale of Perot Systems[edit]
In 2009, Dell acquired Perot Systems and entered the market for IT services. Perot Systems was sold to NTT Data in 2016 at an $800 million loss.[121][122][123]
Competition from tablet computers (2010-2012)[edit]
In 2009, Dell entered the smartphone market with the launch of the Mini 3i in Brazil and China.[27][124]
In April 2010, the release of Apple's iPad tablet computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs.[125] Dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android.[126] The Dell Streak tablet, introduced in 2010, was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated operating system, numerous software bugs, and low resolution screen.[127][27] InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers.[128] Dell responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets.[48] Dell also went on an acquisition spree in 2010-2011, acquiring companies in the storage and software markets including Boomi, Exanet, InSite One, KACE, Ocarina Networks, Scalent, Compellent, Secure Works, RNA Networks, and Force10 Networks.[27]
Loss of market share and expansion to other products[edit]
In 2011, with a shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo to fall to #3 in market share.[129]
The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to a $65 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2012.[130][131] In December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.[132]
In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell and Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design, Dell's customer service and reputation had been slipping.[133][134] In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13% of operating profits in the PC industry, behind Apple Inc.'s Macintosh that took 45%, 7% at Hewlett Packard, 6% at Lenovo and Asus, and 1% for Acer.[135]
Dell attempted to offset its declining PC business, which still accounted for half of its revenue and generated steady cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2012,[136] by expanding into the enterprise market with servers, networking, software, and services.[137] It avoided many of the acquisition writedowns and management turnover that plagued its chief rival Hewlett Packard.[138]
Despite spending $13 billion on acquisitions to diversify its portfolio beyond hardware between 2009 and 2012,[139] the company was unable to convince the market that it could thrive in the post-PC world,[138] and the company suffered continued declines in revenue and share price.[140][141][142][143] Dell's market share in the corporate segment was no longer the "moat" against rivals that it was previously.[144]
2013 buyout[edit]
On February 5, 2013, Dell announced that Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners, aided by a $2 billion loan from Microsoft, would take the company private in a $24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal, the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007 financial crisis.[145][146][147]
In March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn offered to buy the company;[148] however, in April 2013, Blackstone withdrew its offer, citing deteriorating business conditions.[149][150] Other private equity firms such as KKR & Co. and TPG Capital declined to submit alternative bids for Dell, citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures, and a bidding war never materialized.[139] Michael Dell and Silver Lake later increased their offer to $25 billion and closed the acquisition.[151][152][153]
After the buyout, Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Program that was expected to reduce the workforce by up to 7%. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that it was speculated that Dell might be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.[154]
India website and expansion[edit]
In June 2013, Dell India started an e-commerce website, enabling customers to order online.[155][156]
In 2015, Dell announced plans to expand its the capacity its facility in Chennai of 3 million PCs per year.[157]
Partnership with EMC (2001-2011) and 2016 merger with EMC[edit]

In 2001, Dell and EMC entered into a partnership whereby both companies jointly design products and Dell provided support for certain EMC products including midrange storage systems, such as fibre channel and iSCSI storage area networks. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.[158]
On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of the strategic partnership with EMC. In addition, Dell expanded its product line-up by adding the EMC Celerra NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems and partnered on a new line of data deduplication products as part of its TierDisk family of data storage devices.[159]
On October 17, 2011, Dell discontinued reselling all EMC storage products, ending the partnership 2 years early.[160][161]
On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire EMC for $67 billion, in the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[162][163][164]
EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management Corporation, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize.[165][166][167][168][169]
The deal was approved by major investors including Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners.[170]
On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the acquisition of EMC Corp., the largest technology merger in history and became a subsidiary of Dell Technologies.[171][166][172][173][174][175][176]

Marketing[edit]




The company sponsors Dell Diamond, the home stadium of the Round Rock Express, the AAA minor league baseball affiliate of the Texas Rangers major league baseball team


Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, mail-order catalogs, and newspapers. Some of Dell's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors.
A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor Ben Curtis playing the part of "Steven", a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!"[240]
A subsequent advertising campaign featured interns at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).
In 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from BBDO to Working Mother Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from The Flaming Lips and Devo who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad "Work it Out". Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan "Yours is here" to say that it customizes computers to fit customers' requirements.[241]
Beginning in 2011, Dell began hosting a conference in Austin, Texas at the Austin Convention Center titled "Dell World". The event featured new technology and services provided by Dell and Dell's partners. In 2017, the event was moved to Las Vegas.[242]
Dell slogans[edit]

Get more out of now (1984–1989)
Easy as Dell (1989-2001)
Dell. Purely You (2001–2006)
Be direct (2006-2007)
Yours is Here (2007–2011)
The power to do more (2011–present)[243]

Environmental record[edit]
Dell reports its environmental performance in an annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report that follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) protocol.[244]
All of Dell's facilities have permanent recycling centers and in 2005, the company had a reuse/recycle rate of 85%.[245] In 2006, Dell launched a free electronics recycling program.[245]
On February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its "Recycling Works" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.[246]
On June 5, 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company.[247]
On July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009. The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.[248]
On October 19, 2007, the company introduced the term "The Re-Generation" during a round table in London commemorating World Environment Day. "The Re-Generation" refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to make a difference in improving the world's environment. Dell also planned to lead in setting an environmental standard for the technology industry.[249]
In 2008, the company achieved carbon neutrality by purchasing renewable energy credits.[245]
In 2008, Dell announced that its Round Rock headquarters would be 100% powered by green energy, with 60% of energy needs powered by wind farms from TXU Energy and 40% of energy needs powered by the Austin Community Landfill gas-to-energy plant operated by Waste Management.[250]
In 2009, the company was recognized as the top brand for environmental technology in the information technology sector.[245]
In 2012, Dell ranked 5th on Greenpeace's ranking of electronics makers, with a score of 4.6/10, with the low score due in part to the non-removal of polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and Brominated flame retardants from Dell's products, as promised.[251]
In March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen calling for Dell’s founder and CEO Michael Dell to ‘drop the toxics’ and claiming that Dell’s aspiration to be ‘the greenest technology company on the planet’ was ‘hypocritical’.[252][253][254]
In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Dell the 8th highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.[255]
Criticism[edit]
See also: Lawsuits involving Dell Inc.
Upgrade requirements[edit]
In the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily ATX motherboards and PSU to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).[256][257]
Customer service complaints[edit]
In 2005, customer complaints about Dell more than doubled to 1,533, after earnings grew 52% that year.[74] In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service. Issues included call transfers of more than 45% of calls and long wait times.[258] Later in 2006, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150 million.[259]
Accounting practices[edit]
On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of $50–150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share.[260] The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted.[261][262] It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices. In 2010, Dell paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.[263][264]
Error pricing on Taiwanese website[edit]
In July 2009, Dell apologized after drawing the ire of the Taiwanese Consumer Protection Commission for twice refusing to honor a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its Taiwanese website, which Dell claims was in error. In the first instance, Dell offered a 19" LCD panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1,900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honor the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) per customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1 million (US$31,250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price. The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes, as Dell said the company mis-priced its products twice in Taiwanese website within 3 weeks.[265][266]
Lawsuit by Carl Icahn regarding bid by Michael Dell[edit]
After Michael Dell made a $24.4 billion buyout bid in August 2013, activist shareholder Carl Icahn sued the company and its board in an attempt to derail the bid and promote his own forthcoming offer.[267]
Criticism of Dell's claims regarding laptop security[edit]
In 2008, Dell received criticism for marketing its laptop computers as the "World's Most Secure Commercial Laptops". At Lenovo's request, the Better Business Bureau evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support such claim.[268]
Self-signed root certificate[edit]
In November 2015 it emerged that several Dell computers had shipped with an identical pre-installed root certificate known as "eDellRoot".[269] This raised such security risks as attackers impersonating HTTPS-protected websites such as Google and Bank of America and malware being signed with the certificate to bypass Microsoft software filtering.[269] Dell apologised and offered a removal tool.[270][271]
Tracking of customers using Dell Foundation Services[edit]
Also in November 2015, a researcher discovered that customers with diagnostic program Dell Foundation Services could be digitally tracked using the unique service tag number assigned to them by the program, even if a customer enabled private browsing and deleted their browser cookies.[272]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
A Dell employee, Guy Chapman, who is formerly a Wikipedia administrator (JzG), was found to have been removing references on Wikipedia to competitors of Dell Research.[273]

History[edit]
Main article: History of Dell




Dell's first logo from 1984 to 1989






Dell's former logo from 1989 to 2010


In 1984, at the age of 19, with $1,000 in capital from his family, Michael Dell founded PC's Limited, a seller of IBM PC compatible computers, while a student of the University of Texas at Austin and operated the company from his dormitory room.[25][26] In July 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the 10 megabyte Turbo PC, which sold for $795, undercutting IBM.[27][28] After a positive article in PC Week, the company was selling 1,000 machines per month.[28] Michael Dell appeared in PC's Limited advertisements in national magazines, asking readers to "give us a chance to show you what [its products] can do".[29] Dell's family went on to lend him $500,000 to fund the growth of the company, but the loans were repaid in 1986.[28] In late 1986, the company began operations from an 82,000 square foot factory in North Austin.[28]
In 1986, Michael Dell hired Lee Walker, a 44-year-old retired investment banker and venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as mentor and to implement Dell's ideas for growing the company.[28] Walker reorganized the management staff, was instrumental in securing the company's first line of credit from a bank of $10 million, and was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988 such as George Kozmetsky and Bobby Ray Inman.[28] Walker retired in 1990 due to ill health, and Michael Dell hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of Electronic Data Systems to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise.[30]
By early 1987, Dell's factory was producing 7,000 computers per month, each built to customers' specifications.[28] In 1987, the company had $70 million in annual sales and $2.1 million in net income.[28] This represented approximately a market share of 1%, compared to 30% for IBM, 8.2% for Apple Inc., 5.2% for Compaq, 5% for Olivetti, and 4.4% for Zenith Electronics.[28] The company spent $3 million, or 4% of sales, on advertising. Dell also offered journalists from major computer magazines the opportunity to test its products, which gave it further good publicity when positive articles were written in these publications.[28] Dell was known for its excellent customer service, with 90% of complaints resolved in a single phone call.[28] In early 1987, Dell began offering a computer service/repair plan by Honeywell for $35 per year.[28] Dell raised capital in a private placement in 1987.[28]
In 1988, The company changed its name from PC’s Limited to Dell Computer Corporation.[27] In June 1988, Dell raised $30 million of new capital, issuing 3.5 million shares at $8.50 each, becoming a public company via an initial public offering.[27]
In 1989, the company introduced its first laptop computer, the 316LT.[27] In 1990, the company opened a manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland to serve clients in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.[27]
In 1992, Fortune magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell, at 27 years old, the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.[31][27]
By 1993, the company had 5,000 employees.[28]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, sales of computers at retail stores by competitors increased significantly.[28] To complement its own direct sales channel, Dell signed agreements to have its computers sold at CompUSA and Staples Inc. stores.[28] However, selling via middlemen was not very profitable for Dell. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals.[32] Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994.[33] In 1996, Rollins joined Dell full-time.[34]
Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s[edit]
Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed in 1996, when Dell.com reached $1 million in daily sales within 6 months of its launch.[27] While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.[33]
Dell originally had its headquarters at 9505 Arboretum Blvd., in the Arboretum complex in northern Austin, Texas. In 1996, the company moved its headquarters to Round Rock, Texas.[35]
From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, Inc., IBM Aptiva, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out. The company attained and maintained the #1 rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to Consumer Reports, year after year, during the mid-to-late 90s through 2001. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999, with 16% market share.[36] Operating costs made up only 10% of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21% of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25% at Gateway, and 46% at Cisco.[37] In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.[5]
In the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers. The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built more cheaply than its competitors.[38] Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13% of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31% of the market. Dell's first business acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.[37]
Dell opened plants in Penang, Malaysia in 1995 and 2002,[39][40] and in Xiamen, China in 1999.[41] These facilities serve the Asian market and assemble 95% of Dell notebooks. In 1997, the company opened its second manufacturing facility in Texas and shipped its 10 millionth computer.
In May 1999, Dell opened a 260,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42]
Dell's first European manufacturing facility opened in 1990 in the Raheen Industrial Estate near Limerick, Ireland.[43] The plant was expanded in 1996 and again in 1999 with a $90 million expansion that brought the total workforce there to 5,800 people.[44]
By 2000, the Dell.com website was generating $40 million in sales per day and Dell's sales reached $25 billion per year.[28][27] Rollins became President and COO in 2001.[34]
In 2000, Dell moved its corporate headquarters and executive offices to the Las Cimas office complex in Travis County, Texas, between Austin and West Lake Hills.[45] The company leased 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) there, but in early 2002, the company announced that it would move its headquarters back to Round Rock and would sublease its offices in Las Cimas.[46] The subleases were completed in May 2003.[47]
In 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins's attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation.[48] In 2002, Dell started the Dell Direct Store model, opening kiosks in malls and airports in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company, eventually opening 140 kiosks.[49]
In 2003, the company changed its name from Dell Computer Corporation to Dell Inc. to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.[27]
In 2003, Dell consolidated its operations at its Castletroy facility, formerly occupied by Wang Laboratories and Flextronics into its Limerick facility and the Castletroy facility now operates as a movie studio.[50]
In 2004, Michael Dell resigned as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman, handing the CEO title to Kevin Rollins, who had been President and COO since 2001.[27] Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.[48]
In December 2004, Dell announced that it would build a new 750,000 square foot assembly-plant near Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million in incentives and tax breaks.[51] The facility opened in October 2005 after much controversy due to the government subsidies.[52]
Under Rollins, Dell began to loosen its ties to Microsoft and Intel. In March 2006, Dell acquired Alienware, which introduced several new items to Dell products, including processors by Advanced Micro Devices.[53] To prevent cross-market products, Dell continues to run Alienware as a separate entity, but still a wholly owned subsidiary.
Disappointing growth and Dell 2.0 (2005-2006)[edit]
In 2005, Dell came under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its revenue recognition practices.[54] Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by Donald Carty in January 2007.[55]
In 2005, sales growth slowed.[27] At its low point in 2006, the stock price had declined 40% in a year.[56] This led to management changes.[57]
The slowing sales growth was attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs,[58] but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.[59]
In 2006, despite expansions into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on U.S. corporate PC market, and desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32% of its revenue, 85% of its revenue comes from businesses, and 64% of its revenue came from North and South America. U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market was not buying pending the release of Microsoft's Windows Vista in 2007.[57][60] Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.[48]
Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in computer performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to engage in upselling. As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. Dell's customer service worsened as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure. Although, Dell originally was known for high levels of customer service, the decline in computer prices led to the company cutting costs.[61] Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting "got in the way," aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve customer service, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional "bloatware" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the "Dell Hell" prominent on Internet search engines.[56][62]
In 2006, Dell's reputation and earnings suffered when it was discovered that the company sold 12 million of computers between 2003 and 2005 that suffered from bad capacitors and leaked chemicals.[27][63][64] In August 2006, a battery recall as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire caused much negative attention for the company although eventually, Sony was found responsible for the faulty batteries.[65][66]
Dell 2.0 and downsizing[edit]
In the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell's shipments declined and it lost its market share lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard, whose Personal Systems Group was invigorated due to a restructuring initiated by CEO Mark Hurd.[37][67][27] At the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share was 13.9%, compared to 17.4% for Hewlett Packard.[68]
In 2006, Dell announced a change campaign called "Dell 2.0," reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company's products.[59][69][70] While chairman of the board after relinquishing his CEO position, Michael Dell still had significant input in the company during Rollins' years as CEO. With the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw immediate changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company.[71] As part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative, in February 2007, Michael Dell announced several initiatives and plans to improve the company's financial performance. These included elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of "bureaucracy".[72]
Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon its supply chain efficiency to sell established products at low prices, instead of being an innovator.[48][73] By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's relatively low spending on research and development as a percentage of its sales prevented it from developing products in more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and mobile devices.[74] Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized.[5]
In 2006, Dell established its Performance Analytics Group, originally known as Dell Analytics, in Bangalore, India. This division supports pricing, web analytics and supply chain operations.[75]
In late 2006, Dell opened a manufacturing facility in Chennai, India.[76]
Rollins resigns[edit]
On January 31, 2007, After 4 of 5 quarterly earnings reports were below expectations, Rollins resigned as President and CEO, receiving a $5 million severance package, and founder Michael Dell assumed the role of CEO again.[77][78][69]
Retail expansion overseas and closures in the United States[edit]
Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model, which was now cited as a disadvantage compared to rivals such as HP and Acer that also sold computers via retail stores. The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer certain electronics items that customers wanted to see before buying.[58] In early 2007, the company moved away from its direct-only sales model and experimented with mall kiosks and quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.[71][79][80]
In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Budapest and in October 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.[81] HMV's flagship Trocadero store sold Dell PCs beginning in December 2007.[82] From January 2008 the UK stores of DSGi have sold Dell products (in particular, through Currys and PC World stores).[83] Beginning in 2008, Tesco sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.[84]
In May 2007, Dell announced plans to sell its products via existing retail chains in the United States, such as Walmart.[85][86] In February 2008, Dell closed its retail locations in the United States, including its 140 kiosks and concentrated its retail presence on stores such as Walmart and Best Buy.[87][88]
In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, Officeworks (part of Coles Group), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range.[89] In October 2008, Dell opened its first stores in India.[90] Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with now defunct Harris Technology in October 2009.[91] In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for "Slashing Prices".[92] In May 2009, Dell and Dick Smith Electronics (owned by Woolworths Limited) reached an agreement to sell Dell computers within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand.[93][94] In April 2010, Dell announced the closure of the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.[95] In Germany, Dell began selling selected smartphones and notebooks via Media Markt and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.[96]
In December 2007, Dell launched, "Dell Partner Direct", a formal partner program for value-added resellers.[97]
Plant closures and competition from Asian manufacturers (2007-2008)[edit]
Dell originally manufactured computers in house and was a pioneer in the "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.[98] In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.[99][100] As PCs became more commoditized, Dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers.
In 2007, the laptop segment was the fastest-growing segment of the PC market, but Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing laptop sales in big box stores.[101][56] Dell was getting trapped in the commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.[58]
In May 2007, Dell moved desktop and PowerEdge server manufacturing for the South American market from the Eldorado do Sul, Brazil plant opened in 1999, to a new plant in Hortolândia.[102][103]
In January 2008, the company announced the shutdown of its Edmonton, Alberta office, laying off 900 workers.[104] In total, Dell announced 8,800 layoffs in 2007–2008, or 10% of its workforce.[105][106]
In March 2008, Dell closed its manufacturing facilities in Austin, Texas.[107][108]
On April 23, 2008, as part of a cost-cutting measure, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in Ottawa, Ontario, reducing staff by approximately 1,100 employees. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the City of Ottawa won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers and add a new building. These plans were reversed, due to a high Canadian dollar that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell's turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs.[109]
By September 2008, the company desired to outsource manufacturing.[110] In September 2008, Dell approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell manufacturing facilities, with the plan of closing the sales within 18 months.[111][112]
On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to a new plant in Łódź, Poland by January 2010.[113] The European Union gave Dell a €55 million incentive package in conjunction with the move.[114] In December 2009, Dell announced the sale of the facility to Foxconn and outsourced manufacturing, becoming a customer of Foxconn.[115] The closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland resulted in the loss of 1,900 jobs.[116]
In July 2009, Dell closed its manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42][117]
In November 2010, Dell ceased operations at its plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which received $280 million in incentives from the state, and Dell's contract with the state required it to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions. The facility was sold to Herbalife.[118][119][120]
Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's factories overseas. The Miami, Florida facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation.
Acquisition and sale of Perot Systems[edit]
In 2009, Dell acquired Perot Systems and entered the market for IT services. Perot Systems was sold to NTT Data in 2016 at an $800 million loss.[121][122][123]
Competition from tablet computers (2010-2012)[edit]
In 2009, Dell entered the smartphone market with the launch of the Mini 3i in Brazil and China.[27][124]
In April 2010, the release of Apple's iPad tablet computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs.[125] Dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android.[126] The Dell Streak tablet, introduced in 2010, was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated operating system, numerous software bugs, and low resolution screen.[127][27] InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers.[128] Dell responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets.[48] Dell also went on an acquisition spree in 2010-2011, acquiring companies in the storage and software markets including Boomi, Exanet, InSite One, KACE, Ocarina Networks, Scalent, Compellent, Secure Works, RNA Networks, and Force10 Networks.[27]
Loss of market share and expansion to other products[edit]
In 2011, with a shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo to fall to #3 in market share.[129]
The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to a $65 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2012.[130][131] In December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.[132]
In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell and Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design, Dell's customer service and reputation had been slipping.[133][134] In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13% of operating profits in the PC industry, behind Apple Inc.'s Macintosh that took 45%, 7% at Hewlett Packard, 6% at Lenovo and Asus, and 1% for Acer.[135]
Dell attempted to offset its declining PC business, which still accounted for half of its revenue and generated steady cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2012,[136] by expanding into the enterprise market with servers, networking, software, and services.[137] It avoided many of the acquisition writedowns and management turnover that plagued its chief rival Hewlett Packard.[138]
Despite spending $13 billion on acquisitions to diversify its portfolio beyond hardware between 2009 and 2012,[139] the company was unable to convince the market that it could thrive in the post-PC world,[138] and the company suffered continued declines in revenue and share price.[140][141][142][143] Dell's market share in the corporate segment was no longer the "moat" against rivals that it was previously.[144]
2013 buyout[edit]
On February 5, 2013, Dell announced that Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners, aided by a $2 billion loan from Microsoft, would take the company private in a $24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal, the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007 financial crisis.[145][146][147]
In March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn offered to buy the company;[148] however, in April 2013, Blackstone withdrew its offer, citing deteriorating business conditions.[149][150] Other private equity firms such as KKR & Co. and TPG Capital declined to submit alternative bids for Dell, citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures, and a bidding war never materialized.[139] Michael Dell and Silver Lake later increased their offer to $25 billion and closed the acquisition.[151][152][153]
After the buyout, Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Program that was expected to reduce the workforce by up to 7%. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that it was speculated that Dell might be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.[154]
India website and expansion[edit]
In June 2013, Dell India started an e-commerce website, enabling customers to order online.[155][156]
In 2015, Dell announced plans to expand its the capacity its facility in Chennai of 3 million PCs per year.[157]
Partnership with EMC (2001-2011) and 2016 merger with EMC[edit]




Dell–EMC merger wordmark introduced in 2016.






Dell Latitude E5570, a 2016 model.


In 2001, Dell and EMC entered into a partnership whereby both companies jointly design products and Dell provided support for certain EMC products including midrange storage systems, such as fibre channel and iSCSI storage area networks. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.[158]
On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of the strategic partnership with EMC. In addition, Dell expanded its product line-up by adding the EMC Celerra NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems and partnered on a new line of data deduplication products as part of its TierDisk family of data storage devices.[159]
On October 17, 2011, Dell discontinued reselling all EMC storage products, ending the partnership 2 years early.[160][161]
On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire EMC for $67 billion, in the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[162][163][164]
EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management Corporation, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize.[165][166][167][168][169]
The deal was approved by major investors including Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners.[170]
On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the acquisition of EMC Corp., the largest technology merger in history and became a subsidiary of Dell Technologies.[171][166][172][173][174][175][176]

Marketing[edit]




The company sponsors Dell Diamond, the home stadium of the Round Rock Express, the AAA minor league baseball affiliate of the Texas Rangers major league baseball team


Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, mail-order catalogs, and newspapers. Some of Dell's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors.
A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor Ben Curtis playing the part of "Steven", a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!"[240]
A subsequent advertising campaign featured interns at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).
In 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from BBDO to Working Mother Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from The Flaming Lips and Devo who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad "Work it Out". Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan "Yours is here" to say that it customizes computers to fit customers' requirements.[241]
Beginning in 2011, Dell began hosting a conference in Austin, Texas at the Austin Convention Center titled "Dell World". The event featured new technology and services provided by Dell and Dell's partners. In 2017, the event was moved to Las Vegas.[242]
Dell slogans[edit]

Get more out of now (1984–1989)
Easy as Dell (1989-2001)
Dell. Purely You (2001–2006)
Be direct (2006-2007)
Yours is Here (2007–2011)
The power to do more (2011–present)[243]

Environmental record[edit]
Dell reports its environmental performance in an annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report that follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) protocol.[244]
All of Dell's facilities have permanent recycling centers and in 2005, the company had a reuse/recycle rate of 85%.[245] In 2006, Dell launched a free electronics recycling program.[245]
On February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its "Recycling Works" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.[246]
On June 5, 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company.[247]
On July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009. The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.[248]
On October 19, 2007, the company introduced the term "The Re-Generation" during a round table in London commemorating World Environment Day. "The Re-Generation" refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to make a difference in improving the world's environment. Dell also planned to lead in setting an environmental standard for the technology industry.[249]
In 2008, the company achieved carbon neutrality by purchasing renewable energy credits.[245]
In 2008, Dell announced that its Round Rock headquarters would be 100% powered by green energy, with 60% of energy needs powered by wind farms from TXU Energy and 40% of energy needs powered by the Austin Community Landfill gas-to-energy plant operated by Waste Management.[250]
In 2009, the company was recognized as the top brand for environmental technology in the information technology sector.[245]
In 2012, Dell ranked 5th on Greenpeace's ranking of electronics makers, with a score of 4.6/10, with the low score due in part to the non-removal of polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and Brominated flame retardants from Dell's products, as promised.[251]
In March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen calling for Dell’s founder and CEO Michael Dell to ‘drop the toxics’ and claiming that Dell’s aspiration to be ‘the greenest technology company on the planet’ was ‘hypocritical’.[252][253][254]
In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Dell the 8th highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.[255]
Criticism[edit]
See also: Lawsuits involving Dell Inc.
Upgrade requirements[edit]
In the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily ATX motherboards and PSU to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).[256][257]
Customer service complaints[edit]
In 2005, customer complaints about Dell more than doubled to 1,533, after earnings grew 52% that year.[74] In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service. Issues included call transfers of more than 45% of calls and long wait times.[258] Later in 2006, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150 million.[259]
Accounting practices[edit]
On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of $50–150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share.[260] The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted.[261][262] It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices. In 2010, Dell paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.[263][264]
Error pricing on Taiwanese website[edit]
In July 2009, Dell apologized after drawing the ire of the Taiwanese Consumer Protection Commission for twice refusing to honor a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its Taiwanese website, which Dell claims was in error. In the first instance, Dell offered a 19" LCD panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1,900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honor the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) per customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1 million (US$31,250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price. The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes, as Dell said the company mis-priced its products twice in Taiwanese website within 3 weeks.[265][266]
Lawsuit by Carl Icahn regarding bid by Michael Dell[edit]
After Michael Dell made a $24.4 billion buyout bid in August 2013, activist shareholder Carl Icahn sued the company and its board in an attempt to derail the bid and promote his own forthcoming offer.[267]
Criticism of Dell's claims regarding laptop security[edit]
In 2008, Dell received criticism for marketing its laptop computers as the "World's Most Secure Commercial Laptops". At Lenovo's request, the Better Business Bureau evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support such claim.[268]
Self-signed root certificate[edit]
In November 2015 it emerged that several Dell computers had shipped with an identical pre-installed root certificate known as "eDellRoot".[269] This raised such security risks as attackers impersonating HTTPS-protected websites such as Google and Bank of America and malware being signed with the certificate to bypass Microsoft software filtering.[269] Dell apologised and offered a removal tool.[270][271]
Tracking of customers using Dell Foundation Services[edit]
Also in November 2015, a researcher discovered that customers with diagnostic program Dell Foundation Services could be digitally tracked using the unique service tag number assigned to them by the program, even if a customer enabled private browsing and deleted their browser cookies.[272]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
A Dell employee, Guy Chapman, who is formerly a Wikipedia administrator (JzG), was found to have been removing references on Wikipedia to competitors of Dell Research.[273]

History[edit]
Main article: History of Dell




Dell's first logo from 1984 to 1989






Dell's former logo from 1989 to 2010


In 1984, at the age of 19, with $1,000 in capital from his family, Michael Dell founded PC's Limited, a seller of IBM PC compatible computers, while a student of the University of Texas at Austin and operated the company from his dormitory room.[25][26] In July 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the 10 megabyte Turbo PC, which sold for $795, undercutting IBM.[27][28] After a positive article in PC Week, the company was selling 1,000 machines per month.[28] Michael Dell appeared in PC's Limited advertisements in national magazines, asking readers to "give us a chance to show you what [its products] can do".[29] Dell's family went on to lend him $500,000 to fund the growth of the company, but the loans were repaid in 1986.[28] In late 1986, the company began operations from an 82,000 square foot factory in North Austin.[28]
In 1986, Michael Dell hired Lee Walker, a 44-year-old retired investment banker and venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as mentor and to implement Dell's ideas for growing the company.[28] Walker reorganized the management staff, was instrumental in securing the company's first line of credit from a bank of $10 million, and was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988 such as George Kozmetsky and Bobby Ray Inman.[28] Walker retired in 1990 due to ill health, and Michael Dell hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of Electronic Data Systems to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise.[30]
By early 1987, Dell's factory was producing 7,000 computers per month, each built to customers' specifications.[28] In 1987, the company had $70 million in annual sales and $2.1 million in net income.[28] This represented approximately a market share of 1%, compared to 30% for IBM, 8.2% for Apple Inc., 5.2% for Compaq, 5% for Olivetti, and 4.4% for Zenith Electronics.[28] The company spent $3 million, or 4% of sales, on advertising. Dell also offered journalists from major computer magazines the opportunity to test its products, which gave it further good publicity when positive articles were written in these publications.[28] Dell was known for its excellent customer service, with 90% of complaints resolved in a single phone call.[28] In early 1987, Dell began offering a computer service/repair plan by Honeywell for $35 per year.[28] Dell raised capital in a private placement in 1987.[28]
In 1988, The company changed its name from PC’s Limited to Dell Computer Corporation.[27] In June 1988, Dell raised $30 million of new capital, issuing 3.5 million shares at $8.50 each, becoming a public company via an initial public offering.[27]
In 1989, the company introduced its first laptop computer, the 316LT.[27] In 1990, the company opened a manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland to serve clients in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.[27]
In 1992, Fortune magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell, at 27 years old, the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.[31][27]
By 1993, the company had 5,000 employees.[28]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, sales of computers at retail stores by competitors increased significantly.[28] To complement its own direct sales channel, Dell signed agreements to have its computers sold at CompUSA and Staples Inc. stores.[28] However, selling via middlemen was not very profitable for Dell. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals.[32] Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994.[33] In 1996, Rollins joined Dell full-time.[34]
Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s[edit]
Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed in 1996, when Dell.com reached $1 million in daily sales within 6 months of its launch.[27] While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.[33]
Dell originally had its headquarters at 9505 Arboretum Blvd., in the Arboretum complex in northern Austin, Texas. In 1996, the company moved its headquarters to Round Rock, Texas.[35]
From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, Inc., IBM Aptiva, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out. The company attained and maintained the #1 rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to Consumer Reports, year after year, during the mid-to-late 90s through 2001. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999, with 16% market share.[36] Operating costs made up only 10% of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21% of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25% at Gateway, and 46% at Cisco.[37] In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.[5]
In the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers. The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built more cheaply than its competitors.[38] Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13% of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31% of the market. Dell's first business acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.[37]
Dell opened plants in Penang, Malaysia in 1995 and 2002,[39][40] and in Xiamen, China in 1999.[41] These facilities serve the Asian market and assemble 95% of Dell notebooks. In 1997, the company opened its second manufacturing facility in Texas and shipped its 10 millionth computer.
In May 1999, Dell opened a 260,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42]
Dell's first European manufacturing facility opened in 1990 in the Raheen Industrial Estate near Limerick, Ireland.[43] The plant was expanded in 1996 and again in 1999 with a $90 million expansion that brought the total workforce there to 5,800 people.[44]
By 2000, the Dell.com website was generating $40 million in sales per day and Dell's sales reached $25 billion per year.[28][27] Rollins became President and COO in 2001.[34]
In 2000, Dell moved its corporate headquarters and executive offices to the Las Cimas office complex in Travis County, Texas, between Austin and West Lake Hills.[45] The company leased 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) there, but in early 2002, the company announced that it would move its headquarters back to Round Rock and would sublease its offices in Las Cimas.[46] The subleases were completed in May 2003.[47]
In 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins's attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation.[48] In 2002, Dell started the Dell Direct Store model, opening kiosks in malls and airports in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company, eventually opening 140 kiosks.[49]
In 2003, the company changed its name from Dell Computer Corporation to Dell Inc. to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.[27]
In 2003, Dell consolidated its operations at its Castletroy facility, formerly occupied by Wang Laboratories and Flextronics into its Limerick facility and the Castletroy facility now operates as a movie studio.[50]
In 2004, Michael Dell resigned as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman, handing the CEO title to Kevin Rollins, who had been President and COO since 2001.[27] Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.[48]
In December 2004, Dell announced that it would build a new 750,000 square foot assembly-plant near Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million in incentives and tax breaks.[51] The facility opened in October 2005 after much controversy due to the government subsidies.[52]
Under Rollins, Dell began to loosen its ties to Microsoft and Intel. In March 2006, Dell acquired Alienware, which introduced several new items to Dell products, including processors by Advanced Micro Devices.[53] To prevent cross-market products, Dell continues to run Alienware as a separate entity, but still a wholly owned subsidiary.
Disappointing growth and Dell 2.0 (2005-2006)[edit]
In 2005, Dell came under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its revenue recognition practices.[54] Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by Donald Carty in January 2007.[55]
In 2005, sales growth slowed.[27] At its low point in 2006, the stock price had declined 40% in a year.[56] This led to management changes.[57]
The slowing sales growth was attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs,[58] but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.[59]
In 2006, despite expansions into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on U.S. corporate PC market, and desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32% of its revenue, 85% of its revenue comes from businesses, and 64% of its revenue came from North and South America. U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market was not buying pending the release of Microsoft's Windows Vista in 2007.[57][60] Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.[48]
Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in computer performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to engage in upselling. As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. Dell's customer service worsened as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure. Although, Dell originally was known for high levels of customer service, the decline in computer prices led to the company cutting costs.[61] Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting "got in the way," aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve customer service, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional "bloatware" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the "Dell Hell" prominent on Internet search engines.[56][62]
In 2006, Dell's reputation and earnings suffered when it was discovered that the company sold 12 million of computers between 2003 and 2005 that suffered from bad capacitors and leaked chemicals.[27][63][64] In August 2006, a battery recall as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire caused much negative attention for the company although eventually, Sony was found responsible for the faulty batteries.[65][66]
Dell 2.0 and downsizing[edit]
In the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell's shipments declined and it lost its market share lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard, whose Personal Systems Group was invigorated due to a restructuring initiated by CEO Mark Hurd.[37][67][27] At the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share was 13.9%, compared to 17.4% for Hewlett Packard.[68]
In 2006, Dell announced a change campaign called "Dell 2.0," reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company's products.[59][69][70] While chairman of the board after relinquishing his CEO position, Michael Dell still had significant input in the company during Rollins' years as CEO. With the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw immediate changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company.[71] As part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative, in February 2007, Michael Dell announced several initiatives and plans to improve the company's financial performance. These included elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of "bureaucracy".[72]
Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon its supply chain efficiency to sell established products at low prices, instead of being an innovator.[48][73] By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's relatively low spending on research and development as a percentage of its sales prevented it from developing products in more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and mobile devices.[74] Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized.[5]
In 2006, Dell established its Performance Analytics Group, originally known as Dell Analytics, in Bangalore, India. This division supports pricing, web analytics and supply chain operations.[75]
In late 2006, Dell opened a manufacturing facility in Chennai, India.[76]
Rollins resigns[edit]
On January 31, 2007, After 4 of 5 quarterly earnings reports were below expectations, Rollins resigned as President and CEO, receiving a $5 million severance package, and founder Michael Dell assumed the role of CEO again.[77][78][69]
Retail expansion overseas and closures in the United States[edit]
Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model, which was now cited as a disadvantage compared to rivals such as HP and Acer that also sold computers via retail stores. The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer certain electronics items that customers wanted to see before buying.[58] In early 2007, the company moved away from its direct-only sales model and experimented with mall kiosks and quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.[71][79][80]
In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Budapest and in October 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.[81] HMV's flagship Trocadero store sold Dell PCs beginning in December 2007.[82] From January 2008 the UK stores of DSGi have sold Dell products (in particular, through Currys and PC World stores).[83] Beginning in 2008, Tesco sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.[84]
In May 2007, Dell announced plans to sell its products via existing retail chains in the United States, such as Walmart.[85][86] In February 2008, Dell closed its retail locations in the United States, including its 140 kiosks and concentrated its retail presence on stores such as Walmart and Best Buy.[87][88]
In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, Officeworks (part of Coles Group), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range.[89] In October 2008, Dell opened its first stores in India.[90] Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with now defunct Harris Technology in October 2009.[91] In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for "Slashing Prices".[92] In May 2009, Dell and Dick Smith Electronics (owned by Woolworths Limited) reached an agreement to sell Dell computers within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand.[93][94] In April 2010, Dell announced the closure of the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.[95] In Germany, Dell began selling selected smartphones and notebooks via Media Markt and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.[96]
In December 2007, Dell launched, "Dell Partner Direct", a formal partner program for value-added resellers.[97]
Plant closures and competition from Asian manufacturers (2007-2008)[edit]
Dell originally manufactured computers in house and was a pioneer in the "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.[98] In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.[99][100] As PCs became more commoditized, Dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers.
In 2007, the laptop segment was the fastest-growing segment of the PC market, but Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing laptop sales in big box stores.[101][56] Dell was getting trapped in the commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.[58]
In May 2007, Dell moved desktop and PowerEdge server manufacturing for the South American market from the Eldorado do Sul, Brazil plant opened in 1999, to a new plant in Hortolândia.[102][103]
In January 2008, the company announced the shutdown of its Edmonton, Alberta office, laying off 900 workers.[104] In total, Dell announced 8,800 layoffs in 2007–2008, or 10% of its workforce.[105][106]
In March 2008, Dell closed its manufacturing facilities in Austin, Texas.[107][108]
On April 23, 2008, as part of a cost-cutting measure, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in Ottawa, Ontario, reducing staff by approximately 1,100 employees. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the City of Ottawa won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers and add a new building. These plans were reversed, due to a high Canadian dollar that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell's turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs.[109]
By September 2008, the company desired to outsource manufacturing.[110] In September 2008, Dell approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell manufacturing facilities, with the plan of closing the sales within 18 months.[111][112]
On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to a new plant in Łódź, Poland by January 2010.[113] The European Union gave Dell a €55 million incentive package in conjunction with the move.[114] In December 2009, Dell announced the sale of the facility to Foxconn and outsourced manufacturing, becoming a customer of Foxconn.[115] The closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland resulted in the loss of 1,900 jobs.[116]
In July 2009, Dell closed its manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42][117]
In November 2010, Dell ceased operations at its plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which received $280 million in incentives from the state, and Dell's contract with the state required it to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions. The facility was sold to Herbalife.[118][119][120]
Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's factories overseas. The Miami, Florida facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation.
Acquisition and sale of Perot Systems[edit]
In 2009, Dell acquired Perot Systems and entered the market for IT services. Perot Systems was sold to NTT Data in 2016 at an $800 million loss.[121][122][123]
Competition from tablet computers (2010-2012)[edit]
In 2009, Dell entered the smartphone market with the launch of the Mini 3i in Brazil and China.[27][124]
In April 2010, the release of Apple's iPad tablet computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs.[125] Dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android.[126] The Dell Streak tablet, introduced in 2010, was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated operating system, numerous software bugs, and low resolution screen.[127][27] InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers.[128] Dell responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets.[48] Dell also went on an acquisition spree in 2010-2011, acquiring companies in the storage and software markets including Boomi, Exanet, InSite One, KACE, Ocarina Networks, Scalent, Compellent, Secure Works, RNA Networks, and Force10 Networks.[27]
Loss of market share and expansion to other products[edit]
In 2011, with a shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo to fall to #3 in market share.[129]
The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to a $65 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2012.[130][131] In December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.[132]
In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell and Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design, Dell's customer service and reputation had been slipping.[133][134] In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13% of operating profits in the PC industry, behind Apple Inc.'s Macintosh that took 45%, 7% at Hewlett Packard, 6% at Lenovo and Asus, and 1% for Acer.[135]
Dell attempted to offset its declining PC business, which still accounted for half of its revenue and generated steady cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2012,[136] by expanding into the enterprise market with servers, networking, software, and services.[137] It avoided many of the acquisition writedowns and management turnover that plagued its chief rival Hewlett Packard.[138]
Despite spending $13 billion on acquisitions to diversify its portfolio beyond hardware between 2009 and 2012,[139] the company was unable to convince the market that it could thrive in the post-PC world,[138] and the company suffered continued declines in revenue and share price.[140][141][142][143] Dell's market share in the corporate segment was no longer the "moat" against rivals that it was previously.[144]
2013 buyout[edit]
On February 5, 2013, Dell announced that Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners, aided by a $2 billion loan from Microsoft, would take the company private in a $24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal, the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007 financial crisis.[145][146][147]
In March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn offered to buy the company;[148] however, in April 2013, Blackstone withdrew its offer, citing deteriorating business conditions.[149][150] Other private equity firms such as KKR & Co. and TPG Capital declined to submit alternative bids for Dell, citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures, and a bidding war never materialized.[139] Michael Dell and Silver Lake later increased their offer to $25 billion and closed the acquisition.[151][152][153]
After the buyout, Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Program that was expected to reduce the workforce by up to 7%. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that it was speculated that Dell might be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.[154]
India website and expansion[edit]
In June 2013, Dell India started an e-commerce website, enabling customers to order online.[155][156]
In 2015, Dell announced plans to expand its the capacity its facility in Chennai of 3 million PCs per year.[157]
Partnership with EMC (2001-2011) and 2016 merger with EMC[edit]




Dell–EMC merger wordmark introduced in 2016.

In 2001, Dell and EMC entered into a partnership whereby both companies jointly design products and Dell provided support for certain EMC products including midrange storage systems, such as fibre channel and iSCSI storage area networks. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.[158]
On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of the strategic partnership with EMC. In addition, Dell expanded its product line-up by adding the EMC Celerra NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems and partnered on a new line of data deduplication products as part of its TierDisk family of data storage devices.[159]
On October 17, 2011, Dell discontinued reselling all EMC storage products, ending the partnership 2 years early.[160][161]
On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire EMC for $67 billion, in the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[162][163][164]
EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management Corporation, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize.[165][166][167][168][169]
The deal was approved by major investors including Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners.[170]
On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the acquisition of EMC Corp., the largest technology merger in history and became a subsidiary of Dell Technologies.[171][166][172][173][174][175][176]

Marketing[edit]




The company sponsors Dell Diamond, the home stadium of the Round Rock Express, the AAA minor league baseball affiliate of the Texas Rangers major league baseball team


Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, mail-order catalogs, and newspapers. Some of Dell's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors.
A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor Ben Curtis playing the part of "Steven", a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!"[240]
A subsequent advertising campaign featured interns at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).
In 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from BBDO to Working Mother Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from The Flaming Lips and Devo who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad "Work it Out". Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan "Yours is here" to say that it customizes computers to fit customers' requirements.[241]
Beginning in 2011, Dell began hosting a conference in Austin, Texas at the Austin Convention Center titled "Dell World". The event featured new technology and services provided by Dell and Dell's partners. In 2017, the event was moved to Las Vegas.[242]
Dell slogans[edit]

Get more out of now (1984–1989)
Easy as Dell (1989-2001)
Dell. Purely You (2001–2006)
Be direct (2006-2007)
Yours is Here (2007–2011)
The power to do more (2011–present)[243]

Environmental record[edit]
Dell reports its environmental performance in an annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report that follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) protocol.[244]
All of Dell's facilities have permanent recycling centers and in 2005, the company had a reuse/recycle rate of 85%.[245] In 2006, Dell launched a free electronics recycling program.[245]
On February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its "Recycling Works" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.[246]
On June 5, 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company.[247]
On July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009. The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.[248]
On October 19, 2007, the company introduced the term "The Re-Generation" during a round table in London commemorating World Environment Day. "The Re-Generation" refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to make a difference in improving the world's environment. Dell also planned to lead in setting an environmental standard for the technology industry.[249]
In 2008, the company achieved carbon neutrality by purchasing renewable energy credits.[245]
In 2008, Dell announced that its Round Rock headquarters would be 100% powered by green energy, with 60% of energy needs powered by wind farms from TXU Energy and 40% of energy needs powered by the Austin Community Landfill gas-to-energy plant operated by Waste Management.[250]
In 2009, the company was recognized as the top brand for environmental technology in the information technology sector.[245]
In 2012, Dell ranked 5th on Greenpeace's ranking of electronics makers, with a score of 4.6/10, with the low score due in part to the non-removal of polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and Brominated flame retardants from Dell's products, as promised.[251]
In March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen calling for Dell’s founder and CEO Michael Dell to ‘drop the toxics’ and claiming that Dell’s aspiration to be ‘the greenest technology company on the planet’ was ‘hypocritical’.[252][253][254]
In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Dell the 8th highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.[255]
Criticism[edit]

Upgrade requirements[edit]
In the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily ATX motherboards and PSU to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).[256][257]
Customer service complaints[edit]
In 2005, customer complaints about Dell more than doubled to 1,533, after earnings grew 52% that year.[74] In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service. Issues included call transfers of more than 45% of calls and long wait times.[258] Later in 2006, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150 million.[259]
Accounting practices[edit]
On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of $50–150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share.[260] The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted.[261][262] It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices. In 2010, Dell paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.[263][264]
Error pricing on Taiwanese website[edit]
In July 2009, Dell apologized after drawing the ire of the Taiwanese Consumer Protection Commission for twice refusing to honor a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its Taiwanese website, which Dell claims was in error. In the first instance, Dell offered a 19" LCD panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1,900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honor the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) per customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1 million (US$31,250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price. The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes, as Dell said the company mis-priced its products twice in Taiwanese website within 3 weeks.[265][266]
Lawsuit by Carl Icahn regarding bid by Michael Dell[edit]
After Michael Dell made a $24.4 billion buyout bid in August 2013, activist shareholder Carl Icahn sued the company and its board in an attempt to derail the bid and promote his own forthcoming offer.[267]
Criticism of Dell's claims regarding laptop security[edit]
In 2008, Dell received criticism for marketing its laptop computers as the "World's Most Secure Commercial Laptops". At Lenovo's request, the Better Business Bureau evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support such claim.[268]
Self-signed root certificate[edit]
In November 2015 it emerged that several Dell computers had shipped with an identical pre-installed root certificate known as "eDellRoot".[269] This raised such security risks as attackers impersonating HTTPS-protected websites such as Google and Bank of America and malware being signed with the certificate to bypass Microsoft software filtering.[269] Dell apologised and offered a removal tool.[270][271]
Tracking of customers using Dell Foundation Services[edit]
Also in November 2015, a researcher discovered that customers with diagnostic program Dell Foundation Services could be digitally tracked using the unique service tag number assigned to them by the program, even if a customer enabled private browsing and deleted their browser cookies.[272]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
A Dell employee, Guy Chapman, who is formerly a Wikipedia administrator (JzG), was found to have been removing references on Wikipedia to competitors of Dell Research.[273]

History[edit]
Main article: History of Dell




Dell's first logo from 1984 to 1989






Dell's former logo from 1989 to 2010


In 1984, at the age of 19, with $1,000 in capital from his family, Michael Dell founded PC's Limited, a seller of IBM PC compatible computers, while a student of the University of Texas at Austin and operated the company from his dormitory room.[25][26] In July 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the 10 megabyte Turbo PC, which sold for $795, undercutting IBM.[27][28] After a positive article in PC Week, the company was selling 1,000 machines per month.[28] Michael Dell appeared in PC's Limited advertisements in national magazines, asking readers to "give us a chance to show you what [its products] can do".[29] Dell's family went on to lend him $500,000 to fund the growth of the company, but the loans were repaid in 1986.[28] In late 1986, the company began operations from an 82,000 square foot factory in North Austin.[28]
In 1986, Michael Dell hired Lee Walker, a 44-year-old retired investment banker and venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as mentor and to implement Dell's ideas for growing the company.[28] Walker reorganized the management staff, was instrumental in securing the company's first line of credit from a bank of $10 million, and was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988 such as George Kozmetsky and Bobby Ray Inman.[28] Walker retired in 1990 due to ill health, and Michael Dell hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of Electronic Data Systems to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise.[30]
By early 1987, Dell's factory was producing 7,000 computers per month, each built to customers' specifications.[28] In 1987, the company had $70 million in annual sales and $2.1 million in net income.[28] This represented approximately a market share of 1%, compared to 30% for IBM, 8.2% for Apple Inc., 5.2% for Compaq, 5% for Olivetti, and 4.4% for Zenith Electronics.[28] The company spent $3 million, or 4% of sales, on advertising. Dell also offered journalists from major computer magazines the opportunity to test its products, which gave it further good publicity when positive articles were written in these publications.[28] Dell was known for its excellent customer service, with 90% of complaints resolved in a single phone call.[28] In early 1987, Dell began offering a computer service/repair plan by Honeywell for $35 per year.[28] Dell raised capital in a private placement in 1987.[28]
In 1988, The company changed its name from PC’s Limited to Dell Computer Corporation.[27] In June 1988, Dell raised $30 million of new capital, issuing 3.5 million shares at $8.50 each, becoming a public company via an initial public offering.[27]
In 1989, the company introduced its first laptop computer, the 316LT.[27] In 1990, the company opened a manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland to serve clients in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.[27]
In 1992, Fortune magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell, at 27 years old, the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.[31][27]
By 1993, the company had 5,000 employees.[28]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, sales of computers at retail stores by competitors increased significantly.[28] To complement its own direct sales channel, Dell signed agreements to have its computers sold at CompUSA and Staples Inc. stores.[28] However, selling via middlemen was not very profitable for Dell. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals.[32] Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994.[33] In 1996, Rollins joined Dell full-time.[34]
Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s[edit]
Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed in 1996, when Dell.com reached $1 million in daily sales within 6 months of its launch.[27] While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.[33]
Dell originally had its headquarters at 9505 Arboretum Blvd., in the Arboretum complex in northern Austin, Texas. In 1996, the company moved its headquarters to Round Rock, Texas.[35]
From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, Inc., IBM Aptiva, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out. The company attained and maintained the #1 rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to Consumer Reports, year after year, during the mid-to-late 90s through 2001. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999, with 16% market share.[36] Operating costs made up only 10% of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21% of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25% at Gateway, and 46% at Cisco.[37] In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.[5]
In the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers. The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built more cheaply than its competitors.[38] Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13% of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31% of the market. Dell's first business acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.[37]
Dell opened plants in Penang, Malaysia in 1995 and 2002,[39][40] and in Xiamen, China in 1999.[41] These facilities serve the Asian market and assemble 95% of Dell notebooks. In 1997, the company opened its second manufacturing facility in Texas and shipped its 10 millionth computer.
In May 1999, Dell opened a 260,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42]
Dell's first European manufacturing facility opened in 1990 in the Raheen Industrial Estate near Limerick, Ireland.[43] The plant was expanded in 1996 and again in 1999 with a $90 million expansion that brought the total workforce there to 5,800 people.[44]
By 2000, the Dell.com website was generating $40 million in sales per day and Dell's sales reached $25 billion per year.[28][27] Rollins became President and COO in 2001.[34]
In 2000, Dell moved its corporate headquarters and executive offices to the Las Cimas office complex in Travis County, Texas, between Austin and West Lake Hills.[45] The company leased 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) there, but in early 2002, the company announced that it would move its headquarters back to Round Rock and would sublease its offices in Las Cimas.[46] The subleases were completed in May 2003.[47]
In 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins's attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation.[48] In 2002, Dell started the Dell Direct Store model, opening kiosks in malls and airports in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company, eventually opening 140 kiosks.[49]
In 2003, the company changed its name from Dell Computer Corporation to Dell Inc. to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.[27]
In 2003, Dell consolidated its operations at its Castletroy facility, formerly occupied by Wang Laboratories and Flextronics into its Limerick facility and the Castletroy facility now operates as a movie studio.[50]
In 2004, Michael Dell resigned as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman, handing the CEO title to Kevin Rollins, who had been President and COO since 2001.[27] Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.[48]
In December 2004, Dell announced that it would build a new 750,000 square foot assembly-plant near Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million in incentives and tax breaks.[51] The facility opened in October 2005 after much controversy due to the government subsidies.[52]
Under Rollins, Dell began to loosen its ties to Microsoft and Intel. In March 2006, Dell acquired Alienware, which introduced several new items to Dell products, including processors by Advanced Micro Devices.[53] To prevent cross-market products, Dell continues to run Alienware as a separate entity, but still a wholly owned subsidiary.
Disappointing growth and Dell 2.0 (2005-2006)[edit]
In 2005, Dell came under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its revenue recognition practices.[54] Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by Donald Carty in January 2007.[55]
In 2005, sales growth slowed.[27] At its low point in 2006, the stock price had declined 40% in a year.[56] This led to management changes.[57]
The slowing sales growth was attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs,[58] but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.[59]
In 2006, despite expansions into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on U.S. corporate PC market, and desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32% of its revenue, 85% of its revenue comes from businesses, and 64% of its revenue came from North and South America. U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market was not buying pending the release of Microsoft's Windows Vista in 2007.[57][60] Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.[48]
Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in computer performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to engage in upselling. As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. Dell's customer service worsened as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure. Although, Dell originally was known for high levels of customer service, the decline in computer prices led to the company cutting costs.[61] Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting "got in the way," aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve customer service, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional "bloatware" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the "Dell Hell" prominent on Internet search engines.[56][62]
In 2006, Dell's reputation and earnings suffered when it was discovered that the company sold 12 million of computers between 2003 and 2005 that suffered from bad capacitors and leaked chemicals.[27][63][64] In August 2006, a battery recall as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire caused much negative attention for the company although eventually, Sony was found responsible for the faulty batteries.[65][66]
Dell 2.0 and downsizing[edit]
In the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell's shipments declined and it lost its market share lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard, whose Personal Systems Group was invigorated due to a restructuring initiated by CEO Mark Hurd.[37][67][27] At the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share was 13.9%, compared to 17.4% for Hewlett Packard.[68]
In 2006, Dell announced a change campaign called "Dell 2.0," reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company's products.[59][69][70] While chairman of the board after relinquishing his CEO position, Michael Dell still had significant input in the company during Rollins' years as CEO. With the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw immediate changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company.[71] As part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative, in February 2007, Michael Dell announced several initiatives and plans to improve the company's financial performance. These included elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of "bureaucracy".[72]
Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon its supply chain efficiency to sell established products at low prices, instead of being an innovator.[48][73] By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's relatively low spending on research and development as a percentage of its sales prevented it from developing products in more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and mobile devices.[74] Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized.[5]
In 2006, Dell established its Performance Analytics Group, originally known as Dell Analytics, in Bangalore, India. This division supports pricing, web analytics and supply chain operations.[75]
In late 2006, Dell opened a manufacturing facility in Chennai, India.[76]
Rollins resigns[edit]
On January 31, 2007, After 4 of 5 quarterly earnings reports were below expectations, Rollins resigned as President and CEO, receiving a $5 million severance package, and founder Michael Dell assumed the role of CEO again.[77][78][69]
Retail expansion overseas and closures in the United States[edit]
Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model, which was now cited as a disadvantage compared to rivals such as HP and Acer that also sold computers via retail stores. The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer certain electronics items that customers wanted to see before buying.[58] In early 2007, the company moved away from its direct-only sales model and experimented with mall kiosks and quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.[71][79][80]
In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Budapest and in October 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.[81] HMV's flagship Trocadero store sold Dell PCs beginning in December 2007.[82] From January 2008 the UK stores of DSGi have sold Dell products (in particular, through Currys and PC World stores).[83] Beginning in 2008, Tesco sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.[84]
In May 2007, Dell announced plans to sell its products via existing retail chains in the United States, such as Walmart.[85][86] In February 2008, Dell closed its retail locations in the United States, including its 140 kiosks and concentrated its retail presence on stores such as Walmart and Best Buy.[87][88]
In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, Officeworks (part of Coles Group), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range.[89] In October 2008, Dell opened its first stores in India.[90] Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with now defunct Harris Technology in October 2009.[91] In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for "Slashing Prices".[92] In May 2009, Dell and Dick Smith Electronics (owned by Woolworths Limited) reached an agreement to sell Dell computers within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand.[93][94] In April 2010, Dell announced the closure of the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.[95] In Germany, Dell began selling selected smartphones and notebooks via Media Markt and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.[96]
In December 2007, Dell launched, "Dell Partner Direct", a formal partner program for value-added resellers.[97]
Plant closures and competition from Asian manufacturers (2007-2008)[edit]
Dell originally manufactured computers in house and was a pioneer in the "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.[98] In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.[99][100] As PCs became more commoditized, Dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers.
In 2007, the laptop segment was the fastest-growing segment of the PC market, but Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing laptop sales in big box stores.[101][56] Dell was getting trapped in the commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.[58]
In May 2007, Dell moved desktop and PowerEdge server manufacturing for the South American market from the Eldorado do Sul, Brazil plant opened in 1999, to a new plant in Hortolândia.[102][103]
In January 2008, the company announced the shutdown of its Edmonton, Alberta office, laying off 900 workers.[104] In total, Dell announced 8,800 layoffs in 2007–2008, or 10% of its workforce.[105][106]
In March 2008, Dell closed its manufacturing facilities in Austin, Texas.[107][108]
On April 23, 2008, as part of a cost-cutting measure, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in Ottawa, Ontario, reducing staff by approximately 1,100 employees. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the City of Ottawa won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers and add a new building. These plans were reversed, due to a high Canadian dollar that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell's turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs.[109]
By September 2008, the company desired to outsource manufacturing.[110] In September 2008, Dell approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell manufacturing facilities, with the plan of closing the sales within 18 months.[111][112]
On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to a new plant in Łódź, Poland by January 2010.[113] The European Union gave Dell a €55 million incentive package in conjunction with the move.[114] In December 2009, Dell announced the sale of the facility to Foxconn and outsourced manufacturing, becoming a customer of Foxconn.[115] The closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland resulted in the loss of 1,900 jobs.[116]
In July 2009, Dell closed its manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42][117]
In November 2010, Dell ceased operations at its plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which received $280 million in incentives from the state, and Dell's contract with the state required it to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions. The facility was sold to Herbalife.[118][119][120]
Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's factories overseas. The Miami, Florida facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation.
Acquisition and sale of Perot Systems[edit]
In 2009, Dell acquired Perot Systems and entered the market for IT services. Perot Systems was sold to NTT Data in 2016 at an $800 million loss.[121][122][123]
Competition from tablet computers (2010-2012)[edit]
In 2009, Dell entered the smartphone market with the launch of the Mini 3i in Brazil and China.[27][124]
In April 2010, the release of Apple's iPad tablet computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs.[125] Dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android.[126] The Dell Streak tablet, introduced in 2010, was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated operating system, numerous software bugs, and low resolution screen.[127][27] InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers.[128] Dell responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets.[48] Dell also went on an acquisition spree in 2010-2011, acquiring companies in the storage and software markets including Boomi, Exanet, InSite One, KACE, Ocarina Networks, Scalent, Compellent, Secure Works, RNA Networks, and Force10 Networks.[27]
Loss of market share and expansion to other products[edit]
In 2011, with a shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo to fall to #3 in market share.[129]
The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to a $65 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2012.[130][131] In December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.[132]
In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell and Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design, Dell's customer service and reputation had been slipping.[133][134] In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13% of operating profits in the PC industry, behind Apple Inc.'s Macintosh that took 45%, 7% at Hewlett Packard, 6% at Lenovo and Asus, and 1% for Acer.[135]
Dell attempted to offset its declining PC business, which still accounted for half of its revenue and generated steady cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2012,[136] by expanding into the enterprise market with servers, networking, software, and services.[137] It avoided many of the acquisition writedowns and management turnover that plagued its chief rival Hewlett Packard.[138]
Despite spending $13 billion on acquisitions to diversify its portfolio beyond hardware between 2009 and 2012,[139] the company was unable to convince the market that it could thrive in the post-PC world,[138] and the company suffered continued declines in revenue and share price.[140][141][142][143] Dell's market share in the corporate segment was no longer the "moat" against rivals that it was previously.[144]
2013 buyout[edit]
On February 5, 2013, Dell announced that Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners, aided by a $2 billion loan from Microsoft, would take the company private in a $24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal, the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007 financial crisis.[145][146][147]
In March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn offered to buy the company;[148] however, in April 2013, Blackstone withdrew its offer, citing deteriorating business conditions.[149][150] Other private equity firms such as KKR & Co. and TPG Capital declined to submit alternative bids for Dell, citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures, and a bidding war never materialized.[139] Michael Dell and Silver Lake later increased their offer to $25 billion and closed the acquisition.[151][152][153]
After the buyout, Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Program that was expected to reduce the workforce by up to 7%. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that it was speculated that Dell might be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.[154]
India website and expansion[edit]
In June 2013, Dell India started an e-commerce website, enabling customers to order online.[155][156]
In 2015, Dell announced plans to expand its the capacity its facility in Chennai of 3 million PCs per year.[157]
Partnership with EMC (2001-2011) and 2016 merger with EMC[edit]




Dell–EMC merger wordmark introduced in 2016.






Dell Latitude E5570, a 2016 model.


In 2001, Dell and EMC entered into a partnership whereby both companies jointly design products and Dell provided support for certain EMC products including midrange storage systems, such as fibre channel and iSCSI storage area networks. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.[158]
On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of the strategic partnership with EMC. In addition, Dell expanded its product line-up by adding the EMC Celerra NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems and partnered on a new line of data deduplication products as part of its TierDisk family of data storage devices.[159]
On October 17, 2011, Dell discontinued reselling all EMC storage products, ending the partnership 2 years early.[160][161]
On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire EMC for $67 billion, in the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[162][163][164]
EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management Corporation, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize.[165][166][167][168][169]
The deal was approved by major investors including Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners.[170]
On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the acquisition of EMC Corp., the largest technology merger in history and became a subsidiary of Dell Technologies.[171][166][172][173][174][175][176]

Marketing[edit]




The company sponsors Dell Diamond, the home stadium of the Round Rock Express, the AAA minor league baseball affiliate of the Texas Rangers major league baseball team


Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, mail-order catalogs, and newspapers. Some of Dell's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors.
A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor Ben Curtis playing the part of "Steven", a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!"[240]
A subsequent advertising campaign featured interns at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).
In 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from BBDO to Working Mother Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from The Flaming Lips and Devo who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad "Work it Out". Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan "Yours is here" to say that it customizes computers to fit customers' requirements.[241]
Beginning in 2011, Dell began hosting a conference in Austin, Texas at the Austin Convention Center titled "Dell World". The event featured new technology and services provided by Dell and Dell's partners. In 2017, the event was moved to Las Vegas.[242]
Dell slogans[edit]

Get more out of now (1984–1989)
Easy as Dell (1989-2001)
Dell. Purely You (2001–2006)
Be direct (2006-2007)
Yours is Here (2007–2011)
The power to do more (2011–present)[243]

Environmental record[edit]
Dell reports its environmental performance in an annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report that follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) protocol.[244]
All of Dell's facilities have permanent recycling centers and in 2005, the company had a reuse/recycle rate of 85%.[245] In 2006, Dell launched a free electronics recycling program.[245]
On February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its "Recycling Works" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.[246]
On June 5, 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company.[247]
On July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009. The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.[248]
On October 19, 2007, the company introduced the term "The Re-Generation" during a round table in London commemorating World Environment Day. "The Re-Generation" refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to make a difference in improving the world's environment. Dell also planned to lead in setting an environmental standard for the technology industry.[249]
In 2008, the company achieved carbon neutrality by purchasing renewable energy credits.[245]
In 2008, Dell announced that its Round Rock headquarters would be 100% powered by green energy, with 60% of energy needs powered by wind farms from TXU Energy and 40% of energy needs powered by the Austin Community Landfill gas-to-energy plant operated by Waste Management.[250]
In 2009, the company was recognized as the top brand for environmental technology in the information technology sector.[245]
In 2012, Dell ranked 5th on Greenpeace's ranking of electronics makers, with a score of 4.6/10, with the low score due in part to the non-removal of polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and Brominated flame retardants from Dell's products, as promised.[251]
In March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen calling for Dell’s founder and CEO Michael Dell to ‘drop the toxics’ and claiming that Dell’s aspiration to be ‘the greenest technology company on the planet’ was ‘hypocritical’.[252][253][254]
In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Dell the 8th highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.[255]
Criticism[edit]
See also: Lawsuits involving Dell Inc.
Upgrade requirements[edit]
In the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily ATX motherboards and PSU to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).[256][257]
Customer service complaints[edit]
In 2005, customer complaints about Dell more than doubled to 1,533, after earnings grew 52% that year.[74] In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service. Issues included call transfers of more than 45% of calls and long wait times.[258] Later in 2006, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150 million.[259]
Accounting practices[edit]
On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of $50–150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share.[260] The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted.[261][262] It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices. In 2010, Dell paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.[263][264]
Error pricing on Taiwanese website[edit]
In July 2009, Dell apologized after drawing the ire of the Taiwanese Consumer Protection Commission for twice refusing to honor a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its Taiwanese website, which Dell claims was in error. In the first instance, Dell offered a 19" LCD panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1,900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honor the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) per customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1 million (US$31,250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price. The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes, as Dell said the company mis-priced its products twice in Taiwanese website within 3 weeks.[265][266]
Lawsuit by Carl Icahn regarding bid by Michael Dell[edit]
After Michael Dell made a $24.4 billion buyout bid in August 2013, activist shareholder Carl Icahn sued the company and its board in an attempt to derail the bid and promote his own forthcoming offer.[267]
Criticism of Dell's claims regarding laptop security[edit]
In 2008, Dell received criticism for marketing its laptop computers as the "World's Most Secure Commercial Laptops". At Lenovo's request, the Better Business Bureau evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support such claim.[268]
Self-signed root certificate[edit]
In November 2015 it emerged that several Dell computers had shipped with an identical pre-installed root certificate known as "eDellRoot".[269] This raised such security risks as attackers impersonating HTTPS-protected websites such as Google and Bank of America and malware being signed with the certificate to bypass Microsoft software filtering.[269] Dell apologised and offered a removal tool.[270][271]
Tracking of customers using Dell Foundation Services[edit]
Also in November 2015, a researcher discovered that customers with diagnostic program Dell Foundation Services could be digitally tracked using the unique service tag number assigned to them by the program, even if a customer enabled private browsing and deleted their browser cookies.[272]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
A Dell employee, Guy Chapman, who is formerly a Wikipedia administrator (JzG), was found to have been removing references on Wikipedia to competitors of Dell Research.[273]

History[edit]
Main article: History of Dell




Dell's first logo from 1984 to 1989






Dell's former logo from 1989 to 2010


In 1984, at the age of 19, with $1,000 in capital from his family, Michael Dell founded PC's Limited, a seller of IBM PC compatible computers, while a student of the University of Texas at Austin and operated the company from his dormitory room.[25][26] In July 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the 10 megabyte Turbo PC, which sold for $795, undercutting IBM.[27][28] After a positive article in PC Week, the company was selling 1,000 machines per month.[28] Michael Dell appeared in PC's Limited advertisements in national magazines, asking readers to "give us a chance to show you what [its products] can do".[29] Dell's family went on to lend him $500,000 to fund the growth of the company, but the loans were repaid in 1986.[28] In late 1986, the company began operations from an 82,000 square foot factory in North Austin.[28]
In 1986, Michael Dell hired Lee Walker, a 44-year-old retired investment banker and venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as mentor and to implement Dell's ideas for growing the company.[28] Walker reorganized the management staff, was instrumental in securing the company's first line of credit from a bank of $10 million, and was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988 such as George Kozmetsky and Bobby Ray Inman.[28] Walker retired in 1990 due to ill health, and Michael Dell hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of Electronic Data Systems to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise.[30]
By early 1987, Dell's factory was producing 7,000 computers per month, each built to customers' specifications.[28] In 1987, the company had $70 million in annual sales and $2.1 million in net income.[28] This represented approximately a market share of 1%, compared to 30% for IBM, 8.2% for Apple Inc., 5.2% for Compaq, 5% for Olivetti, and 4.4% for Zenith Electronics.[28] The company spent $3 million, or 4% of sales, on advertising. Dell also offered journalists from major computer magazines the opportunity to test its products, which gave it further good publicity when positive articles were written in these publications.[28] Dell was known for its excellent customer service, with 90% of complaints resolved in a single phone call.[28] In early 1987, Dell began offering a computer service/repair plan by Honeywell for $35 per year.[28] Dell raised capital in a private placement in 1987.[28]
In 1988, The company changed its name from PC’s Limited to Dell Computer Corporation.[27] In June 1988, Dell raised $30 million of new capital, issuing 3.5 million shares at $8.50 each, becoming a public company via an initial public offering.[27]
In 1989, the company introduced its first laptop computer, the 316LT.[27] In 1990, the company opened a manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland to serve clients in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.[27]
In 1992, Fortune magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell, at 27 years old, the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.[31][27]
By 1993, the company had 5,000 employees.[28]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, sales of computers at retail stores by competitors increased significantly.[28] To complement its own direct sales channel, Dell signed agreements to have its computers sold at CompUSA and Staples Inc. stores.[28] However, selling via middlemen was not very profitable for Dell. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals.[32] Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994.[33] In 1996, Rollins joined Dell full-time.[34]
Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s[edit]
Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed in 1996, when Dell.com reached $1 million in daily sales within 6 months of its launch.[27] While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.[33]
Dell originally had its headquarters at 9505 Arboretum Blvd., in the Arboretum complex in northern Austin, Texas. In 1996, the company moved its headquarters to Round Rock, Texas.[35]
From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, Inc., IBM Aptiva, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out. The company attained and maintained the #1 rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to Consumer Reports, year after year, during the mid-to-late 90s through 2001. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999, with 16% market share.[36] Operating costs made up only 10% of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21% of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25% at Gateway, and 46% at Cisco.[37] In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.[5]
In the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers. The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built more cheaply than its competitors.[38] Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13% of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31% of the market. Dell's first business acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.[37]
Dell opened plants in Penang, Malaysia in 1995 and 2002,[39][40] and in Xiamen, China in 1999.[41] These facilities serve the Asian market and assemble 95% of Dell notebooks. In 1997, the company opened its second manufacturing facility in Texas and shipped its 10 millionth computer.
In May 1999, Dell opened a 260,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42]
Dell's first European manufacturing facility opened in 1990 in the Raheen Industrial Estate near Limerick, Ireland.[43] The plant was expanded in 1996 and again in 1999 with a $90 million expansion that brought the total workforce there to 5,800 people.[44]
By 2000, the Dell.com website was generating $40 million in sales per day and Dell's sales reached $25 billion per year.[28][27] Rollins became President and COO in 2001.[34]
In 2000, Dell moved its corporate headquarters and executive offices to the Las Cimas office complex in Travis County, Texas, between Austin and West Lake Hills.[45] The company leased 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) there, but in early 2002, the company announced that it would move its headquarters back to Round Rock and would sublease its offices in Las Cimas.[46] The subleases were completed in May 2003.[47]
In 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins's attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation.[48] In 2002, Dell started the Dell Direct Store model, opening kiosks in malls and airports in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company, eventually opening 140 kiosks.[49]
In 2003, the company changed its name from Dell Computer Corporation to Dell Inc. to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.[27]
In 2003, Dell consolidated its operations at its Castletroy facility, formerly occupied by Wang Laboratories and Flextronics into its Limerick facility and the Castletroy facility now operates as a movie studio.[50]
In 2004, Michael Dell resigned as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman, handing the CEO title to Kevin Rollins, who had been President and COO since 2001.[27] Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.[48]
In December 2004, Dell announced that it would build a new 750,000 square foot assembly-plant near Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million in incentives and tax breaks.[51] The facility opened in October 2005 after much controversy due to the government subsidies.[52]
Under Rollins, Dell began to loosen its ties to Microsoft and Intel. In March 2006, Dell acquired Alienware, which introduced several new items to Dell products, including processors by Advanced Micro Devices.[53] To prevent cross-market products, Dell continues to run Alienware as a separate entity, but still a wholly owned subsidiary.
Disappointing growth and Dell 2.0 (2005-2006)[edit]
In 2005, Dell came under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its revenue recognition practices.[54] Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by Donald Carty in January 2007.[55]
In 2005, sales growth slowed.[27] At its low point in 2006, the stock price had declined 40% in a year.[56] This led to management changes.[57]
The slowing sales growth was attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs,[58] but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.[59]
In 2006, despite expansions into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on U.S. corporate PC market, and desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32% of its revenue, 85% of its revenue comes from businesses, and 64% of its revenue came from North and South America. U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market was not buying pending the release of Microsoft's Windows Vista in 2007.[57][60] Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.[48]
Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in computer performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to engage in upselling. As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. Dell's customer service worsened as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure. Although, Dell originally was known for high levels of customer service, the decline in computer prices led to the company cutting costs.[61] Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting "got in the way," aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve customer service, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional "bloatware" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the "Dell Hell" prominent on Internet search engines.[56][62]
In 2006, Dell's reputation and earnings suffered when it was discovered that the company sold 12 million of computers between 2003 and 2005 that suffered from bad capacitors and leaked chemicals.[27][63][64] In August 2006, a battery recall as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire caused much negative attention for the company although eventually, Sony was found responsible for the faulty batteries.[65][66]
Dell 2.0 and downsizing[edit]
In the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell's shipments declined and it lost its market share lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard, whose Personal Systems Group was invigorated due to a restructuring initiated by CEO Mark Hurd.[37][67][27] At the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share was 13.9%, compared to 17.4% for Hewlett Packard.[68]
In 2006, Dell announced a change campaign called "Dell 2.0," reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company's products.[59][69][70] While chairman of the board after relinquishing his CEO position, Michael Dell still had significant input in the company during Rollins' years as CEO. With the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw immediate changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company.[71] As part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative, in February 2007, Michael Dell announced several initiatives and plans to improve the company's financial performance. These included elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of "bureaucracy".[72]
Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon its supply chain efficiency to sell established products at low prices, instead of being an innovator.[48][73] By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's relatively low spending on research and development as a percentage of its sales prevented it from developing products in more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and mobile devices.[74] Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized.[5]
In 2006, Dell established its Performance Analytics Group, originally known as Dell Analytics, in Bangalore, India. This division supports pricing, web analytics and supply chain operations.[75]
In late 2006, Dell opened a manufacturing facility in Chennai, India.[76]
Rollins resigns[edit]
On January 31, 2007, After 4 of 5 quarterly earnings reports were below expectations, Rollins resigned as President and CEO, receiving a $5 million severance package, and founder Michael Dell assumed the role of CEO again.[77][78][69]
Retail expansion overseas and closures in the United States[edit]
Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model, which was now cited as a disadvantage compared to rivals such as HP and Acer that also sold computers via retail stores. The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer certain electronics items that customers wanted to see before buying.[58] In early 2007, the company moved away from its direct-only sales model and experimented with mall kiosks and quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.[71][79][80]
In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Budapest and in October 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.[81] HMV's flagship Trocadero store sold Dell PCs beginning in December 2007.[82] From January 2008 the UK stores of DSGi have sold Dell products (in particular, through Currys and PC World stores).[83] Beginning in 2008, Tesco sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.[84]
In May 2007, Dell announced plans to sell its products via existing retail chains in the United States, such as Walmart.[85][86] In February 2008, Dell closed its retail locations in the United States, including its 140 kiosks and concentrated its retail presence on stores such as Walmart and Best Buy.[87][88]
In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, Officeworks (part of Coles Group), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range.[89] In October 2008, Dell opened its first stores in India.[90] Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with now defunct Harris Technology in October 2009.[91] In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for "Slashing Prices".[92] In May 2009, Dell and Dick Smith Electronics (owned by Woolworths Limited) reached an agreement to sell Dell computers within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand.[93][94] In April 2010, Dell announced the closure of the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.[95] In Germany, Dell began selling selected smartphones and notebooks via Media Markt and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.[96]
In December 2007, Dell launched, "Dell Partner Direct", a formal partner program for value-added resellers.[97]
Plant closures and competition from Asian manufacturers (2007-2008)[edit]
Dell originally manufactured computers in house and was a pioneer in the "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.[98] In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.[99][100] As PCs became more commoditized, Dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers.
In 2007, the laptop segment was the fastest-growing segment of the PC market, but Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing laptop sales in big box stores.[101][56] Dell was getting trapped in the commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.[58]
In May 2007, Dell moved desktop and PowerEdge server manufacturing for the South American market from the Eldorado do Sul, Brazil plant opened in 1999, to a new plant in Hortolândia.[102][103]
In January 2008, the company announced the shutdown of its Edmonton, Alberta office, laying off 900 workers.[104] In total, Dell announced 8,800 layoffs in 2007–2008, or 10% of its workforce.[105][106]
In March 2008, Dell closed its manufacturing facilities in Austin, Texas.[107][108]
On April 23, 2008, as part of a cost-cutting measure, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in Ottawa, Ontario, reducing staff by approximately 1,100 employees. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the City of Ottawa won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers and add a new building. These plans were reversed, due to a high Canadian dollar that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell's turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs.[109]
By September 2008, the company desired to outsource manufacturing.[110] In September 2008, Dell approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell manufacturing facilities, with the plan of closing the sales within 18 months.[111][112]
On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to a new plant in Łódź, Poland by January 2010.[113] The European Union gave Dell a €55 million incentive package in conjunction with the move.[114] In December 2009, Dell announced the sale of the facility to Foxconn and outsourced manufacturing, becoming a customer of Foxconn.[115] The closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland resulted in the loss of 1,900 jobs.[116]
In July 2009, Dell closed its manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42][117]
In November 2010, Dell ceased operations at its plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which received $280 million in incentives from the state, and Dell's contract with the state required it to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions. The facility was sold to Herbalife.[118][119][120]
Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's factories overseas. The Miami, Florida facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation.
Acquisition and sale of Perot Systems[edit]
In 2009, Dell acquired Perot Systems and entered the market for IT services. Perot Systems was sold to NTT Data in 2016 at an $800 million loss.[121][122][123]
Competition from tablet computers (2010-2012)[edit]
In 2009, Dell entered the smartphone market with the launch of the Mini 3i in Brazil and China.[27][124]
In April 2010, the release of Apple's iPad tablet computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs.[125] Dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android.[126] The Dell Streak tablet, introduced in 2010, was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated operating system, numerous software bugs, and low resolution screen.[127][27] InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers.[128] Dell responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets.[48] Dell also went on an acquisition spree in 2010-2011, acquiring companies in the storage and software markets including Boomi, Exanet, InSite One, KACE, Ocarina Networks, Scalent, Compellent, Secure Works, RNA Networks, and Force10 Networks.[27]
Loss of market share and expansion to other products[edit]
In 2011, with a shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo to fall to #3 in market share.[129]
The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to a $65 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2012.[130][131] In December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.[132]
In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell and Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design, Dell's customer service and reputation had been slipping.[133][134] In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13% of operating profits in the PC industry, behind Apple Inc.'s Macintosh that took 45%, 7% at Hewlett Packard, 6% at Lenovo and Asus, and 1% for Acer.[135]
Dell attempted to offset its declining PC business, which still accounted for half of its revenue and generated steady cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2012,[136] by expanding into the enterprise market with servers, networking, software, and services.[137] It avoided many of the acquisition writedowns and management turnover that plagued its chief rival Hewlett Packard.[138]
Despite spending $13 billion on acquisitions to diversify its portfolio beyond hardware between 2009 and 2012,[139] the company was unable to convince the market that it could thrive in the post-PC world,[138] and the company suffered continued declines in revenue and share price.[140][141][142][143] Dell's market share in the corporate segment was no longer the "moat" against rivals that it was previously.[144]
2013 buyout[edit]
On February 5, 2013, Dell announced that Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners, aided by a $2 billion loan from Microsoft, would take the company private in a $24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal, the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007 financial crisis.[145][146][147]
In March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn offered to buy the company;[148] however, in April 2013, Blackstone withdrew its offer, citing deteriorating business conditions.[149][150] Other private equity firms such as KKR & Co. and TPG Capital declined to submit alternative bids for Dell, citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures, and a bidding war never materialized.[139] Michael Dell and Silver Lake later increased their offer to $25 billion and closed the acquisition.[151][152][153]
After the buyout, Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Program that was expected to reduce the workforce by up to 7%. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that it was speculated that Dell might be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.[154]
India website and expansion[edit]
In June 2013, Dell India started an e-commerce website, enabling customers to order online.[155][156]
In 2015, Dell announced plans to expand its the capacity its facility in Chennai of 3 million PCs per year.[157]
Partnership with EMC (2001-2011) and 2016 merger with EMC[edit]




Dell–EMC merger wordmark introduced in 2016.






Dell Latitude E5570, a 2016 model.


In 2001, Dell and EMC entered into a partnership whereby both companies jointly design products and Dell provided support for certain EMC products including midrange storage systems, such as fibre channel and iSCSI storage area networks. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.[158]
On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of the strategic partnership with EMC. In addition, Dell expanded its product line-up by adding the EMC Celerra NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems and partnered on a new line of data deduplication products as part of its TierDisk family of data storage devices.[159]
On October 17, 2011, Dell discontinued reselling all EMC storage products, ending the partnership 2 years early.[160][161]
On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire EMC for $67 billion, in the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[162][163][164]
EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management Corporation, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize.[165][166][167][168][169]
The deal was approved by major investors including Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners.[170]
On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the acquisition of EMC Corp., the largest technology merger in history and became a subsidiary of Dell Technologies.[171][166][172][173][174][175][176]

Marketing[edit]




The company sponsors Dell Diamond, the home stadium of the Round Rock Express, the AAA minor league baseball affiliate of the Texas Rangers major league baseball team


Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, mail-order catalogs, and newspapers. Some of Dell's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors.
A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor Ben Curtis playing the part of "Steven", a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!"[240]
A subsequent advertising campaign featured interns at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).
In 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from BBDO to Working Mother Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from The Flaming Lips and Devo who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad "Work it Out". Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan "Yours is here" to say that it customizes computers to fit customers' requirements.[241]
Beginning in 2011, Dell began hosting a conference in Austin, Texas at the Austin Convention Center titled "Dell World". The event featured new technology and services provided by Dell and Dell's partners. In 2017, the event was moved to Las Vegas.[242]
Dell slogans[edit]

Get more out of now (1984–1989)
Easy as Dell (1989-2001)
Dell. Purely You (2001–2006)
Be direct (2006-2007)
Yours is Here (2007–2011)
The power to do more (2011–present)[243]

Environmental record[edit]
Dell reports its environmental performance in an annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report that follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) protocol.[244]
All of Dell's facilities have permanent recycling centers and in 2005, the company had a reuse/recycle rate of 85%.[245] In 2006, Dell launched a free electronics recycling program.[245]
On February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its "Recycling Works" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.[246]
On June 5, 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company.[247]
On July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009. The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.[248]
On October 19, 2007, the company introduced the term "The Re-Generation" during a round table in London commemorating World Environment Day. "The Re-Generation" refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to make a difference in improving the world's environment. Dell also planned to lead in setting an environmental standard for the technology industry.[249]
In 2008, the company achieved carbon neutrality by purchasing renewable energy credits.[245]
In 2008, Dell announced that its Round Rock headquarters would be 100% powered by green energy, with 60% of energy needs powered by wind farms from TXU Energy and 40% of energy needs powered by the Austin Community Landfill gas-to-energy plant operated by Waste Management.[250]
In 2009, the company was recognized as the top brand for environmental technology in the information technology sector.[245]
In 2012, Dell ranked 5th on Greenpeace's ranking of electronics makers, with a score of 4.6/10, with the low score due in part to the non-removal of polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and Brominated flame retardants from Dell's products, as promised.[251]
In March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen calling for Dell’s founder and CEO Michael Dell to ‘drop the toxics’ and claiming that Dell’s aspiration to be ‘the greenest technology company on the planet’ was ‘hypocritical’.[252][253][254]
In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Dell the 8th highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.[255]
Criticism[edit]
See also: Lawsuits involving Dell Inc.
Upgrade requirements[edit]
In the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily ATX motherboards and PSU to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).[256][257]
Customer service complaints[edit]
In 2005, customer complaints about Dell more than doubled to 1,533, after earnings grew 52% that year.[74] In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service. Issues included call transfers of more than 45% of calls and long wait times.[258] Later in 2006, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150 million.[259]
Accounting practices[edit]
On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of $50–150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share.[260] The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted.[261][262] It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices. In 2010, Dell paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.[263][264]
Error pricing on Taiwanese website[edit]
In July 2009, Dell apologized after drawing the ire of the Taiwanese Consumer Protection Commission for twice refusing to honor a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its Taiwanese website, which Dell claims was in error. In the first instance, Dell offered a 19" LCD panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1,900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honor the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) per customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1 million (US$31,250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price. The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes, as Dell said the company mis-priced its products twice in Taiwanese website within 3 weeks.[265][266]
Lawsuit by Carl Icahn regarding bid by Michael Dell[edit]
After Michael Dell made a $24.4 billion buyout bid in August 2013, activist shareholder Carl Icahn sued the company and its board in an attempt to derail the bid and promote his own forthcoming offer.[267]
Criticism of Dell's claims regarding laptop security[edit]
In 2008, Dell received criticism for marketing its laptop computers as the "World's Most Secure Commercial Laptops". At Lenovo's request, the Better Business Bureau evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support such claim.[268]
Self-signed root certificate[edit]
In November 2015 it emerged that several Dell computers had shipped with an identical pre-installed root certificate known as "eDellRoot".[269] This raised such security risks as attackers impersonating HTTPS-protected websites such as Google and Bank of America and malware being signed with the certificate to bypass Microsoft software filtering.[269] Dell apologised and offered a removal tool.[270][271]
Tracking of customers using Dell Foundation Services[edit]
Also in November 2015, a researcher discovered that customers with diagnostic program Dell Foundation Services could be digitally tracked using the unique service tag number assigned to them by the program, even if a customer enabled private browsing and deleted their browser cookies.[272]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
A Dell employee, Guy Chapman, who is formerly a Wikipedia administrator (JzG), was found to have been removing references on Wikipedia to competitors of Dell Research.[273]

China regulatory approval clears way to complete transaction to combine Dell and EMC New company to begin operating as Dell Technologies following close of the transactionDell Inc. and EMC Corp. (NYSE: EMC) today announced that they intend to close the transaction to combine Dell and EMC on Wednesday, September 7, 2016.  Dell Technologies, the name of the new combined company, will begin operating immediately following the close of the transaction.Today’s announcement follows regulatory approval of the Dell and EMC transaction by China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), which has granted clearance for the companies’ proposed combination. MOFCOM approval was the final regulatory condition to closing the transaction. EMC shareholders approved the transaction on July 19, with approximately 98 percent of voting EMC shareholders casting their votes in favor of the merger, representing approximately 74 percent of EMC's outstanding common stock.“This is an historic moment for both Dell and EMC. Combined, we will be exceptionally well-positioned for growth in the most strategic areas of next generation IT including digital transformation, software-defined data center, converged infrastructure, hybrid cloud, mobile and security,” said Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies. “Our investments in R&D and innovation, along with our 140,000 team members around the world, will give us unmatched scale, strength and flexibility, deepening our relationships with customers of all sizes.”“I am proud of everything we’ve built at EMC – from humble beginnings as a Boston-based startup to a global, world-class technology company with an unyielding dedication to our customers,” said Joe Tucci, chairman and chief executive officer of EMC.  “The combination of Dell and EMC creates a new powerhouse in the industry - providing the essential technology for the next era in IT.” At closing, EMC shareholders will receive $24.05 per share in cash in addition to a newly issued tracking stock linked to a portion of EMC’s economic interest in the VMware business. Based on the estimated number of EMC shares outstanding at the close of the transaction, EMC shareholders are expected to receive approximately 0.111 shares of new tracking stock for each EMC share.  Upon close of the transaction, EMC shares under the ticker symbol “EMC” will be suspended from trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of the tracking stock, trading under the ticker symbol “DVMT,” are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, September 7.About Dell TechnologiesDell Technologies listens to customers and delivers worldwide innovative technology, business solutions and services that give them the power to do more.

compliance requirements of changing environmental and safety laws; and the effect of armed hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters, and public health issues.This list of risks, uncertainties, and other factors is not complete.  Dell Technologies discusses some of these matters more fully, as well as certain risk factors that could affect the Dell Technologies’ business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the prospectus/proxy statement forming part of Dell Technologies’ Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-208524) and Dell Technologies’ quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  These filings are available for review through the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website at www.sec.gov.  Any or all forward-looking statements Dell Technologies makes may turn out to be wrong, and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions Dell Technologies might make or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those identified in this press release.  Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements made in this press release, which speak only as of its date.  Dell Technologies does not undertake to update, and expressly disclaims any duty to update, its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of circumstances or events that arise after the date they are made, new information, or otherwise.EMC CorporationThis communication contains forward-looking information about EMC Corporation and the proposed transaction that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Dell




Dell's first logo from 1984 to 1989






Dell's former logo from 1989 to 2010


In 1984, at the age of 19, with $1,000 in capital from his family, Michael Dell founded PC's Limited, a seller of IBM PC compatible computers, while a student of the University of Texas at Austin and operated the company from his dormitory room.[25][26] In July 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the 10 megabyte Turbo PC, which sold for $795, undercutting IBM.[27][28] After a positive article in PC Week, the company was selling 1,000 machines per month.[28] Michael Dell appeared in PC's Limited advertisements in national magazines, asking readers to "give us a chance to show you what [its products] can do".[29] Dell's family went on to lend him $500,000 to fund the growth of the company, but the loans were repaid in 1986.[28] In late 1986, the company began operations from an 82,000 square foot factory in North Austin.[28]
In 1986, Michael Dell hired Lee Walker, a 44-year-old retired investment banker and venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as mentor and to implement Dell's ideas for growing the company.[28] Walker reorganized the management staff, was instrumental in securing the company's first line of credit from a bank of $10 million, and was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988 such as George Kozmetsky and Bobby Ray Inman.[28] Walker retired in 1990 due to ill health, and Michael Dell hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of Electronic Data Systems to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise.[30]
By early 1987, Dell's factory was producing 7,000 computers per month, each built to customers' specifications.[28] In 1987, the company had $70 million in annual sales and $2.1 million in net income.[28] This represented approximately a market share of 1%, compared to 30% for IBM, 8.2% for Apple Inc., 5.2% for Compaq, 5% for Olivetti, and 4.4% for Zenith Electronics.[28] The company spent $3 million, or 4% of sales, on advertising. Dell also offered journalists from major computer magazines the opportunity to test its products, which gave it further good publicity when positive articles were written in these publications.[28] Dell was known for its excellent customer service, with 90% of complaints resolved in a single phone call.[28] In early 1987, Dell began offering a computer service/repair plan by Honeywell for $35 per year.[28] Dell raised capital in a private placement in 1987.[28]
In 1988, The company changed its name from PC’s Limited to Dell Computer Corporation.[27] In June 1988, Dell raised $30 million of new capital, issuing 3.5 million shares at $8.50 each, becoming a public company via an initial public offering.[27]
In 1989, the company introduced its first laptop computer, the 316LT.[27] In 1990, the company opened a manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland to serve clients in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.[27]
In 1992, Fortune magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell, at 27 years old, the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.[31][27]
By 1993, the company had 5,000 employees.[28]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, sales of computers at retail stores by competitors increased significantly.[28] To complement its own direct sales channel, Dell signed agreements to have its computers sold at CompUSA and Staples Inc. stores.[28] However, selling via middlemen was not very profitable for Dell. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals.[32] Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994.[33] In 1996, Rollins joined Dell full-time.[34]
Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s[edit]
Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed in 1996, when Dell.com reached $1 million in daily sales within 6 months of its launch.[27] While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.[33]
Dell originally had its headquarters at 9505 Arboretum Blvd., in the Arboretum complex in northern Austin, Texas. In 1996, the company moved its headquarters to Round Rock, Texas.[35]
From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, Inc., IBM Aptiva, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out. The company attained and maintained the #1 rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to Consumer Reports, year after year, during the mid-to-late 90s through 2001. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999, with 16% market share.[36] Operating costs made up only 10% of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21% of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25% at Gateway, and 46% at Cisco.[37] In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.[5]
In the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers. The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built more cheaply than its competitors.[38] Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13% of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31% of the market. Dell's first business acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.[37]
Dell opened plants in Penang, Malaysia in 1995 and 2002,[39][40] and in Xiamen, China in 1999.[41] These facilities serve the Asian market and assemble 95% of Dell notebooks. In 1997, the company opened its second manufacturing facility in Texas and shipped its 10 millionth computer.
In May 1999, Dell opened a 260,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42]
Dell's first European manufacturing facility opened in 1990 in the Raheen Industrial Estate near Limerick, Ireland.[43] The plant was expanded in 1996 and again in 1999 with a $90 million expansion that brought the total workforce there to 5,800 people.[44]
By 2000, the Dell.com website was generating $40 million in sales per day and Dell's sales reached $25 billion per year.[28][27] Rollins became President and COO in 2001.[34]
In 2000, Dell moved its corporate headquarters and executive offices to the Las Cimas office complex in Travis County, Texas, between Austin and West Lake Hills.[45] The company leased 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) there, but in early 2002, the company announced that it would move its headquarters back to Round Rock and would sublease its offices in Las Cimas.[46] The subleases were completed in May 2003.[47]
In 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins's attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation.[48] In 2002, Dell started the Dell Direct Store model, opening kiosks in malls and airports in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company, eventually opening 140 kiosks.[49]
In 2003, the company changed its name from Dell Computer Corporation to Dell Inc. to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.[27]
In 2003, Dell consolidated its operations at its Castletroy facility, formerly occupied by Wang Laboratories and Flextronics into its Limerick facility and the Castletroy facility now operates as a movie studio.[50]
In 2004, Michael Dell resigned as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman, handing the CEO title to Kevin Rollins, who had been President and COO since 2001.[27] Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.[48]
In December 2004, Dell announced that it would build a new 750,000 square foot assembly-plant near Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million in incentives and tax breaks.[51] The facility opened in October 2005 after much controversy due to the government subsidies.[52]
Under Rollins, Dell began to loosen its ties to Microsoft and Intel. In March 2006, Dell acquired Alienware, which introduced several new items to Dell products, including processors by Advanced Micro Devices.[53] To prevent cross-market products, Dell continues to run Alienware as a separate entity, but still a wholly owned subsidiary.
Disappointing growth and Dell 2.0 (2005-2006)[edit]
In 2005, Dell came under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its revenue recognition practices.[54] Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by Donald Carty in January 2007.[55]
In 2005, sales growth slowed.[27] At its low point in 2006, the stock price had declined 40% in a year.[56] This led to management changes.[57]
The slowing sales growth was attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs,[58] but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.[59]
In 2006, despite expansions into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on U.S. corporate PC market, and desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32% of its revenue, 85% of its revenue comes from businesses, and 64% of its revenue came from North and South America. U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market was not buying pending the release of Microsoft's Windows Vista in 2007.[57][60] Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.[48]
Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in computer performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to engage in upselling. As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. Dell's customer service worsened as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure. Although, Dell originally was known for high levels of customer service, the decline in computer prices led to the company cutting costs.[61] Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting "got in the way," aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve customer service, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional "bloatware" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the "Dell Hell" prominent on Internet search engines.[56][62]
In 2006, Dell's reputation and earnings suffered when it was discovered that the company sold 12 million of computers between 2003 and 2005 that suffered from bad capacitors and leaked chemicals.[27][63][64] In August 2006, a battery recall as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire caused much negative attention for the company although eventually, Sony was found responsible for the faulty batteries.[65][66]
Dell 2.0 and downsizing[edit]
In the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell's shipments declined and it lost its market share lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard, whose Personal Systems Group was invigorated due to a restructuring initiated by CEO Mark Hurd.[37][67][27] At the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share was 13.9%, compared to 17.4% for Hewlett Packard.[68]
In 2006, Dell announced a change campaign called "Dell 2.0," reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company's products.[59][69][70] While chairman of the board after relinquishing his CEO position, Michael Dell still had significant input in the company during Rollins' years as CEO. With the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw immediate changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company.[71] As part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative, in February 2007, Michael Dell announced several initiatives and plans to improve the company's financial performance. These included elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of "bureaucracy".[72]
Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon its supply chain efficiency to sell established products at low prices, instead of being an innovator.[48][73] By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's relatively low spending on research and development as a percentage of its sales prevented it from developing products in more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and mobile devices.[74] Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized.[5]
In 2006, Dell established its Performance Analytics Group, originally known as Dell Analytics, in Bangalore, India. This division supports pricing, web analytics and supply chain operations.[75]
In late 2006, Dell opened a manufacturing facility in Chennai, India.[76]
Rollins resigns[edit]
On January 31, 2007, After 4 of 5 quarterly earnings reports were below expectations, Rollins resigned as President and CEO, receiving a $5 million severance package, and founder Michael Dell assumed the role of CEO again.[77][78][69]
Retail expansion overseas and closures in the United States[edit]
Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model, which was now cited as a disadvantage compared to rivals such as HP and Acer that also sold computers via retail stores. The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer certain electronics items that customers wanted to see before buying.[58] In early 2007, the company moved away from its direct-only sales model and experimented with mall kiosks and quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.[71][79][80]
In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Budapest and in October 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.[81] HMV's flagship Trocadero store sold Dell PCs beginning in December 2007.[82] From January 2008 the UK stores of DSGi have sold Dell products (in particular, through Currys and PC World stores).[83] Beginning in 2008, Tesco sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.[84]
In May 2007, Dell announced plans to sell its products via existing retail chains in the United States, such as Walmart.[85][86] In February 2008, Dell closed its retail locations in the United States, including its 140 kiosks and concentrated its retail presence on stores such as Walmart and Best Buy.[87][88]
In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, Officeworks (part of Coles Group), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range.[89] In October 2008, Dell opened its first stores in India.[90] Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with now defunct Harris Technology in October 2009.[91] In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for "Slashing Prices".[92] In May 2009, Dell and Dick Smith Electronics (owned by Woolworths Limited) reached an agreement to sell Dell computers within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand.[93][94] In April 2010, Dell announced the closure of the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.[95] In Germany, Dell began selling selected smartphones and notebooks via Media Markt and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.[96]
In December 2007, Dell launched, "Dell Partner Direct", a formal partner program for value-added resellers.[97]
Plant closures and competition from Asian manufacturers (2007-2008)[edit]
Dell originally manufactured computers in house and was a pioneer in the "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.[98] In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.[99][100] As PCs became more commoditized, Dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers.
In 2007, the laptop segment was the fastest-growing segment of the PC market, but Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing laptop sales in big box stores.[101][56] Dell was getting trapped in the commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.[58]
In May 2007, Dell moved desktop and PowerEdge server manufacturing for the South American market from the Eldorado do Sul, Brazil plant opened in 1999, to a new plant in Hortolândia.[102][103]
In January 2008, the company announced the shutdown of its Edmonton, Alberta office, laying off 900 workers.[104] In total, Dell announced 8,800 layoffs in 2007–2008, or 10% of its workforce.[105][106]
In March 2008, Dell closed its manufacturing facilities in Austin, Texas.[107][108]
On April 23, 2008, as part of a cost-cutting measure, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in Ottawa, Ontario, reducing staff by approximately 1,100 employees. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the City of Ottawa won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers and add a new building. These plans were reversed, due to a high Canadian dollar that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell's turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs.[109]
By September 2008, the company desired to outsource manufacturing.[110] In September 2008, Dell approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell manufacturing facilities, with the plan of closing the sales within 18 months.[111][112]
On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to a new plant in Łódź, Poland by January 2010.[113] The European Union gave Dell a €55 million incentive package in conjunction with the move.[114] In December 2009, Dell announced the sale of the facility to Foxconn and outsourced manufacturing, becoming a customer of Foxconn.[115] The closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland resulted in the loss of 1,900 jobs.[116]
In July 2009, Dell closed its manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee.[42][117]
In November 2010, Dell ceased operations at its plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which received $280 million in incentives from the state, and Dell's contract with the state required it to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions. The facility was sold to Herbalife.[118][119][120]
Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's factories overseas. The Miami, Florida facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation.
Acquisition and sale of Perot Systems[edit]
In 2009, Dell acquired Perot Systems and entered the market for IT services. Perot Systems was sold to NTT Data in 2016 at an $800 million loss.[121][122][123]
Competition from tablet computers (2010-2012)[edit]
In 2009, Dell entered the smartphone market with the launch of the Mini 3i in Brazil and China.[27][124]
In April 2010, the release of Apple's iPad tablet computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs.[125] Dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android.[126] The Dell Streak tablet, introduced in 2010, was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated operating system, numerous software bugs, and low resolution screen.[127][27] InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers.[128] Dell responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets.[48] Dell also went on an acquisition spree in 2010-2011, acquiring companies in the storage and software markets including Boomi, Exanet, InSite One, KACE, Ocarina Networks, Scalent, Compellent, Secure Works, RNA Networks, and Force10 Networks.[27]
Loss of market share and expansion to other products[edit]
In 2011, with a shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo to fall to #3 in market share.[129]
The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to a $65 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2012.[130][131] In December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.[132]
In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell and Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design, Dell's customer service and reputation had been slipping.[133][134] In the fourth quarter of 2012, Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13% of operating profits in the PC industry, behind Apple Inc.'s Macintosh that took 45%, 7% at Hewlett Packard, 6% at Lenovo and Asus, and 1% for Acer.[135]
Dell attempted to offset its declining PC business, which still accounted for half of its revenue and generated steady cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2012,[136] by expanding into the enterprise market with servers, networking, software, and services.[137] It avoided many of the acquisition writedowns and management turnover that plagued its chief rival Hewlett Packard.[138]
Despite spending $13 billion on acquisitions to diversify its portfolio beyond hardware between 2009 and 2012,[139] the company was unable to convince the market that it could thrive in the post-PC world,[138] and the company suffered continued declines in revenue and share price.[140][141][142][143] Dell's market share in the corporate segment was no longer the "moat" against rivals that it was previously.[144]
2013 buyout[edit]
On February 5, 2013, Dell announced that Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners, aided by a $2 billion loan from Microsoft, would take the company private in a $24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal, the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007 financial crisis.[145][146][147]
In March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn offered to buy the company;[148] however, in April 2013, Blackstone withdrew its offer, citing deteriorating business conditions.[149][150] Other private equity firms such as KKR & Co. and TPG Capital declined to submit alternative bids for Dell, citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures, and a bidding war never materialized.[139] Michael Dell and Silver Lake later increased their offer to $25 billion and closed the acquisition.[151][152][153]
After the buyout, Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Program that was expected to reduce the workforce by up to 7%. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that it was speculated that Dell might be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.[154]
India website and expansion[edit]
In June 2013, Dell India started an e-commerce website, enabling customers to order online.[155][156]
In 2015, Dell announced plans to expand its the capacity its facility in Chennai of 3 million PCs per year.[157]
Partnership with EMC (2001-2011) and 2016 merger with EMC[edit]




Dell–EMC merger wordmark introduced in 2016.






Dell Latitude E5570, a 2016 model.


In 2001, Dell and EMC entered into a partnership whereby both companies jointly design products and Dell provided support for certain EMC products including midrange storage systems, such as fibre channel and iSCSI storage area networks. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.[158]
On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of the strategic partnership with EMC. In addition, Dell expanded its product line-up by adding the EMC Celerra NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems and partnered on a new line of data deduplication products as part of its TierDisk family of data storage devices.[159]
On October 17, 2011, Dell discontinued reselling all EMC storage products, ending the partnership 2 years early.[160][161]
On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire EMC for $67 billion, in the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[162][163][164]
EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management Corporation, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize.[165][166][167][168][169]
The deal was approved by major investors including Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners.[170]
On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the acquisition of EMC Corp., the largest technology merger in history and became a subsidiary of Dell Technologies.[171][166][172][173][174][175][176]

Marketing[edit]




The company sponsors Dell Diamond, the home stadium of the Round Rock Express, the AAA minor league baseball affiliate of the Texas Rangers major league baseball team


Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, mail-order catalogs, and newspapers. Some of Dell's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors.
A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor Ben Curtis playing the part of "Steven", a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!"[240]
A subsequent advertising campaign featured interns at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).
In 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from BBDO to Working Mother Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from The Flaming Lips and Devo who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad "Work it Out". Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan "Yours is here" to say that it customizes computers to fit customers' requirements.[241]
Beginning in 2011, Dell began hosting a conference in Austin, Texas at the Austin Convention Center titled "Dell World". The event featured new technology and services provided by Dell and Dell's partners. In 2017, the event was moved to Las Vegas.[242]
Dell slogans[edit]

Get more out of now (1984–1989)
Easy as Dell (1989-2001)
Dell. Purely You (2001–2006)
Be direct (2006-2007)
Yours is Here (2007–2011)
The power to do more (2011–present)[243]

Environmental record[edit]
Dell reports its environmental performance in an annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report that follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) protocol.[244]
All of Dell's facilities have permanent recycling centers and in 2005, the company had a reuse/recycle rate of 85%.[245] In 2006, Dell launched a free electronics recycling program.[245]
On February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its "Recycling Works" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.[246]
On June 5, 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company.[247]
On July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009. The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.[248]
On October 19, 2007, the company introduced the term "The Re-Generation" during a round table in London commemorating World Environment Day. "The Re-Generation" refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to make a difference in improving the world's environment. Dell also planned to lead in setting an environmental standard for the technology industry.[249]
In 2008, the company achieved carbon neutrality by purchasing renewable energy credits.[245]
In 2008, Dell announced that its Round Rock headquarters would be 100% powered by green energy, with 60% of energy needs powered by wind farms from TXU Energy and 40% of energy needs powered by the Austin Community Landfill gas-to-energy plant operated by Waste Management.[250]
In 2009, the company was recognized as the top brand for environmental technology in the information technology sector.[245]
In 2012, Dell ranked 5th on Greenpeace's ranking of electronics makers, with a score of 4.6/10, with the low score due in part to the non-removal of polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and Brominated flame retardants from Dell's products, as promised.[251]
In March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen calling for Dell’s founder and CEO Michael Dell to ‘drop the toxics’ and claiming that Dell’s aspiration to be ‘the greenest technology company on the planet’ was ‘hypocritical’.[252][253][254]
In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Dell the 8th highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.[255]
Criticism[edit]
See also: Lawsuits involving Dell Inc.
Upgrade requirements[edit]
In the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily ATX motherboards and PSU to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).[256][257]
Customer service complaints[edit]
In 2005, customer complaints about Dell more than doubled to 1,533, after earnings grew 52% that year.[74] In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service. Issues included call transfers of more than 45% of calls and long wait times.[258] Later in 2006, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150 million.[259]
Accounting practices[edit]
On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of $50–150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share.[260] The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted.[261][262] It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices. In 2010, Dell paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.[263][264]
Error pricing on Taiwanese website[edit]
In July 2009, Dell apologized after drawing the ire of the Taiwanese Consumer Protection Commission for twice refusing to honor a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its Taiwanese website, which Dell claims was in error. In the first instance, Dell offered a 19" LCD panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1,900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honor the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) per customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1 million (US$31,250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price. The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes, as Dell said the company mis-priced its products twice in Taiwanese website within 3 weeks.[265][266]
Lawsuit by Carl Icahn regarding bid by Michael Dell[edit]
After Michael Dell made a $24.4 billion buyout bid in August 2013, activist shareholder Carl Icahn sued the company and its board in an attempt to derail the bid and promote his own forthcoming offer.[267]
Criticism of Dell's claims regarding laptop security[edit]
In 2008, Dell received criticism for marketing its laptop computers as the "World's Most Secure Commercial Laptops". At Lenovo's request, the Better Business Bureau evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support such claim.[268]
Self-signed root certificate[edit]
In November 2015 it emerged that several Dell computers had shipped with an identical pre-installed root certificate known as "eDellRoot".[269] This raised such security risks as attackers impersonating HTTPS-protected websites such as Google and Bank of America and malware being signed with the certificate to bypass Microsoft software filtering.[269] Dell apologised and offered a removal tool.[270][271]
Tracking of customers using Dell Foundation Services[edit]
Also in November 2015, a researcher discovered that customers with diagnostic program Dell Foundation Services could be digitally tracked using the unique service tag number assigned to them by the program, even if a customer enabled private browsing and deleted their browser cookies.[272]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
A Dell employee, Guy Chapman, who is formerly a Wikipedia administrator (JzG), was found to have been removing references on Wikipedia to competitors of Dell Research.[273]
