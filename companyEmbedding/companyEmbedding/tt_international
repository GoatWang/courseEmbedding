Our Background

					TT International was incorporated in 1984 as T.T. Importers and Exporters Pte Ltd and later changed its name to TT International Limited. We have since become one of Singapore's leading international traders of consumer electronics. Through the years of market penetration and development, TT has gained a firm foothold in the economies of emerging markets worldwide. Our wide spectrum of consumer electronics covers a range of over 4,000 models - for examples, see products.

					In 1999, TT started assembling and aggressive marketing of "AKIRA", our very own house brand of consumer electronics. AKIRA has a very comprehensive range of audio-visual and audio products as well as household appliances that caters specially for the modern living needs of households, businesses and communities worldwide.

					TT had also diversified into providing third-party warehousing and logistics services.

					The new millennium marked a very significant milestone for TT as TT was listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in June 2000.

					Following the Company listing in SGX, TT had further developed a new business of localized assembly and Original Design Manufacturing (ODM). With this new step, we seek to complement and strengthen our existing branded and AKIRA businesses.

					In 2007, TT announced the Acquisition of the Furniture Companies from Novena Holdings Ltd. As part of the acquisition, Novena Furnishing Centre Pte Ltd, Castilla Design Pte Ltd, Living Lifestyle Pte Ltd, Natural Living Pte Ltd, The White Collection Pte Ltd and Poya Communication Pte Ltd (collectively "Furniture Companies") had become the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. The shares of the Furniture Companies are held by the Company via Furniture & Furnishings Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TT.

Our Background

					TT International was incorporated in 1984 as T.T. Importers and Exporters Pte Ltd and later changed its name to TT International Limited. We have since become one of Singapore's leading international traders of consumer electronics. Through the years of market penetration and development, TT has gained a firm foothold in the economies of emerging markets worldwide. Our wide spectrum of consumer electronics covers a range of over 4,000 models - for examples, see products.

					In 1999, TT started assembling and aggressive marketing of "AKIRA", our very own house brand of consumer electronics. AKIRA has a very comprehensive range of audio-visual and audio products as well as household appliances that caters specially for the modern living needs of households, businesses and communities worldwide.

					TT had also diversified into providing third-party warehousing and logistics services.

					The new millennium marked a very significant milestone for TT as TT was listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in June 2000.

					Following the Company listing in SGX, TT had further developed a new business of localized assembly and Original Design Manufacturing (ODM). With this new step, we seek to complement and strengthen our existing branded and AKIRA businesses.

					In 2007, TT announced the Acquisition of the Furniture Companies from Novena Holdings Ltd. As part of the acquisition, Novena Furnishing Centre Pte Ltd, Castilla Design Pte Ltd, Living Lifestyle Pte Ltd, Natural Living Pte Ltd, The White Collection Pte Ltd and Poya Communication Pte Ltd (collectively "Furniture Companies") had become the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. The shares of the Furniture Companies are held by the Company via Furniture & Furnishings Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TT.
