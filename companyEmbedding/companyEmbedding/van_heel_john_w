John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Thanks, Effie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. We are pleased that you are with us to discuss our third quarter 2017 performance. Today, we will start with a review of our third quarter results and update on our growth strategy, and then the outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2017.
Then I'll turn the call over to Brian D'Ambrosia, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide additional details on our financial results. Despite a difficult operating environment, the return of winter weather late in the third quarter, combined with our effective cost control and solid integration of recent acquisitions allowed us to achieve third quarter earnings at the midpoint of our guidance.
Fiscal year-to-date, we've been able to capitalize on this challenging market and accelerate our acquisition and greenfield activity with the opening of 67 net new stores and the pending acquisition of 16 additional Car-X locations. Combined, these acquisitions represent $150 million in expected annualized sales and 16% sales growth. These acquisitions not only build a strong foundation for future profitability, but have also allowed us to add to our store footprint in new Southern markets.

It is our ability to accelerate acquisition growth, particularly in tough years for the industry in our geographies that allows Monro to guide to flat earnings per share for the year despite negative comparable store sales, underscoring the strength of our business model.
Turning to our third quarter results. Sales increased 21% to $288 million. Comparable store sales increased 2.3%, with sequential improvement month-to-month. Comps in October declined 4.1% and improved to negative 2% in November. And as mild weather gave way to snow in December, comparable store sales for the month in December increased by 11% when adjusted for one additional selling day in the month, as Christmas shifted into our fiscal fourth quarter.
Traffic for the quarter increased 2% driven by a strong December, but with flat traffic in October and November. Winter weather in December also unlocked pent-up demand for tires, with comparable store tire sales in the third quarter increasing 6% led by unit growth, particularly in December when units increased approximately 25%.
Larger ticket and discretionary service category such as brakes, alignments and front-end shocks remained under pressure, but showed meaningful improvement from prior quarters. General maintenance was flat for the quarter.
From a geographic perspective, our Southern markets continue to outperform in the months of October and November. But with the late arrival of winter weather, our Northern markets significantly outperformed in the month of December.
As we enter the fourth quarter, we've seen a return to the milder temperatures, which have once again impacted our top-line, particularly as we lap our most difficult comp of the previous year. Quarter-to-date comparable store sales adjusted for one less selling day in the quarter are negative 7%, compared to an increase of 7% in the same period last year. That is driven primarily by a decrease in tire units, which more than offset positive comps in the brake category. Also, sales in the first week of fiscal February were up 1%. We expect comps to improve as we move through the fourth quarter as comparison significantly ease. Last year's February and March combined comparable store sales were negative 3.4%.
Turning now to gross margin, as previously guided to, third quarter gross margin declined by 250 basis points versus the prior year due to the impact of fiscal 2017 acquisitions, including the newly acquired tire wholesale business. Gross margin was also impacted by higher tire sales, which carry a lower margin than our service category. However, on a comparable store basis, gross margin was flat year-over-year due to lower material cost, primarily related to tires and leverage on fixed expenses. As expected, the decline in gross margin was more than offset by 280 basis points of leverage on SG&A. On a comparable store basis, when excluding due diligence cost, third quarter total operating expenses increased less than 1% year-over-year, a result of our effective cost control.
Now, I'd like to provide a brief update on our digital initiatives. We continue to see strong increases in our online appointments, as well as improved collection and use of customer email, feedback and reviews. We are pleased to report that customer reviews collected in the third quarter continue to post a 94% approval rating with a total customer satisfaction score of 4.5 out of 5, results we are very proud of. We continue to develop and implement improvements to our customer experience, both online and in-store through enhanced tools and training for our store employees.
Turning now to our growth strategy. The integration of our fiscal 2017 acquisition is progressing in line with our plan. As previously announced, the third quarter included results from the Clark Tire acquisition, a 26-store chain of retail and commercial tire and service location, and a retread plant in Western North Carolina.

As a reminder, the transaction was completed in mid-September and also includes four wholesale tire centers that continue to operate under the Tires Now brand name. We've been very pleased with the results from Clark Tire thus far and continue to expect the transaction will add approximately $85 million in annualized sales, representing a sales mix of 50% retail and commercial, and 50% wholesale.
We also continue to see solid results from the acquisition of McGee Auto Service & Tires, a chain of 29 retail and commercial locations and a retread facility in Florida, which we completed in the first quarter. McGee remains on plan to deliver $50 million in annualized sales, representing a sales mix of 40% service and 60% tires.
As a reminder, these acquisitions are strategically significant because they expand our retail and commercial business by 55 stores and $90 million in sales in the key markets of Florida and North Carolina, as well as add $45 million in tire wholesale business, which combined increases both our scale and market share.
They increase our tire unit purchases by approximately 25%, expanding our tire assortment and strengthening our purchasing power. As we previously stated, a $1 decrease in cost-per-tire is nearly $4 million in annual cost savings. They also allow us to directly distribute tires to approximately 100 of our stores, or roughly 10% of our chain, strengthening our position as an independent dealer and reducing our reliance on distributors, thereby allowing us to maximize profitability, while creating new organic growth opportunities in the wholesale business. And they expand our acquisition opportunities to include competitors with integrated retail, commercial and wholesale operations.
Our strategy with respect to our commercial and wholesale operations, in the near term, is to integrate, strengthen and grow them in their respective markets. Longer term, we will evaluate how we can further leverage them across the other 24 states and distribution centers we operate in. We believe these acquisitions will continue to strengthen our competitiveness in the market, while providing another valuable avenue of growth over the next several years.
I'm also pleased to announce today that we've signed a definitive agreement to acquire 16 stores from a Car-X franchisee, which includes 13 location in Illinois and three locations in Iowa. These stores are expected to generate $15 million in annualized sales, representing a sales mix of 75% service and 25% tires. The stores will continue to operate under the Car-X banner and the transaction is expected to close this coming March.
Fiscal year-to-date acquisitions completed and announced are expected to add approximately $150 million in annualized sales and represent 16% sales growth. As we've recently discussed, we believe the consumer remains under pressure with stagnant wage growth, increasing rents and resets on healthcare deductible and increasing premiums impacting their spending. This is adding to the choppiness of the market, which is reflected in our recent top-line results.
However, it is this challenging market which has helped us accelerate our acquisition activities. At present, we continue to have more than 10 NDAs signed, each of them representing between 5 stores and 40 stores within existing markets. Looking ahead, we expect the current operating environment will continue to create favorable, accretive acquisition opportunities.
We've also continued to make progress on our goal of opening 20 to 40 greenfield locations in fiscal 2017. In the third quarter, we opened nine stores, bringing our total to 25 new greenfield locations fiscal year to-date. We expect to open five additional stores in the fourth quarter. We have slowed the pace of greenfield activity in the fourth quarter, given the integration work we currently have underway with our 2017 acquisition.

As a reminder, greenfield stores for us include acquisitions of one to four stores. These store additions help drive scale on a local level by allowing us to increase store density in existing markets at very attractive costs. We will continue to capitalize on these opportunities into fiscal 2018.
Now, let's turn to our outlook. In light of weak comparable store sales in January over a strong comp last year, we have taken a cautious approach to our fourth quarter guidance. We expect fourth quarter comparable store sales to be in the range of a decline of 2.5% to 1% versus an increase of 50 basis points last year. We expect comparable store sales to improve as we lap easier comparison for the remainder of the quarter.
As a reminder, comparable store sales combined for February and March of last year were negative 3.4%. The low end of our comp guidance assumes that we recover one-half of this decline, while the high end assumes we recover the full 3.4% decline. As is always the case this time of year, winter weather and snow will be a major driver.
Based on this comp guidance and contributions from our recent and announced acquisitions, we anticipate total sales in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $262 million to $268 million. Further, we expect fourth quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.44, reflecting slight dilution from our fiscal 2017 acquisition. This compares to earnings per share of $0.42 in the fourth quarter of last year.
Based upon our updated fourth quarter guidance, we are lowering our expectations for fiscal 2017 comparable store sales to a decline of 3% to a decline of 2.5%, compared to our previous guidance, which called for a decline of 2.5% to 1.5%. We expect fiscal 2017 total sales to be in the range of $1.032 billion to $1.038 billion.
We have also updated our fiscal 2017 earnings guidance to $1.95 to $2 per share compared to our previous range of $2 to $2.10 per share to reflect the lower comparable store sales and slight dilution from our recent acquisitions in the fourth quarter. This guidance is based on 33.4 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The midpoint of the full-year earnings guidance represents an operating margin of 12% and EBITDA of approximately $172 million.
As I discussed with you on our last call and as you saw this quarter, the commercial and wholesale businesses we acquired in fiscal 2017 operate at a lower gross margin than our retail business. However, they also require a lower level of SG&A expenses. Therefore, we continue to expect that this change in our sales mix will reduce gross margins by approximately 250 basis points and be offset by a similar reduction in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. This was the case during the quarter, and we expect to continue to see this trend until we begin to anniversary these acquisitions next year.
Said another way, our base business operates at about 40% to 41% gross margin. And in the fiscal 2017 acquisitions, we've added commercial and wholesale business, which operate around a 15% gross margin. With commercial and wholesale at about 10% of overall sales, that 25% difference in gross margin will result in a 250-basis-point decrease in our overall gross margin. However, that will be offset by lower SG&A to generate those sales, minimizing the impact on operating margin.
In terms of earnings going forward, we expect the $105 million of retail and commercial annualized sales from our fiscal 2017 acquisition to contribute similarly to prior acquisitions. We expect the acquired wholesale business to contribute EBITDA between $4 million and $5 million, including improvements in tire costs and distribution efficiencies.
Importantly, our outlook for the industry remains positive and we expect to continue to strengthen going forward. Vehicles 13 years old and older continue to account for 29% of our traffic, in line with the previous quarter and up from 27% last year. These vehicles produce average ticket similar to our overall average, demonstrating that customers continue to invest in and maintain their vehicles, even as they advance in age.

The other significant driver is that total vehicles in operation are expected to grow 9% by 2020, with vehicles in our sweet spot of six years old and older representing the majority of the growth. At the same time, the number of service base is expected to continue with slow, steady decline. These trends should represent meaningful tailwind to our comparable store sales over the next several years. Before I hand the call over to Brian, I would like to provide commentary on some of the trends we expect to see in fiscal 2018.
First, we expect strong contributions from our fiscal 2017 acquisition, which represent approximately 16% annualized sales growth. We believe comparable store sales will benefit from easier comparisons, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2018. We also expect to sign a new oil supply agreement in the first half of fiscal 2018, resulting in annualized sales of $2 million to $3 million – annualized savings of $2 million to $3 million.
We believe our purchasing power and cost competitiveness will continue to strengthen, particularly with respect to tires based on the 25% increase in annual tire unit purchases we realized from our recent acquisitions. However, this benefit may be offset by upcoming price increases from tire manufacturers.
To give you some detail, recent increases in raw materials have led many tire manufacturers to announce price increases in the mid-single digits beginning with February 2017 orders. However, it's worth noting that not every manufacturer has announced the price increase, and some manufacturers are offsetting these price increases with additional volume rebate.
We expect the overall supply of tires will continue to increase, making the market more competitive. Given our increasing scale, we believe we are in a strong position to manage these higher costs, but it's still too early to provide specific guidance. And lastly, fiscal 2018 is a 53-week year. We estimate that this will benefit comparable store sales by approximately 2% and earnings per share by approximately $0.09.
Before I conclude, I want to briefly address questions I received regarding potential new government policy changes. Quite simply, we don't know what the impact of these changes will have on Monro until we see the exact details in government's plans. I can tell you that a reduction in the corporate tax rate would be a significant benefit, given that our effective tax rate is around 38% on $100 million of pre-tax income.
As far as possible, border adjustments or taxes, we import about two-thirds of our parts and a little more than one-third of our tire units. These import tires are primarily at the entry level and are lower cost relative to branded tires.
As you've seen, we continue to drive significant scale across our business, which gives us more flexibility in our supply chain, putting us in an enviable position – an enviable competitive position to manage through any potential cost pressures. Having said that, we do hope that there are adults in the room hearing these policy discussions as they may be far reaching, impacting the majority of U.S. companies across multiple industries, not to mention significant price increases to U.S. consumers.
Our investors should also take comfort in the fact that any additional pressure on our industry whether from tire cost increases, changes in import policy, or a continued consumer pressure, will create additional acquisition opportunities over time, which will only strengthen our competitive advantages.
To conclude, I would like to thank our entire team for their solid execution this quarter. We greatly appreciate all of their work.
Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Brian D'Ambrosia, for a review of our financial results. Brian?

Brian J. D'Ambrosia - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Thanks, John. Sales for the quarter increased 20.6% and $49.3 million. New stores defined as stores opened or acquired after March 28, 2015, added $46.2 million, including sales of $43.8 million from fiscal 2016 and 2017 acquisitions.
Comparable store sales increased 2.3%, partially offsetting this was a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately $1.9 million. There were 90 selling days in the current quarter and 89 in the prior year third quarter. Adjusted for days, comparable store sales increased 1.1%.
Year-to-date sales increased $54.9 million and 7.7%. New stores contributed $83.4 million of the increase including $77.1 million from fiscal 2016 and 2017 acquisitions. Largely offsetting this was a decrease in comparable store sales of 3.1%. Additionally, there was a decrease in sales from closed doors of approximately $6.5 million.
In a limited number of transactions for the delivery of tires to national account customers, we received a delivery commission. Historically, we recorded these as a gross transaction in sales and cost of sales, netting to the amount of delivery commission in gross profit. We believe that net accounting is more appropriate for these transactions. Therefore, beginning in fiscal 2017, these transactions will be recorded on the sales line at the amount of the delivery commission. The impact of the adjustments, which lowered sales and cost of sales by equal amounts was $3.1 million and $7.4 million for the quarter and 9 months ended December 2016 respectively. These adjustments were not material to the comparable periods of the prior year or to previously disclosed comparable store sales percentages.
There were 271 selling days for the first 9 months of this fiscal year and 270 last fiscal year. Adjusted for days, comparable store sales decreased 3.5%. At December 24, 2016, the company had 1,098 company-operated stores and 132 franchise locations, as compared with 1,031 company-operated stores and 138 franchise locations at December 26, 2015.
During the quarter ended December 2016, we added 9 company-operated stores and closed 8, including 2 damaged locations expected to reopen in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we added 81 company-operated stores including one purchase from an existing franchisee and closed 12 stores. Additionally, two franchise locations have closed, and we purchased one location from an existing franchisee as a company-operated store.
Gross profit for the quarter ended December 2016 was $105.6 million, or $36.6% of sales as compared with $93.4 million, or 39.1% of sales for the quarter ended December 2015. The decrease in gross margin for the quarter was primarily due to the fiscal 2017 acquisitions, which have a higher material cost of sales than the retail business.
On a consolidated basis, labor cost decreased slightly as a percentage of sales due to the impact of positive comparable store sales. Distribution and occupancy cost decreased moderately as a percentage of sales as we gain leverage on these largely fixed cost over higher overall sales. On a comparable store basis, gross margin for the quarter ended December 2016 remain flat with the prior quarter as lower product cost, particularly tires, offset a shift in mix from higher margin service categories to the lower margin tire category.
Gross profit for the nine months ended December 2016 was $303.7 million, or 39.5% of sales as compared with $293.8 million, or 41.1% of sales for the nine months ended December 2015. The year-to-date decrease in gross margin was largely due to the fiscal 2017 acquisitions as described for the quarter.
Additionally, labor costs increased slightly and distribution and occupancy costs decreased slightly as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year. On a comparable store basis, gross margin for the nine months ended December 2016 remain flat with the same period in the prior year at 41.2% of sales.

Operating expenses for the quarter ended December 2016 increased $5.6 million and over $72.5 million, or 25.2% of sales as compared with $66.9 million, or 28% of sales for the quarter ended December 2015, primarily due to increased expenses for new stores, partially offset by reduced due diligence costs.
On a comparable store basis and excluding due diligence costs, total operating expense dollars in the quarter ended December 2016 increased less than 1% from the prior-year period. We believe that this demonstrates the effectiveness of our strong cost control in a period of soft sales.
For the nine months ended December 2016, operating expenses increased by $7.7 million to $207.4 million, or 26.9% of sales as compared with $199.7 million and 27.9% of sales for the prior period. The dollar increase primarily relates to increased expenses for new stores, partially offset by reduced due diligence costs.
Operating income for the quarter ending December 2016 of $33.1 million increased by 25.1% as compared to operating income of approximately $26.4 million for the quarter ended December 2015, an increase as a percentage of sales from 11.1% to 11.5%. Operating income for the nine months ended December 2016 of approximately $96.3 million increased by 2.3% as compared to operating income of approximately $94.1 million for the nine months ended December 2015 and decreased as a percentage of sales from 13.2% to 12.5%.
Net interest expense for the quarter ended December 2016 increased $1.4 million as compared to the same period last year, which increased from 1.6% to 1.8% as a percentage of sales. The weighted-average debt outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by approximately $99 million as compared to the third quarter of last year. This increase is due to an increase in debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility, as well as an increase in capital lease debt recorded in connection with the fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 acquisitions. The weighted-average interest rate increased by approximately 20 basis points as compared to the third quarter of the prior year.
For the nine months ended December 2016, net interest expense increased by $3.2 million as compared to the same period in the prior year and increased from 1.5% to 1.8% as a percentage of sales for the same period. Weighted-average debt increased by approximately $72 million and the weighted-average interest rate increased by approximately 20 basis points as compared to the same period in the prior year.
The effective tax rate was 37.2% of pre-tax income for the quarter ended December 2016, and 33.1% for the quarter ended December 2015. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 2016 and December 2015 was 37.1% and 36.7% respectively of pre-tax income.
Net income for the current quarter of $17.6 million increased 15.3% from net income for the quarter ended December 2015. Earnings per share on a diluted basis for the quarter ended December 2016 of $0.53 increased 15.2%, as compared to last year's $0.46. For the nine months ended December 2016, net income of $51.9 million decreased 2% and diluted earnings per share decreased 1.9% from $1.59 to $1.56.
Our balance sheet continues to be strong. Our current ratio at 1.1:1 is comparable to last year's third quarter and to year-end fiscal 2016. Inventory turns at December 2016 improved modestly as compared to year-end and third quarter of last year.
In the first nine months of this year, we generated approximately $102 million of cash flow from operating activities and increased our debt under our revolver by approximately $81 million. Capital lease and financing obligations increased $33 million due primarily to the accounting for our fiscal 2016 and 2017 acquisitions. At the end of the third quarter, debt consisted of $185 million of outstanding revolver debt and $210 million of capital leases and financing obligations.

As a result of the fiscal 2017 borrowings, our debt-to-capital ratio, including capital leases, increased to 41% at December 2016 from 34% at March 2016. Without capital and financing leases, our debt-to-capital ratio was 24% at the end of December 2016 and 16% at March 2016. Under our revolving credit facility, we have $600 million that is committed through January 2021.
Additionally, we have $100 million accordion feature included in the revolving credit agreement. We are currently borrowing at LIBOR plus 100 basis points and have approximately $388 million of availability, not counting the accordion.
We are fully compliant with all of our debt covenants and have plenty of room under our financial covenants to add additional debt for acquisitions without any issues. All of this, as well as the flexibility built into our debt agreement, allows us to take advantage of more and larger acquisitions and makes it easy for us to get acquisitions done quickly.
During the first nine months of this year, we spent approximately $28 million on CapEx, approximately $8 million in the first quarter and $10 million in each of the second and third quarters, and $134 million on acquisitions, which also includes the small one to four store deals.
Depreciation and amortization totaled approximately $33 million, and we received $2 million from the exercise of stock options. We paid about $17 million in dividends. This concludes my formal remarks on the financial statements.
With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session

Thank you. We'll go first to Bret Jordan of Jefferies.
David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC
Hey. Good afternoon, guys. It's David Kelley in for Bret this morning. Just wondering if you could provide some quick commentary on regional performance delta in January and February, maybe what you're seeing in Northern versus Southern markets, and if you've seen any change from December to January in some of your Southern stores that'll be great?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Sure. In January and February, the Southern markets continue to outperform. Obviously, when you look at our January and February of last year, we sold a lot of tires because we finally – last year we got a little bit of winter weather in January. So, that's really skewing the result I think. Overall, like we said, the South was flat for the quarter, in the third quarter, and that is with some impact early in that quarter in October from Hurricane Matthew, which impacted those stores primarily. So, for January and February I think those trends are continuing. The South is continuing to outperform.
David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up on that. You mentioned tires, any significant performance shifts in other specific categories? Just looking again kind of end of year or two, what we're seeing in January year-to-date?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Well, and I called out during my prepared remarks that the brake category quarter-to-date in these first five weeks is positive. I think it's plus 2% on a positive last year, and that certainly is a much better run rate than what we saw earlier this fiscal year.
David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC
Okay Great. Perfect. And then one more and I'll pass it along. Any color on, I guess, some of the multiples you're seeing in the acquisition market, any significant changes there either up or down? That would be great as well.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
No. In the 5 to 40 stores that we've talked about here where we have more than 10 NDAs still, we're not seeing any changes in the multiples. What I will say is that we do buy-off of trailing EBITDA. And in a year like this, trailing EBITDA is pressured. So, prices overall are reflecting that and getting better.

David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC
All right. Thank you. Appreciate the commentary.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Sure. Thank you.
Operator
We'll move next to Rick Nelson of Stephens.
Rick Nelson - Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Good morning.
Rick Nelson - Stephens, Inc.
I'd like to follow-up on guidance for the fourth quarter, which implies EBITDA margin down about 100 basis points we're calculating. If you could tell us what the drivers are to that?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Yeah. It's simply deleveraged from the sales adjustment. The impact in the change in our guidance reflects the fact that we had anticipated a positive comp in the fourth quarter here, and given the start in January, we needed to revise that. So, it's just basically that impact. If you take that, that's basically a 3.5% comp store change, comp store sales change on the low-end and the high-end. And if you look at that versus the sort of $0.075 for every 1% comp for the year, you'll basically get $0.06 or $0.07 in that (38:18).
Rick Nelson - Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Thanks for that color, John. Also, I'd like to ask you about these tire price increases, so you said some of the manufacturers are trying to put through mid-single digit growth. Do you think those types of increases, do they stick? And if you could talk about your ability to pass those on to the consumer?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Sure. They certainly stick a lot less with the company that's growing their tire unit purchases by 25% like us. And the other thing is, we'll see what happens to commodities going forward. The increases in commodities kind of accelerated late in the calendar year. So, we'll see if that continues.
In terms of passing them along, I think there's two things I would say is first, we will certainly try to pass any increases that we're seeing along, and I would expect competitors, particularly smaller competitors, to need to do that, given the choppy and more difficult operating environment. So, what we're looking for is if our costs go up less than theirs, and you try to pass it along, maybe we get some help from the margin side. But we'll have to see.
In the past, if we were putting through price increases, we might be able to pass half of that along historically or half of the announced increases along. And if we do better on our increases, we'll look to protect first our gross profit in terms of dollars per tire, and then we'll look to see if we can manage cost to get some benefit there. But it will be a pressure that certainly wasn't there when we had this call in October.
Rick Nelson - Stephens, Inc.
I think back in October, you had talked about a $1 per unit cost advantage per tire.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Right. I mean, in this case, I'm not issuing guidance or maybe that might be more or like the best result as opposed to the base result going forward. I don't know, We'll certainly update at the end when we issue guidance for fiscal 2018. And we're working hard to make sure that our increase in unit purchases is going to pay-off for us and our stockholders.
Rick Nelson - Stephens, Inc.
All right, great. Hey, thanks a lot and good luck.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.

Up next from Oppenheimer, we'll hear from Brian Nagel.
David Bellinger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hi. This is David Bellinger on for Brian. I have a few quick questions. So, first on the January accounts being down about 7%. How should we interpret that, that bascially sales slowdown? Did a strong December shift sales at a January? And basically, how meaningful is January in terms of Q4? Are tires or other categories more pronounced versus other quarters?

John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Yeah. So, sure. I think the short story on January is that we were up against a big comp in the prior year, driven by some recovery of sales last year from a weak third quarter. And this year, we, certainly, had a big spike in December, and came in and saw some warmer weather throughout our markets in January. We haven't had much snow. And so I think running up against the high conflict we had last year, it's just – we gave most of that back.
So, I think what's important as we pointed out is the February and March comparisons get much more favorable. February has started out in the first week at plus 1%, and so I expect that our trends should improve as the quarter goes forward. I talked about the brake category being positive, on positive sales last year. And I would expect we have some tire unit opportunity, particularly with some snow as the quarter moves on here.
David Bellinger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Okay. And then just following-up on that. So, clearly a normalized winter ahead of – no real help to December comps. Just when you stacked it up to past winters, with the colder temperatures. I know it's tough to quantify. But in your opinion, could that December and winter period been harsh enough to propel and sort of a longer tail for auto services demand into the coming spring and summer months ahead?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Well, I think our comps were weak at the beginning of this fiscal year. So, we've at least gotten some winter weather during this winter. Not enough of it. Certainly, it would have been great had it come in November as well because that is the biggest tire selling month of the year.
So, before I make predictions about next year, I would hope that we continue to see some cold weather and some snow, which gets plows out on the road and creates potholes. That really helps lay the groundwork for a strong first half of the year.
I think regardless, I'm optimistic about the first half of the year next year, given the very favorable comparisons that we'll be up against.
David Bellinger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Got it. I appreciate you taking my questions. Thanks, John.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Sure.

We'll go next to Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hello, and good morning too. I want to first revisit the question that Rick asked about EBIT margin, implied EBIT margin in the fourth quarter. We're just trying to process some of the guidance that you gave in interest and taxes and such. But it looks like you've got EBIT margin implied down about as much as you had it down in the first and second quarters during which period the comps were down substantially more than you're guiding down in Q4 in the March quarter.
So, is there – and I know when you spoke about the acquisitions that have kind of different P&L geography, you suggested that they kind of have a similar operating margin end game. So, is there anything else that could be pressuring the operating margin relative to sales compared to the trends that we saw earlier in the year?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Yeah. I think there are a couple of things. First of all, the fourth quarter is the lowest sales quarter, and that's a piece of it. We – and the acquisitions are dilutive. It will be much more dilutive than the first two quarters. We purchased McGee and – during the first quarter, and then we purchased the much larger Clark business in this – where the results came in to our results for the first time in the third quarter. So, I think if you look at those, those really bridge the gap.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
And as you think about the seasonality of the tire business relative to (46:30) is obviously where the acquisitions are tilted relative to the rest of the business, is it more weighted away from Q4?

John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
I'm sorry. The...
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Is the seasonality of the tire business even more extreme than the rest of the business, whether that works against Q4 profitability?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
No. I mean, in terms of the tire business, we said that the biggest driver of the tire business within our markets is winter weather, particularly as you hit Q3 and Q4.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yeah.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Q3, I view that as the sort of peak of seasonality related to that business with Q4 sort of close behind there. So, yes, if we get more snow, I expect that to be a positive for the remainder of the quarter here.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it. Second question, just want to make sure I understand the impact of the day shift, I guess where the Christmas holiday fell. So, it sounds like it was included in that reported comp, though you did disclose the comp X, the extra day, which I guess is about a percentage point lower. It sounds like the month that you gave us, though, were adjusted. So, in other words, the day is out, and then, I guess one of the reasons there might have been a bigger difference between the total on the comp sales number. Would that have driven a bigger difference between the total on the comp sales number, or is that more the acquisitions that would have done so? Because it sounds like...
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
No. It's really – yeah. It's really the acquisitions.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it. And...
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Go ahead.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
And then my final question kind of moving past the extra day stuff, which I know can be banal, and I think you touched on this, John, just if you look at some of the government data on tire PPI and CPI, that had been favorable for you, at least theoretically so where you had a bit of a spread that should have been hopeful on margin. What's your expectation for tire margin as commodity costs are to move higher again?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Well, I guess it depends on – you're saying if commodity costs move higher, I guess, I would tell you what we said about the cost increases. If that – to the extent that that drives cost increases, it will drive lower cost increases for us, I would expect, because of our large volume and growing volumes. And we certainly run the business to maintain our margins, so we will certainly look to pass along those increases and maintain our pricing discipline as we have in the past. So I guess, I don't have any specific guidance around that but like everything that impacts the entire market, we ought to see some competitive advantage arise from it.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Understood. Okay. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Sure.

From Consumer Edge, we'll go to Jamie Albertine. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC
Great. Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just a quick housekeeping item. I noticed that your interest expense ticked up a little bit. I just want to make sure to ask you how we should think about that going forward, (50:22) of an elevated interest expense estimate flowing through the model, number one.
Number two, more strategically, however you want to define it but, what percentage of your portfolio would you say today is Northeast relative to Mid-Atlantic and Southeast? And how quickly will that change over time with respect to acquisitions? Because it does seem like you always are active in the acquisition market but there are clearly aren't any sort of big one or two transaction items that can really shift that percentage quickly? So, if we were to sit here today and sort of model out the next two or three years, what's the percentage today? And how will that look like, in your opinion, in the coming year or two? Thanks.

John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Sure. Let me take the second question first. Right now, our comp base is a little over 80% what we call north, and a little under 20% in the South. So, obviously adding the majority of the acquisitions that we made are in the South, so that should probably – that will increase the Southern exposure there.
From our perspective, looking out the next couple of years, I like the growth in the South, that's great, but we get so much operating leverage in all of the acquisitions that we complete that I don't want anyone to have the impression that we're not interested in doing acquisitions in any of our markets. That is a key piece of our strategy. But going forward, you should expect us to be active all throughout our markets and with a particular interest in the South, but not some kind of fundamental preference from this point forward.
The other point that I would make along with that is when you look at dilution and dilution on the operating margin, in the year with big acquisitions, the basic approach that we have and part of our strategy or one of the results of our strategy is that we continue to add acquisitions and dilute the operating margin and then bring it back up as we integrate those acquisitions.
So, this year, you're seeing that more markedly because we're in a year early in these acquisitions in the integration process where they're dilutive, but we have all the sales coming on. So, that is a dynamic that is something that we will continue to see. And I think it's not necessarily a good thing. But it's just a result of what I view as a great strategy that we've been able to execute. So, I want to make sure that – and that is a particular interest as we look at the fourth quarter here. We're going to have acquisitions that are dilutive because we're adding sales early in the integration process.
On the interest expense, Brian will take that.
Brian J. D'Ambrosia - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Yeah. So, the interest expense is up. The big driver of that is just the weighted-average debt outstanding that's $99 million higher than it was in the prior-year quarter. Debt, obviously, affected by the acquisitions, the debt that we incurred for borrowings for payment of the acquisitions, and also capital leases that we assumed as part of those acquisitions.
So, that is not too difficult to model in terms of our typical pay-downs against future deals will affect the amount that we have outstanding related to that. So, the interest rate was less of an impact on it, only 20 basis points. But we are currently 100 basis points over LIBOR. So, any variability in LIBOR will affect our rate going forward.
James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC
Got it. Thank you, gentlemen, for both those answers. And just if I may, a quick follow-up on the strategic question, John. Can you provide an update, I know in prior calls we talked about how you're fulfilling your stores in the Southern part of the country, this was the Georgia and Florida markets from quite a distance. Can you just give us a little bit of an update as to how you're looking at investments into may be Southeastern distribution, or how we should think about the impact related to that in the coming quarters from whether it's a COGS or SG&A perspective, or a combination thereof that the impact to operating margin ahead of your potential investment in a closer distribution facility? Thanks.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Sure. You're right. We are distributing from a distance to those stores. As I've said previously, we are taking a look at opportunities for distribution centers somewhere potentially in the Florida market. And we said we were looking at that in the back half of this fiscal year. We're doing that.

And I would – what I don't want to do is get out in front of that if we're going to be making an acquisition that might have some redundant warehouse space or availability there. So, we want to give some time for that. And I think what I've said previously is still the case. We're certainly not maximizing the cost of goods benefits, but I still believe that we need to be over 100 stores for a distribution center down there to pay-off. And so, we will be looking that over the next several months and updating as we issue our guidance for fiscal 2018.
James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks, again, and best of luck for the next quarter.

Moving on to Michael Montani of Evercore.
Michael Montani - Evercore ISI
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask if I could on the third quarter. Can you split out what's in the tire comp of plus 6%? What did you see in terms of price versus units in the quarter?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Sure. Units were up 8% and average ticket was down 2%. And that was...
Michael Montani - Evercore ISI
Got it.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
...mostly – it was mostly trade down some price.
Michael Montani - Evercore ISI
Okay. Thank you. And then one quick one on Fair Labor Standards Act, which looks like we're able to avert, I guess, in December. Is that going to have any ongoing negative headwind because you all would have communicated that or are you able to avoid that potential expense step-up?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
No. We did not roll out any changes there.
Michael Montani - Evercore ISI
Okay.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
We were – we want to see what any final rules are before we go changing pay plans. We don't like to change pay plans on people.
Michael Montani - Evercore ISI
Got it. And then, I guess, the last one was a bit of housekeeping, but just can you give us a mix of percentage of revenue by category for the quarter?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Sure. For the combined – for the company, brakes was 12%, steering was 9%, tires was 52%, and maintenance was 26%. The difference is exhaust, but it should be about 2%.

From KeyBanc, we'll go next to Brett Hoselton. Please go ahead.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Good morning, gentlemen.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Good morning.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Could you please comment on your tire mix shift to lower margin tires? Is that a management strategy, or is that simply a result of consumer preference?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
It's really consumer preference. As we've said in the past, what we've done over the last couple years is broaden our assortment. And we've done that in part with increased lines of import tires. But, we broaden that assortment to provide consumers choice, good value for them where we are able to make good gross profit dollars per tire. And really, more than anything, it's consumer choice.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
And then on the tire pricing front, to-date, you haven't seen any impact of tire pricing in the most recent quarter and through January. Is that a fair statement?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
You mean retail?
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Yes. Yeah. Well, in terms of – tire pricing in terms of the sell-in.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Yeah. At retail to consumer, we haven't seen any significant changes really from recent trend. In terms of sell-in to dealers or to tire dealers in the industry, I would expect January sell-in there, so many manufacturer sells to maybe reflect the fact that that some companies, including ours, are trying to make sure that they buy ahead of any cost increases that are coming to them.

Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, John. I appreciate it.

Moving on to Carolina Jolly of Gabelli.
A. Carolina Jolly - Gabelli & Co.
Good morning. Thanks for taking my call.
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Sure.
A. Carolina Jolly - Gabelli & Co.
I know we had spoken about in the past that some of your acquisitions cannibalized some of your revenues. Is that built into your current comps?
John W. Van Heel - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
I think that is the dynamic that we see in specific markets where we're buying businesses that – and we really saturate the market. Certainly, it wasn't a huge impact in the past quarter. In the past quarter, I think what we said is that our business in the winter reacts to snow, and that was sort of proven in spades in the quarter.
A. Carolina Jolly - Gabelli & Co.
And then also -
Robert G. Gross - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
Yeah. This is Rob. Carolina, we're not going to blame weak comps, on facility and grabbing market share, making more money in a market. It's just an edge on but if you add 10% of the acquisition growth, one year, and additional 10%, a year before, and knows they're working their way into the system and operating margins, it's going to have some slight negative drag.
A. Carolina Jolly - Gabelli & Co.
Okay. Thanks.
Robert G. Gross - Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.
But we own our weak comps.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

I'll start today with a review of our results, key initiatives and outlook for fiscal 2016. I'll then turn the call over to Cathy D'Amico, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide additional details on our financial results.
In the second quarter, we delivered on our key objectives of increasing traffic, leveraging our scale and supply-chain, and effectively managing operating expenses while driving strong contributions from our recent acquisitions and maintaining a robust pipeline of new acquisition opportunities. Our team's strong execution drove positive results on both the top and bottom line.
Sales in the second quarter increased by over 8%. Comparable store sales were positive 2.1%, led by a 2% increase in traffic, and were consistent throughout the quarter. Earnings per share grew 14% to a record $0.57, the midpoint of our guidance, supported by operating margin expansion of 120 basis points. For the first six months of the fiscal year, sales have increased by 8%, operating margin expanded 90 basis points and net income increased by 13%. These results clearly demonstrate that our business model is working.

We are also pleased that the sales momentum we experienced in the second quarter has strengthened into October with a 4.2% increase in comparable store sales month to date and continued positive traffic. During the second quarter, sales grew across our key categories. Most notably, comparable sales for alignments increased by 11%, tires and exhaust each increased by 3% and brakes increased by 2%, maintenance services and front end shocks were both flat. We are encouraged by the 3% increase in tire sales in the second quarter led by higher retail tire prices and flat tire units, which we believe are indicative of broader trends and reflect that we have customers continuing to delay purchases particularly on large ticket items.
That said, as our results would suggest, we are seeing improvement. October will mark our sixth consecutive month of positive comparable store sales. However, I would like to see our 4.2% positive comparable store sales trend month to date continue through the third quarter before I consider this an inflection point for consumers.
The recent sales initiatives we have undertaken to improve our marketing, CRM and Web-site capabilities are helping to support our field teams highly focused on driving higher store traffic and sales. The continued shift in marketing spend to more efficient digital advertising and including through our CRM system are driving customers both to our stores and Web-site. We have upgraded our desktop and mobile Web-site capabilities with significant improvements to our online appointment and tire search function.
In addition to these online enhancements, we are increasing the collection of customer e-mail addresses allowing us to more effectively communicate and drive higher customer conversion. These initiatives are already having a positive impact on our traffic and sales which we expect will build as we move further into the back half of the year.
Now let's turn to gross margin. We continued to generate significant gross margin expansion with an increase of 170 basis points to 42.1% in the quarter, driven by lower material cost as a percentage of sales, increased payroll efficiency and leverage of our distribution and occupancy costs. In the second quarter, we collected more gross profit dollars for tires than in the same period last year.
This is significant to our earnings growth given that every $1 increase in tire gross profit is worth $0.05 of earnings per share in a given year, which is double the contribution versus a 1% increase in unit. Looking ahead, we expect that our cost advantage versus competitors will continue to widen as we capitalize on our increasing scale and flexible supply chain while continuing to effectively manage our retail tire prices.
Moving on to expenses, total operating expenses as a percent of sales delevered by 50 basis points in the second quarter, driven primarily by higher due diligence costs related to potential acquisitions. Despite the choppy environment, we achieved another quarter of strong profit growth with second quarter operating income up 18% year-over-year and operating margin expansion of 120 basis points to 14.3% of sales.
Net income increased 16% year-over-year to $18.9 million or a record $0.57 in earnings per share, and included $0.02 of expense related to annual director stock option grant. Our strong sales results in the quarter and year-to-date underscores the flexibility of our business model and demonstrates that regardless of the macro environment we can successfully manage the business to drive strong bottom line results.
Now I would like to discuss our growth strategy. Continuing our strong acquisition growth, during the second quarter we completed the previously announced acquisition of 31 stores in central New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. 25 of these stores are located in central New York and two are in Pennsylvania. Those stores have been rebranded under the Mr. Tire brand allowing the Company to fill in existing markets where we currently operate Monro Brake & Tire location. The remaining four stores are located in Massachusetts and operate under the Monro Brake & Tire brand.

These acquisitions increase Monro's presence in these regions and demonstrate the advantages of Monro's two-brand strategy. These transactions are expected to add approximately $31 million in annualized sales, representing an estimated sales mix of 60% service and 40% tires. They are expected to be breakeven to slightly accretive to earnings per share in fiscal 2016 as we anticipate that cost synergies will be realized at an accelerated pace, due primarily to our ability to leverage the existing distribution in these markets.
As a reminder, in the first quarter we completed the acquisition of the Car-X brand, a chain of 146 franchise locations operating in 10 states. Car-X is expected to add approximately $2 million in EBITDA annually and will be slightly accretive to earnings per share in fiscal 2016. In total, these transactions completed in the first six months of fiscal 2016 represent approximately $35 million in annualized sales.
Acquisitions allow us to increase Monro's total sales and store count and as a result raise our purchasing power with vendors. They also allow us to further leverage distribution, advertising, field management and corporate overhead costs, all of which will help drive future operating margin expansion.
The current operating environment continues to create favorable acquisition opportunities. In the short-term, choppy sales trends and higher costs continue to weigh on smaller dealers, but importantly, the longer-term opportunity is that owners of independent tire dealers are at or near retirement age without an internal succession option. When excluding the acquisitions completed year to date in fiscal 2016, we continue to have more than 10 NDAs signed. We remain very optimistic by the opportunities to complete additional acquisitions in the second half of the fiscal year.
Now let's turn to the details of our outlook. Taking into account anticipated sales contribution from our completed 2016 acquisitions, the strong performance of our recent acquisitions and positive comparable store sales trend, we are narrowing our fiscal 2016 sales guidance to a range of $955 million to $970 million. This range now assumes comparable store sales of positive 1.5% to 2.5% compared to our previous guidance of 1% to 3%. As a reminder, we closed 34 BJ's locations in fiscal 2015 which reduces our sales base versus last year but will have minimal impact on earnings.
Turning to our expectations for cost of goods, we continue to believe that Monro's overall tire cost including related warehousing and logistics will be down slightly in fiscal 2016. We expect lower raw material costs, increasing competition among manufacturers and our robust supply chain to continue to benefit gross margin while further widening our competitive cost advantage. Unlike many of our competitors, we have already shifted nearly all of our non-branded tire sourcing to suppliers outside of China, minimizing the impact of the Chinese tariff.
Furthermore, due to the strong performance of our recent acquisitions, we now expect $0.14 to $0.18 in earnings per share contribution from them compared to previous guidance of $0.12 to $0.17. We remain very encouraged by the opportunities we see to complete additional attractive acquisitions this fiscal year. As a result we expect higher due diligence cost in fiscal 2016 compared to last year which is reflected in our earnings guidance.
Based on these assumptions, we have narrowed our fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.07 to $2.17 versus our prior guidance of $2 to $2.20. This compares to earnings per share of $1.88 in fiscal 2015, an increase of 10% to 15% year-over-year, on top of a 40% increase in the prior two years. Our fiscal 2016 guidance is based on 33.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.

In short, we raised the lower end of our guidance from $2 to $2.07 per share, in step with our higher sales expectation, and adjusted the high end from $2.20 to $2.17 per share as a result of higher expected due diligence costs. The midpoint of our earnings guidance represents operating margin expansion of 80 basis points for the fiscal year on top of the 80 basis point improvement we realized in fiscal 2015.
Given the lower material costs we anticipate this fiscal year, we now expect the comparable store sales increase of approximately 50 basis points will overcome inflation versus the 2% to 2.5% increase we have historically required. With that said, let me remind you that every 1% increase in comparable store sales above that inflation hurdle generates an incremental $0.07 in EPS.
Turning to the quarter, as I previously stated, October comparable store sales are up approximately 4.2% month to date. Based on these trends, we expect total third quarter comparable store sales to increase 2% to 4% versus the prior year period. We anticipate total sales for the quarter to be in the range of $247 million to $254 million. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.58 versus $0.49 in the prior year period and include higher due diligence cost.
Long-term trends remain favorable for our business with nearly 250 million vehicles on the road with a record average age of 11.8 years old, a slowly declining population of service base and consumers choosing Do It For Me service more frequently. Importantly, during this first six months of the fiscal year, vehicles 13 years old and older accounted for 28% of our traffic. These vehicles produced average tickets similar to our overall average, demonstrating that consumers continue to invest in and maintain their vehicles even as they advance in age.
Our key competitive advantages are still in place, including our low-cost operations, superior customer service and convenience, along with our store density and two-brand store strategy. Our five year plan remains unchanged and it continues to call for on average 15% annual top line growth including 10% growth through acquisitions, 3% comps and a 2% increase from greenfield stores. Our acquisitions are generally diluted to earnings in the first six months as we overcome due diligence and deal related costs, while working through initial inventory and the operational transition of these stores.
With cost savings and recovery in sales, results are generally breakeven to slightly accretive year one and $0.09 to $0.12 accretive in year two, and an additional $0.09 to $0.12 accretive in year three. Over a five-year period, that should improve operating margins by approximately 300 basis points and deliver an average of 20% bottom line growth. As our results have shown, our disciplined acquisition strategy is further strengthening our position in the marketplace. We expect it to continue to provide meaningful value to our shareholders for many years to come.
Before I hand the call over to Cathy, I want to reiterate that I am pleased by our overall execution as we look to deliver our sixth consecutive month of positive comparable store sales with 90 basis points of operating margin expansion year to date and record profit. As we move into the second half of the year, I would like to share with you positive trends that we believe will continue to favorably impact our bottom line in fiscal 2016.
These include the positive impact to traffic and sales from our heightened operational focus and our turn to digital CRM and marketing initiatives, higher inflation of 2% to 3% which represents a 1% increase in overall comparable store sales on flat unit volume, tire cost of goods that are down slightly versus fiscal 2015, [indiscernible] prices a year-over-year benefit from the decline in oil cost net of reduced waste oil credits of approximately $1 million, and significant sales and earnings contributions from our fiscal 2014, 2015 and recent 2016 acquisitions, and additional acquisitions at attractive valuations.

Before I turn the call over to Cathy, I would like to thank each of our employees for their continued hard work. Their consistent execution and superior customer service they deliver on a daily basis is reflected in Monro's brand strength and financial success. They are the reason for Monro's compelling customer value proposition and I'm greatly appreciative of their efforts.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Cathy for a more detailed review of our financial results. Cathy?
Catherine D'Amico
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Sales increased 8.1% and $17.9 million for the quarter. New stores, which we define as stores opened or acquired after March 29, 2014, added $18.5 million including sales of $17.5 million from fiscal 2015 and 2016 acquired stores. Comparable store sales increased 2.1%. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately $5.2 million, largely related to the BJ's store closures in fiscal 2015.
Additionally, during the quarter ended September 2015, the Company completed the bulk sale of approximately $2 million of inventory to a [indiscernible] company as compared to a $2.9 million transaction in the second quarter of last year. There were 91 selling days in both the current and prior year's second quarters.
Year to date, sales increased $36.9 million and 8.4%. New stores contributed $43.8 million of the increase, including $40.7 million from fiscal 2015 and 2016 acquisitions. Additionally, there was a comparable store sales increase of 0.8%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately $11.3 million, again largely related to the BJ's store closures. And there were 181 selling days for the first six months of this and last fiscal year.
At September 26, 2015, the Company had 1,029 Company-operated stores and 143 franchised locations, as compared with 1,003 Company-operated stores and one franchised location at September 27, 2014. During the quarter ended September 2015, the Company added 35 Company-operated stores and closed five. Year to date, we added 39 stores and closed nine.
Gross profit for the quarter ended September 2015 was $100.7 million or 42.1% of sales, as compared with $89.5 million or 40.4% of sales for the quarter ended September 2014. The increase in gross profit for the quarter ended September 2015 as a percentage of sales is due to several factors. First, there was a decrease in total material cost including outside purchases primarily related to reduced oil and tire cost.
Distribution and occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year quarter as we gained leverage on these largely fixed costs with higher sales. Additionally, the recording of some new leases under GAAP as operating versus capital reduced occupancy cost and increased interest expense. Labor costs decreased as a percent of sales as compared to the prior year quarter to continued focused cost control.
Gross profit for the six months ended September 2015 was $200.4 million or 42.1% of sales as compared to $179.5 million or 40.9% of sales for the six months ended September 2014. The year to date increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is due to similar factors as I described for the quarter. Material costs declined meaningfully related to decreases in oil and tire costs. Additionally, labor costs as a percentage of sales decreased as compared to the prior year.
Operating expenses for the quarter ended September 2015 increased $6.1 million and were $66.6 million or 27.9% of sales as compared with $60.5 million or 27.4% of sales for the quarter ended September 2014. The increase as a percent of sales is primarily due to increased due diligence cost and increased management bonus related to improved performance as compared to the prior year quarter.

For the six months ended September 2015, operating expenses increased by $11.6 million to $132.7 million or 27.9% of sales, as compared with $121.2 million and 27.6% of sales for the prior period this month. The increase is primarily due to increased due diligence and management bonus expense as well as a small increase in benefit cost as a percent of sales, again as compared to the prior six months.
Operating income for the quarter ended September 2015 of $34.1 million increased by 17.9% as compared to operating income of approximately $28.9 million for the quarter ended September 2014, an increase as a percentage of sales from 13.1% to 14.2%. Operating income for the six months ended September 2015 of approximately $67.7 million increased by 16.1% as compared to operating income of approximately $58.3 million for the six months ended September 2014. It also increased as a percentage of sales from 13.3% to 14.2%.
Net interest expense for the quarter ended September 2015 at 1.6% of sales increased $1 million as compared to the same period last year, which was at 1.3% of sales. Weighted average debt outstanding for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 increased by approximately $43 million as compared to the second quarter of last year. The increase is primarily related to an increase in capital lease debt recorded in connection with the fiscal 2015 and 2016 acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate also increased by approximately 70 basis points from the prior year, largely due to adding capital leases.
For the six months ended September 2015, interest expense increased by $2.2 million, an increase from 1.1% to 1.5% as a percentage of sales for the same period. Weighted average debt increased by approximately $43 million and the weighted average interest rate increased by approximately 100 basis points, again due to an increase in capital lease debt.
Our effective tax rate was 38% of pre-tax income for the quarter ended September 2015 and 38.1% for the quarter ended September 2014. Net income for the current quarter of $18.9 million increased to 15.6% over the net income for the quarter ended September 2014. Earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.57 increased 14% as compared to last year's $0.50. For the six months ended September 2015, net income of $37.7 million increased 13.3% and diluted earnings per share increased 12.9% from $1.10 to $1.14 per share.
Moving on to our balance sheet, it continues to be strong. Our current ratio of 1.2 to 1 is comparable to fiscal 2015. In the first six months of this year we generated approximately $45 million of cash flow from operating activities and increased our debt under our revolver by approximately $22 million. We used these borrowings and cash flow from operating activities to finance our fiscal 2016 acquisitions which added 34 stores to date as well as the Car-X franchise business. Capital lease and financing obligations increased $29 million, due primarily to our fiscal 2015 and 2016 acquisitions.
At the end of the second quarter, debt consisted of $145 million of outstanding revolver debt and $171 million of capital leases and financing obligations. As a result of the fiscal 2016 borrowings, our debt to capital ratio including capital leases increased to 38% at September 2015 from 36% at March 2015. Without capital and operating leases, our debt to capital ratio is 22% at the end of September 2015 and 21% at the end of March 2015.
Under our revolving credit facility, we have 250 million that is committed through December 2017. Additionally, we have a $75 million accordion feature included in the revolving credit agreement. We are currently borrowing at LIBOR plus 125 basis points and we have approximately $90 million of availability, not including the accordion. We are fully compliant with all of our debt covenants and have plenty of room under these covenants to add additional debt for acquisitions without any problem. All of this as well as the flexibility built into our debt agreement continues to make it easy for us to get acquisitions done quickly. Additionally, we are in the process of negotiating a larger facility to ensure that we can fund more and larger acquisitions going forward.

During the first six months of this year, we spent approximately $20 million on CapEx and we concluded approximately $10 million in the second quarter and $47 million on acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization totaled approximately $20 million, divided roughly evenly between Q1 and Q2, and we received $5 million from the exercise of stock options. We paid about $10 million in dividend.
Inventory is up approximately $5 million from March 2015, largely due to acquired stores and the purchase of winter tires in anticipation of the demand in the third quarter. Total inventory turns for the rolling 12 months ended September 2015 were relatively flat from last year's second quarter in units.
That concludes my formal remarks on the financial statements. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.
Bret Jordan
On the gross margin, some pretty good performance in the quarter. Was there any contribution from leftover Chinese tire inventory that was still turning in there?
John W. Van Heel
No. Obviously we are turning the tires as we go, but what we said is we expect tire cost overall to be slightly down this year. So we've really been able to hold those costs in check. So [no change] [ph] from that.
Bret Jordan
Okay. And then the supply chain, what markets are you sourcing out of now given the fact that the Chinese product is less attractive, and maybe could you tell us what the mix of import was versus branded tires in the quarter?
John W. Van Heel
There are other Pacific rim countries and they are, as we said before, some new manufacturer relationship as well as some continuing that have shifted their production outside of China. And then the mix is roughly the same this year and last year, it's right around 40%.
Bret Jordan
Okay, great. And then just on segments, [indiscernible] 11% comp in alignment and it outperforming tires so much and [they have] [ph] certain non-alignment fees, and what do you make of that, is that something that was promoted in the quarter?
John W. Van Heel
Yes, I think again it relates back to what we said about tire units being flat. I think consumers are still deferring larger ticket purchases, and in those cases they are making sure and accepting our alignment recommendations more often to keep the tires that they have on their cars going longer, and I mean that's where we put an operational focus on that as well because we think that is the case and we are doing a much better job of this than we were doing prior.
Bret Jordan
Okay. And then the quarter, October to date comp, is segment trends in that 4.2% roughly the same or is there anything sort of outlying in that current performance?
John W. Van Heel
So traffic is up as I said, tires are about plus 3 I think [whereas the] [ph] service is getting better.
Bret Jordan
Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator
Moving on, we'll go to Rick Nelson of Stephens.
Nicholas Zangler
This is Nick Zangler in for Rick. Just hitting on that 4.2% October comp, that's really strong. It looks like to me the strongest number since January of 2012. Now it looks like November could be a little bit of a harder month to lap but December kind of looks like from a competitive basis like October. So given your guide of 2% to 4%, what needs to happen in this quarter for you to get to high end of that range, and we're kind of hearing titbits on a milder winter this quarter or into next year, how does that factor in and is that good for you guys, bad for you guys, just some reflections on that?
John W. Van Heel
I think we have seen a quarter of plus 2%, that we think is the floor. We are running plus 4% right now on higher traffic. We have gotten good contributions from our initiatives there, and as I look at it, November and December really offset themselves, so we are really running up against the slightly negative comp over the next couple of months, and I think there is significant opportunity to continue at this plus 4%. I'd like to see that for the remainder of the quarter.

Nicholas Zangler
Great. And then just wanted to jump back over to the Car-X acquisition. Obviously I would imagine the franchise owners were able to purchase product from Monro which has the potential to provide benefits to both Monro and the franchise owners given your scale. Can you talk about any progress you have made with those owners since the acquisition, have you been able to improve those franchise operations, did they benefit you, just what your interaction has been with those owners?
John W. Van Heel
Sure. Things are going well at Car-X. We are looking to use all of the advantages that we have that you just talked about to help improve the businesses of the franchise owners. We are bringing opportunities to them as we get those sorted out. So they've been running well but overall that's a $2 million EBITDA opportunity on a $160 million plus EBITDA company. So it's going well, we're very pleased with it and we continue to work hard to help these guys improve their business and grow the chain.
Nicholas Zangler
Great. And then finally, has that served as a potential acquisition pool, how are the dynamics, what does it look like, do you have like a right of first refusal? I would imagine the owners would go to you guys first but is there anything contractually that's baked in there?
John W. Van Heel
No, there isn't. Again, our objective is to help these guys improve their businesses and grow the chain. We think that where they would come to us if they want to sell their business, they would have more of an opportunity than perhaps they've had in the past, but we're very happy with the franchise model there and we're trying to grow that with them.
Nicholas Zangler
Great. Congratulations on the results, positive comps and the good start to 3Q, good luck.
Operator
And next we'll hear from Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets.
Tony Cristello
One question, I wanted to talk a little bit about, and obviously you got to be careful in terms of comp trend and where you're forecasting, and I know you are running a 4% in October, can you give me the sort of cadence of how the quarter shaped up, and then on the sustainability of a positive October, what do you typically see heading into November on that?
John W. Van Heel
So the second quarter was plus 2.3% in July, plus 2.1% in August and plus 1.9% in September. And again in this quarter, is a key quarter for tire sales, November is a very important month there, as we just talked about we were up something like 3.9% last September, but then had a negative month in December. So I think if the consumer – hopefully, our traffic initiative which has brought in a bunch of new customers in the second quarter are going to help us sustain that plus 4% throughout the third quarter here.
Robert G. Gross
Yes, I think we were up 3.9% in November, is what we were going to say, and we would hope the 4% is the new norm, but one month does not make a trend.
Tony Cristello
Right. Patience but you hope that the pent-up demand flows through?
Robert G. Gross
No, we have no patience.
Tony Cristello
Maybe shifting gears a little bit to, you expanded into some newer markets in Florida and Georgia which are very good markets but atypical to Monro, you don't have a big infrastructure still, you don't get the benefits of distribution, and I'm just trying to understand then, one, I'm assuming you are getting good sales results but you may not get the full leverage that you would get in those markets, how should we think about contribution on a go forward basis as you are backfilling and building out those markets?
John W. Van Heel
In particular Florida and Georgia, you're right we don't have the distribution down there. The sales results are good. We are happy with that. We typically talk about 100 to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement that we get from distribution synergies. Right now we are delivering product down to those markets. So our distribution costs are higher. So basically right now we are not getting that 100 to 150 basis point on distribution and that represents an opportunity. We said in the past that we would look at opening a DC when we're more like triple digit stores down in those markets, and at that point we would spend some money on the DC, on a larger store base to get after that distribution synergies.

Tony Cristello
Okay. And I'm assuming that your targeted growth of acquisitions is inclusive of those newer markets. Are those markets that you feel comfortable enough to continue to maybe add stores via greenfield?
John W. Van Heel
Yes, we absolutely are adding both greenfield stores and looking at those for acquisitions. We have a number of acquisition opportunities in those markets which I view as very positive. They are large, dense markets, and they balance our exposure to more Northeast and North Central markets. So I think it's a great opportunity for us.
Tony Cristello
And how long would it take you to sort of get a DC up and running, is that a couple of years venture and therefore maybe you don't get the full efficiencies in those markets for another two, three years?
John W. Van Heel
No, that would be more like somewhere plus or minus, probably a little bit plus 12 months once we made that decision.
Tony Cristello
Okay, great. Thank you for your time.
Operator
Next we'll hear from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI.
Michael Montani
I want to ask about the NDA pipeline, if I could for a moment. There was a comment that you all had made about increasing the credit line and potentially being related to larger sized deals. So could there be any in the pipeline now that are larger sized, how should we sort of think about that?
John W. Van Heel
The more than 10 NDAs that we talked about are 5 to 40 stores within our markets. So if we were a bigger company with more opportunities, and with respect to larger deals we have always said that anything that makes sense for our Company and the shareholder of the Company, that we would look at, but right now I want to make sure that we have the opportunity to take advantage of all the acquisition opportunities that we see. We said this was going to be a good year for acquisitions, we wanted to have the flexibility to take advantage.
Michael Montani
Great. And just to follow up, the digital initiatives that you have embarked on sound to be paying off a little bit. Can you quantify at all, if you look at the traffic, up 2, and it sounds like it hasn't gotten any worse than that in October, how much of that might be related to those initiatives, and also what are oil changes looking like?
John W. Van Heel
So oil changes are up, and when you look at the traffic, we're bringing in a lot of new customers here. That's our focus in the field and I view the digital initiatives as supporting that. So the big push is all of our guys in the field doing a great job for customers, bringing in new customers, doing more, getting them out happy with our service on a first visit that might be something more like an oil change or a lower-cost service, and giving them a reason to come back to us. So that plus 2 traffic in the quarter should help pay off in the second quarter, should help pay off in the third quarter with consumers coming back and needing more costly repairs that they can't delay anymore.
Michael Montani
Got it. Just one last housekeeping thing which was, if you could share what the mix was this quarter in terms of revenue by category?
John W. Van Heel
Sure. So for the quarter tires was 43, steering was 10, exhaust was 4, brakes was 16 and maintenance was 28, and as always don't hold me to the rounding.
Michael Montani
Sounds good. Thanks a lot.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Next we'll hear from Jamie Albertine with Stifel.
Jamie Albertine
So first of all congratulations, you had a solid quarter, the gross margin I think it was already asked about was exceptional, and it looks like what you're doing to drive the comp leverage point lower is benefiting yourselves now as comp appears to be a bit down to accelerating, but really if I may, I know you have asked, it's been asked a bunch of different ways, I want to drill on the comp a little bit. Is it too early given where we are in October, I know I saw [Bill's] [ph] highlight last weekend, there was some snowfall, I don't know if upstate New York is different, but is it too early to make a call on whether folks are getting into snow tires and replacing what you've told us in the past are heavily used bald deferred tire purchases?

Robert G. Gross
This is Rob. It's too early, I mean we said tires in October are doing the same thing they did in Q2, and I don't think people are thinking about buying some tires in July, August or September. So we continue to run flat units which would say they are not unbelievably nervous about winter weather. I mean the few snowflakes we saw last weekend is not a driver, and I think as we said, flat units with inflation are going to be the driver of the tire comp, and the improvement at least we've seen in October, John said relates to a service business. We really need to see November and December to make a call on whether the consumer is going to stop deferring tires. We certainly know they need them, we've certainly seen a lot of ugly ones and when we do change them, they are bald, but too early to call and we hope that push us towards a plus 4 as opposed to what John said was the floor of plus 2.
Jamie Albertine
Let me ask then as well, it sounds like you're doing a great job to bring in new customers, I guess first, is there any data to suggest where you are pulling those customers from, and what can you tell us about those new customers, are they more inclined to spend or they have a higher income level versus maybe your core base, so how should we think about the impact, however small, because I'm really trying to get a sense here of when can we expect the deferred maintenance cycle to end, right, and I'm looking for any evidence so that we confine to that extent? So is there anything on the new customer side that can help us?
John W. Van Heel
The plus 2 in traffic for the quarter is a high number for us, it's a good number for us, and it is a lot of new customers. With regard to where they're coming from, I guess I could say to you that I think our sales trends in general are ahead of the other companies that I'm seeing in those NDAs. So I think we're doing well there. But those customers are coming in for oil changes and again we are looking to bring them back for additional service on their return visit. And I think with regard to whether this is a real shift in the customer, I would say that it's not right now given the flat tire units, but we'll let you know after the end of the quarter.
Jamie Albertine
Okay. And I'm still beating the comp horse here, but last question on comp, from a regional perspective as you've grown into newer markets, and I know they're not flowing through your comp base in many cases yet, but is there a clear or definitive performance difference in the newer markets versus the Northeast, and so to that end could you make the argument that perhaps your comp will be a little bit more predictable or be more stable over the next few years as they roll into your base?
John W. Van Heel
Yes, Florida and Georgia are doing well for us, and I think the more exposure we get to those markets, that will certainly help reduce some of the volatility that we have seen from winter weather and this discussion we're having about November and December. I view that as a positive. The most important thing for us is to grow and increase our store density in our existing markets and as we're talking about in Florida and Georgia here, in these contiguous markets.
Jamie Albertine
Okay, great. John and everyone, thanks again. I appreciate and good luck in the current quarter.
Operator
Moving on, we'll go to Scott Stember with C.L. King.
Scott Stember
Most of my questions have been asked already, but just going back to the comp range that you gave for the full year, 1.5 to 2.5, it looks like you paired down the high end by just a smidge, and in October we saw probably stronger than anybody expected comps up north of 4%. I know you guys like to be conservative and justly so, but is there anything else that we're missing that we should be looking at, any concerns that you have that is giving you any pause to maybe be a little bit more aggressive on the comp end?

John W. Van Heel
No. October was consistent with the overall comp, last year it was down too and in the fourth quarter we were down 1.8, in the third quarter and fourth quarter it was down 2.5. So I think there's nothing there that you're not seeing, it's just a bit of a conservatism, giving [out] [ph] conservatism. I'd like to make sure we hit the number.
Scott Stember
Got it, that's fair enough. And just last question, I mean you guys have obviously done a very good job of attracting your customers into your stores for the services that you already sell, but is there anything else out there, anything new that you guys are working on, any new services that is part of your broad initiative to increase your sales, whether it would be more temperature controlled items or whatnot, but is there anything that's in the works that possibly could be an additional driver going forward?
John W. Van Heel
What our focus is operationally is driving new customers in, they need the basic work that we provide and our doing a better job with those customers. You can see that as an example in the alignment category. There is a need out there, we've got an operational focus on it, it's a very high profit category for us and high customer satisfaction category because it helps them preserve the investments that they've made in their tires. That's where our focus is and that's where we think the biggest gains are for us. We are looking at, we are trying to do the best job we can addressing all the needs that our customers have.
Scott Stember
Got it. That's all I have. Thanks so much for taking my questions.
Operator
That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back to John Van Heel for any additional or closing comments.
John W. Van Heel
Thank you all for your time this morning. I'm looking forward to reporting on the continued positive impacts of our focus on sales and traffic and contributions from the acquisition opportunities we're acting on. Our business model should produce another year of double-digit EPS growth on top of the 40% increase over the past two years. We appreciate your continued support and the efforts of our employees that work hard to take care of our customers every day. Thanks again and have a great day.
Operator
And that will conclude today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation.
