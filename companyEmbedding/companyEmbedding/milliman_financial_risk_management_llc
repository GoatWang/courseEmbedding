The Milliman Managed Risk StrategyTM aims to stabilize the volatility of an investment portfolio during periods of significant and sustained market declines, providing investors with the same risk management techniques used by major financial institutions around the world.
Since the early 1950s, most attempts at managing portfolio risk have relied heavily on asset allocation—diversifying exposure among asset classes that have exhibited historically low correlation to one another. This approach has proven to be less effective during major downturns. In 2008, for example, nearly every major asset class was affected by the global economic downturn.
The high correlation among many of the world’s major asset classes was likely not a black swan event, but rather the inherent reaction of ever-more-connected global economies.
The declining effectiveness of conventional risk management and the introduction of new risk management strategies have the potential to transform the way people manage risk and save for retirement. The Milliman Managed Risk Strategy brings the same risk management techniques to investors that have been used by some of the world’s largest companies, including through the most recent global market downturn. Today, the Milliman Managed Risk Strategy is included in a range of investment options totaling $60 billion in portfolio value.
How it works
The Milliman Managed Risk Strategy uses hedge assets (typically exchange-traded futures contracts) that act independently of an underlying portfolio, which allows investors to remain invested in current assets. The Strategy consists of two risk management processes that actively account for changing market conditions. Following are brief descriptions of these processes, which are designed to help foster growth in bull markets while defending against losses in down markets:

A volatility management process, which is designed to keep the risk level of the portfolio from increasing significantly during periods of market turbulence. This is accomplished by continuously monitoring and reacting to specific changes in the market, allowing the overall portfolio to effectively target a predetermined volatility level and accurately maintain it over time.
A capital preservation process, which adjusts futures positions on a daily basis, subject to market-based thresholds, with the goal of maintaining the capital of the portfolio on a rolling five-year basis. In a severely declining market, futures gains are generally harvested and reinvested in growth assets in an effort to maximize long-term returns.

Financial futures contracts—contractual agreements to buy or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price in the future—established a way for large institutional investors to develop sophisticated and cost-effective safeguards in an effort to effectively weather volatile markets. The financial futures market is one of the most transparent and liquid markets in the world and accounts for over US $1 trillion per day in contract value.
Milliman does not rely on computer trading models to execute each trade, but on a global team of experienced traders operating from Chicago, London, and Sydney. As a result, Milliman’s trading team can incorporate market factors into the decision making process that a computer model cannot.
Key benefits
The Milliman Managed Risk Strategy:

Targets a specific volatility level. Milliman monitors portfolio risk around the clock and reacts to specific changes in the market. This approach aims to reduce the portfolio's volatility during periods of market turbulence by targeting a predetermined volatility level and then striving to maintain that level over time.
Employs a capital preservation strategy. During periods of significant and sustained market declines, the Milliman Managed Risk Strategy uses a futures-based risk management process that adjusts positions on a daily basis with the goal of reducing losses and maintaining the capital of the portfolio.
Avoids value-destroying behaviors. The Milliman Managed Risk Strategy automatically locks in gains from favorable returns on underlying investments and harvests gains from the hedge portfolio during severe market corrections to avoid value-destroying behaviors like buying high and selling low.
Requires no movement of underlying portfolio assets. The Milliman Managed Risk Strategy acts as a basket of hedge assets and operates independently of the underlying portfolio, which allows investors to remain invested in current assets.
Offers institutional-quality access to a global risk management authority. Milliman Financial Risk Management LLC provides investment advisory, hedging, and consulting services on $150 billion in global assets (as of September 30, 2014).

                  Turnover is calculated by taking the # of new holdings (initial purchases) + the # of positions sold out of (not just reduced) divided by the total # of holdings for the quarter.
                
[2]:
                  Alt Turnover is calculated by taking either the total MV of new purchases or
                   the MV of securities sold, whichever is less,
                   divided by the total MV of the fund.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
