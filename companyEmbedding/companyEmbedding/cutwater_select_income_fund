Insight Select Income Fund (NYSE:INSI)Historical Stock Chart
1 Year : From Jul 2016 to Jul 2017



      CUTWATER SELECT INCOME FUND DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND
    
      The Cutwater Select Income Fund
    

Dividend Declaration


      The Cutwater Select Income Fund (CSI) (the “Fund”) declared a dividend 
      of $0.20 on December 7, 2016, payable on January 18, 2017, to 
      shareholders of record at the close of business on December 21, 2016, 
      with an ex-dividend date of December 19, 2016.
    

      The dividend of $0.20 per share would equate to an annual dividend 
      payment for the last four quarters of $0.90 per share.
    

The Fund is a diversified closed-end management investment company 
      whose investment objective is to seek a high rate of return, primarily 
      from interest income and trading activity, from a portfolio principally 
      consisting of debt securities. The Fund will also seek capital 
      appreciation principally by purchasing debt securities at prices that 
      the Adviser believes are below their intrinsic value. The Fund will also 
      look to benefit from trading securities to optimize the risk adjusted 
      yields in the Fund. Cutwater Investor Services Corp., the Fund’s 
      investment adviser, provides fixed income management to a variety of 
      institutional clients including corporations, governmental entities, 
      employee benefit plans and registered investment companies.


A portion of a Fund's current distribution may include sources other 
      than net investment income, including a return of capital. Investors 
      should understand that a return of capital is not a distribution from 
      income or gains of a Fund. As required under the 1940 Act, a notice with

      federal income tax characterization of distributions. After the end of

Cutwater Select Income Fund






Business Wire




Dec 7, 2016 4:32 PM EST













 




























































  The Cutwater Select Income Fund  Dividend Declaration  The Cutwater Select Income Fund (CSI) (the "Fund") declared a dividend of $0.20 on December 7, 2016, payable on January 18, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 21, 2016, with an ex-dividend date of December 19, 2016.  The dividend of $0.20 per share would equate to an annual dividend payment for the last four quarters of $0.90 per share.  The Fund is a diversified closed-end management investment company whose investment objective is to seek a high rate of return, primarily from interest income and trading activity, from a portfolio principally consisting of debt securities. The Fund will also seek capital appreciation principally by purchasing debt securities at prices that the Adviser believes are below their intrinsic value. The Fund will also look to benefit from trading securities to optimize the risk adjusted yields in the Fund. Cutwater Investor Services Corp., the Fund's investment adviser, provides fixed income management to a variety of institutional clients including corporations, governmental entities, employee benefit plans and registered investment companies.  A portion of a Fund's current distribution may include sources other than net investment income, including a return of capital. Investors should understand that a return of capital is not a distribution from income or gains of a Fund. As required under the 1940 Act, a notice with the estimated components of the distribution will be sent to shareholders at the time of payment if it does not consist solely of net investment income. The notice should not be used to prepare tax returns as the estimates indicated in the notice may differ from the ultimate federal income tax characterization of distributions. After the end of each calendar year, investors will be sent a Form 1099-DIV informing them how to report distributions received during that year for federal income tax purposes.  Statements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined by the United States securities laws. You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward-looking statements because they are subject to uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond the Fund's control and could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  An investor should consider a Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.

	Public Sector Group






Insight's Public Sector Group (PSG)  
Few public entities today have the luxury of dedicating staff solely to investment management of their operating cash assets, which is why many public officials turn to the professionals at Insight. 
We have a wealth of experience, over 25 years, in managing portfolios for clients in the public sector, with assets totaling $95bn worldwide. 
Insight's PSG provides public entities' treasury staff with customized investment portfolios specifically tailored to their individual needs and objectives. 
The PSG employs a team approach comprised of Insight's PSG portfolio managers, global credit research analysts, US client service professionals and US distribution operations groups and supported by Insight's fixed income group globally of over 100 investment professionals with an average industry experience of 17 years. 
Adding value to client portfolios 
Insight's PSG strategy is designed to add value to clients' portfolios primarily through five steps in the active management process. For each client, we: 
- determine a duration target and select a corresponding benchmark- actively manage that duration within a band intended to enhance earnings while protecting the principal of the portfolio- allocate to sectors based on relative value modeling and fundamental analysis- select securities based on in-depth credit research and the security's characteristics- provide Government Accounting Standards Board-compliant reporting 
Philosophy and approach 
Since many public entities have policies and regulations that restrict them to investing in conservative fixed income securities, our philosophy of actively managing customized portfolios provides each client with the greatest opportunity to add value to their portfolio net of fees, within the investment policies, objectives and guidelines governing their investment program. This can often include: 
- preserving capital- providing sufficient liquidity- achieving a market rate of return 
We believe we position clients' portfolios for future market conditions, aiming to enhance the portfolio's return in all market environments. Insight's portfolio managers have considerable experience analyzing current market conditions and projecting future conditions in order to effectively implement active investment strategies based on both.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

	Our strategies





US corporate

This corporate bond strategy offers investors a diversified way to gain broad US dollar investment grade credit exposure. The strategy targets dynamic sub-sector allocation and bottom-up security selection as the main potential sources of return, while typically maintaining duration close to benchmark. Strong risk controls are integral to the management of the strategy. 


Find out more





US core

This strategy offers broad US fixed income exposure designed to offer investors a core bond holding as part of a balanced overall portfolio. This active strategy offers an alternative to passive approach to core fixed income, combining top-down active sector allocation with bottom-up security selection, drawing on the expertise of our research analysts. The strategy will primarily invest in investment grade US fixed income with modest allocation to non-benchmark sectors. 


Find out more







US core plus
This core plus strategy seeks to maximize risk-adjusted excess returns. It invests primarily in investment grade US fixed income with the goal of consistently outperforming its benchmark through the active management of interest rate positioning, sector allocation and security selection. This strategy's excess returns will also come from active allocation to non-benchmark sectors such as high yield and emerging market debt. 

Find out more





US intermediate

Our intermediate fixed income strategy offers investors a diversified, risk-controlled approach to gain broad fixed income exposure to the intermediate part of the yield curve. This active strategy aims to generate excess returns primarily through sector allocation and security selection. 


Find out more







US select income
An income-oriented approach to fixed income investing which invests in a range of investment grade and high yield securities. These assets include corporate bonds, US government obligations, mortgage and asset-backed securities and others. 

Find out more





US long duration

This strategy is suited for investors that have long-dated liabilities. It blends long duration US government and credit securities with the goal of maximizing risk-adjusted excess return. The strategy seeks to take advantage of pricing and spread inefficiencies in long-dated fixed income assets as well as to enhance returns with modest opportunistic use of non-benchmark assets. 


Find out more







Global credit

This global credit strategy scours the fixed income universe for the best investment opportunities to deliver strong risk-adjusted excess returns versus its benchmark. Though focused on investment grade securities, this strategy has the latitude to invest across the full spectrum of credit opportunities.  


Find out more





Buy and maintain

This strategy aims to deliver global credit exposure in a smarter way than traditional indexation. It invests in bonds from investment grade quality issuers with strong long-term fundamentals with a view to avoiding defaults and material loss and with sector weights that are more balanced than issuance-driven passive benchmarks. Additionally, reinvestment of coupons and modest turnover are used to keep duration constant. 


Find out more







Global aggregate
This strategy provides broad global bond market exposure and fully utilizes the expertise of our 98-strong global fixed income team.

The Fund will also seek capital appreciation principally by purchasing debt securities at prices that the Adviser believes are below their intrinsic value. The Fund will also look to benefit from trading securities to optimize the risk adjusted yields in the Fund. Cutwater Investor Services Corp., the Fund’s investment adviser, provides fixed income management to a variety of institutional clients including corporations, governmental entities, employee benefit plans and registered investment companies.A portion of a Fund's current distribution may include sources other than net investment income, including a return of capital. Investors should understand that a return of capital is not a distribution from income or gains of a Fund. As required under the 1940 Act, a notice with the estimated components of the distribution will be sent to shareholders at the time of payment if it does not consist solely of net investment income. The notice should not be used to prepare tax returns as the estimates indicated in the notice may differ from the ultimate federal income tax characterization of distributions. After the end of each calendar year, investors will be sent a Form 1099-DIV informing them how to report distributions received during that year for federal income tax purposes.Statements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined by the United States securities laws. You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward-looking statements because they are subject to uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond the Fund’s control and could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.An investor should consider a Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161207006313/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceRepublicans kill the border taxYahoo FinanceTwitter is only famous now because of President Trump: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredGDP — What you need to know in markets on FridayYahoo FinanceWhite House comms director Scaramucci: 'I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to suck my own c--k'Business InsiderMattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted transgender ban, and he was reportedly 'appalled' by itBusiness InsiderEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredAmazon wobble creates ripples across worldwide stock marketsReutersAmazon could be the first trillion dollar company: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoRolls-Royce Motor CEO: We’re not in the auto business.
