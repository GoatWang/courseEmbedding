	Delta Dental of Michigan Plan I Features
























Plan Information


PPO Plan I Generous Annual Maximum! No Deductibles 
Covered Services Fee Schedule
Gives you peace of mind so you'll never have to worry about having a healthy smile.
Your Delta Dental benefits include coverage at all levels of service—from routine cleanings to root canals. You can go to any licensed dentist, however, you may save on out-of-pocket costs by going to a Delta Dental PPO dentist. In the event that treatment is rendered from a dentist who does not participate, the patient may be responsible for more than the percentage indicated below.
The information on this site is an overview of benefits and not a guarantee of payment. The following summary is a sample of benefits. Policies have exclusions and limitations that may limit coverage. For complete coverage details, please refer to your policy (in Oregon, refer to policy INVD-100A-Delta). These dental plans are available exclusively to members of organizations offering Delta Dental to them. Products and services referred to in this brochure are not available in all states or jurisdictions.





Plan I Covered Services





Plan I—The payment is based on the participating status of the dentist: Delta Dental PPO—based on dentist’s submitted fee or the Delta Dental PPO dentist fee schedule, whichever is less; Delta Dental Premier—based on dentist’s submitted fee or the maximum approved fee, whichever is less; and non-par—based on dentist’s submitted fee or Delta Dental’s nonparticipating dentist fee, whichever is less.

            Note: The balance sheet gives a snapshot of the financial health of an organization at a particular point in time. An organization's total assets should generally exceed its total liabilities, or it cannot survive long, but the types of assets and liabilities also must be considered. For instance, an organization's current assets (cash, receivables, securities, etc.) should be sufficient to cover its current liabilities (payables, deferred revenue, current year loan, and note payments). Otherwise, the organization may face solvency problems. On the other hand, an organization whose cash and equivalents greatly exceed its current liabilities might not be putting its money to best use.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.

Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

* Cost for individual coverage/group plan, source: National Association of Dental Plans. The information above is a general overview. Before purchasing, review specific plan details as costs, coverage and benefits may vary. ** California dental plans currently does not offer HMO insurance plans. This guide is solely for comparison and patient education. 


























Dental Savings Plans or Dental Insurance
Which one is right for you?
Dental insurance limits coverage to $1,000-$1,500 annually (about the cost of a root canal and a dental crown) and makes you wait months before you’re covered for all dental procedures. Dental savings plans cost less than insurance, do not have spending limits and can be used within 72 hours of purchase. 












Click Here To Learn More About Our Dental Plan Options!




What Is A Dental Savings Plan?


An affordable, flexible alternative to dental insurance. Members of dental savings plans receive discounts of 10%-60% (depending on plan chosen) on dental care from a network of California dentists. With a dental savings plan there are no annual spending limitations, and no waiting to save on your dental care.




What is a PPO Plan and Why is it better than an HMO?


With a Preferred Provider Plan (PPO) you can choose from a wider network of dentists than offered by a HMO. You can also see dentists outside of the PPO network, though you’ll save the most by staying in-network. PPOs have less restrictions on when and how often you can get care than HMOs. But PPO coverage for restorative treatments typically doesn’t kick in until you have been a plan member for 6-12 months.




What is Dental Indemnity Insurance?


Also known as “traditional” or “fee for service” insurance, with a dental indemnity plan, you can see any dentist. As with a PPO plan, members pay a percentage of the dentist’s rate.  Costs of dental services may be higher with an indemnity plan, as compared to PPO or HMO plans, but annual maximum spending limits are often also higher. 

















Save on Dental Care, California! Affordable Dental Options For Every Smile
Keep your teeth healthy with discounts on essential preventive care such as checkups and professional cleanings. Reclaim your smile and confidence with big savings on root canals, crowns, implants and dentures. And enjoy reduced rates on braces, whitening treatments, dental implants and many other services covered by our dental plan options.
