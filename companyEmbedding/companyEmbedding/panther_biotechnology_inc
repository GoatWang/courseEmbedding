Panther Biotechnology, Inc. Announces a 6-1 Forward Stock Split to Increase Liquidity of Their Common Stock and Intent to List on the NYSE or NASDAQHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,475.42-2.41 (-0.10%)Dow 3021,796.55+85.54 (+0.39%)Nasdaq6,382.19-40.56 (-0.63%)Panther Biotechnology, Inc. Announces a 6-1 Forward Stock Split to Increase Liquidity of Their Common Stock and Intent to List on the NYSE or NASDAQMarketwiredSeptember 8, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareCHICAGO, IL--(Marketwired - Sep 8, 2014) - Panther Biotechnology, Inc. (OTC Pink: PBYA) (  PINKSHEETS :  PBYA ) announced that a 6-1 forward stock split has been filed and has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and is subject to FINRA approval. The exact date of the split is still pending; however, the forward splitting of the common stock PBYA is being done to increase liquidity for current and future shareholders.Irwin Zalcberg, Chairman of Panther, commented, "Liquidity of our stock is paramount for this organization with only 375,000 shares freely tradable in our float and the rest of the shares outstanding are locked-up for up to 36 months. We will utilize our ability to acquire top-notch developmental hematology products and move the pipeline forward to fast track our goals. One of our main goals as a company is to have a liquid market for investors and up-listing to the NASDAQ or NYSE in the near-term. We look forward to expanding our pipeline, and hitting the pavement to relay our story as the best young biotech on the market. As a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma survivor myself it's imperative that we get Numonafide on the market to alleviate the stress being put on patients using toxic chemo therapeutics and we will have advanced discussions with the FDA to accelerate development. We aim to have a shareholders first mentality which means picking the best drugs, keeping costs down, spending capital to share our story and spend on value driven events and corporate actions to maximize shareholder appreciation. Since we don't have any approved products, sales people or the ability to pay the traditional marketing spend of a mature biotechnology company yet, we will spend a modest percentage of our capital on making this the best marketed biotechnology stock. Our team believes we have a potential molecule with an unlimited potential and upside in Numonafide and potentially three more coming in over the next few months and we plan on being aggressive in our pursuits on all fronts."About Panther Biotechnology, Inc.: Panther Biotechnology is a newly formed entity focused on the acquisition and development of therapeutics for the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma and other cancers. The Company will focus on identifying promising anti-cancer therapeutic candidate that are optimized derivatives of widely studied products or re-purposed existing marketed compounds. The first product candidate, Numonafide, will be evaluated for the treatment of patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The AML market is anticipated to grow to $1.67 billion dollars by 2020 in G8 countries and it is Panthers belief that there are insufficient treatment options available to treat patients.Except for statements that are historical, the statements in this release are "forward-looking" statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Panther cannot ensure that it will be able to obtain a license for Numonafide, or any other technologies, on a commercially acceptable or reasonable basis and may not be able to attract the necessary funding to advance the project in a timely manner. In addition, Panther cannot ensure that clinical results related to in-vivo and in-vitro studies of Numonafide will reproduce the positive results achieved to date. Panther cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial marketing of its treatment for Patients with AML and there may be other treatments in development that are approved before Panthers. Finally, Panther does not currently meet listing requirements for either the NASDAQ or NYSE nor can it ensure that it will be able to achieve these listing requirements.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextS&P 500 and Nasdaq close lower after tech's reversal from record highsCNBCEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredCramer's lightning round: Remember my order for the top semiconductor equipment stocksCNBCCenturyLink CEO to employees: 'We are not perfect,' 'keep your spirits up'Denver Business JournalAmazon profit slumps 77 percent as costs surge, shares fallReutersA Penny-Crypto Miracle Making Some Americans RichAgora FinancialSponsoredRepublicans kill the border taxYahoo FinanceMattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted transgender ban, and he was reportedly 'appalled' by itBusiness InsiderAll the companies in Jeff Bezos’s empire, in one (large) chartMarketWatchZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredTwitter is only famous now because of President Trump: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoRolls-Royce Motor CEO: We’re not in the auto business.

	PANTHER BIOTECHNOLOGY, INC.






	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements




	August 31, 2016




	(Unaudited)




	 




	NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS




	 





	Organization and Business Activity






	 




	Panther Biotechnology, Inc. (the “Company”)
	was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 11, 2011.  The Company was originally incorporated as New Era Filing Services
	Inc., changed its name to NEF Enterprises, Inc. on October 4, 2011 and then changed its name to Panther Biotechnology, Inc. on
	May 29, 2014.  The Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, PubCo Reporting Services, Inc., formerly known as New Era
	Filing Services, Inc., in Florida on November 20, 2012.


	 


	The Company has established a fiscal year
	end of May 31.


	 


	The Company is an early stage bio-medical
	technology company that pursues and is continuing to pursue in-licensing of certain technologies so that they may be able to develop
	those technologies for treatments of patients with cancer.  Panther’s current purpose is to better serve the unmet medical
	needs of patients with the most difficult to treat cancers.  Panther’s mission is to identify, license and acquire unique
	molecules that are designed to heal without causing harm and are either optimized derivatives of existing products, repurposed
	approved products or new classes of drugs. Panther is also seeking other diversified business opportunities.


	 



	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 





	Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements






	 




	The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated
	financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). and should be read in conjunction
	with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's latest annual report filed with
	the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a
	fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein.
	The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes
	to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the
	audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2016, as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted.


	 




	Basis of Consolidation






	 




	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
	have been eliminated in these consolidated financial statements.


	 




	Use of Estimates






	 




	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
	and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues
	and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s periodic
	filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties
	and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations of the Company.

	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	 




	The Company considers all highly liquid
	investments with original maturities of less than three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which,
	in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value, to be cash equivalents.


	 




	Intangible Assets






	 




	Intangible assets are amortized using the
	straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and
	take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.
	All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. Intangible assets having a capitalized cost of $390,487 were impaired
	during the year ended May 31, 2016. No impairment of intangible assets was identified for the three months ended August 31, 2016.


	 




	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets






	 




	The Company reviews the carrying value
	of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost-carrying value
	of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating
	the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net undiscounted
	cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset’s
	carrying value and estimated fair value.


	 




	Fair Value of Financial Instruments






	 




	The Company adopted the framework for measuring
	fair value that establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
	1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy
	are described below:


	 


	Basis of Fair Value Measurement


	 




	 



	·




	Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.





	 



	·




	Level 2 - Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or the liability; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.





	 



	·




	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.





	 


	The Company believes that the fair value
	of its financial instruments comprising cash, accounts payable, and convertible notes approximate their carrying amounts. As of
	August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, the Company had no Level 1 or Level 2 financial assets or liabilities, and Level 3 financial
	assets consisted of the Company’s derivative liability.


	 


	The following table presents the fair value measurement information
	for the Company as of August 31, 2016:

	Income Taxes






	 




	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
	recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in
	effect when these differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the
	weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

	Share-based Expenses






	 




	ASC 718 "

	Compensation –
	Stock Compensation

	" prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee
	services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity
	instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including
	grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values.
	That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award,
	known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).


	 


	The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
	issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, "

	Equity – Based Payments
	to Non-Employees"

	Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever
	is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based
	payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.


	 




	Loss per Share






	 




	Basic loss per common share equals net
	loss divided by weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share includes the impact on dilution
	from all contingently issuable shares, including options, warrants and convertible securities. The common stock equivalents from
	contingent shares are determined by the treasury stock method. The Company incurred net losses for the three months ended August
	31, 2016 and 2015, and therefore, basic and diluted loss per share for those periods are the same as all potential common equivalent
	shares would be antidilutive. For the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had 33,000 common stock warrants
	outstanding that were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would be anti-dilutive.


	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	 




	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU
	No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and in August 2015 issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation
	and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. Under ASU 2015-03, debt issuance
	costs reported on the consolidated balance sheet would be reflected as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather
	than as an asset. While ASU 2015-03 addresses costs related to term debt, ASU No. 2015-15 provides clarification regarding costs
	to secure revolving lines of credit, which are, at the outset, not associated with an outstanding borrowing. ASU No. 2015-15 provides
	commentary that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements
	as an asset and subsequently amortizing them ratably over the term of the revolving debt arrangement. The Company has elected to
	implement ASU No. 2015-03 early and the financial statements as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 reflect the early adoption.


	 


	The Company does not expect the adoption
	of any other recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations
	or cash flows.


	 




	Reclassifications






	 




	Certain reclassifications may have been
	made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.


	 




	Subsequent Events






	 




	The Company has evaluated all transactions
	through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued for subsequent event disclosure consideration.


	 



	NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN AND LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS




	 



	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
	in the normal course of business. As of August 31, 2016, the Company has a cumulative net loss since inception of $11,605,782,
	negative working capital of $1,204,557 and is currently in default on its convertible debt. The Company has required additional
	capital raises and advances from shareholders to support its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability
	of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company's continuation as a going concern is
	dependent upon its ability to raise sufficient capital to fund its operations until such time as it can generate revenues. No assurance
	can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.


	 


	The consolidated financial statements do
	not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
	of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	NOTE 4 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES




	 





	License Agreement with Northwestern University






	 




	On January 26, 2015, the Company entered
	into a license agreement with Northwestern University (“Northwestern”). Northwestern is the owner of certain patents
	and grants for cancer treatments of which the Company has obtained an exclusive license under a Patent Rights agreement and a non-exclusive
	license under a Know-How agreement (together the “Licensed Product”) (“the Northwestern License”).


	 


	The Northwestern License required that
	the Company raise $3,000,000 dollars prior to the one year anniversary of the agreement on January 26, 2016. The Company did not
	raise the requisite amount of capital and is in default on the license agreement. Although the Company has not received a notice
	of default from Northwestern regarding the default, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company recognized an impairment
	charge of $198,820 related to the Northwestern License, which represents the net book value of the intangible asset. However, we
	maintain a close relationship with Northwestern, as they are a significant shareholder in the Company, and the Inventor of the
	Licensed Products sits on our Board of Directors as well as a Professor of Hematology at the Feinberg Medical School (Northwestern’s
	medical school).


	 


	According to the agreement, the Company
	must reach the following milestones to maintain the licenses:


	 




	 



	a)




	Raise funds of at least $3 million by January 26, 2016.





	 



	b)




	Initiate good laboratory practices in preclinical studies with a Licensed Product within 18 months of the closing date;





	 



	c)




	File an Investigational new drug application within 4 years of the closing date;





	 



	d)




	First dosing of a patient in a phase I clinical trial for a Licensed Product within 5 years of the closing date;





	 



	e)




	First dosing of a patient in a phase II clinical trial for a Licensed Product within 6 years of the closing date;





	 



	f)




	First dosing of a patient in a phase III clinical trial for a Licensed Product within eight years of the closing date;





	 



	g)




	Submit a new drug application for a Licensed Product within 10 years of the closing date;





	 



	h)




	Complete and submit to Northwestern a business plan for commercialization of a Licensed Product within 1 year of submission of a new drug application (“NDA”) for such Licensed Product.





	 


	In consideration of the license granted
	by Northwestern, the Company shall pay to Northwestern the following:


	 




	 



	a)




	A non-creditable, non-refundable licensing fee of $24,000 within 30 days of the closing date. The license fee was paid during the year ended May 31, 2014. On January 26, 2015, the license deposit was capitalized as part of the intangible license purchase upon closing of the transaction.





	 




	 



	b)




	In partial consideration of the grant of the exclusive rights and license to the assigned patent rights and non-exclusive license to the know-how of Northwestern, the Company agreed to issue Northwestern a number of shares of its common stock that will represent 2% of the total outstanding shares of the Company and, in consideration of Dr. Sui Huang’s role as co-founder and in anticipation of entering into a research agreement with Northwestern to support research in Dr. Sui Huang’s laboratory, the Company will issue to Dr. Sui Huang a number of shares of common stock that will represent 2% of the total outstanding shares of the Company; The fair value of the 186,282 common shares, based on the January 26, 2015 closing stock price of $2.01, was $374,427.  The Company recorded an intangible license asset in the amount of $187,214 for the shares owed to Northwestern and recorded share-based compensation of $187,213 for the shares owed to Dr. Sui Huang. As of May 31, 2015 and August 31, 2015, none of these shares had been issued and a stock payable in the amount of $374,427 was recorded. On September 12, 2015, one of the Company’s shareholders, and former Chairman of the Board, transferred 186,282 common shares of his own on behalf of the Company for the 4% of outstanding shares to be issued above.





	 




	 



	c)




	The Company shall pay to Northwestern a non-creditable, non-refundable annual maintenance fee on each anniversary of the closing date according to the following schedule until the Company receives regulatory approval from the Federal Drug Administration (or foreign equivalent) (“Regulatory Approval”) of the first Licensed Product(s):

	The Company will reimburse Northwestern's out of pocket patent expenses totaling approximately $25,000 as of November 18, 2014. All future patent costs for the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of the Patent rights, shall be borne by the Company. Payment of out of pocket patent expenses will be deferred until the earlier of a) the date the Company closes on its first round of financing after the closing date or b) one year from the closing date.  None of these events have occurred as of May 31, 2016 and through the date of this filing and the $25,000 reimbursement remains in deferral.

	Blue Print Partners Group






	 




	On April 7, 2015, the Company entered into
	a twelve-month consulting agreement with Blue Print Partners and its principal, Tim Boyd, to assist in, among other items, the
	daily merger and acquisition activities of the Company, raising capital, and the possible acquisition of pre-identified biotech
	assets. Mr. Boyd was to be paid a signing fee of 6,250 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $50,000
	on closing and a retainer of $12,500 per month plus out-of-pocket costs. Mr. Boyd would also have been entitled to various success
	fees ranging from seven percent (7%) to ten percent (10%), based on the type of transaction, of the total value of any transaction,
	and would be payable in shares of the Company’s common stock. Mr. Boyd would have earned a success fee of $100,000 plus 10%
	of the transaction value in the Company’s stock in the event of a closing of a transaction of an acquisition of an agreed
	upon target company, a success fee upon the closing of a financing of 5% cash or 10% in Company stock (7% cash or 12% stock for
	Mezzanine or Equity financing) if Boyd had introduced us to the investor or lender, or a success fee of $100,000 on the sale of
	any of the Company assets through Mr. Boyd. None of these potential targets had been met by Mr. Boyd prior to the termination of
	this Agreement. Due to Mr. Boyd’s improper and unauthorized activities in a number of transactions, the Company terminated
	this agreement on August 18, 2015, and informed Mr. Boyd he would not be receiving any shares and the Company demanded the return
	of $10,000 delivered to Mr. Boyd for the purposes of legal fees for a possible transaction. The Company has instituted legal
	proceedings against Mr. Boyd due to a pattern of conduct by Mr. Boyd after the consulting agreement was signed that the Company
	believes was wholly improper and is seeking significant damages from Mr. Boyd for damages caused due to his actions. The
	Company recorded a stock payable of $50,000 for the 6,250 signing fee shares and accrued $25,000 for the April and May retainer
	amounts due under the agreement as of May 31, 2015. During the three months ended August 31, 2015, the Company accrued an additional
	$37,500 for monthly retainers, pending resolution of this matter. On July 6, 2015, the Company issued 6,250 common shares for the
	$50,000 stock payable recorded as of May 31, 2015. The Company filed a 30-day notice of termination on August 31, 2015, and per
	the terms of the agreement, the contract was terminated on September 30, 2015. Accordingly, the Company reversed the stock payable
	and accrued compensation as of May 31, 2016.

	License Agreement with University
	of Rochester






	 




	On April 16, 2015, the Company entered
	into an exclusive patent license agreement with University of Rochester (“Rochester”). Rochester grants to the Company
	a worldwide exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, for patents and technology related to the treatment
	of diabetes (the “Patent Products”). According to the agreement, the Company will reimburse Rochester for all mutually
	agreed fees and costs relating to the filing, prosecution, and maintenance of patent applications, including without limitation,
	interferences, oppositions, and reexaminations, and the maintenance and defense of patents in patent rights, including fees and
	cost incurred on, and after the closing date of the agreement.


	 


	As partial consideration for the rights
	conveyed by Rochester under this agreement, the Company agreed to issue 25,437 shares of the Company’s common stock to Rochester
	as a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable license issue fee valued at $200,000 based upon the average price per share during
	the week preceding the closing date, which was $7.86. Rochester may not transfer the shares before August 30, 2016.  The Company
	capitalized the $200,000 as an intangible license asset on the consolidated balance sheet. On July 6, 2015, the Company issued
	25,437 common shares to settle the $200,000 stock payable recorded as of May 31, 2015.


	 


	In addition to the above license fee, for
	the term of the agreement on an annual basis measured from the closing date of the agreement, the Company will pay at the beginning
	of the following year a non-refundable minimum annual maintenance fee of $15,000 in cash or Company stock each year prior to the
	onset of clinical trials. Rochester will waive the pre-clinical trial annual maintenance fee if the Company spends at least $200,000
	annually on the drug development that would enhance the patent rights conveyed. After onset of clinical trials, the Company
	will pay a non-refundable minimum annual maintenance fee of $25,000 in cash or Company stock each year or part of year until the
	first product is commercialized and sales royalty payments begin. Annual maintenance fees paid in cash will be credited against
	the costs of maintaining the Patent Rights for that year.


	 


	During the term of this Agreement, the
	Company agreed to pay to Rochester an earned royalty of 5% of the first $10,000,000, 4% of the second $10,000,000, 3% of the third
	$10,000,000, 2% of the fourth $10,000,000 in net sales revenue produced from Patent Products, and 1% of all remaining net sales
	revenue produced from Patent Products. Earned royalty payments are due and payable within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter.


	 


	The Company agreed to pay to Rochester
	50% of all cash and non-cash consideration derived from sublicenses granted by the Company in Patent Products, excluding earned
	royalties, loans, equity investments, and research and development support.


	 


	The Company agreed to pay Rochester the
	milestone payments per product as set forth below:

	If the Company sponsors Phase I, II and III clinical trials, the Company will pay $500,000 within 30 days of approval of any Patent Product;





	 



	b)




	If the Company sells a controlling interest in or sublicenses substantially all of the Patent Products before the initiation of Phase II clinical trial, the Company will pay:





	 




	 



	1)




	$200,000 within 30 days of initiation of Phase II clinical trial;





	 



	2)




	$200,000 within 30 days of initiation of Phase III clinical trial; and





	 



	3)




	$300,000 within 30 days of approval of a Patent Product





	 


	As of August 31, 2016, and through the
	date of this filing, none of the milestones noted above for Rochester have been met.


	 


	The term of this Agreement will commence
	on the closing date and will end upon the latest of (i) expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the Patent Products; or

	The University of Rochester License required
	that the Company spend $200,000 annually on drug development or pay an annual maintenance fee of $15,000 in cash or an equivalent
	number of the Company’s common stock. The Company has defaulted on these requirements. Although the Company has not received
	a notice of default from Rochester regarding the default, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $191,667 related to the
	Rochester License, which represents the net book value of the intangible license, during the year ended May 31, 2016.

	Alchemia Oncology / Blueprint Partners
	Dispute






	 




	On June 27, 2015, the Company entered into
	a binding term sheet to acquire Alchemia Oncology Pty LTD (“Alchemia”), a subsidiary of Alchemia LTD listed on the
	Australian Stock Exchange (the “Alchemia Term Sheet”). The transaction was brought to the Company by Tim Boyd of Blueprint
	Partners, whom the Company engaged to seek potential acquisitions of Australian biotechnology candidates on a success fee basis,
	see Note 4. Mr. Boyd identified and negotiated directly with Alchemia and agreed on the transaction terms. Mr. Boyd subsequently
	presented those terms to the Company. Mr. Boyd guaranteed the due diligence and a financing of $10,000,000 should the Company engage
	in the transaction, with a short term guarantee of $500,000 simply to execute the term sheet. The agreement that Mr. Boyd negotiated
	required a final mutually agreed upon asset purchase agreement containing certain milestone achievements in the short term, including
	but not limited to, a filing of an S-1 registration statement and applying for a listing on the NASDAQ. The acquisition consideration
	was $15,000,000 worth of the Company’s common shares. The guaranteed price of the first tranche of the Blueprint Partners
	financing was $5 per share. The Company believed the transaction to be of minimal risk. However, the initial failure of Blueprint
	to deliver the financing, of which an initial $500,000 was guaranteed with five days from the date of the signing of the term sheet,
	resulted in the failure to achieve certain milestones per the term sheet which then subjected the Company to a breakup fee of $500,000.
	The Company takes the position that it is not liable if such fee were ever pursued due to the failure of Blueprint to deliver the
	financing. The Company was unable to agree upon the terms of the asset purchase agreement as well as unable to achieve the milestones
	on a timely basis due to both Alchemia withholding critical data and Mr. Boyd improperly misrepresenting his ability to deliver
	the requisite financing concurrent with the execution of the term sheet. In addition, the Company discovered questionable board
	relationships and practices amongst Alchemia and Mr. Boyd. Also, certain statements and actions from Alchemia appeared contradictory
	to the expectations of the relationship. The Company made every attempt to resolve the situation, however, the Company suspects
	that possible collusion amongst the parties made the transaction absolutely impossible to consummate. Currently there is no negotiation
	or agreement in place. The Company believes it is entitled to damages and has initiated litigation against Tim Boyd and Blueprint
	Partners and is evaluating whether other parties should be part of the litigation in any capacity. This is not expected to have
	a material impact on the Company.


	 




	In December 2015, the Company received
	a demand letter for payment under the Alchemia Term Sheet demanding $500,000 for the breakup fee and an additional $75,000 for
	operational expenses. The Company has delivered a demand letter to Alchemia asserting its rights to void the agreement in light
	of irregularities that have been brought to the Company’s attention. Neither Alchemia nor the Company have initiated legal
	action regarding the Alchemia Term Sheet. The Company intends to mount a vigorous defense in the event that suit is brought by
	Alchemia and will pursue counterclaims against Alchemia in the event a lawsuit is filed against the Company by Alchemia.


	 




	Stock Purchase Agreement






	 




	On August 28, 2015, the Company entered
	into a Stock Purchase Agreement with a private non-affiliated investor to sell 33,000 shares of the Company’s common stock,
	at a price of $5.00 per share. The closing occurred on August 28, 2015. The investor also received a common stock purchase
	warrant for the right to purchase 33,000 shares at a purchase price of $6.00 per share. The warrant expires on August 27, 2020.
	The investor also received 22,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, with a fair market value of $112,200 based on our
	stock closing price of $5.10 that vested over six months, as consideration for a one year consulting agreement to the Company.
	The investor has agreed to assist the Company in the capacity of investor relations, introductions to potential public market investors
	in the Chicago area, business development and facilitating with potential synergistic corporate alliances, and potential alliances
	with medical practices, etc. in the Chicago area.

	NOTE 8 – DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES




	 



	On August 20, 2015, the Company issued
	a convertible note agreement with a variable conversion feature that gave rise to an embedded derivative instrument. The derivative
	feature has been valued using a binomial lattice-based option valuation model using holding period assumptions developed from the
	Company's business plan and management assumptions, and expected volatility from comparable companies including OTC Pink® and
	small-cap companies. Increases or decreases in the Company's share price, the volatility of the share price, changes in interest
	rates in general, and the passage of time will all impact the value of the derivative instrument. The Company re-values the derivative
	instrument at the end of each reporting period and any changes are reflected as changes in derivative liabilities in the consolidated
	statements of operations. The assumptions used are as follows:

	NOTE 9 – STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY




	 



	In June and July 2016, the Company entered
	into stock purchase agreements with private investors to sell 450,000 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of $67,500.


	 





	NOTE 10 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS




	 



	On September 20, 2016, the Company entered
	into a letter of intent ("Letter of Intent") with Brown Technical Media Corp. ("Brown") a privately owned corporation
	with respect to a proposed acquisition whereby the shareholders of Brown would exchange all of their outstanding capital stock
	with the Company, in consideration for approximately 12 million shares of the Company’s common stock, plus certain earn-out
	rights, the result of which will be that Brown would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Exchange").
	The Exchange will be structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the US Internal Revenue Code.


	 


	The closing of the Exchange is subject
	to certain closing conditions set forth in the Letter of Intent including, but not limited to:


	 


	•       the
	negotiation and execution of a definitive share exchange agreement among the Company and Brown’s shareholders;


	 


	•       the
	execution of definitive instruments and agreements related to the Exchange including employment agreements with Brown’s and
	Panther’s executive management and such other employees as Brown shall designate;


	 


	•       the
	Company's raising a minimum of $250,000 in a private placement;


	 


	•       the
	obtaining by the Company and Brown of all necessary board and stockholder approvals; and


	 


	•       the
	delivery by Brown of audited and interim unaudited financial statements and pro forma financial statements, as required pursuant
	to the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 


	The deadline for closing the Exchange,
	pursuant to the Letter of Intent, is December 31, 2016.


	 


	Steven M. Plumb, the Chief Financial Officer
	of the Company is the Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Brown and also owns 45.4% of Brown’s
	outstanding common stock and would therefore receive approximately 5,442,177 shares of the Company’s common stock in the
	Exchange.


	 


	In September 2016, the board approved
	the issuance of 1,303,333 shares for cash and services. As of the filing date, 833,333 shares have not been issued.


	 


	On October 11, 2016, the Company entered
	into a Settlement Agreement with Typenex Co-Investment, LLC (“Typenex”), whereby the Company and Typenex agreed to
	modify the terms of the Secured Convertible Promissory Note dated August 20, 2015 (the “Note”) between the Company
	and Typenex. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed that the Company will repay $265,000 plus accrued
	interest (the “Settlement Amount”) in fourteen payments. The first thirteen payments will be in the amount of $20,000
	and the fourteenth payment will be in the amount of the unpaid balance of the Settlement Amount. The first payment was due and
	paid on October 21, 2016. Subsequent payments are due on the fifth day of each month thereafter. The Company will make the first
	thirteen payments as follows: (i) $10,000.00 in cash, and (ii) if elected by Typenex in its sole discretion, up to $10,000.00 in
	shares of Company’s common stock. The conversion price of the portion of the payment to be made in the Company’s common
	stock will be based upon the market price which shall mean 60% multiplied by the average of the three (3) lowest Closing Bid Prices
	in the ten (10) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable payment date.


	 


	On October 19, 2016, the Company issued
	85,574 shares of its common stock to a consultant in exchange for services rendered. The fair market value of the common stock
	on the date of issuance was $68,459.

	due primarily to the increase in the derivative liability.

	Expenses




	 



	Operating expenses for the three months
	ended August 31, 2016, decreased $5,942,637 compared to the comparative period in 2015, from $6,051,149 to $108,512. The decrease
	in expenses can be primarily attributed to a decrease in share-based compensation of $5,532,053, Depreciation and amortization
	decreased $6,850, from $13,778 to $6,928. Impairment of intangibles decreased $390,487, from $390,487 to $0 as a result of the
	impairment of the University of Rochester and Northwestern University licenses in the prior year that did not recur in the current
	year.


	 


	Other expenses changed from $106,130 in
	the prior year to other expense of $313,274, for an increase of $207,144 which is composed of loss on debt extinguishment of $17,142,
	increase in the change in derivative liability of $410,082, from ($15,239) in the prior year to $262,520 in the current year, and
	a change in interest expense of $7,563. Loss on sale of subsidiary of $80,194 was incurred in the prior year and not in the current
	year.


	 



	Limited Operating History; Need for
	Additional Capital




	 



	There is limited historical financial information
	about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are a development stage company and generated limited revenues from
	operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations.  Our business is subject to risks
	inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in our rebranding
	efforts, and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in supplies and services.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 



	Currently we do not have sufficient capital
	to fund our business development for the next 12 months. We feel we do have enough funds to cover our operating expenses for the
	next 12 months. We have no committed source of outside future financing. Our current directors have provided some funds to
	cover some of the Company's costs.

	As of August 31, 2016, the Company's cash
	balance was $65,526 compared to $108,912 as of May 31, 2016 and our total assets were $308,701 compared with $358,937 as of
	May 31, 2016. The decrease in cash was due to the use of cash to fund operations and repay debt. The change in total assets was
	primarily due amortization of license agreement costs and the use of cash to fund operations and repay debt.


	 


	As of August 31, 2016, the Company had
	total liabilities of $1,270,083 compared with $966,033 as of May 31, 2016.  Our liabilities increased $304,050 primarily
	due to the increase in derivative liability of $262,520.


	 


	As of August 31, 2016, the Company had
	a working capital deficit of $1,204,557 compared with a working capital deficit of $857,121 as of May 31, 2016. The increase
	in our working capital deficit was primarily attributed to the increase in derivative liability of $262,520.


	 



	Cash Flow from Operating Activities




	 



	During the three months ended August 31,
	2016, the Company used $85,886 in operating activities, compared to the $55,843 of cash used by operating activities during the three
	months ended August 31, 2015.


	 



	Cash Flow from Financing Activities




	 



	During the three months ended August 31,
	2016, the Company received gross proceeds of $67,500 from the sale of common stock during the quarter compared to the prior year
	when the Company had $220,000 in cash from financing activities due to proceeds from issuance of a convertible note.


	 




	Critical Accounting Policies




	 


	We prepare our consolidated financial statements
	in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments
	on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated
	financial statements are prepared. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain,
	materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we
	review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.


	 


	While we believe that the historical experience,
	current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with
	GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.


	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 


	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
	that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
	revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

	ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
	RISK




	 



	As a "smaller reporting company",
	we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.



	 





	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	 



	As of August 31, 2016, management assessed
	the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial
	reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
	Commission ("COSO") and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during
	the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application
	of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal
	controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.


	 


	The matters involving internal controls
	and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
	Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting
	in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation
	of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) management dominated by a single individual without adequate compensating
	controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive and Financial Officer in connection with
	the review of our financial statements as of August 31, 2016.


	 


	Management believes that the material weaknesses
	set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit
	committee, which has been rectified as of the filing date of this document, and the lack of a majority of outside directors on
	our board of directors, which has also been rectified by the filing date of this document, results in ineffective oversight in
	the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in
	our financial statements in future periods.


	 



	Changes in Internal Controls




	 



	There have been no changes in our internal
	controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Securities Exchange
	Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the quarter ended August 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
	likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF
	PROCEEDS




	 



	In June and July 2016, the Company entered
	into stock purchase agreements with private investors to sell 450,000 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of $67,500
	at a price of $0.15 per share.


	 


	On October 19, 2016, the Company issued 85,574 shares of its common
	stock to a consultant in exchange for services rendered.


	 


	The issuances of the above securities were
	deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).



	 





	ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES




	 



	On March 30, 2016, the Company received a notice of default
	from the lender of our secured convertible note holder. The total amount of principal and accrued interest due to the lender as
	a result of the default is $499,735 as of August 31, 2016 and the interest rate of the debt increased to 22%.

	ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION




	 



	On October 11, 2016, the Company entered
	into a Settlement Agreement with Typenex Co-Investment, LLC (“Typenex”), whereby the Company and Typenex agreed to
	modify the terms of the Secured Convertible Promissory Note dated August 20, 2015 (the “Note”) between the Company
	and Typenex. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed that the Company will repay $265,000 plus accrued
	interest (the “Settlement Amount”) in fourteen payments. The first thirteen payments will be in the amount of $20,000
	and the fourteenth payment will be in the amount of the unpaid balance of the Settlement Amount. The first payment was due and
	paid on October 21, 2016. Subsequent payments are due on the fifth day of each month thereafter. The Company will make the first
	thirteen payments as follows: (i) $10,000.00 in cash, and (ii) if elected by Typenex in its sole discretion, up to $10,000.00 in
	shares of Company’s common stock. The conversion price of the portion of the payment to be made in the Company’s common
	stock will be based upon the market price which shall mean 60% multiplied by the average of the three (3) lowest Closing Bid Prices
	in the ten (10) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable payment date.

	TYPENEX NOTE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT


	 


	This Note Settlement
	Agreement (this “

	Agreement

	”) is entered into as of October 5, 2016 (the “

	Effective Date

	”)
	by and between Typenex Co-Investment, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“

	Lender

	”), and Panther Biotechnology,
	Inc., a Nevada corporation (“

	Borrower

	”). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement without definition shall have
	the meanings given to them in the Note (defined below). Each of Borrower and Lender is sometimes referred to herein individually
	as a “

	Party

	” and collectively as the “

	Parties

	.”


	 


	A.

	              

	Borrower previously sold and issued to Lender that certain Secured Convertible Promissory Note dated August 20, 2015 in
	the original principal amount of $1,215,000.00 (the “

	Note

	”) pursuant to that certain Securities Purchase Agreement
	dated August 20, 2015 by and between Lender and Borrower (the “

	Purchase Agreement

	,” and together with the Note
	and all other documents entered into in conjunction therewith, the “

	Transaction Documents

	”).


	 


	B.

	              

	On March 30, 2016, Lender delivered to Borrower a certain notice outlining the occurrence of various Events of Default under
	the Transaction Documents (the “

	Defaults

	”).


	 


	C.

	              

	As a result of the Defaults, on or around April 25, 2016, Lender filed a lawsuit against Borrower in the Third Judicial
	District Court of Salt Lake County, State of Utah (the “

	Lawsuit

	”) and initiated arbitration against Borrower
	by delivering an Arbitration Notice pursuant to Section 10.2 and Exhibit H of the Purchase Agreement (the “

	Arbitration

	”).


	 


	D.

	              

	Lender and Borrower now desire to restructure and settle the Note on the terms and conditions set forth herein and to stay
	the Lawsuit and the Arbitration.


	 


	NOW, THEREFORE, for
	good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:


	 


	1.

	               


	Recitals and Definitions

	. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the recitals set forth above in
	this Agreement are true and accurate, are contractual in nature, and are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement.


	 


	2.

	               


	Settlement Amount

	. Notwithstanding the terms and conditions of the Note, Borrower covenants and agrees to pay to
	Lender $265,000.00 plus accrued interest thereon (the “

	Settlement Amount

	”) in accordance with the terms and
	conditions of this Agreement. The Settlement Amount will be due and payable to Lender in fourteen (14) payments (each such payment,
	an “

	Amortization Payment

	”). The first thirteen (13) Amortization Payments will be in the amount of $20,000.00
	each and the fourteenth (14

	th

	) Amortization Payment will be in the amount of the unpaid balance of the Settlement Amount.
	The first Amortization Payment is due and payable to Lender on or before October 21, 2016, and each successive Amortization Payment
	is due and payable to Lender on or before the fifth (5

	th

	) day of each month thereafter until November 5, 2017 (each
	such date, a “

	Payment Date

	”). The first thirteen (13) Amortization Payments shall be made as follows: (i) $10,000.00
	in cash, and (ii) if elected by Lender in its sole discretion, up to $10,000.00 in shares of Borrower’s Common Stock (“

	Payment
	Shares

	”); provided that any portion of any Amortization Payment that is paid via Payment Shares (the “

	Conversion
	Amount

	”) shall be subject to the following conditions: (a) the number of Payment Shares deliverable with respect to any
	portion of any Amortization Payment made in Common Stock shall be equal to the Conversion Amount divided by the Market Price (as
	defined below); (b) all Payment Shares must be delivered in the manner set forth in Section 9 of the Note; and (c) the applicable
	Payment Shares must have been received by Lender or its broker, as applicable, and become Free Trading within three (3) Trading
	Days of the delivery of the Conversion Notice (as defined below) for such Amortization Payment to be deemed to have been timely
	made. The fourteenth (14

	th

	) and final Amortization Payment shall be made in cash. If Lender elects to receive a particular
	Conversion Amount via Payment Shares, then in such event Lender will deliver a conversion notice (a “

	Conversion Notice

	”)
	to Borrower setting forth the number of Payment Shares deliverable with respect to such Conversion Amount. Any Payment Shares delivered
	pursuant to this Section 2 shall be subject to a true-up in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 11 of the Note.
	In addition, if any Conversion Amount in any month is less than $10,000.00, then in the following month or months Lender shall
	be allowed to convert an amount equal to the difference between the amounts Lender was allowed to convert and the amounts Lender
	actually converted. For illustration purposes only, if Lender’s aggregate Conversion Amounts during the first two (2) months
	following the Effective Date were $15,000.00, then Lender would be entitled to convert a Conversion Amount of up to $15,000.00
	in the next month (the $10,000 available for conversion during such third month, plus the $5,000.00 carryover from the first two
	(2) months). If Lender’s aggregate Conversion Amounts during the third month following the Effective Date were $12,000.00
	for purposes of this example, then Lender would be entitled to convert a Conversion Amount of up to $13,000.00 during the following
	month. For purposes hereof the term “

	Market Price

	” shall mean 60% multiplied by the average of the three (3)
	lowest Closing Bid Prices in the ten (10) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Payment Date.


	 


	3.

	              



	Prepayment

	. Borrower shall have the right, exercisable at any time in Borrower’s
	sole discretion, to prepay the Settlement Amount, in full, prior to the final Payment Date without any prepayment penalty.



	 


	 


	 


	 








	 



	1



	 







	 




	 






	4.

	               


	Interest

	. Beginning on the Effective Date, Interest shall accrue on the Settlement Amount at the rate of 10% per
	annum. All interest calculations hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve (12) thirty
	(30) day months and shall compound daily. Interest shall be calculated, due and payable with the 14

	th

	payment.


	 


	5.

	               


	Share Reserve

	. Within three (3) Trading Days of the Effective Date, Borrower agrees to cause its transfer agent to
	increase the Share Reserve (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) to 3,750,000 shares of Common Stock and to cause its transfer
	agent to provide confirmation to Lender that such increase in the Share Reserve has been completed.


	 


	6.

	               


	Forbearance

	. Subject to the terms, conditions and understandings contained in this Agreement, Lender hereby agrees
	to refrain and forbear from exercising and enforcing its remedies under the Note, any of the Transaction Documents or under applicable
	law, for so long as Borrower is not in default of any of its obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation making
	all Amortization Payments as and when due (the “

	Forbearance

	”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Forbearance shall
	automatically terminate immediately upon the occurrence of any material breach of this Agreement (including without limitation
	any failure of Borrower to make any Amortization Payment when due) and in such event Lender may seek all recourse available to
	it under the terms of the Note, this Agreement, or any other Transaction Document.


	 


	7.

	               


	Payment in Full

	. Upon satisfaction of all of Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement, including, without
	limitation, timely payment of all Amortization Payments to Lender or otherwise paying the entire Settlement Amount, Borrower shall
	be deemed to have paid the entire Outstanding Balance of the Note in full and shall have no further obligations under the Note.
	In addition, upon satisfaction of all of Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation payment
	of all Amortization Payments or otherwise paying the Settlement Amount to Lender in full, the Transaction Documents will terminate
	and shall be deemed to be of no further force or effect, and the Parties shall be released from all obligations, definitions, representations
	and commitments therein.


	 



	8.

	               



	Failure to Comply

	. Should Borrower fail to comply with any of the conditions set forth herein, including without
	limitation failing to make any Amortization Payment when due hereunder (including timely delivery of any Payment Shares), if Borrower
	has not previously repaid the Settlement Amount in full, all accommodations given herein shall immediately and automatically be
	deemed withdrawn and Lender shall be entitled to all remedies available to it at law, in equity or as otherwise set forth in the
	Note, the other Transaction Documents, and this Agreement, including without limitation accelerating Borrower’s obligation
	to repay the entire Outstanding Balance of the Note in full (as such Outstanding Balance is calculated pursuant to the terms of
	the Note and notwithstanding any reductions thereof or other accommodations granted herein) and Default Interest shall begin accruing
	on such Outstanding Balance. In the event Borrower has made any Amortization Payments hereunder, but fails to make all Amortization
	Payments when due hereunder, Lender shall apply the Amortization Payments previously made against the Outstanding Balance of the
	Note.


	 


	9.

	               


	Stay of Lawsuit and Arbitration

	. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Parties agree to cause the Lawsuit and the
	Arbitration to be stayed. The Parties further agree to cooperate with each other to the extent reasonably necessary in the filing
	of any documents necessary to stay the Lawsuit and the Arbitration. In addition, the Parties also agree to dismiss the Lawsuit
	and the Arbitration with prejudice once Borrower’s obligations hereunder have been satisfied in full (including, without
	limitation, timely payment of all Amortization Payments to Lender or otherwise paying the entire Settlement Amount).


	 


	10.

	            


	Ownership Limitation

	. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if at any time Lender
	shall or would be issued shares of Common Stock hereunder, but such issuance would cause Lender (together with its affiliates)
	to beneficially own a number of shares exceeding 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date (including
	for such purpose the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such issuance) (the “

	Maximum Percentage

	”), then Borrower
	must not issue to Lender shares of Common Stock which would exceed the Maximum Percentage. For purposes of this section, beneficial
	ownership of Common Stock will be determined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. The shares of Common Stock issuable to
	Lender that would cause the Maximum Percentage to be exceeded are referred to herein as the “

	Ownership Limitation Shares

	”.
	Borrower will reserve the Ownership Limitation Shares for the exclusive benefit of Lender. From time to time, Lender may notify
	Borrower in writing of the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares that may be issued to Lender without causing Lender to exceed
	the Maximum Percentage. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower shall be unconditionally obligated to immediately issue such designated
	shares to Lender, with a corresponding reduction in the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares. By written notice to Borrower,
	Lender may increase, decrease or waive the Maximum Percentage as to itself but any such waiver will not be effective until the
	61st day after delivery thereof. The foregoing 61-day notice requirement is enforceable, unconditional and non-waivable and shall
	apply to all affiliates and assigns of Lender.


	 



	11.

	            



	Representations, Warranties and Agreements

	. In order to induce Lender to enter into this Agreement, Borrower,
	for itself, and for its affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby acknowledges, represents, warrants and agrees as follows:


	 



	11.1.

	        



	Authority

	. Borrower has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to incur and perform all
	obligations and covenants contained herein, all of which have been duly authorized by all proper and necessary action. No consent,
	approval, filing or registration with or notice to any governmental authority is required as a condition to the validity of this
	Agreement or the performance of any of the obligations of Borrower hereunder.

	11.2.

	        



	No Waiver

	. Any Event of Default which may have occurred under any Note has not been, is not hereby, and shall
	not be deemed to be waived by Lender, expressly, impliedly, through course of conduct or otherwise except upon full satisfaction
	of Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement. The agreement of Lender to refrain and forbear from exercising any rights
	and remedies by reason of any existing default or any future default shall not constitute a waiver of, consent to, or condoning
	of, any other existing or future default.


	 



	11.3.

	        



	Accurate Representations

	. All understandings, representations, warranties and recitals contained or expressed
	in this Agreement are true, accurate, complete, and correct in all respects; and no such understanding, representation, warranty,
	or recital fails or omits to state or otherwise disclose any material fact or information necessary to prevent such understanding,
	representation, warranty, or recital from being misleading. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Lender has been induced in part
	to enter into this Agreement based upon Lender’s justifiable reliance on the truth, accuracy, and completeness of all understandings,
	representations, warranties, and recitals contained in this Agreement. There is no fact known to Borrower or which should be known
	to Borrower which Borrower has not disclosed to Lender on or prior to the date hereof which would or could materially and adversely
	affect the understandings of Lender expressed in this Agreement or any representation, warranty, or recital contained in this Agreement.


	 



	11.4.

	        



	No Defenses


	.

	Borrower has no defenses, affirmative or otherwise,
	rights of setoff, rights of recoupment, claims, counterclaims, actions or causes of action of any kind or nature whatsoever against
	Lender, directly or indirectly, arising out of, based upon, or in any manner connected with, the transactions contemplated hereby,
	whether known or unknown, which occurred, existed, was taken, permitted, or begun prior to the execution of this Agreement and
	occurred, existed, was taken, permitted or begun in accordance with, pursuant to, or by virtue of any of the terms or conditions
	of the Transaction Documents. To the extent any such defenses, affirmative or otherwise, rights of setoff, rights of recoupment,
	claims, counterclaims, actions or causes of action exist or existed, such defenses, rights, claims, counterclaims, actions and
	causes of action are hereby waived, discharged and released. Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that the execution of this
	Agreement by Lender shall not constitute an acknowledgment of or admission by Lender of the existence of any claims or of liability
	for any matter or precedent upon which any claim or liability may be asserted.


	 



	11.5.

	and discuss (i) all terms and conditions of this Agreement, (ii) any and all other documents executed and delivered in connection
	with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) all factual and legal matters relevant to this Agreement and/or
	any and all such other documents, with counsel freely and independently selected by Borrower (or had the opportunity to be represented
	by counsel). Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that it has actively and with full understanding participated in the negotiation
	of this Agreement and all other documents executed and delivered in connection with this Agreement after consultation and review
	with its counsel (or had the opportunity to be represented by counsel), that all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
	and the other documents executed and delivered in connection with this Agreement have been negotiated at arm’s-length, and
	that this Agreement and all such other documents have been negotiated, prepared, and executed without fraud, duress, undue influence,
	or coercion of any kind or nature whatsoever having been exerted by or imposed upon any party by any other party. No provision
	of this Agreement or such other documents shall be construed against or interpreted to the disadvantage of any party by any court
	or other governmental or judicial authority by reason of such party having or being deemed to have structured, dictated, or drafted
	such provision.


	 



	11.6.

	        



	No Proceedings


	.

	There are no proceedings or investigations pending
	or threatened before any court or arbitrator or before or by, any governmental, administrative, or judicial authority or agency,
	or arbitrator, against Borrower.


	 



	11.7.

	        



	No Statutes


	.

	There is no statute, regulation, rule, order or
	judgment and no provision of any mortgage, indenture, contract or other agreement binding on Borrower, which would prohibit or
	cause a default under or in any way prevent the execution, delivery, performance, compliance or observance of any of the terms
	and conditions of this Agreement and/or any of the other documents executed and delivered in connection with this Agreement.


	 



	11.8.

	        



	Solvent


	.

	Borrower is solvent as of the date of this Agreement,
	and none of the terms or provisions of this Agreement shall have the effect of rendering Borrower insolvent. The terms and provisions
	of this Agreement and all other instruments and agreements entered into in connection herewith are being given for full and fair
	consideration and exchange of value.


	 



	12.

	            



	Certain Acknowledgments

	. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that no property or cash consideration
	of any kind whatsoever has been or shall be given by Lender to Borrower in connection with this Agreement.


	 



	13.

	            



	Miscellaneous


	.




	 



	13.1.

	        


	Further Assurances

	. At any time or from time to time after the Effective Date, at the request of a Party, and without

	transactions and fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

	for arbitration of any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Transaction Document or the relationship of
	the Parties or their affiliates shall be in Salt Lake County, Utah. Without modifying the Parties obligations to resolve disputes
	hereunder or under any Transaction Document pursuant to the Arbitration Provisions, each Party hereto submits to the exclusive
	jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah in any proceeding arising out of or relating to this
	Agreement and agrees that all Claims in respect of the proceeding may only be heard and determined in any such court and hereby
	expressly submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such court for the purposes hereof and expressly waives any
	claim of improper venue and any claim that such courts are an inconvenient forum. Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably consents

	or certified mail, postage prepaid, to its address as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, such service to become effective ten
	(10) days after such mailing.

	BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY
	TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED

	Severability

	an additional award of the full amount of the attorneys’ fees and expenses paid by such prevailing Party in connection
	with the dispute without reduction or apportionment based upon the individual claims or defenses giving rise to the fees and
	expenses. Nothing herein shall restrict or impair an arbitrator’s or a court’s power to award fees and expenses

	the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Borrower is not relying on any representation, warranty, covenant or promise of

 Panther Biotechnology Inc. (OTCMKTS:PBYA) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.


The information in Item 2.01 below regarding the Premier
Exchange Agreement, First Note, Second Note, Hill Note, Security
Agreement, Novation Agreement, and Lock-Up Agreement (each as
defined below), is incorporated in this Item 1.01 by
reference.


Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of
Assets.


Premier Acquisition


On January 19, 2017, Panther Biotechnology, Inc. (Panther,
the Company, we and us) consummated the
transactions contemplated by a Share Exchange Agreement (the
Premier Exchange Agreement), by and between the Company,
Premier Purchasing and Marketing Alliance LLC (Premier),
and the sole member of Premier, Scott Schwartz. In connection
with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Premier
Exchange Agreement (the Premier Exchange), we acquired
100% of the outstanding membership interests of Premier from Mr.
Schwartz in consideration for $50,000 in cash, the First Note,
Second Note and Hill Note (each as defined and described below),
and 645,000 shares of our restricted common stock (the Premier
Shares). The amounts owed under the First Note, Second Note
and Hill Note are secured by a Security Agreement, providing Mr.
Schwartz a first priority security interest in all of the
membership interests of Premier. The Premier Exchange has an
effective date of January 1, 2017. As part of the transaction,
Mr. Schwartz agreed to assume all liability for payables owed by
Premier to Hill Electric Supply Co., Inc. (Hill), a
related party of Mr. Schwartz, as of the effective date of the
transaction, to a Novation Agreement, provided that we agreed to
pay all amounts we collect in outstanding accounts receivable as
of the effective date to Hill, to pay down such assumed amount.
The Premier Share Exchange included standard and customary
representations, warranties and indemnification rights.


Premier, also known as National Electrical Wholesale Providers
(NEWP), is in the business of servicing electrical wholesalers
throughout the United States with electrician related study
material including the National Electrical Code. Premier provides
a complete line of printed reference materials in addition to
eBooks, downloadable digital formatting, and mobile applications
to all distributors. Premier has significant corporate accounts
with electrical wholesale conglomerates making them one of the
largest wholesalers of National Electrical Codes in the United
States. Premier also covers HVAC, Plumbing, Industrial and
Residential trade reference materials with online training for
product education, certification and current code practices.
Premier services several multibillion dollar companies such as
Consolidated Electrical Distributors and Home Depot reaching
thousands of accounts in locations throughout the United States.


The Premier Shares are subject to a lock-up agreement (the
Lock-Up Agreement), which prohibits the sale of any
Premier Shares for a period of one year and restricts the sale of
any of the shares in any thirty day period, for an additional one
year thereafter, to 10% of the total volume of our common stock
which traded in the prior 30 days, on a rolling basis.


The First Promissory Note (the First Note) provided to
Schwartz at closing evidences the principal amount of $50,000
owed to Schwartz, which accrues interest at the rate of 8% per
annum until the maturity date, which is the earlier of September
30, 2017, and the date that we raise at least $1.5 million in
funding subsequent to January 1, 2017. The Second Promissory Note
(the Second Note) provided to Schwartz at closing
evidences the principal amount of $50,000 owed to Schwartz, which
accrues interest at the rate of 8% per annum until paid in full.
The Second Note is payable in three installments of $16,667 each,
on January 31, 2017, February 29, 2017 and March 31, 2017. The
Hill Promissory Note (the Hill Note and together with the
First Note and Second Note, the Notes) issued at closing
evidences the principal amount of $36,830 owed by us to Hill,
which amount does not accrue interest and is due and payable on
March 1, 2017. The Notes contain standard and customary events of
default and may be prepaid at any time without penalty.


* * * * * *


The foregoing descriptions of the Premier Exchange Agreement,
First Note, Second Note, Hill Note, Security Agreement, Novation
Agreement, and Form of Lock-Up Agreement, do not purport to be
complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
Premier Exchange Agreement, First Note, Second Note, Hill Note,
Security Agreement, Novation Agreement, and Form of Lock-Up
Agreement, copies of which are attached as Exhibits 2.1, 10.1,
10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6, respectively, to this Current
Report on Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference.


        

Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an
Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a
Registrant.


See the discussions under Item 1.01 above with respect to
the First Note, Second Note, and Hill Note, which are
incorporated in this Item 2.03 in their entirety, by
reference.


Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities


In connection with the closing of the Premier Share Exchange, we
issued the Premier Shares to Mr. Schwartz.


The Company claims an exemption from registration to Section
4(a)(2) and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the Securities Act), for the offer and
sale of the Premier Shares, described above in Item 2.01,
due to the fact that the foregoing offer and sale did not involve
a public offering, the recipient took the securities for
investment and not resale, the Company has taken appropriate
measures to restrict transfer, and the recipient (a) is an
accredited investor, and (b) has access to similar
documentation and information as would be required in a
Registration Statement under the Securities Act.


Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.


On January 20, 2017, the Company issued a press release
announcing the entry into and the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Premier Share Exchange Agreement and related
matters as described above in Item 2.01. A copy of the
press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.


The information responsive to Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K
and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, shall not be deemed
filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), or
otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall
it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the
Securities Act, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set
forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Panther Biotechnology Announces Agreement To Acquire Technology Assets Of Faulk Pharmaceuticals 











Tweet








4/7/2015 10:13:24 AM


CHICAGO, IL--(Marketwired - April     07, 2015) -   Panther Biotechnology, Inc. (OTC PINK: PBYA), a biotechnology company specializing in the development of enhanced therapeutics for the treatment of neoplastic and autoimmune disorders, is pleased to announce today that it has entered into a definitive agreement with privately held Faulk Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to acquire Faulk's pharmaceutical technology assets. The transaction will provide Panther Biotechnology with a proprietary, multinationally patent protected, ligand-drug conjugate technology platform as well as a pipeline of drug product candidates that address unmet medical needs in oncology, autoimmune, antiviral and other disease indications.

The lead development program is a ligand-drug conjugate, TRF-DOX, a combination of transferrin glycoproteins with Doxorubicin for targeted delivery to tumors with the reduction of serious side effects. Clinical results demonstrate significant improvement over Doxorubicin. In a randomized, double blind, controlled study of patients with advanced FIGO stage IV ovarian cancer, the addition of either TRF-DOX or Doxorubicin to conventional chemotherapy was compared. Treatment with TRF-DOX resulted in a statistically significant increase in survival over Doxorubicin in patients with drug resistant ovarian cancer. In a non-blinded study in patients with acute leukemia, TRF-DOX was dosed at 10% of the usual dose and demonstrated an 87% decline in cancer cells circulating in the blood and no extension of the disease to bone marrow in 100% of the patients. TRF-DOX also exhibited a complete response of both the primary tumor and metastatic lesions in a patient with angiosarcoma after having failed three months of standard chemotherapy. Panther plans to submit applications for a phase 2 study in ovarian cancer and a phase 1a / 1b study in lung cancer.

TRF-DOX leverages the targeting ability of the plasma protein transferrin to deliver a powerful chemotherapeutic payload to cancerous cells. In vitro assays demonstrate growth inhibition of cancer cells that are resistant to other chemotherapies including Doxorubicin itself. Cytotoxicity studies demonstrate that a dose reduction of ten to one hundred-fold kills all cancer cells in multiple indications. In vivo studies demonstrate that TRF-DOX selectively binds tumors, inhibits tumor growth better than unmodified Doxorubicin, and increases survival. This improved therapeutic index suggests that further improvements in efficacy without added toxicity can be achieved.

Under the terms of the agreement, in exchange for substantially all the assets of Faulk Pharmaceuticals, Panther will issue shares of the common stock of Panther Biotechnology, Inc. in addition to a tiered royalty payment agreement based on the achievement of specified revenue milestones for any commercialized products based on the acquired technology. As part of the agreement, Panther will also gain access to a strong research and development network and a portfolio of domestic and international patents. The transaction is expected to close by the end of May.

"We are very excited to be acquiring Faulk Pharmaceutical's technology, which we see as complementary to our efforts to develop and commercialize innovative pharmaceutical approaches for the treatment of cancer," stated Evan Levine, Chief Executive Officer of Panther Biotechnology. "This acquisition is a continuation of our strategy to build out a robust pipeline with novel pharmaceutical technologies that improve the efficacy and tolerability of validated therapies."

"Panther's expanded pipeline now includes both early and later stage drugs that address multi-billion dollar market opportunities for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The oncology assets under exploration include molecules targeting certain cancer stem cells," said Dr. Jayesh Mehta who is a Director of Panther and Professor of Medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and heads the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program of Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

"Our decision to join Panther has been driven both by our conviction in their ability to leverage our technology platform and also by the high value we see in the TRF-DOX program," stated Dr. W. Page Faulk, founder of Faulk Pharmaceuticals. "We look forward to taking an active role in advancing TRF-DOX into new clinical trials, in addition to furthering the development of the pipeline of drug candidates we created. We are very pleased to become part of a company that shares our commitment to improving the lives of patients suffering from cancer and other diseases with high unmet medical needs."

About Faulk Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Faulk Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company that is developing a novel technology platform to develop best-in-class drug formulations for cancer and other diseases. The Faulk technology employs chemical conjugation techniques to create powerful pairings of proteins and chemotherapeutic drug formulations that provide a targeting strategy and the predictable delivery of a therapeutic drug. The technology was specifically designed to circumvent many of the challenges associated with the development of drug resistance that so often occurs with many newer cancer therapies.

About Panther Biotechnology, Inc.

Panther Biotechnology, Inc. is an entity focused on the acquisition and development of therapeutics for the treatment of several types of cancer and autoimmune disorders. The company will focus on identifying promising anti-cancer therapeutic candidates that are optimized derivatives of widely studied products or re-purposed existing marketed compounds.

 All the World’s a Cloud
        All of Cloud Is at Cloud Expo!

 Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things 
          Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps 


Join Us at the Javits Center in New York, NY, June 6-8 

          Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. 

          Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. 

          Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS – software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service.

          Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year.

          Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. 

          WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous.

          Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud.

        Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: 
        
          •	Cloud Computing
            •	Big Data | Analytics
            •	Internet of Things
            •	Containers | Microservices
            •	WebRTC
            •	DevOps


        Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. 

          Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. 

          The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. 

          Attend Cloud Expo. Create your own custom experience. Learn the latest from the world's best technologists. Talk to the vendors you are considering, and put them to the test.

          See you in New York!
