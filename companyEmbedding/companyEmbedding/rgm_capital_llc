RGM Advisors - About Austin












CompanyCareers BackgroundPhilosophyCultureContact OverviewAbout AustinBenefits   












Austin, Texas
Ask any Austinite what the city means to them and you’ll likely get a different answer from each one. Austin has something for everyone; it’s a comfortable mix of culture and casual in a vibrant urban setting that’s surrounded by miles of nature. Austin embraces innovation, creativity, and diversity, and also likes to keep things a little weird. That’s what makes Austin a special place to live, work, and play.

LIVE MUSIC
Austin is, officially, the Live Music Capital of the World, which means you can hear live music of almost any kind, every day and night of the week, whether at our famous clubs, a restaurant, the grocery store, or even at a city council meeting. Live music provides the soundtrack for life in Austin and is as diverse and creative as the people who live here.

ARTS & PERFORMANCE
Austin’s performance venues, including the celebrated Long Center and the newly renovated Texas Performing Arts Center, along with the city’s many smaller theatres, provide a wide range of cultural experiences, from symphony and opera to musical theatre, drama, and exciting touring artists. The Blanton Museum holds a renowned permanent collection of American, European, and Latin American art, while the Austin Museum of Art presents changing exhibitions and a wide range of education programs for adults and children. Ballet Austin, the Austin Symphony, and Austin Lyric Opera each produce annual performance seasons that comfortably mix classic masterpieces with new and exciting works by leading artists.

RESTAURANTS & FOOD
Austin has more restaurants per capita than New York City and offers a great menu of culinary delights. We have the best Mexican food north of the border and a wide variety of fine dining that crosses many cuisines including Inter-Continental, Indian, Thai, Argentinean, Japanese, and Italian. For those eating on the run, our rapidly emerging fleet of eclectic food trailers serves affordable, top-notch cuisine and tempting treats from many locations around the city, some of which are Zagat rated. Austin is also home to Whole Foods, whose flagship store is located just steps from downtown. Finally, several weekly farmers’ markets and foodie favorite Central Market round out Austin’s savory offerings.

SPORTS & RECREATION
“Hook ‘em Horns!” may be the dominant cheer around town, but Austin has more to offer than just one of the top ranked college sports programs in the country. Austin now hosts both Formula 1 and Moto GP races, making the city one of the world's premiere racing destinations. Shape magazine says Austin is America’s 10th fittest city and our hike and bike trails, park facilities, and bike routes make it easy to get out and exercise. Austin also has minor league baseball, hockey, and basketball to provide year-round sports fun for all ages.

CITY LIVING
Austin’s downtown is growing by leaps and bounds and is a great place to live, work, and play. You can take up residence in a gleaming new condo tower, walk to work, and join a bustling community of urban city dwellers. With dozens of unique locally owned shops and eclectic eateries, the downtown district – and its slightly funky South Congress neighbor – provide the setting for a uniquely Austin kind of life.

ANNUAL EVENTS
Austin hosts some of the most dynamic and creative annual events in the country. South by Southwest and Austin City Limits Festival might be the best known, but there’s also the Star of Texas Rodeo, the acclaimed Austin Film Festival, and the stylish First Night Austin street party every New Year’s Eve (when it’s usually about 70 degrees). In Austin, you don’t have to look too far or wait very long for the next unique experience.
