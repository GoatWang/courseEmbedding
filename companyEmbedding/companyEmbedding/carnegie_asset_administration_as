Fraudsters are using the details of firms we authorise to try to convince people that they work for a genuine, authorised firm. Find out more about this ‘clone firm’. 






Almost all firms and individuals carrying out financial services activities in the UK have to be authorised or registered by us. This firm is not authorised or registered by us but has been targeting people in the UK, claiming to be an authorised firm.
This is what we call a 'clone firm'; and fraudsters usually use this tactic when contacting people out of the blue, so you should be especially wary if you have been cold called. They may use the name of the genuine firm, the 'firm reference number' (FRN) we have given the authorised firm or other details.
You can find out more about this scam tactic and how to protect yourself from clone firms.
Clone firm details
Fraudsters are using or giving out the following details as part of their tactics to scam people in the UK:

How to protect yourself
We strongly advise you to only deal with financial firms that are authorised by us, and check the Financial Services Register to ensure they are. It has information on firms and individuals that are, or have been, regulated by us.
If you want to check a consumer credit firm that may not yet have been authorised by us, please also check the Interim Permission Register
If a firm does not appear on the Register but claims it does, contact our Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
There are more steps you should take to avoid scams and unauthorised firms.
You should also be aware that if you give money to an unauthorised firm, you will not be covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.
Report a clone firm
If you think you have been approached by an unauthorised or clone firm, or contacted about a scam, you should contact us. If you were offered, bought or sold shares, you can use our reporting form.
What to do if your firm is cloned
If you think your authorised firm has been cloned or scammers are fraudulently using your name or other details, contact our Firm Helpline on 0300 500 0597.

Tepper School of Business (Tepper)
http://www.tepper.cmu.edu/
412-268-2268
Master of Business Administration—MBA
This is primarily a two-year, full-time program, with almost all students completing an internship in the summer between the first and second year of study. An early graduation option is available in some cases,  which allows full-time students to complete their studies in 16 months, but tuition is not decreased. Working professionals in the Pittsburgh area may also complete the MBA degree in the evening through the three-year flex-time program.  The FlexMBA program allows professionals who are unable to attend weekly, on-campus classes to earn the same MBA as our full-time and part-time students through a flexible, part-time online and on-site curriculum.

MBA and Civil and Environmental Engineering [with CIT]—MBA/M.S.
This dual program offers students the opportunity to develop technical and managerial skills in the management of civil and environmental organizations, projects and systems, as well as business management.
MBA and Juris Doctor [with the University of Pittsburgh School of Law]—MBA/J.D.
Many lawyers need to draw heavily on management skills, and many business practitioners need knowledge of law. In response, Tepper and the University of Pittsburgh School of Law have designed a rigorous four-year, dual-degree program in which students earn both the J.D. and MBA. Interested candidates must apply and be admitted to both the MBA program and the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.
MBA and Software Engineering [with SCS]—MBA/M.S.E.
The Master of Business Administration and Master of Software Engineering (MBA/M.S.E.) is a six-semester program that starts each year in August. The focus of the dual-degree program is to develop the technical and the managerial skills needed for software design, development, engineering and implementation. This dual-degree program is designed for exceptionally strong candidates for either the MBA or the M.S.E. programs. Each applicant must have engineering/science backgrounds, and must apply and be admitted to both the MBA and the M.S.E. programs. Candidates must take both the Graduate Management Admissions Test and the Graduate Record Examination. The completion date cannot be accelerated; students must remain in residence at Carnegie Mellon for the seven semesters of the program.
Computational Finance - MSCF
The MSCF program focuses on the use of quantitative methods and information technology in the field of finance. The curriculum provides an in-depth understanding of the mathematics used to model security prices, the statistical tools needed to summarize and predict the behavior of financial data and the predominant programming languages used in the industry, preparing students for careers in risk management, trading, and asset management. The program can be completed in sixteen months (full-time) at either the Pittsburgh or New York City campus.
www.cmu.edu/mscf
Integrated Innovation for Products & Services [with CIT, CFA and Tepper]—MII-PS
The one-year professional degree in integrated innovation is offered by the Integrated Innovation Institute at Carnegie Mellon. The Integrated Innovation Institute is a unique academic, research, and executive education entity that is jointly supported by the Carnegie Institute of Technology (the College of Engineering), the College of Fine Arts' School of Design, and the Tepper School of Business. The Master of Integrated Innovation degree focuses on the creation of products, services and interactive experiences that define new product opportunities that exceed user value expectations. The program excels at providing engineers, designers, business students and those in related fields, the skills and knowledge to become elite innovators.

DOCTORAL PROGRAMS
http://www.tepper.cmu.edu/prospective-students/phd
Accounting—Ph.D.
This program prepares students to conduct original, creative research that will add to the general knowledge of accounting, providing rigorous training in accounting and the related disciplines of economics, behavior science, finance, production, statistics, mathematics and other social science research methods. Most accounting research at Tepper is grounded in economics, but students may take courses in mathematics, probability and statistics, econometrics and experimental design, which prepare them to conduct both theoretical and empirical research. 
Business Technologies—Ph.D.
The BT program provides students with a firm understanding of the technical and organizational aspects of computer-based systems, as well as the analytical and empirical skills with which to contribute to basic, scientific knowledge in the discipline. Students in the program master the core material, gain exposure to the broader aspects of information systems and concentrate in at least one specialized area of BT (e.g., electronic commerce, software development productivity or economics of information systems).
Economics—Ph.D.
This program educates scientists who will advance the frontiers of economic knowledge through research and teaching. The program is designed to provide students with sound training in economic theory and the quantitative tools required for innovative research on economic problems. The program is also structured to allow students both time and guidance for research activities.
Financial Economics—Ph.D.
This program educates students in the concepts and analytical techniques needed to understand and advance the frontiers of knowledge in financial economics, providing sound training in economics, finance and quantitative methods, and the opportunity to work closely with faculty on original research. This training typically leads to academic careers in major business schools and economics departments.
Marketing—Ph.D.
The intent of this program is to produce leading scholars and researchers who are well grounded in the basic disciplines underlying marketing thought, and who understand and practice the state of the art in marketing. A set of basic courses in marketing provides a solid background in fundamental marketing problems such as product design, strategy, management, marketing communications, buyer behavior and marketing research. In addition to computer science, psychology and decision sciences, the university offers excellent programs in other disciplines related to marketing (such as statistics), and Tepper itself contains excellent resources in areas such as operations research, economics and organizational behavior and theory.
Operations Management —Ph.D.
This program’s goal is to train researchers and future faculty to develop scientific solutions to the problems currently being faced by operations managers. The area covers a broad range of topics as found in: supply chain management; internet applications and e-commerce; logistics; international operations; inventory control; scheduling; just-in-time manufacturing; kanban systems; interface of design and manufacturing; interface of manufacturing with information systems and marketing; new product development; learning and human resource practices in manufacturing organizations; automation and computer integrated manufacturing; quality management; activity based costing; and other interdisciplinary aspects of plant operations and shop floor control. Faculty research interests range from quantitative modeling to empirical studies using tools from operations research, mathematical programming, applied stochastic processes, simulation, artificial intelligence, statistics and econometrics.
Operations Research—Ph.D.
Operations research is the study of mathematical methods, usually implemented by computer programs, that can be used in solving managerial decision problems. A major goal of the program is to train students to recognize operations research problems in real-world situations, and to give them the opportunity to learn about the implementation of operations research models in one or more of these substantive areas. Each student must choose an area of concentration for the minor requirement (e.g., Probability and Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Operations Management or Economics).
Organizational Behavior and Theory—Ph.D.
The goal of this program is to produce scientists who will make significant research contributions to the general understanding of the structure and functioning of organizations and of the behavior of individuals and groups in organizations. The program is designed to permit a very close learning relationship among students and faculty. The opportunities for interaction with faculty and students in other Carnegie Mellon graduate departments (e.g., Heinz School of Public Policy and departments of Psychology, Social and Decision Sciences and Statistics), the small size of the program and its flexibility allow students to individualize their learning experiences and to develop programs that fit their goals.
Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization [with MCS and SCS]—Ph.D.
The focus of this program is on the design of efficient algorithms for problems arising in computer science and operations research, and on the mathematics required to analyze these algorithms and problems. The program brings together the study of the mathematical structure of discrete objects and the design and analysis of algorithms in areas such as graph theory, combinatorial optimization, integer programming, polyhedral theory, computational algebra, geometry and number theory. http://aco.math.cmu.edu 412/268-2545
Economics and Public Policy [with Heinz]—Ph.D.
This program is jointly offered by Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz School and Tepper School of Business. Students in this program will obtain in-depth training in economics, quantitative methods and substantive policy areas. Students in the joint program must be admitted into both Heinz’s Public Policy and Management Ph.D. program and Tepper’s Economics program. However, to ease the administrative burden on the applicant, he or she need only submit one application to either program.
Management of Manufacturing and Automation [with Robotics Institute]—Ph.D.
This program gives qualified students a total-system perspective on manufacturing issues. The program is particularly useful for students interested in gaining a perspective that integrates management, engineering and computer science to solve the new challenges of design, planning, operation (including real-time control) and evaluation of modern and automated manufacturing systems and industries. Students work with faculty from both Tepper and the Robotics Institute on projects that involve faculty from both areas. The interdisciplinary focus allows students to work closely on issues in accounting, finance, economics and marketing, and the ways in which they affect the design and operation of modern manufacturing facilities.
Strategy, Entrepreneurship and Technological Change [with CIT, Heinz and H&SS]—Ph.D.
This joint program spans four colleges at Carnegie Mellon: Tepper, Heinz, H&SS (Department of Social and Decision Sciences) and CIT (Department of Engineering and Public Policy). Students receive training in the areas of firm strategy, entrepreneurship and technological change, with an emphasis on analytic modeling. Coursework draws from a number of disciplines and areas, including economics, history, statistics, organizational behavior, entrepreneurship and firm strategy.

Guide to Graduate Degrees & Programs
Because of our interdisciplinary nature, it is sometimes difficult for prospective graduate students to identify the Carnegie Mellon graduate degree/program that would be appropriate for them. The Guide to Graduate Degrees and Programs provides a broad introduction to the academic departments.
The brochures below highlight program opportunities in some of our key areas of research and academics.
1. Energy, Environment, & Sustainability [pdf]
2. Health-Related Fields [pdf]
3. Data Sciences
4. Graduate Intercollegiate Tech-Arts Degrees
Admissions
All admission processes are handled at the program/department level, so you will find the most up-to-date and program specific information on the individual website for each program through the Guide to Graduate Degrees and Programs. Any program-specific questions should be directed to your program of interest. Many of the departmental websites provide information regarding the application process, deadlines and the specifics of the academic programs under a “Prospective Student” section so it is highly recommended that you look at this information. You may also find responses to common application questions under an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section under Application/Admissions.
Global Presence
Carnegie Mellon is increasing its global partnerships with branch campuses and collaborative international programs. We encourage you to explore graduate degree programs at all of our locations to find the best fit to meet your goals.
