We Give You Options
Sourcing engines is a complicated business. Application workloads differ, and often require completely different components with complex assemblies. Buying engines isn’t only about power and torque — it’s about value, performance, and reliability. And the engine industry doesn’t make it easy. An automotive bias and poor application support leaves equipment manufacturers to fend for themselves. Wouldn’t it be nice to find powertrains built for your product instead of the other way around?
At PSI, building custom power systems is what we’re all about. We transform engines into ruggedized power systems ideally suited to their end-application use. Fuel-flexibility and efficiency, weight, ruggedization of high-use components — all result from well-thought decisions made by our application-savvy engineers, in conjunction with our customers.
And PSI’s global-scale purchasing power allows us to provide high-performance, cost-competitive cooling packages, fuel systems, and other components. In-house design services, in-line testing, emissions certification, and other value-added options make PSI a single-source solution for all of your powertrain needs.
See all of what PSI has to offer here.
Leading-Edge Manufacturing 
The more manufacturing progresses globally, the more we learn about what can go wrong, and how to do it right. But many manufacturers are slow to incorporate this knowledge, clinging to inefficient methods and dated, proprietary technologies.
PSI is different. We know that lean manufacturing and proven workflow systems lead to the highest engine quality at the lowest cost to our customers, so we embrace these wisdoms. PSI’s quality systems including Six Sigma, ISO 9001:2008, and 5S to name a few, guide the management of our 400,000+ square foot manufacturing, engineering, assembly and distribution space.
And our open-architecture methodology makes PSI engines a better value because of the flexibility it affords. While some engine suppliers use only proprietary technologies in their products, PSI licenses the latest technology innovations to make high-performing power systems that are more efficient and effective than their conventional counterparts. We favor fuel-flexible, platform-agnostic designs that are amenable to future upgrades and adaptations. This gives our customers the best technology available today with the flexibility for future enhancements and unrestricted scalability and growth.
We also utilize best practices for production to keep quality and flexibility high while keeping waste low, allowing us to maintain value prices for our customers. Flexible assembly lines and labor schedules allow us to expand or streamline at will to meet demand. Coordinated assembly lines make in-line testing easy for evaluating and maintaining product quality. And our specialized schedule and release systems integrate with Just-In-Time, Kanban and designated pull systems to support inventory reduction goals.
Read about PSI’s quality systems, or learn more about what we do.
PSI is Powering a Greener Future
The world is changing. Traditional-fuel prices are becoming volatile, emission regulations are more stringent every day, and equipment manufacturers are being forced to adapt. We make adapting easy with fuel-flexible, emission-certified engines to meet the demands of every application. PSI is one of the largest providers of industrial gas and alternative fuel engines in North America and has over 20 years of experience serving emission control system solutions.
Our engines are emission certified for all fuels and are available in Gasoline, Natural Gas (NG), Liquid Propane (LP), and Dual Fuel. All certified engines can be delivered as drop-in power systems, complete with cooling and fuel components, air handling, hydraulics, electrics, packaging, and telematics.
PSI incorporates the newest clean technologies to deliver the best performance-to-fuel ratio at the lowest long-range cost. Whether you’re dealing with EPA regulations for Small Off-Road, Large Spark Ignited engines or On-Highway Certification, PSI has a solution.

PSI On-Highway Engines
Out on the asphalt day in and day out, your vehicles take a beating. The length of their life — and how much they cost you along the way — depends on the quality of the engine inside.
PSI builds efficient, fuel-flexible, high-performance engines that can handle the rigors of on-road. From garbage trucks to school buses to delivery vehicles, our engines deliver the economy you need without sacrificing on power or performance.
Our emissions solutions take the complexity out of compliance. Innovative technology eliminates the need for expensive Tier-4 after-treatments, and fuel-flexible designs provide maximum insurance against volatile fuel prices.
PSI’s lineup for on-highway currently includes our specially designed 4.8 liter, 6.0 liter, 8.8 liter, and 11.1 liter engines, which run on gasoline, propane (LP), or compressed natural gas (CNG).
Take a look at our cleantech options for on-highway:

The class 4, 5, 6 and 7 on-highway applications we build for include:





School buses
Transit buses
Garbage trucks
Chassis manufacturing
Military vehicles




Long-haul trucks
Panel vans
Step vans
Delivery trucks
Recreational vehicles





Break out of Tier-4 Tyranny
With emissions regulations looming for diesel engines, on-highway companies are assessing their options. The expense of engine modifications, added packaging size, complexity and serviceability of after-treatment, and volatile fuel prices have driven OEMS to look at alternatives.
PSI’s clean-technology solutions for on-road put you back in the driver’s seat with a host of emissions-conscious, fuel-flexible engines to suit your needs. The latest green technologies provide substantial reduction in emissions without the usual loss of performance, and significant fuel savings helping to achieve a quicker return on investment.
Many of our engines are pre-certified for emissions, and as the Manufacturer of Record for all our engines, PSI takes care of the documentation associated with certification — so you don’t have to.
Our green power solutions reduce the cost and complexity of compliance, leaving you free to enjoy your company’s contribution to the global sustainability effort.
We also invite you to learn more about PSI, or simply contact us today to see how PSI can power your company.

Power Solutions International, Inc. Announces the Acquisition of Professional Power Products, Inc.
Enters Market for Large Power Generation Systems

WOOD DALE, Ill., April 1, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Power Solutions International, Inc. (Nasdaq:PSIX), a leader in the design, engineering and manufacture of emissions-certified alternative-fuel and conventional power systems, today announced that it acquired Professional Power Products, Inc. ("PPPI"), a leading designer and manufacturer of large, custom engineered integrated electrical power generation systems serving the global diesel and natural gas power generation market.


 PPPI specializes in power generation systems for both standby and prime power applications. Each integrated generator system is a pre-assembled, modular, fully integrated generator set shipped directly to the OEM or end user customer. The PPPI product portfolio also includes switchgear, control panels, load banks, mobile power trailers and UL Listed® tanks. In 2013, PPPI generated net sales and operating income of approximately $40.3 million and $7.9 million, respectively.      


 The Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of PPPI for an initial cash purchase price of $46 million. In addition, the Company will issue to the sellers between $5 million and $15 million in the Company's common stock, valued at $76.02 per share, based upon PPPI's 2014 operating results. The cash portion of the transaction is being financed initially with the Company's bank credit facility. To facilitate the transaction, the Company entered into an amended and restated agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. increasing its revolving line of credit from $75 million to $90 million, among other things. 


 Excluding one-time transaction, integration and purchase accounting related costs, the transaction is expected to be accretive to the Company's results in 2014. The earnings per share impact also will be subject to the accounting allocation of the purchase price and contingent consideration.


 The Company also noted the acquisition extends its global reach and represents a continuation of the Company's strategy of providing value-added power solutions and ongoing growth strategies fueled by diesel and natural gas trends. The addition of PPPI broadens the Company's product offerings and is expected to accelerate growth with both new and existing customers globally.


 "We are delighted with the acquisition of PPPI and the tremendous opportunity it presents us," stated Gary Winemaster, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Power Solutions International, Inc.  "PPPI brings us a talented management team and a strong complementary product offering. This, along with PSI's expertise in power systems technology and extensive customer relationships, creates a remarkable combination that should expand our customer reach and position us very well for growth in the years ahead."

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 


 This press release contains forward-looking statements, regarding the current expectations of Power Solutions International, Inc. (the "Company") about its prospects and opportunities, including expectations with respect to the acquisition of PPPI. These forward-looking statements are covered by the "Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company has tried to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as "expect," "contemplate," "anticipate," "estimate," "plan," "will," "would," "should," "forecast," "believe," "outlook, " "guidance," "projection," "target" or similar expressions, but these words are not the exclusive means for identifying such statements. The Company cautions that a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors could 
cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the Company's ability to integrate PPPI into the business of the Company successfully and the amount of time and expense spent and incurred in connection with the integration; the risk that the economic benefits, cost savings and other synergies that the Company anticipates as a result of the acquisition are not fully realized or take longer to realize than expected; the continued development and expansion of the market for alternative fuel power systems; technological and other risks relating to the Company's development of its 8.8 liter engine, introduction of other new products and entry into on-road markets (including the risk that these initiatives may not be successful); the timing of new product ramp-ups; the significant 
strain on the Company's senior management team, support teams, manufacturing lines, information technology platforms and other resources resulting from rapid expansion of the Company's operations (including as a result of the acquisition of PPPI); changes in environmental and regulatory policies; significant competition; global economic conditions (including their impact on demand growth); and the Company's dependence on key suppliers. For a detailed discussion of factors that could affect the Company's future operating results, please see the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the disclosures under "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in those filings.
