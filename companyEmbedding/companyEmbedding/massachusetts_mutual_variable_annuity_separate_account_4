Answer a few questions to get started


















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.
	
	
	       
					
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.




Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and, in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.



          Annuities at Fidelity are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc. and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC.


          Fidelity Income Strategy Evaluator is an educational tool.

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

Information � (In the event no Beneficiary designation is on record, death benefit proceeds will be paid to the default Beneficiary as provided under the terms of the Contract. Unless you indicate otherwise, in the event of the death of a Joint
Owner, the surviving Joint Owner, if any, will be treated as the Primary Beneficiary. Unless you indicate otherwise, if a Beneficiary in any class predeceases the last surviving Annuitant, that Beneficiary�s share will be distributed pro-rata
among the remaining Beneficiaries in that class.)  � If Joint Annuitants are designated under a qualified Contract,
the surviving Annuitant must be the sole Primary Beneficiary.  � For the �% of remaining payments� section,
as an alternative you may write �In Equal Shares� if desired.  F Check here if the Contract is jointly owned and a
designation other than the surviving Owner is to be the Primary Beneficiary.  Primary Beneficiary Name Date Of Birth Social

Payment (A $10,000 minimum is required.)  � Single Purchase Payment Amount $
������������Please estimate for transfers.  � All
transfers/rollovers received within 60 calendar days from our receipt of the first payment constitute a single Purchase Payment. The single Purchase Payment will be applied to this Contract upon the earlier of: (a)�our receipt of all
transfer/rollover payments, or (b)�60 calendar days from our receipt of the first payment. Any portion of the Purchase Payment allocated to the General Account will receive credit for the time between our receipt of the payment and the Contract
issue date. Any portion of the Purchase Payment allocated to a variable investment choice will not receive such a credit nor will it receive stock market performance.  � If the minimum Purchase Payment amount is not satisfied within 60 calendar days from our receipt of the first payment, the Purchase Payment will be returned and no Contract will be issued. If,
on the 60th calendar day since our receipt of the first payment, the amount received to date meets the minimum Purchase Payment requirement, we will issue the Contract with the amount received to date regardless of the fact that the entire amount of
the anticipated single Purchase Payment has not been received by us. If you would prefer we open separate Contracts at the time each transfer/rollover is received, please submit a separate Application for each.  � REQUIRED Replacement Question�(This section must be completed by the Owner.)  � APPLICATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTAIN THIS INFORMATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

to me under this Contract by Electronic Direct Deposit to the bank account designated below. I also authorize MassMutual to initiate debits to that bank account for overpayments made to me and the bank named below to debit my account and refund any
such overpayments to MassMutual. Payments made under this agreement shall fully satisfy MassMutual�s obligation to make payments to me.  I also agree that to cancel this agreement, I must give at least one months written notice to the MassMutual Home Office. Upon my death, my executors or administrators shall pay to MassMutual from my estate the amount of any
payments collected by the bank, which were not payable because they were issued after my death.  Owner Signature (If direct

 2A. Tax Withholding  Payments qualifying as eligible rollover distributions, which you receive from tax-qualified contracts, are subject to mandatory 20% Federal income tax withholding. The Internal Revenue Code requires you receive a reasonable
time (at least 30 days) to consider making a direct rollover of your tax-qualified assets to an eligible retirement plan rather than receiving an eligible rollover distribution subject to mandatory withholding. You may elect to waive the right to
this required time period.  Other payments you receive from Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company
(�MassMutual�) are subject to Federal income tax withholding unless you elect not to have withholding apply. Any election you make will remain in effect until you revoke it by returning to us a signed and dated revocation of election. If
no withholding election is affirmatively made, withholding will be performed based on a filing status of married with three exemptions as required by the Internal Revenue Code.  If you elect not to have withholding apply to your other payments, or if you do not have enough Federal income tax withheld from these
payments, you may be responsible for the payment of estimated tax and/or be subject to estimated tax penalties.  State
and/or local income tax withholding will be performed in those jurisdictions where it is required. In addition, if federal withholding is elected we will assume that state and local withholding is also elected for those jurisdictions where
withholding is optional, unless otherwise indicated in the Miscellaneous Instructions/Comments section. If taxes are withheld, they will be withheld for all Payees, including those with dollar amount Annuity Payments.  You should consult with a professional tax advisor before you begin receiving payments. Please check the appropriate box below to make
your withholding election for payments other than eligible rollover distributions:  A. F I elect to have no income tax
withheld from my annuity payments (do not complete B or C).  � F I want my withholding from each annuity payment to be
figured using the default assumption of married claiming three exemptions unless another election of allowances and marital status is shown below (you may also designate an additional amount in item C).  ������������Allowances F Single F Married F Married, but withhold at a higher
single rate  C. F Withhold the following additional amount from each annuity payment (you must complete B)

Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company and its affiliates offer a variety of annuity products. These products may include fixed and variable immediate annuity Contracts as well as fixed and variable deferred annuity Contracts.
The products are designed to satisfy a customer�s need for a long-term retirement product. Immediate annuities are designed for customers who desire to receive annuity payments rather than accumulate contract value. Deferred annuities are
designed for customers who desire to accumulate contract value and receive annuity payments at a later date. Fixed annuity products (immediate and deferred) are designed for customers who have a low risk tolerance and seek a guaranteed rate of
return. Variable annuity products (immediate and deferred) are designed for customers who have a higher risk tolerance. Please ask your producer for more information about these annuity contracts to determine which one is the best one for you.

days after receipt at the Annuity Service Center. Additional Purchase Payments will be credited to the Contract as of the Valuation Period when they are received in good order.  TRANSFERS  Minimum and Maximum Amount to be Transferred: The
minimum amount of a transfer is $1,000 per transfer request (from one or multiple Sub-Accounts and the Fixed Account(s) during the Accumulation Period) or the Contract Owner�s entire interest in the Sub-Account or Fixed Account(s), if less.
This requirement is waived if the transfer is made in connection with any scheduled transfer program (e.g. dollar cost averaging, rebalancing, asset allocation, interest sweep) offered by the Company.  For any Contract Year, transfers out of the Declared Interest Rate Fixed Account are limited in amount to 30% of the Contract Value allocated to such account at the time
of the first transfer in that Contract Year. The entire Contract Value allocated to the Fixed Account may be transferred in the Contract Year following 30% transfers in each of the immediately preceding three Contract Years, provided that Purchase
Payments or transfers have not been applied to the Fixed Account(s) from the time the first annual transfer was made.  Transfers out of the Fixed
Account(s) are done on a first-in-first-out basis. [Currently, the Company will limit transfers from the Separate Account such that no transfer can cause the Fixed Account to exceed 70% of the Contract Value.] The Company reserves the right, upon 30
days advance notice to the Contract Owner, to limit transfers from the Separate Account to the Fixed Account.  Transfers between Competing Accounts are not
allowed except as provided below. The Fixed Account(s) and the money market Sub-Account are considered Competing Accounts. For a period of ninety (90)�days following a transfer out of a Competing Account, no transfers may be made into that same
account or any other Competing Account. However, transfers may be made from the money market Sub-Account to the Fixed Account(s) without regard to the Competing Accounts restrictions.  Number of Transfers: The Contract Owner may make unlimited transfers during the Accumulation Period and 6 transfers per calendar year during the Annuity Period, subject to the conditions imposed on such
transfers by the Company. The Company reserves the right to limit transfers when the transfer privilege is being exercised to the detriment of other Contract Owners. The Company further reserves the right, upon 30 days advance notice to the Contract
Owner, to limit the number of transfers in the future.  Unscheduled transfers may not be made if the Contract Owner is participating in either the
Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit (GMAB), Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit (GMIB) or Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB); provided, however, that the Company reserves the right, upon 30 days advance notice to the Contract Owner, to
modify permissible transfers to the Fixed Account and/or Sub-Accounts.  Free Transfers: 12�per calendar year during the Accumulation Period;
6�per calendar year during the Annuity Period. All transfers made during a Valuation Period are deemed to be one transfer.  �

Exhibit 4 part 1  �
Transfer Fee: The Transfer fee will not exceed $20 for each transfer in excess of the Free Transfers. In
addition, this requirement is waived if transfers are made in connection with any scheduled transfer program offered by the Company or through an automatic voice response system or the internet.  Minimum Amount Which Must Remain In a Sub-Account or the Fixed Account(s) After a Transfer: $1,000; or if the entire amount in the Sub-Account or Fixed Account(s)
is less than $1,000, the entire amount must be transferred.  WITHDRAWALS  Contingent Deferred Sales Charge (CDSC): A Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is assessed against the amount of the Contract Value withdrawn and may be applied to an Annuity Option. The charge is calculated at
the time of each withdrawal or if applicable, at the time of annuitization. For partial withdrawals, the charge is deducted from the remaining Contract Value and is deducted from the Sub-Accounts and Fixed Account(s) in the same proportion that the
amount of withdrawal from the Sub-Account or Fixed Account(s) bears to the total of the partial withdrawal.  �

 HISTORY



 



 Massachusetts Mutual
     Variable Annuity Separate Account 1 (Separate Account 1) is a
     separate investment account established on April 8, 1981 by Massachusetts
     Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual). Separate Account 1
     operates as a registered unit investment trust pursuant to the Investment
     Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act) and the rules promulgated
     thereunder.



 



 MassMutual maintains three
     segments within Separate Account 1. The segments are Variable Annuity Fund
     4, Flex-Annuity IV (Qualified) and Flex Extra (Qualified). These notes and
     the financial statements presented herein, with the exception of Note 9,
     describe and consist only of the Variable Annuity Fund 4 and Flex-Annuity
     IV (Qualified) segments (the Segment).



 


2.

 INVESTMENT OF THE SEGMENTS
     ASSETS



 



 The Variable Annuity Fund
     4 and the Flex-Annuity IV (Qualified) segments each have four divisions.
     The MML Equity Division invests in shares of MML Equity Fund, the MML
     Money Market Division invests in shares of MML Money Market Fund, the MML
     Managed Bond Division invests in shares of MML Managed Bond Fund and the
     MML Blend Division invests in shares of MML Blend Fund.



 



 MML Equity Fund, MML Money
     Market Fund, MML Managed Bond Fund and MML Blend Fund are four of the
     eight separate series of shares of the MML Series Investment Fund (the
     MML Trust). The MML Trust is an open-end, management
     investment company registered under the 1940 Act. MassMutual serves as the
     investment manager to the MML Trust. David L. Babson & Company, Inc. (
     Babson), a controlled subsidiary of MassMutual, served as the
     investment sub-adviser to MML Equity Fund and the Equity Sector of the MML
     Blend Fund (effective January 1, 2000, Babson will continue to serve as
     the sub-adviser to the MML Equity Fund and will become the sub-adviser to
     the MML Money Market Fund, MML Managed Bond Fund and the entire MML Blend
     Fund) .



 


3.

 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
     POLICIES



 



 The following is a summary
     of significant accounting policies followed consistently by the Segment in
     preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally
     accepted accounting principles.



 



 A.   
      Investment Valuation



 



 Investments in MML Equity
     Fund, MML Money Market Fund, MML Managed Bond Fund and MML Blend Fund are
     each stated at market value which is the net asset value of each of the
     respective funds.



 



 B.   
      Accounting For Investments



 



 Investment transactions
     are accounted for on trade date and identified cost is the basis followed
     in determining the cost of investments sold for financial statement
     purposes. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.



 



 C.   
      Federal Income Taxes



 



 Operations of the Segment
     form a part of the total operations of MassMutual, and the Segment is not
     taxed separately. MassMutual is taxed as a life insurance company under
     the provisions of the 1986 Internal Revenue Code, as amended. The Segment
     will not be taxed as a regulated investment company under
     Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. Under existing federal law, no
     taxes are payable on investment income and realized capital gains
     attributable to contracts which depend on the Segments investment
     performance. Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax has been
     made. MassMutual may, however, make such a charge in the future if an
     unanticipated change of current law results in a company tax liability
     attributable to the Segment.



Notes To Financial Statements
   (Continued)
 
 



  D.   
      Annuitant Mortality Fluctuation Reserve



 



 The Segment maintains a
     reserve as required by regulatory authorities to provide for mortality
     losses incurred. The reserve is increased quarterly for mortality gains
     and its proportionate share of any increases in value. The reserve is
     charged quarterly for mortality losses and its proportionate share of any
     decreases in value. Transfers to or from MassMutual are then made
     quarterly to adjust the Segments. Net transfers from the Segments to
     MassMutual totaled $52,683 for the year ended December 31, 1999. The
     reserve is subject to a maximum of 3% of the Segments annuity
     reserves. Any mortality losses in excess of this reserve will be assumed
     by MassMutual. The reserve is not available to owners of contracts except
     to the extent necessary to cover mortality losses under the
     contracts.



 



 E.   
      Annuity Reserves



 



 Annuity reserves are
     developed by using accepted actuarial methods and are computed using the
     1971 Individual Annuity Mortality Table, as modified.



 



 F.   
      Estimates



 



 The preparation of
     financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
     principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
     affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
     contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
     and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
     period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



 


4.

 CHARGES FOR MORTALITY AND EXPENSE
     RISKS



 



 A.   
      Variable Annuity Fund 4 Contracts



 



 Currently, daily charges
     for mortality and expense risks assumed by MassMutual are made which are
     equivalent on an annual basis to 0.73% of the value of the Variable
     Annuity Fund 4 Contracts. Effective on January 1 of any year after the
     first Contract year, the daily charge made for the assumption of mortality
     and expense risks will be as determined by MassMutual, but in no event
     will such charge be at an annual rate of more than 1.2045% of the value of
     the Variable Annuity Fund 4 Contracts.



 



 B.   
      Flex-Annuity IV (Qualified) Contracts



 



 Daily charges for
     mortality and expense risks assumed by MassMutual are made which are
     equivalent on an annual basis to 1.25% of the value of the Flex-Annuity IV
     Contracts.



 


5.

 DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT



 



 MML Investors Services,
     Inc. (MMLISI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MassMutual, serves
     as the principal underwriter for the contracts. MMLISI is registered as a
     broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of
     the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. The contracts are no
     longer offered for sale to the public. However, contract owners may
     continue to make purchase payments under existing contracts.



 



 Pursuant to the
     underwriting and servicing agreements, commissions or other fees due to
     registered representatives for selling and servicing the contracts are
     paid by MassMutual on behalf of MMLISI. MMLISI also receives compensation
     for its activities as underwriter of the contracts.

 Independent Auditors Report
 
The Board of Directors and Policyowners of
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance
    Company
 
We have audited the accompanying statement of Assets and Liabilities
    of each of the divisions of the Variable Annuity Fund 4 and Flex Annuity IV
    (Qualified) Segments of Massachusetts Mutual Variable Annuity Separate
    Account I (the Account), as of December 31, 1999, and the
    related statements of Operations and of Changes in Net Assets for the year
    then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Account
    s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements based on our audit. The Financial Statements of the
    account for the year ended December 31, 1998, were audited by other
    auditors, whose report, dated February 25, 1999, expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those statements.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted
    auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
    audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
    are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of
    December 31, 1999 by correspondence with the investment company. An audit
    also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
    estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of the Account at December 31,
    1999, and the results of its operations and its changes in net assets for
    the year then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
    principles.

Answer a few questions to get started


















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.
	
	
	       
					
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.




Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and, in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Have Us Call You








Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.
