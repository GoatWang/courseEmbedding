Early years (1997-2000)[edit]




An Allegiant Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83 at McCarran International Airport


Allegiant Air was founded in January 1997 by Mitch Allee (owner, CEO), Jim Patterson (president) and Dave Beadle (chief pilot), under the name WestJet Express.[1] After losing a trademark dispute with West Jet Air Center of Rapid City, South Dakota and recognizing the name's similarity to WestJet Airlines of Canada, the airline adopted the name Allegiant Air and received FAA and DOT certification for scheduled and charter domestic operations on June 19, 1998. The airline also has authority for charter service to Canada and Mexico.
Scheduled service began on October 15, 1998, between Las Vegas and the airline's original hub in Fresno, California, at the Fresno Yosemite International Airport, with Douglas DC-9-21 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-51 jetliners. During the second half of 1999, the airline was operating nonstop flights between Fresno and Las Vegas, Burbank and Lake Tahoe, and Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe as well as flying one-stop direct service between Fresno and Lake Tahoe via Las Vegas.[9] Shortly after WinAir Airlines closed in 1999, Allegiant Air opened a small hub in Long Beach, CA (LGB) and in 2000 was operating nonstop flights to Fresno and Las Vegas in addition to Fresno-Las Vegas nonstop service.[10] Later in 2000, Allegiant continued to expand and was operating the only nonstop jet service between Lake Tahoe Airport from Long Beach in addition to operating new flights into Portland, Oregon and Reno with Portland-Reno and Reno-Fresno nonstops and direct one-stop service between Portland and Fresno via Reno.[11] However, Allegiant was unable to bring in enough revenue to cover its costs and on December 13, 2000, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Restructuring (2001-02)[edit]
The bankruptcy allowed Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., one of the airline's major creditors, to gain control of the business. A veteran leader of low-cost airlines, Gallagher had worked with WestAir and as CEO of ValuJet Airlines; his tenure included the Flight 592 tragedy. In June 2001, Gallagher restructured Allegiant to a low-cost model, focusing on smaller markets that larger airlines did not serve with mainline aircraft. Now chief executive officer and chairman, he moved the headquarters and operations to Las Vegas.
In March 2002, Allegiant exited bankruptcy and entered into a long-term contract with Harrah's to provide charter services to its casinos in Laughlin and Reno, Nevada. At the same time, the airline acquired its first McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliner. From 2002 through 2004, the airline developed its scheduled-service business model. By 2004, Allegiant was flying from 13 small cities to Las Vegas offering bundled air and hotel packages.
Expansion (2006-08)[edit]
In November 2006, Allegiant filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in anticipation of a planned initial public offering of its Common Stock. It is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ALGT".
On October 25, 2007, the airline opened a fourth focus city and operations base at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport in Mesa, Arizona, connecting 13 cities already served by Allegiant and one new city to the Phoenix metropolitan area.[12] The airport announced a 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) expansion in August 2008, which increased the number of gates from two to four and allowed Allegiant to triple the number of flights from Phoenix. The expansion was funded by a loan from Allegiant which will be repaid by passenger fees.[13]
On November 14, 2007, Allegiant opened its fifth focus city and operations base at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, connecting other Allegiant cities to South Florida.
In January 2008, Allegiant opened its sixth base at Washington's Bellingham International Airport. The airline bases two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft in Bellingham as part of the expansion.[14] Routes served exclusively from Bellingham include Las Vegas, Palm Springs, San Diego, San Francisco and Phoenix. Expansion in Bellingham has been largely driven by its proximity to Vancouver, British Columbia.
2010s[edit]
On July 1, 2010 Allegiant returned to Long Beach Airport (LGB) in Long Beach, California having previously served LGB with DC-9 jets with nonstop flights to Las Vegas (LAS) and Lake Tahoe (TVL) in 2000.[15][16] The airline also intended to fly from Bellingham International Airport and Stockton several times a week; however, there is no service at present flown between these two cities although Allegiant continues to serve Stockton with flights to Las Vegas, Phoenix/Mesa and San Diego.[17]
In February 2010, Allegiant opened its ninth base at Grand Rapids' Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Michigan. The airline based two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft in Grand Rapids, but ended their airport's status as a hub in 2011. The airline continues to fly out of Grand Rapids in a reduced capacity.[18]
In March 2010, Allegiant purchased six used Boeing 757-200 jetliners as part of plans to begin flights to Hawaii, with deliveries from early 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011.[19] It gained the approval for type with the FAA in July 2011,[20] and then worked with the FAA to obtain the appropriate ETOPS rating in order to be able to serve Hawaii. Allegiant currently operates nonstop Boeing 757 service to Honolulu from Las Vegas.[21]
In November 2011, Allegiant closed its Long Beach facility and consolidated all Los Angeles area flights at Los Angeles International (LAX).
In 2014, Cincinnati became Allegiant's largest O&D (Origination & Destination) city, with over 11 destinations and 40 weekly departures. This has grown to 17 destinations and 63 weekly flights as of summer 2017.
In summer 2015, a rash of midair breakdowns drew federal scrutiny. "Before the night was finished on June 25, 2015, five Allegiant flights had been interrupted in four hours, all because different planes had failed in midair," reported the Tampa Bay Times.[22] Since October 2015, the Federal Aviation Authority has kept Allegiant under close supervision.[23][24][25] In July 2015, Allegiant Air announced bases would be established at Asheville Regional Airport and Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, becoming the first base at a non-vacation destination.[citation needed]
Corporate affairs[edit]

Business model[edit]




An Allegiant Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83 in old livery


Allegiant aims primarily to serve leisure travelers, particularly those in colder northern climates, going to warm-weather tourist destinations such as Punta Gorda, Tampa Bay, Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles and Phoenix.[26] It also serves smaller destinations that see few direct flights by major carriers. Many of the airline's markets, such as Peoria, Illinois, are served only by commuter service requiring a connection at an airline hub.[27] In October 2009, Allegiant had competition on just five of its 136 routes.[28]
Although it does not fly to Canada, Allegiant advertises extensively there and flies from about a dozen small airports near the Canada–US border. Many of its customers at airports such as Bellingham, Washington (BLI), Niagara Falls, New York (IAG), Ogdensburg, New York (OGS), Grand Forks, North Dakota (GFK) and Plattsburgh, New York (PBG) are Canadians, who can save money by flying from U.S. airports.[29]
To keep ticket prices relatively low, Allegiant offers a lower frequency of flights and no amenities such as frequent flier points or on-board entertainment.[27][30]
It prefers to use smaller/secondary airports where landing fees cost less, such as Orlando Sanford International Airport. At Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, Allegiant is now the only carrier. However, since 2015, Allegiant has been growing at major airports, such as Cincinnati, Memphis, Raleigh/Durham, Indianapolis, and San Antonio.
Allegiant already flies into many major airports, including McCarran International (Las Vegas) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. In June 2013, Allegiant deviated from this strategy with plans to compete with Southwest Airlines by offering direct flights between Las Vegas and Austin, a medium hub served by 10 carriers with non-stop routes to over 40 destinations. The airline also flies less frequently compared to the major airlines, operating routes two or three times per week. That requires fewer crews and allows less time-pressured aircraft maintenance.
In February 2011, Allegiant proposed to sell two types of tickets to passengers: advance tickets at a fixed higher rate and time-of-departure tickets that cost less but may have fees added based on the price of aviation fuel.[31] In 2012, the U.S. Department of Transportation banned the practice as part of wider regulations that also require taxes and fees to be included in airfares. Allegiant, along with Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines, sued the DOT to overturn these new rules. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the DOT on 24 July 2012[32] and the US Supreme Court denied certiorari on 1 April 2013.[33]
Ancillary revenue[edit]
Like Ryanair, the low-cost airline founded by the Ryan family of Ireland, who also have invested in Allegiant, the airline seeks ancillary revenue to supplement ticket revenue.[34] These ancillary fees include those for checking luggage, carrying on luggage (other than a small personal item), buying food and drinks on board, obtaining advance seat assignments, paying by credit card, and more.[27][35][36] Allegiant CEO Maurice Gallagher said in 2009, "We collect $110 from you at the end of your trip. If I tried to charge you $110 up front, you wouldn't pay it. But if I sell you a $75 ticket and you self-select the rest, you will."[37]
Allegiant also earns commissions by offering hotel rooms, car rentals and admission to tourist attractions on its website. It sells package vacations under the brand name Allegiant Vacations. The company has arrangements with 34 hotels in Las Vegas and 21 in the Orlando and Daytona Beach, Florida, areas. In 2008, the airline sold 400,000 hotel room nights.[37] Commissions on hotel and rental car packages are up to one-third of the airline's revenue.[35][37]
In 2009, ancillary revenues were $33.35 per passenger.[38]
Charter flights[edit]
Allegiant's air charter operation contributed 7% of its revenue in 2009.[39]
In March 2011, Allegiant took over charter service to Wendover Airport for Peppermill Casinos, Inc. to shuttle customers to Peppermill's three casinos in West Wendover, Nevada; the Montego Bay Resort, the Rainbow Wendover and the Peppermill Wendover.[40] Allegiant based one 150-seat, MD-80 series jet aircraft in Wendover and more than 20 employees, including maintenance, flight crews and stations personnel.[41]
Allegiant also transports firefighters for the United States Forest Service as well as college basketball teams.[39]

Allegiant had a contract to supply charter flights from Miami to four cities in Cuba beginning June 2009. One aircraft was committed to the contract.[39] The contract was for fixed-fee flying, meaning all the airline was required to do was provide the dry aircraft and the flight crew. The contractor was responsible for all other costs including fuel. However, Allegiant ended this service in August 2009.[42]
The company had charter contracts with Caesars Entertainment to ferry customers to Caesars casino properties through Reno-Tahoe International Airport, Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport and Tunica Municipal Airport.[43] These contracts ended in December 2012 when Caesars Entertainment signed a new contract with Republic Airways to provide the charter service to Caesars properties in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Tunica, Mississippi and Laughlin, Nevada.[44]
Costs[edit]
The airline tends to offer lower fares, which requires strict cost control.[27] Part of the airline's lower cost structure includes operation of McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets, which the airline can purchase and refurbish for as little as $4 million.[35] While the aircraft are less fuel-efficient than newer planes, Allegiant is able to purchase used MD-80s outright for one-tenth the cost of a new Boeing 737 although Allegiant has subsequently purchased used Boeing 757-200s, Airbus A319s and Airbus A320s.[34] (the 757s were acquired for its Hawaii service while the Airbus jets are beginning to replace MD-80 aircraft). Given the low cost of ownership, Allegiant is able to operate its aircraft less (seven flight hours per day on average versus 13 hours per day at JetBlue Airways), which helps keep labor costs lower.[34] Overall, Allegiant operates with 35 full-time workers per plane compared to more than 50 at other carriers. Allegiant schedules their crew members so that they always return to their domicile at the end of the day, thus avoiding the need for hotel rooms which can be a costly expense for airlines.[35]
The airline seeks to maintain a low permanent operating cost at the airport.[45] Allegiant rents ticket counters on an hourly basis and in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Springfield, Missouri, many duties are handled by airport employees contracted to Allegiant.[34][46]
Allegiant maintains control over pricing by offering flights exclusively through its website, which also sells these ancillary products. It has no toll-free phone number and does not use Internet travel agencies.[27]
Criticism of the business model[edit]
The airport director in Worcester, Massachusetts, felt that Allegiant reneged on a commitment to serve the airport for five years given the use of federal grants to assist its startup. However, the airline responded that the market was immediately unprofitable and starting service there was a poor decision; flights were reported to be 80% full.[45] Allegiant's flights average 90% full.[37]
The United States Department of Transportation cited the airline in 2009 for not including the "convenience fee" in the initial price quote on the website.[28]
Criticism of workers' right to organize[edit]
Flight attendants at the carrier voted to organize their workgroup under the Transport Workers Union of America in December 2010, citing scheduling concerns among other issues in their work rules and the airline's pilots elected to vote on whether to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in July 2012.[47] In August 2012, the pilots voted to organize and joined the Teamsters.[48] Allegiant's chairman and CEO, Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., has been critical of the unionization of airline employees and has stated that "Unionization is one of those things that clogs the arteries and makes you less quick and not as nimble as you need to be on top of your game... In this industry and others that are heavily unionized, you ultimately end up with bankruptcy as the primary driver" [47]
Safety concerns[edit]
Allegiant Air has been closely monitored by the FAA due to many emergency landings and aborted takeoffs.[49] ABC interviewed a former Allegiant mechanic, who said "Dedicated steps were not being performed with maintenance manuals or even with general practices, before an aircraft is released.".[50] Many of these incidents have involved Allegiant's MD80 aircraft, which are expected to be replaced by Airbus A320 family aircraft. 46 of the 86 aircraft have made emergency landings, all of which were on MD-80's. [51] In March 2016 an Allegiant Air Airbus A320 was forced to make an emergency landing at Jacksonville.[52]
In May 2016, the FAA confirmed that Allegiant was under investigation.[53] On August 17, 2016, Allegiant Flight 436 aborted its take-off from McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada due to an uncommanded early rotation at about 120 knots (220 km/h) indicated airspeed. An investigation by the FAA found that maintenance procedures had not been followed by Allegiant's maintenance provider, AAR Air Services Inc. This resulted in a nut becoming detached from an elevator boost cylinder. The aircraft had made 216 flights in an unairworthy condition. The FAA investigation revealed two similar occurrences. The FAA intend to prosecute over each offence.[54] The result of the 2016 FAA audit was to give the airline a clean bill of health.
A November 2016 analysis by the Tampa Bay Times noted that Allegiant's planes were four times more likely to have in flight failures than other major US airlines.[55]
Destinations[edit]
Main article: Allegiant Air destinations
As of March 2017, Allegiant offers service to 177 destinations throughout the United States, mostly to smaller non-hub regional airports and all usually only a few times each week. It chooses its routes after calculating expected costs and revenue and adds or ends service to particular destinations as demand warrants.

Fleet development[edit]
Allegiant Air is the only US-based carrier to have operated all five subtypes of the MD-80 series. On January 4, 2010, the SAS Group sold 18 surplus MD-80 series aircraft, built in the 1980s, to Allegiant Travel Company.[77]
In March 2010, Allegiant purchased six Boeing 757-200 aircraft from Thomson Airways for flights to Hawaii with the delivery of the first two in the following months. In September 2011, Allegiant Air introduced the 757 into service from their main hub in Las Vegas. Allegiant later began using the ETOPS configured 757s for service to Hawaii.[78] Fresno and Las Vegas were the inaugural destinations with nonstop service to Honolulu, Hawaii. Nonstop service to Honolulu was then added from Bellingham, Boise, Eugene, Phoenix (via Mesa Gateway Airport), Santa Maria, Spokane and Stockton.[79] Nonstop service to Hawaii was also planned from Monterey, CA but was not actually operated. Allegiant then began to reduce its Hawaii service and currently only operates Las Vegas-Honolulu nonstops with all Honolulu service scheduled to end in November 2017 due to Allegiant determining that the extensive and costly maintenance check that happens about every 6 years and costs upwards of $1,000,000USD would not be efficient. [80]
In September 2010, Allegiant began to reconfigure their MD-80 fleet from 150 seats to 166 seats per plane. The project would involve removing galleys from the planes to add the 16 additional seats. All of the MD-80 conversions were completed by the end of September 2013.[81][82]
In July 2012, Allegiant announced the future addition of the Airbus A319-100 aircraft to its fleet. The aircraft are used and formerly belonged to easyJet and Cebu Pacific. Two former easyJet aircraft entered service in 2013, with another in 2014 and 6 in 2015.[83] In December 2012, Allegiant cancelled the agreement with Cebu Pacific citing an inability to agree on economic provisions.[84] On May 1, 2013, Allegiant purchased another A319 aircraft previously operated by easyJet and would enter service in the third quarter of 2013.[85] On February 23, 2015, Allegiant purchased 6 more A319s from Cebu Pacific which will be delivered starting this year until 2016.[86]
In 2013, Allegiant acquired 9 Airbus A320-200 aircraft from Spanish flag carrier Iberia.[87][88] Seven of the A320s were delivered in 2013 and were used for growth into new markets, including destinations in Mexico, the Rocky Mountains as well as airfields such as Charlottesville and Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and Trenton, New Jersey.[84] On February 24, 2015, Allegiant announced the purchase of 2 additional A320s from Philippine Airlines which will enter into service by 2015.[89] Later in 2015 the airline announced a firm order for an Airbus A320 direct from Airbus, the first time it has directly purchased new aircraft from the supplier.[90]
In May of 2017, Allegiant Air took delivery of its first brand new A320. Allegiant will take delivery of 10 new A320s in 2017 and 2 in 2018. All Allegiant Airbuses will be repainted in Allegiant's new livery. Old Aircraft will be retired with Allegiant old liveries. All new Airbuses will have sharklets and painted in Allegaint's new livery.
Livery[edit]
Allegiant Air's livery features a bright sunburst design on the tail, emphasizing the airline's "sun" destinations. The livery has a bold, contemporary look that was created for the airline by Tiami Designs, Atlanta, Georgia.[91]

History[edit]
Early years (1997-2000)[edit]




An Allegiant Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83 at McCarran International Airport


Allegiant Air was founded in January 1997 by Mitch Allee (owner, CEO), Jim Patterson (president) and Dave Beadle (chief pilot), under the name WestJet Express.[1] After losing a trademark dispute with West Jet Air Center of Rapid City, South Dakota and recognizing the name's similarity to WestJet Airlines of Canada, the airline adopted the name Allegiant Air and received FAA and DOT certification for scheduled and charter domestic operations on June 19, 1998. The airline also has authority for charter service to Canada and Mexico.
Scheduled service began on October 15, 1998, between Las Vegas and the airline's original hub in Fresno, California, at the Fresno Yosemite International Airport, with Douglas DC-9-21 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-51 jetliners. During the second half of 1999, the airline was operating nonstop flights between Fresno and Las Vegas, Burbank and Lake Tahoe, and Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe as well as flying one-stop direct service between Fresno and Lake Tahoe via Las Vegas.[9] Shortly after WinAir Airlines closed in 1999, Allegiant Air opened a small hub in Long Beach, CA (LGB) and in 2000 was operating nonstop flights to Fresno and Las Vegas in addition to Fresno-Las Vegas nonstop service.[10] Later in 2000, Allegiant continued to expand and was operating the only nonstop jet service between Lake Tahoe Airport from Long Beach in addition to operating new flights into Portland, Oregon and Reno with Portland-Reno and Reno-Fresno nonstops and direct one-stop service between Portland and Fresno via Reno.[11] However, Allegiant was unable to bring in enough revenue to cover its costs and on December 13, 2000, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Restructuring (2001-02)[edit]
The bankruptcy allowed Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., one of the airline's major creditors, to gain control of the business. A veteran leader of low-cost airlines, Gallagher had worked with WestAir and as CEO of ValuJet Airlines; his tenure included the Flight 592 tragedy. In June 2001, Gallagher restructured Allegiant to a low-cost model, focusing on smaller markets that larger airlines did not serve with mainline aircraft. Now chief executive officer and chairman, he moved the headquarters and operations to Las Vegas.
In March 2002, Allegiant exited bankruptcy and entered into a long-term contract with Harrah's to provide charter services to its casinos in Laughlin and Reno, Nevada. At the same time, the airline acquired its first McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliner. From 2002 through 2004, the airline developed its scheduled-service business model. By 2004, Allegiant was flying from 13 small cities to Las Vegas offering bundled air and hotel packages.
Expansion (2006-08)[edit]
In November 2006, Allegiant filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in anticipation of a planned initial public offering of its Common Stock. It is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ALGT".
On October 25, 2007, the airline opened a fourth focus city and operations base at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport in Mesa, Arizona, connecting 13 cities already served by Allegiant and one new city to the Phoenix metropolitan area.[12] The airport announced a 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) expansion in August 2008, which increased the number of gates from two to four and allowed Allegiant to triple the number of flights from Phoenix. The expansion was funded by a loan from Allegiant which will be repaid by passenger fees.[13]
On November 14, 2007, Allegiant opened its fifth focus city and operations base at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, connecting other Allegiant cities to South Florida.
In January 2008, Allegiant opened its sixth base at Washington's Bellingham International Airport. The airline bases two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft in Bellingham as part of the expansion.[14] Routes served exclusively from Bellingham include Las Vegas, Palm Springs, San Diego, San Francisco and Phoenix. Expansion in Bellingham has been largely driven by its proximity to Vancouver, British Columbia.
2010s[edit]
On July 1, 2010 Allegiant returned to Long Beach Airport (LGB) in Long Beach, California having previously served LGB with DC-9 jets with nonstop flights to Las Vegas (LAS) and Lake Tahoe (TVL) in 2000.[15][16] The airline also intended to fly from Bellingham International Airport and Stockton several times a week; however, there is no service at present flown between these two cities although Allegiant continues to serve Stockton with flights to Las Vegas, Phoenix/Mesa and San Diego.[17]
In February 2010, Allegiant opened its ninth base at Grand Rapids' Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Michigan. The airline based two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft in Grand Rapids, but ended their airport's status as a hub in 2011. The airline continues to fly out of Grand Rapids in a reduced capacity.[18]
In March 2010, Allegiant purchased six used Boeing 757-200 jetliners as part of plans to begin flights to Hawaii, with deliveries from early 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011.[19] It gained the approval for type with the FAA in July 2011,[20] and then worked with the FAA to obtain the appropriate ETOPS rating in order to be able to serve Hawaii. Allegiant currently operates nonstop Boeing 757 service to Honolulu from Las Vegas.[21]
In November 2011, Allegiant closed its Long Beach facility and consolidated all Los Angeles area flights at Los Angeles International (LAX).
In 2014, Cincinnati became Allegiant's largest O&D (Origination & Destination) city, with over 11 destinations and 40 weekly departures. This has grown to 17 destinations and 63 weekly flights as of summer 2017.
In summer 2015, a rash of midair breakdowns drew federal scrutiny. "Before the night was finished on June 25, 2015, five Allegiant flights had been interrupted in four hours, all because different planes had failed in midair," reported the Tampa Bay Times.[22] Since October 2015, the Federal Aviation Authority has kept Allegiant under close supervision.[23][24][25] In July 2015, Allegiant Air announced bases would be established at Asheville Regional Airport and Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, becoming the first base at a non-vacation destination.[citation needed]
Corporate affairs[edit]

Headquarters[edit]

Business model[edit]




An Allegiant Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83 in old livery


Allegiant aims primarily to serve leisure travelers, particularly those in colder northern climates, going to warm-weather tourist destinations such as Punta Gorda, Tampa Bay, Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles and Phoenix.[26] It also serves smaller destinations that see few direct flights by major carriers. Many of the airline's markets, such as Peoria, Illinois, are served only by commuter service requiring a connection at an airline hub.[27] In October 2009, Allegiant had competition on just five of its 136 routes.[28]
Although it does not fly to Canada, Allegiant advertises extensively there and flies from about a dozen small airports near the Canada–US border. Many of its customers at airports such as Bellingham, Washington (BLI), Niagara Falls, New York (IAG), Ogdensburg, New York (OGS), Grand Forks, North Dakota (GFK) and Plattsburgh, New York (PBG) are Canadians, who can save money by flying from U.S. airports.[29]
To keep ticket prices relatively low, Allegiant offers a lower frequency of flights and no amenities such as frequent flier points or on-board entertainment.[27][30]
It prefers to use smaller/secondary airports where landing fees cost less, such as Orlando Sanford International Airport. At Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, Allegiant is now the only carrier. However, since 2015, Allegiant has been growing at major airports, such as Cincinnati, Memphis, Raleigh/Durham, Indianapolis, and San Antonio.
Allegiant already flies into many major airports, including McCarran International (Las Vegas) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. In June 2013, Allegiant deviated from this strategy with plans to compete with Southwest Airlines by offering direct flights between Las Vegas and Austin, a medium hub served by 10 carriers with non-stop routes to over 40 destinations. The airline also flies less frequently compared to the major airlines, operating routes two or three times per week. That requires fewer crews and allows less time-pressured aircraft maintenance.
In February 2011, Allegiant proposed to sell two types of tickets to passengers: advance tickets at a fixed higher rate and time-of-departure tickets that cost less but may have fees added based on the price of aviation fuel.[31] In 2012, the U.S. Department of Transportation banned the practice as part of wider regulations that also require taxes and fees to be included in airfares. Allegiant, along with Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines, sued the DOT to overturn these new rules. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the DOT on 24 July 2012[32] and the US Supreme Court denied certiorari on 1 April 2013.[33]
Ancillary revenue[edit]
Like Ryanair, the low-cost airline founded by the Ryan family of Ireland, who also have invested in Allegiant, the airline seeks ancillary revenue to supplement ticket revenue.[34] These ancillary fees include those for checking luggage, carrying on luggage (other than a small personal item), buying food and drinks on board, obtaining advance seat assignments, paying by credit card, and more.[27][35][36] Allegiant CEO Maurice Gallagher said in 2009, "We collect $110 from you at the end of your trip. If I tried to charge you $110 up front, you wouldn't pay it. But if I sell you a $75 ticket and you self-select the rest, you will."[37]
Allegiant also earns commissions by offering hotel rooms, car rentals and admission to tourist attractions on its website. It sells package vacations under the brand name Allegiant Vacations. The company has arrangements with 34 hotels in Las Vegas and 21 in the Orlando and Daytona Beach, Florida, areas. In 2008, the airline sold 400,000 hotel room nights.[37] Commissions on hotel and rental car packages are up to one-third of the airline's revenue.[35][37]
In 2009, ancillary revenues were $33.35 per passenger.[38]
Charter flights[edit]
Allegiant's air charter operation contributed 7% of its revenue in 2009.[39]
In March 2011, Allegiant took over charter service to Wendover Airport for Peppermill Casinos, Inc. to shuttle customers to Peppermill's three casinos in West Wendover, Nevada; the Montego Bay Resort, the Rainbow Wendover and the Peppermill Wendover.[40] Allegiant based one 150-seat, MD-80 series jet aircraft in Wendover and more than 20 employees, including maintenance, flight crews and stations personnel.[41]
Allegiant also transports firefighters for the United States Forest Service as well as college basketball teams.[39]




An Allegiant Air Boeing 757–200 at McCarran International Airport


Allegiant had a contract to supply charter flights from Miami to four cities in Cuba beginning June 2009. One aircraft was committed to the contract.[39] The contract was for fixed-fee flying, meaning all the airline was required to do was provide the dry aircraft and the flight crew. The contractor was responsible for all other costs including fuel. However, Allegiant ended this service in August 2009.[42]
The company had charter contracts with Caesars Entertainment to ferry customers to Caesars casino properties through Reno-Tahoe International Airport, Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport and Tunica Municipal Airport.[43] These contracts ended in December 2012 when Caesars Entertainment signed a new contract with Republic Airways to provide the charter service to Caesars properties in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Tunica, Mississippi and Laughlin, Nevada.[44]
Costs[edit]
The airline tends to offer lower fares, which requires strict cost control.[27] Part of the airline's lower cost structure includes operation of McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets, which the airline can purchase and refurbish for as little as $4 million.[35] While the aircraft are less fuel-efficient than newer planes, Allegiant is able to purchase used MD-80s outright for one-tenth the cost of a new Boeing 737 although Allegiant has subsequently purchased used Boeing 757-200s, Airbus A319s and Airbus A320s.[34] (the 757s were acquired for its Hawaii service while the Airbus jets are beginning to replace MD-80 aircraft). Given the low cost of ownership, Allegiant is able to operate its aircraft less (seven flight hours per day on average versus 13 hours per day at JetBlue Airways), which helps keep labor costs lower.[34] Overall, Allegiant operates with 35 full-time workers per plane compared to more than 50 at other carriers. Allegiant schedules their crew members so that they always return to their domicile at the end of the day, thus avoiding the need for hotel rooms which can be a costly expense for airlines.[35]
The airline seeks to maintain a low permanent operating cost at the airport.[45] Allegiant rents ticket counters on an hourly basis and in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Springfield, Missouri, many duties are handled by airport employees contracted to Allegiant.[34][46]
Allegiant maintains control over pricing by offering flights exclusively through its website, which also sells these ancillary products. It has no toll-free phone number and does not use Internet travel agencies.[27]
Criticism of the business model[edit]
The airport director in Worcester, Massachusetts, felt that Allegiant reneged on a commitment to serve the airport for five years given the use of federal grants to assist its startup. However, the airline responded that the market was immediately unprofitable and starting service there was a poor decision; flights were reported to be 80% full.[45] Allegiant's flights average 90% full.[37]
The United States Department of Transportation cited the airline in 2009 for not including the "convenience fee" in the initial price quote on the website.[28]
Criticism of workers' right to organize[edit]
Flight attendants at the carrier voted to organize their workgroup under the Transport Workers Union of America in December 2010, citing scheduling concerns among other issues in their work rules and the airline's pilots elected to vote on whether to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in July 2012.[47] In August 2012, the pilots voted to organize and joined the Teamsters.[48] Allegiant's chairman and CEO, Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., has been critical of the unionization of airline employees and has stated that "Unionization is one of those things that clogs the arteries and makes you less quick and not as nimble as you need to be on top of your game... In this industry and others that are heavily unionized, you ultimately end up with bankruptcy as the primary driver" [47]
Safety concerns[edit]
Allegiant Air has been closely monitored by the FAA due to many emergency landings and aborted takeoffs.[49] ABC interviewed a former Allegiant mechanic, who said "Dedicated steps were not being performed with maintenance manuals or even with general practices, before an aircraft is released.".[50] Many of these incidents have involved Allegiant's MD80 aircraft, which are expected to be replaced by Airbus A320 family aircraft. 46 of the 86 aircraft have made emergency landings, all of which were on MD-80's. [51] In March 2016 an Allegiant Air Airbus A320 was forced to make an emergency landing at Jacksonville.[52]
In May 2016, the FAA confirmed that Allegiant was under investigation.[53] On August 17, 2016, Allegiant Flight 436 aborted its take-off from McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada due to an uncommanded early rotation at about 120 knots (220 km/h) indicated airspeed. An investigation by the FAA found that maintenance procedures had not been followed by Allegiant's maintenance provider, AAR Air Services Inc. This resulted in a nut becoming detached from an elevator boost cylinder. The aircraft had made 216 flights in an unairworthy condition. The FAA investigation revealed two similar occurrences. The FAA intend to prosecute over each offence.[54] The result of the 2016 FAA audit was to give the airline a clean bill of health.
A November 2016 analysis by the Tampa Bay Times noted that Allegiant's planes were four times more likely to have in flight failures than other major US airlines.[55]
Destinations[edit]
Main article: Allegiant Air destinations
As of March 2017, Allegiant offers service to 177 destinations throughout the United States, mostly to smaller non-hub regional airports and all usually only a few times each week. It chooses its routes after calculating expected costs and revenue and adds or ends service to particular destinations as demand warrants.

Fleet development[edit]
Allegiant Air is the only US-based carrier to have operated all five subtypes of the MD-80 series. On January 4, 2010, the SAS Group sold 18 surplus MD-80 series aircraft, built in the 1980s, to Allegiant Travel Company.[77]
In March 2010, Allegiant purchased six Boeing 757-200 aircraft from Thomson Airways for flights to Hawaii with the delivery of the first two in the following months. In September 2011, Allegiant Air introduced the 757 into service from their main hub in Las Vegas. Allegiant later began using the ETOPS configured 757s for service to Hawaii.[78] Fresno and Las Vegas were the inaugural destinations with nonstop service to Honolulu, Hawaii. Nonstop service to Honolulu was then added from Bellingham, Boise, Eugene, Phoenix (via Mesa Gateway Airport), Santa Maria, Spokane and Stockton.[79] Nonstop service to Hawaii was also planned from Monterey, CA but was not actually operated. Allegiant then began to reduce its Hawaii service and currently only operates Las Vegas-Honolulu nonstops with all Honolulu service scheduled to end in November 2017 due to Allegiant determining that the extensive and costly maintenance check that happens about every 6 years and costs upwards of $1,000,000USD would not be efficient. [80]
In September 2010, Allegiant began to reconfigure their MD-80 fleet from 150 seats to 166 seats per plane. The project would involve removing galleys from the planes to add the 16 additional seats. All of the MD-80 conversions were completed by the end of September 2013.[81][82]
In July 2012, Allegiant announced the future addition of the Airbus A319-100 aircraft to its fleet. The aircraft are used and formerly belonged to easyJet and Cebu Pacific. Two former easyJet aircraft entered service in 2013, with another in 2014 and 6 in 2015.[83] In December 2012, Allegiant cancelled the agreement with Cebu Pacific citing an inability to agree on economic provisions.[84] On May 1, 2013, Allegiant purchased another A319 aircraft previously operated by easyJet and would enter service in the third quarter of 2013.[85] On February 23, 2015, Allegiant purchased 6 more A319s from Cebu Pacific which will be delivered starting this year until 2016.[86]
In 2013, Allegiant acquired 9 Airbus A320-200 aircraft from Spanish flag carrier Iberia.[87][88] Seven of the A320s were delivered in 2013 and were used for growth into new markets, including destinations in Mexico, the Rocky Mountains as well as airfields such as Charlottesville and Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and Trenton, New Jersey.[84] On February 24, 2015, Allegiant announced the purchase of 2 additional A320s from Philippine Airlines which will enter into service by 2015.[89] Later in 2015 the airline announced a firm order for an Airbus A320 direct from Airbus, the first time it has directly purchased new aircraft from the supplier.[90]
In May of 2017, Allegiant Air took delivery of its first brand new A320. Allegiant will take delivery of 10 new A320s in 2017 and 2 in 2018. All Allegiant Airbuses will be repainted in Allegiant's new livery. Old Aircraft will be retired with Allegiant old liveries. All new Airbuses will have sharklets and painted in Allegaint's new livery.
Livery[edit]
Allegiant Air's livery features a bright sunburst design on the tail, emphasizing the airline's "sun" destinations. The livery has a bold, contemporary look that was created for the airline by Tiami Designs, Atlanta, Georgia.[91]

History[edit]
Early years (1997-2000)[edit]




An Allegiant Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83 at McCarran International Airport


Allegiant Air was founded in January 1997 by Mitch Allee (owner, CEO), Jim Patterson (president) and Dave Beadle (chief pilot), under the name WestJet Express.[1] After losing a trademark dispute with West Jet Air Center of Rapid City, South Dakota and recognizing the name's similarity to WestJet Airlines of Canada, the airline adopted the name Allegiant Air and received FAA and DOT certification for scheduled and charter domestic operations on June 19, 1998. The airline also has authority for charter service to Canada and Mexico.
Scheduled service began on October 15, 1998, between Las Vegas and the airline's original hub in Fresno, California, at the Fresno Yosemite International Airport, with Douglas DC-9-21 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-51 jetliners. During the second half of 1999, the airline was operating nonstop flights between Fresno and Las Vegas, Burbank and Lake Tahoe, and Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe as well as flying one-stop direct service between Fresno and Lake Tahoe via Las Vegas.[9] Shortly after WinAir Airlines closed in 1999, Allegiant Air opened a small hub in Long Beach, CA (LGB) and in 2000 was operating nonstop flights to Fresno and Las Vegas in addition to Fresno-Las Vegas nonstop service.[10] Later in 2000, Allegiant continued to expand and was operating the only nonstop jet service between Lake Tahoe Airport from Long Beach in addition to operating new flights into Portland, Oregon and Reno with Portland-Reno and Reno-Fresno nonstops and direct one-stop service between Portland and Fresno via Reno.[11] However, Allegiant was unable to bring in enough revenue to cover its costs and on December 13, 2000, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Restructuring (2001-02)[edit]
The bankruptcy allowed Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., one of the airline's major creditors, to gain control of the business. A veteran leader of low-cost airlines, Gallagher had worked with WestAir and as CEO of ValuJet Airlines; his tenure included the Flight 592 tragedy. In June 2001, Gallagher restructured Allegiant to a low-cost model, focusing on smaller markets that larger airlines did not serve with mainline aircraft. Now chief executive officer and chairman, he moved the headquarters and operations to Las Vegas.
In March 2002, Allegiant exited bankruptcy and entered into a long-term contract with Harrah's to provide charter services to its casinos in Laughlin and Reno, Nevada. At the same time, the airline acquired its first McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliner. From 2002 through 2004, the airline developed its scheduled-service business model. By 2004, Allegiant was flying from 13 small cities to Las Vegas offering bundled air and hotel packages.
Expansion (2006-08)[edit]
In November 2006, Allegiant filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in anticipation of a planned initial public offering of its Common Stock. It is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ALGT".
On October 25, 2007, the airline opened a fourth focus city and operations base at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport in Mesa, Arizona, connecting 13 cities already served by Allegiant and one new city to the Phoenix metropolitan area.[12] The airport announced a 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) expansion in August 2008, which increased the number of gates from two to four and allowed Allegiant to triple the number of flights from Phoenix. The expansion was funded by a loan from Allegiant which will be repaid by passenger fees.[13]
On November 14, 2007, Allegiant opened its fifth focus city and operations base at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, connecting other Allegiant cities to South Florida.
In January 2008, Allegiant opened its sixth base at Washington's Bellingham International Airport. The airline bases two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft in Bellingham as part of the expansion.[14] Routes served exclusively from Bellingham include Las Vegas, Palm Springs, San Diego, San Francisco and Phoenix. Expansion in Bellingham has been largely driven by its proximity to Vancouver, British Columbia.
2010s[edit]
On July 1, 2010 Allegiant returned to Long Beach Airport (LGB) in Long Beach, California having previously served LGB with DC-9 jets with nonstop flights to Las Vegas (LAS) and Lake Tahoe (TVL) in 2000.[15][16] The airline also intended to fly from Bellingham International Airport and Stockton several times a week; however, there is no service at present flown between these two cities although Allegiant continues to serve Stockton with flights to Las Vegas, Phoenix/Mesa and San Diego.[17]
In February 2010, Allegiant opened its ninth base at Grand Rapids' Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Michigan. The airline based two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft in Grand Rapids, but ended their airport's status as a hub in 2011. The airline continues to fly out of Grand Rapids in a reduced capacity.[18]
In March 2010, Allegiant purchased six used Boeing 757-200 jetliners as part of plans to begin flights to Hawaii, with deliveries from early 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011.[19] It gained the approval for type with the FAA in July 2011,[20] and then worked with the FAA to obtain the appropriate ETOPS rating in order to be able to serve Hawaii. Allegiant currently operates nonstop Boeing 757 service to Honolulu from Las Vegas.[21]
In November 2011, Allegiant closed its Long Beach facility and consolidated all Los Angeles area flights at Los Angeles International (LAX).
In 2014, Cincinnati became Allegiant's largest O&D (Origination & Destination) city, with over 11 destinations and 40 weekly departures. This has grown to 17 destinations and 63 weekly flights as of summer 2017.
In summer 2015, a rash of midair breakdowns drew federal scrutiny. "Before the night was finished on June 25, 2015, five Allegiant flights had been interrupted in four hours, all because different planes had failed in midair," reported the Tampa Bay Times.[22] Since October 2015, the Federal Aviation Authority has kept Allegiant under close supervision.[23][24][25] In July 2015, Allegiant Air announced bases would be established at Asheville Regional Airport and Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, becoming the first base at a non-vacation destination.[citation needed]
Corporate affairs[edit]

Business model[edit]




An Allegiant Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83 in old livery


Allegiant aims primarily to serve leisure travelers, particularly those in colder northern climates, going to warm-weather tourist destinations such as Punta Gorda, Tampa Bay, Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles and Phoenix.[26] It also serves smaller destinations that see few direct flights by major carriers. Many of the airline's markets, such as Peoria, Illinois, are served only by commuter service requiring a connection at an airline hub.[27] In October 2009, Allegiant had competition on just five of its 136 routes.[28]
Although it does not fly to Canada, Allegiant advertises extensively there and flies from about a dozen small airports near the Canada–US border. Many of its customers at airports such as Bellingham, Washington (BLI), Niagara Falls, New York (IAG), Ogdensburg, New York (OGS), Grand Forks, North Dakota (GFK) and Plattsburgh, New York (PBG) are Canadians, who can save money by flying from U.S. airports.[29]
To keep ticket prices relatively low, Allegiant offers a lower frequency of flights and no amenities such as frequent flier points or on-board entertainment.[27][30]
It prefers to use smaller/secondary airports where landing fees cost less, such as Orlando Sanford International Airport. At Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, Allegiant is now the only carrier. However, since 2015, Allegiant has been growing at major airports, such as Cincinnati, Memphis, Raleigh/Durham, Indianapolis, and San Antonio.
Allegiant already flies into many major airports, including McCarran International (Las Vegas) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. In June 2013, Allegiant deviated from this strategy with plans to compete with Southwest Airlines by offering direct flights between Las Vegas and Austin, a medium hub served by 10 carriers with non-stop routes to over 40 destinations. The airline also flies less frequently compared to the major airlines, operating routes two or three times per week. That requires fewer crews and allows less time-pressured aircraft maintenance.
In February 2011, Allegiant proposed to sell two types of tickets to passengers: advance tickets at a fixed higher rate and time-of-departure tickets that cost less but may have fees added based on the price of aviation fuel.[31] In 2012, the U.S. Department of Transportation banned the practice as part of wider regulations that also require taxes and fees to be included in airfares. Allegiant, along with Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines, sued the DOT to overturn these new rules. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the DOT on 24 July 2012[32] and the US Supreme Court denied certiorari on 1 April 2013.[33]
Ancillary revenue[edit]
Like Ryanair, the low-cost airline founded by the Ryan family of Ireland, who also have invested in Allegiant, the airline seeks ancillary revenue to supplement ticket revenue.[34] These ancillary fees include those for checking luggage, carrying on luggage (other than a small personal item), buying food and drinks on board, obtaining advance seat assignments, paying by credit card, and more.[27][35][36] Allegiant CEO Maurice Gallagher said in 2009, "We collect $110 from you at the end of your trip. If I tried to charge you $110 up front, you wouldn't pay it. But if I sell you a $75 ticket and you self-select the rest, you will."[37]
Allegiant also earns commissions by offering hotel rooms, car rentals and admission to tourist attractions on its website. It sells package vacations under the brand name Allegiant Vacations. The company has arrangements with 34 hotels in Las Vegas and 21 in the Orlando and Daytona Beach, Florida, areas. In 2008, the airline sold 400,000 hotel room nights.[37] Commissions on hotel and rental car packages are up to one-third of the airline's revenue.[35][37]
In 2009, ancillary revenues were $33.35 per passenger.[38]
Charter flights[edit]
Allegiant's air charter operation contributed 7% of its revenue in 2009.[39]
In March 2011, Allegiant took over charter service to Wendover Airport for Peppermill Casinos, Inc. to shuttle customers to Peppermill's three casinos in West Wendover, Nevada; the Montego Bay Resort, the Rainbow Wendover and the Peppermill Wendover.[40] Allegiant based one 150-seat, MD-80 series jet aircraft in Wendover and more than 20 employees, including maintenance, flight crews and stations personnel.[41]
Allegiant also transports firefighters for the United States Forest Service as well as college basketball teams.[39]

Allegiant had a contract to supply charter flights from Miami to four cities in Cuba beginning June 2009. One aircraft was committed to the contract.[39] The contract was for fixed-fee flying, meaning all the airline was required to do was provide the dry aircraft and the flight crew. The contractor was responsible for all other costs including fuel. However, Allegiant ended this service in August 2009.[42]
The company had charter contracts with Caesars Entertainment to ferry customers to Caesars casino properties through Reno-Tahoe International Airport, Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport and Tunica Municipal Airport.[43] These contracts ended in December 2012 when Caesars Entertainment signed a new contract with Republic Airways to provide the charter service to Caesars properties in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Tunica, Mississippi and Laughlin, Nevada.[44]
Costs[edit]
The airline tends to offer lower fares, which requires strict cost control.[27] Part of the airline's lower cost structure includes operation of McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets, which the airline can purchase and refurbish for as little as $4 million.[35] While the aircraft are less fuel-efficient than newer planes, Allegiant is able to purchase used MD-80s outright for one-tenth the cost of a new Boeing 737 although Allegiant has subsequently purchased used Boeing 757-200s, Airbus A319s and Airbus A320s.[34] (the 757s were acquired for its Hawaii service while the Airbus jets are beginning to replace MD-80 aircraft). Given the low cost of ownership, Allegiant is able to operate its aircraft less (seven flight hours per day on average versus 13 hours per day at JetBlue Airways), which helps keep labor costs lower.[34] Overall, Allegiant operates with 35 full-time workers per plane compared to more than 50 at other carriers. Allegiant schedules their crew members so that they always return to their domicile at the end of the day, thus avoiding the need for hotel rooms which can be a costly expense for airlines.[35]
The airline seeks to maintain a low permanent operating cost at the airport.[45] Allegiant rents ticket counters on an hourly basis and in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Springfield, Missouri, many duties are handled by airport employees contracted to Allegiant.[34][46]
Allegiant maintains control over pricing by offering flights exclusively through its website, which also sells these ancillary products. It has no toll-free phone number and does not use Internet travel agencies.[27]
Criticism of the business model[edit]
The airport director in Worcester, Massachusetts, felt that Allegiant reneged on a commitment to serve the airport for five years given the use of federal grants to assist its startup. However, the airline responded that the market was immediately unprofitable and starting service there was a poor decision; flights were reported to be 80% full.[45] Allegiant's flights average 90% full.[37]
The United States Department of Transportation cited the airline in 2009 for not including the "convenience fee" in the initial price quote on the website.[28]
Criticism of workers' right to organize[edit]
Flight attendants at the carrier voted to organize their workgroup under the Transport Workers Union of America in December 2010, citing scheduling concerns among other issues in their work rules and the airline's pilots elected to vote on whether to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in July 2012.[47] In August 2012, the pilots voted to organize and joined the Teamsters.[48] Allegiant's chairman and CEO, Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., has been critical of the unionization of airline employees and has stated that "Unionization is one of those things that clogs the arteries and makes you less quick and not as nimble as you need to be on top of your game... In this industry and others that are heavily unionized, you ultimately end up with bankruptcy as the primary driver" [47]
Safety concerns[edit]
Allegiant Air has been closely monitored by the FAA due to many emergency landings and aborted takeoffs.[49] ABC interviewed a former Allegiant mechanic, who said "Dedicated steps were not being performed with maintenance manuals or even with general practices, before an aircraft is released.".[50] Many of these incidents have involved Allegiant's MD80 aircraft, which are expected to be replaced by Airbus A320 family aircraft. 46 of the 86 aircraft have made emergency landings, all of which were on MD-80's. [51] In March 2016 an Allegiant Air Airbus A320 was forced to make an emergency landing at Jacksonville.[52]
In May 2016, the FAA confirmed that Allegiant was under investigation.[53] On August 17, 2016, Allegiant Flight 436 aborted its take-off from McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada due to an uncommanded early rotation at about 120 knots (220 km/h) indicated airspeed. An investigation by the FAA found that maintenance procedures had not been followed by Allegiant's maintenance provider, AAR Air Services Inc. This resulted in a nut becoming detached from an elevator boost cylinder. The aircraft had made 216 flights in an unairworthy condition. The FAA investigation revealed two similar occurrences. The FAA intend to prosecute over each offence.[54] The result of the 2016 FAA audit was to give the airline a clean bill of health.
A November 2016 analysis by the Tampa Bay Times noted that Allegiant's planes were four times more likely to have in flight failures than other major US airlines.[55]
Destinations[edit]
Main article: Allegiant Air destinations
As of March 2017, Allegiant offers service to 177 destinations throughout the United States, mostly to smaller non-hub regional airports and all usually only a few times each week. It chooses its routes after calculating expected costs and revenue and adds or ends service to particular destinations as demand warrants.

Fleet development[edit]
Allegiant Air is the only US-based carrier to have operated all five subtypes of the MD-80 series. On January 4, 2010, the SAS Group sold 18 surplus MD-80 series aircraft, built in the 1980s, to Allegiant Travel Company.[77]
In March 2010, Allegiant purchased six Boeing 757-200 aircraft from Thomson Airways for flights to Hawaii with the delivery of the first two in the following months. In September 2011, Allegiant Air introduced the 757 into service from their main hub in Las Vegas. Allegiant later began using the ETOPS configured 757s for service to Hawaii.[78] Fresno and Las Vegas were the inaugural destinations with nonstop service to Honolulu, Hawaii. Nonstop service to Honolulu was then added from Bellingham, Boise, Eugene, Phoenix (via Mesa Gateway Airport), Santa Maria, Spokane and Stockton.[79] Nonstop service to Hawaii was also planned from Monterey, CA but was not actually operated. Allegiant then began to reduce its Hawaii service and currently only operates Las Vegas-Honolulu nonstops with all Honolulu service scheduled to end in November 2017 due to Allegiant determining that the extensive and costly maintenance check that happens about every 6 years and costs upwards of $1,000,000USD would not be efficient. [80]
In September 2010, Allegiant began to reconfigure their MD-80 fleet from 150 seats to 166 seats per plane. The project would involve removing galleys from the planes to add the 16 additional seats. All of the MD-80 conversions were completed by the end of September 2013.[81][82]
In July 2012, Allegiant announced the future addition of the Airbus A319-100 aircraft to its fleet. The aircraft are used and formerly belonged to easyJet and Cebu Pacific. Two former easyJet aircraft entered service in 2013, with another in 2014 and 6 in 2015.[83] In December 2012, Allegiant cancelled the agreement with Cebu Pacific citing an inability to agree on economic provisions.[84] On May 1, 2013, Allegiant purchased another A319 aircraft previously operated by easyJet and would enter service in the third quarter of 2013.[85] On February 23, 2015, Allegiant purchased 6 more A319s from Cebu Pacific which will be delivered starting this year until 2016.[86]
In 2013, Allegiant acquired 9 Airbus A320-200 aircraft from Spanish flag carrier Iberia.[87][88] Seven of the A320s were delivered in 2013 and were used for growth into new markets, including destinations in Mexico, the Rocky Mountains as well as airfields such as Charlottesville and Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and Trenton, New Jersey.[84] On February 24, 2015, Allegiant announced the purchase of 2 additional A320s from Philippine Airlines which will enter into service by 2015.[89] Later in 2015 the airline announced a firm order for an Airbus A320 direct from Airbus, the first time it has directly purchased new aircraft from the supplier.[90]
In May of 2017, Allegiant Air took delivery of its first brand new A320. Allegiant will take delivery of 10 new A320s in 2017 and 2 in 2018. All Allegiant Airbuses will be repainted in Allegiant's new livery. Old Aircraft will be retired with Allegiant old liveries. All new Airbuses will have sharklets and painted in Allegaint's new livery.
Livery[edit]
Allegiant Air's livery features a bright sunburst design on the tail, emphasizing the airline's "sun" destinations. The livery has a bold, contemporary look that was created for the airline by Tiami Designs, Atlanta, Georgia.[91]

History[edit]
Early years (1997-2000)[edit]




An Allegiant Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83 at McCarran International Airport


Allegiant Air was founded in January 1997 by Mitch Allee (owner, CEO), Jim Patterson (president) and Dave Beadle (chief pilot), under the name WestJet Express.[1] After losing a trademark dispute with West Jet Air Center of Rapid City, South Dakota and recognizing the name's similarity to WestJet Airlines of Canada, the airline adopted the name Allegiant Air and received FAA and DOT certification for scheduled and charter domestic operations on June 19, 1998. The airline also has authority for charter service to Canada and Mexico.
Scheduled service began on October 15, 1998, between Las Vegas and the airline's original hub in Fresno, California, at the Fresno Yosemite International Airport, with Douglas DC-9-21 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-51 jetliners. During the second half of 1999, the airline was operating nonstop flights between Fresno and Las Vegas, Burbank and Lake Tahoe, and Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe as well as flying one-stop direct service between Fresno and Lake Tahoe via Las Vegas.[9] Shortly after WinAir Airlines closed in 1999, Allegiant Air opened a small hub in Long Beach, CA (LGB) and in 2000 was operating nonstop flights to Fresno and Las Vegas in addition to Fresno-Las Vegas nonstop service.[10] Later in 2000, Allegiant continued to expand and was operating the only nonstop jet service between Lake Tahoe Airport from Long Beach in addition to operating new flights into Portland, Oregon and Reno with Portland-Reno and Reno-Fresno nonstops and direct one-stop service between Portland and Fresno via Reno.[11] However, Allegiant was unable to bring in enough revenue to cover its costs and on December 13, 2000, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Restructuring (2001-02)[edit]
The bankruptcy allowed Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., one of the airline's major creditors, to gain control of the business. A veteran leader of low-cost airlines, Gallagher had worked with WestAir and as CEO of ValuJet Airlines; his tenure included the Flight 592 tragedy. In June 2001, Gallagher restructured Allegiant to a low-cost model, focusing on smaller markets that larger airlines did not serve with mainline aircraft. Now chief executive officer and chairman, he moved the headquarters and operations to Las Vegas.
In March 2002, Allegiant exited bankruptcy and entered into a long-term contract with Harrah's to provide charter services to its casinos in Laughlin and Reno, Nevada. At the same time, the airline acquired its first McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliner. From 2002 through 2004, the airline developed its scheduled-service business model. By 2004, Allegiant was flying from 13 small cities to Las Vegas offering bundled air and hotel packages.
Expansion (2006-08)[edit]
In November 2006, Allegiant filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in anticipation of a planned initial public offering of its Common Stock. It is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ALGT".
On October 25, 2007, the airline opened a fourth focus city and operations base at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport in Mesa, Arizona, connecting 13 cities already served by Allegiant and one new city to the Phoenix metropolitan area.[12] The airport announced a 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) expansion in August 2008, which increased the number of gates from two to four and allowed Allegiant to triple the number of flights from Phoenix. The expansion was funded by a loan from Allegiant which will be repaid by passenger fees.[13]
On November 14, 2007, Allegiant opened its fifth focus city and operations base at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, connecting other Allegiant cities to South Florida.
In January 2008, Allegiant opened its sixth base at Washington's Bellingham International Airport. The airline bases two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft in Bellingham as part of the expansion.[14] Routes served exclusively from Bellingham include Las Vegas, Palm Springs, San Diego, San Francisco and Phoenix. Expansion in Bellingham has been largely driven by its proximity to Vancouver, British Columbia.
2010s[edit]
On July 1, 2010 Allegiant returned to Long Beach Airport (LGB) in Long Beach, California having previously served LGB with DC-9 jets with nonstop flights to Las Vegas (LAS) and Lake Tahoe (TVL) in 2000.[15][16] The airline also intended to fly from Bellingham International Airport and Stockton several times a week; however, there is no service at present flown between these two cities although Allegiant continues to serve Stockton with flights to Las Vegas, Phoenix/Mesa and San Diego.[17]
In February 2010, Allegiant opened its ninth base at Grand Rapids' Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Michigan. The airline based two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft in Grand Rapids, but ended their airport's status as a hub in 2011. The airline continues to fly out of Grand Rapids in a reduced capacity.[18]
In March 2010, Allegiant purchased six used Boeing 757-200 jetliners as part of plans to begin flights to Hawaii, with deliveries from early 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011.[19] It gained the approval for type with the FAA in July 2011,[20] and then worked with the FAA to obtain the appropriate ETOPS rating in order to be able to serve Hawaii. Allegiant currently operates nonstop Boeing 757 service to Honolulu from Las Vegas.[21]
In November 2011, Allegiant closed its Long Beach facility and consolidated all Los Angeles area flights at Los Angeles International (LAX).
In 2014, Cincinnati became Allegiant's largest O&D (Origination & Destination) city, with over 11 destinations and 40 weekly departures. This has grown to 17 destinations and 63 weekly flights as of summer 2017.
In summer 2015, a rash of midair breakdowns drew federal scrutiny. "Before the night was finished on June 25, 2015, five Allegiant flights had been interrupted in four hours, all because different planes had failed in midair," reported the Tampa Bay Times.[22] Since October 2015, the Federal Aviation Authority has kept Allegiant under close supervision.[23][24][25] In July 2015, Allegiant Air announced bases would be established at Asheville Regional Airport and Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, becoming the first base at a non-vacation destination.[citation needed]
Corporate affairs[edit]

Headquarters[edit]

Business model[edit]




An Allegiant Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83 in old livery


Allegiant aims primarily to serve leisure travelers, particularly those in colder northern climates, going to warm-weather tourist destinations such as Punta Gorda, Tampa Bay, Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles and Phoenix.[26] It also serves smaller destinations that see few direct flights by major carriers. Many of the airline's markets, such as Peoria, Illinois, are served only by commuter service requiring a connection at an airline hub.[27] In October 2009, Allegiant had competition on just five of its 136 routes.[28]
Although it does not fly to Canada, Allegiant advertises extensively there and flies from about a dozen small airports near the Canada–US border. Many of its customers at airports such as Bellingham, Washington (BLI), Niagara Falls, New York (IAG), Ogdensburg, New York (OGS), Grand Forks, North Dakota (GFK) and Plattsburgh, New York (PBG) are Canadians, who can save money by flying from U.S. airports.[29]
To keep ticket prices relatively low, Allegiant offers a lower frequency of flights and no amenities such as frequent flier points or on-board entertainment.[27][30]
It prefers to use smaller/secondary airports where landing fees cost less, such as Orlando Sanford International Airport. At Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, Allegiant is now the only carrier. However, since 2015, Allegiant has been growing at major airports, such as Cincinnati, Memphis, Raleigh/Durham, Indianapolis, and San Antonio.
Allegiant already flies into many major airports, including McCarran International (Las Vegas) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. In June 2013, Allegiant deviated from this strategy with plans to compete with Southwest Airlines by offering direct flights between Las Vegas and Austin, a medium hub served by 10 carriers with non-stop routes to over 40 destinations. The airline also flies less frequently compared to the major airlines, operating routes two or three times per week. That requires fewer crews and allows less time-pressured aircraft maintenance.
In February 2011, Allegiant proposed to sell two types of tickets to passengers: advance tickets at a fixed higher rate and time-of-departure tickets that cost less but may have fees added based on the price of aviation fuel.[31] In 2012, the U.S. Department of Transportation banned the practice as part of wider regulations that also require taxes and fees to be included in airfares. Allegiant, along with Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines, sued the DOT to overturn these new rules. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the DOT on 24 July 2012[32] and the US Supreme Court denied certiorari on 1 April 2013.[33]
Ancillary revenue[edit]
Like Ryanair, the low-cost airline founded by the Ryan family of Ireland, who also have invested in Allegiant, the airline seeks ancillary revenue to supplement ticket revenue.[34] These ancillary fees include those for checking luggage, carrying on luggage (other than a small personal item), buying food and drinks on board, obtaining advance seat assignments, paying by credit card, and more.[27][35][36] Allegiant CEO Maurice Gallagher said in 2009, "We collect $110 from you at the end of your trip. If I tried to charge you $110 up front, you wouldn't pay it. But if I sell you a $75 ticket and you self-select the rest, you will."[37]
Allegiant also earns commissions by offering hotel rooms, car rentals and admission to tourist attractions on its website. It sells package vacations under the brand name Allegiant Vacations. The company has arrangements with 34 hotels in Las Vegas and 21 in the Orlando and Daytona Beach, Florida, areas. In 2008, the airline sold 400,000 hotel room nights.[37] Commissions on hotel and rental car packages are up to one-third of the airline's revenue.[35][37]
In 2009, ancillary revenues were $33.35 per passenger.[38]
Charter flights[edit]
Allegiant's air charter operation contributed 7% of its revenue in 2009.[39]
In March 2011, Allegiant took over charter service to Wendover Airport for Peppermill Casinos, Inc. to shuttle customers to Peppermill's three casinos in West Wendover, Nevada; the Montego Bay Resort, the Rainbow Wendover and the Peppermill Wendover.[40] Allegiant based one 150-seat, MD-80 series jet aircraft in Wendover and more than 20 employees, including maintenance, flight crews and stations personnel.[41]
Allegiant also transports firefighters for the United States Forest Service as well as college basketball teams.[39]




An Allegiant Air Boeing 757–200 at McCarran International Airport


Allegiant had a contract to supply charter flights from Miami to four cities in Cuba beginning June 2009. One aircraft was committed to the contract.[39] The contract was for fixed-fee flying, meaning all the airline was required to do was provide the dry aircraft and the flight crew. The contractor was responsible for all other costs including fuel. However, Allegiant ended this service in August 2009.[42]
The company had charter contracts with Caesars Entertainment to ferry customers to Caesars casino properties through Reno-Tahoe International Airport, Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport and Tunica Municipal Airport.[43] These contracts ended in December 2012 when Caesars Entertainment signed a new contract with Republic Airways to provide the charter service to Caesars properties in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Tunica, Mississippi and Laughlin, Nevada.[44]
Costs[edit]
The airline tends to offer lower fares, which requires strict cost control.[27] Part of the airline's lower cost structure includes operation of McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets, which the airline can purchase and refurbish for as little as $4 million.[35] While the aircraft are less fuel-efficient than newer planes, Allegiant is able to purchase used MD-80s outright for one-tenth the cost of a new Boeing 737 although Allegiant has subsequently purchased used Boeing 757-200s, Airbus A319s and Airbus A320s.[34] (the 757s were acquired for its Hawaii service while the Airbus jets are beginning to replace MD-80 aircraft). Given the low cost of ownership, Allegiant is able to operate its aircraft less (seven flight hours per day on average versus 13 hours per day at JetBlue Airways), which helps keep labor costs lower.[34] Overall, Allegiant operates with 35 full-time workers per plane compared to more than 50 at other carriers. Allegiant schedules their crew members so that they always return to their domicile at the end of the day, thus avoiding the need for hotel rooms which can be a costly expense for airlines.[35]
The airline seeks to maintain a low permanent operating cost at the airport.[45] Allegiant rents ticket counters on an hourly basis and in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Springfield, Missouri, many duties are handled by airport employees contracted to Allegiant.[34][46]
Allegiant maintains control over pricing by offering flights exclusively through its website, which also sells these ancillary products. It has no toll-free phone number and does not use Internet travel agencies.[27]
Criticism of the business model[edit]
The airport director in Worcester, Massachusetts, felt that Allegiant reneged on a commitment to serve the airport for five years given the use of federal grants to assist its startup. However, the airline responded that the market was immediately unprofitable and starting service there was a poor decision; flights were reported to be 80% full.[45] Allegiant's flights average 90% full.[37]
The United States Department of Transportation cited the airline in 2009 for not including the "convenience fee" in the initial price quote on the website.[28]
Criticism of workers' right to organize[edit]
Flight attendants at the carrier voted to organize their workgroup under the Transport Workers Union of America in December 2010, citing scheduling concerns among other issues in their work rules and the airline's pilots elected to vote on whether to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in July 2012.[47] In August 2012, the pilots voted to organize and joined the Teamsters.[48] Allegiant's chairman and CEO, Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., has been critical of the unionization of airline employees and has stated that "Unionization is one of those things that clogs the arteries and makes you less quick and not as nimble as you need to be on top of your game... In this industry and others that are heavily unionized, you ultimately end up with bankruptcy as the primary driver" [47]
Safety concerns[edit]
Allegiant Air has been closely monitored by the FAA due to many emergency landings and aborted takeoffs.[49] ABC interviewed a former Allegiant mechanic, who said "Dedicated steps were not being performed with maintenance manuals or even with general practices, before an aircraft is released.".[50] Many of these incidents have involved Allegiant's MD80 aircraft, which are expected to be replaced by Airbus A320 family aircraft. 46 of the 86 aircraft have made emergency landings, all of which were on MD-80's. [51] In March 2016 an Allegiant Air Airbus A320 was forced to make an emergency landing at Jacksonville.[52]
In May 2016, the FAA confirmed that Allegiant was under investigation.[53] On August 17, 2016, Allegiant Flight 436 aborted its take-off from McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada due to an uncommanded early rotation at about 120 knots (220 km/h) indicated airspeed. An investigation by the FAA found that maintenance procedures had not been followed by Allegiant's maintenance provider, AAR Air Services Inc. This resulted in a nut becoming detached from an elevator boost cylinder. The aircraft had made 216 flights in an unairworthy condition. The FAA investigation revealed two similar occurrences. The FAA intend to prosecute over each offence.[54] The result of the 2016 FAA audit was to give the airline a clean bill of health.
A November 2016 analysis by the Tampa Bay Times noted that Allegiant's planes were four times more likely to have in flight failures than other major US airlines.[55]
Destinations[edit]
Main article: Allegiant Air destinations
As of March 2017, Allegiant offers service to 177 destinations throughout the United States, mostly to smaller non-hub regional airports and all usually only a few times each week. It chooses its routes after calculating expected costs and revenue and adds or ends service to particular destinations as demand warrants.

Fleet development[edit]
Allegiant Air is the only US-based carrier to have operated all five subtypes of the MD-80 series. On January 4, 2010, the SAS Group sold 18 surplus MD-80 series aircraft, built in the 1980s, to Allegiant Travel Company.[77]
In March 2010, Allegiant purchased six Boeing 757-200 aircraft from Thomson Airways for flights to Hawaii with the delivery of the first two in the following months. In September 2011, Allegiant Air introduced the 757 into service from their main hub in Las Vegas. Allegiant later began using the ETOPS configured 757s for service to Hawaii.[78] Fresno and Las Vegas were the inaugural destinations with nonstop service to Honolulu, Hawaii. Nonstop service to Honolulu was then added from Bellingham, Boise, Eugene, Phoenix (via Mesa Gateway Airport), Santa Maria, Spokane and Stockton.[79] Nonstop service to Hawaii was also planned from Monterey, CA but was not actually operated. Allegiant then began to reduce its Hawaii service and currently only operates Las Vegas-Honolulu nonstops with all Honolulu service scheduled to end in November 2017 due to Allegiant determining that the extensive and costly maintenance check that happens about every 6 years and costs upwards of $1,000,000USD would not be efficient. [80]
In September 2010, Allegiant began to reconfigure their MD-80 fleet from 150 seats to 166 seats per plane. The project would involve removing galleys from the planes to add the 16 additional seats. All of the MD-80 conversions were completed by the end of September 2013.[81][82]
In July 2012, Allegiant announced the future addition of the Airbus A319-100 aircraft to its fleet. The aircraft are used and formerly belonged to easyJet and Cebu Pacific. Two former easyJet aircraft entered service in 2013, with another in 2014 and 6 in 2015.[83] In December 2012, Allegiant cancelled the agreement with Cebu Pacific citing an inability to agree on economic provisions.[84] On May 1, 2013, Allegiant purchased another A319 aircraft previously operated by easyJet and would enter service in the third quarter of 2013.[85] On February 23, 2015, Allegiant purchased 6 more A319s from Cebu Pacific which will be delivered starting this year until 2016.[86]
In 2013, Allegiant acquired 9 Airbus A320-200 aircraft from Spanish flag carrier Iberia.[87][88] Seven of the A320s were delivered in 2013 and were used for growth into new markets, including destinations in Mexico, the Rocky Mountains as well as airfields such as Charlottesville and Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and Trenton, New Jersey.[84] On February 24, 2015, Allegiant announced the purchase of 2 additional A320s from Philippine Airlines which will enter into service by 2015.[89] Later in 2015 the airline announced a firm order for an Airbus A320 direct from Airbus, the first time it has directly purchased new aircraft from the supplier.[90]
In May of 2017, Allegiant Air took delivery of its first brand new A320. Allegiant will take delivery of 10 new A320s in 2017 and 2 in 2018. All Allegiant Airbuses will be repainted in Allegiant's new livery. Old Aircraft will be retired with Allegiant old liveries. All new Airbuses will have sharklets and painted in Allegaint's new livery.
Livery[edit]
Allegiant Air's livery features a bright sunburst design on the tail, emphasizing the airline's "sun" destinations. The livery has a bold, contemporary look that was created for the airline by Tiami Designs, Atlanta, Georgia.[91]

History[edit]
Early years (1997-2000)[edit]




An Allegiant Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83 at McCarran International Airport


Allegiant Air was founded in January 1997 by Mitch Allee (owner, CEO), Jim Patterson (president) and Dave Beadle (chief pilot), under the name WestJet Express.[1] After losing a trademark dispute with West Jet Air Center of Rapid City, South Dakota and recognizing the name's similarity to WestJet Airlines of Canada, the airline adopted the name Allegiant Air and received FAA and DOT certification for scheduled and charter domestic operations on June 19, 1998. The airline also has authority for charter service to Canada and Mexico.
Scheduled service began on October 15, 1998, between Las Vegas and the airline's original hub in Fresno, California, at the Fresno Yosemite International Airport, with Douglas DC-9-21 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-51 jetliners. During the second half of 1999, the airline was operating nonstop flights between Fresno and Las Vegas, Burbank and Lake Tahoe, and Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe as well as flying one-stop direct service between Fresno and Lake Tahoe via Las Vegas.[9] Shortly after WinAir Airlines closed in 1999, Allegiant Air opened a small hub in Long Beach, CA (LGB) and in 2000 was operating nonstop flights to Fresno and Las Vegas in addition to Fresno-Las Vegas nonstop service.[10] Later in 2000, Allegiant continued to expand and was operating the only nonstop jet service between Lake Tahoe Airport from Long Beach in addition to operating new flights into Portland, Oregon and Reno with Portland-Reno and Reno-Fresno nonstops and direct one-stop service between Portland and Fresno via Reno.[11] However, Allegiant was unable to bring in enough revenue to cover its costs and on December 13, 2000, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Restructuring (2001-02)[edit]
The bankruptcy allowed Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., one of the airline's major creditors, to gain control of the business. A veteran leader of low-cost airlines, Gallagher had worked with WestAir and as CEO of ValuJet Airlines; his tenure included the Flight 592 tragedy. In June 2001, Gallagher restructured Allegiant to a low-cost model, focusing on smaller markets that larger airlines did not serve with mainline aircraft. Now chief executive officer and chairman, he moved the headquarters and operations to Las Vegas.
In March 2002, Allegiant exited bankruptcy and entered into a long-term contract with Harrah's to provide charter services to its casinos in Laughlin and Reno, Nevada. At the same time, the airline acquired its first McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliner. From 2002 through 2004, the airline developed its scheduled-service business model. By 2004, Allegiant was flying from 13 small cities to Las Vegas offering bundled air and hotel packages.
Expansion (2006-08)[edit]
In November 2006, Allegiant filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in anticipation of a planned initial public offering of its Common Stock. It is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ALGT".
On October 25, 2007, the airline opened a fourth focus city and operations base at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport in Mesa, Arizona, connecting 13 cities already served by Allegiant and one new city to the Phoenix metropolitan area.[12] The airport announced a 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) expansion in August 2008, which increased the number of gates from two to four and allowed Allegiant to triple the number of flights from Phoenix. The expansion was funded by a loan from Allegiant which will be repaid by passenger fees.[13]
On November 14, 2007, Allegiant opened its fifth focus city and operations base at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, connecting other Allegiant cities to South Florida.
In January 2008, Allegiant opened its sixth base at Washington's Bellingham International Airport. The airline bases two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft in Bellingham as part of the expansion.[14] Routes served exclusively from Bellingham include Las Vegas, Palm Springs, San Diego, San Francisco and Phoenix. Expansion in Bellingham has been largely driven by its proximity to Vancouver, British Columbia.
2010s[edit]
On July 1, 2010 Allegiant returned to Long Beach Airport (LGB) in Long Beach, California having previously served LGB with DC-9 jets with nonstop flights to Las Vegas (LAS) and Lake Tahoe (TVL) in 2000.[15][16] The airline also intended to fly from Bellingham International Airport and Stockton several times a week; however, there is no service at present flown between these two cities although Allegiant continues to serve Stockton with flights to Las Vegas, Phoenix/Mesa and San Diego.[17]
In February 2010, Allegiant opened its ninth base at Grand Rapids' Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Michigan. The airline based two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft in Grand Rapids, but ended their airport's status as a hub in 2011. The airline continues to fly out of Grand Rapids in a reduced capacity.[18]
In March 2010, Allegiant purchased six used Boeing 757-200 jetliners as part of plans to begin flights to Hawaii, with deliveries from early 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011.[19] It gained the approval for type with the FAA in July 2011,[20] and then worked with the FAA to obtain the appropriate ETOPS rating in order to be able to serve Hawaii. Allegiant currently operates nonstop Boeing 757 service to Honolulu from Las Vegas.[21]
In November 2011, Allegiant closed its Long Beach facility and consolidated all Los Angeles area flights at Los Angeles International (LAX).
In 2014, Cincinnati became Allegiant's largest O&D (Origination & Destination) city, with over 11 destinations and 40 weekly departures. This has grown to 17 destinations and 63 weekly flights as of summer 2017.
In summer 2015, a rash of midair breakdowns drew federal scrutiny. "Before the night was finished on June 25, 2015, five Allegiant flights had been interrupted in four hours, all because different planes had failed in midair," reported the Tampa Bay Times.[22] Since October 2015, the Federal Aviation Authority has kept Allegiant under close supervision.[23][24][25] In July 2015, Allegiant Air announced bases would be established at Asheville Regional Airport and Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, becoming the first base at a non-vacation destination.[citation needed]

Business model[edit]

Allegiant aims primarily to serve leisure travelers, particularly those in colder northern climates, going to warm-weather tourist destinations such as Punta Gorda, Tampa Bay, Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles and Phoenix.[26] It also serves smaller destinations that see few direct flights by major carriers. Many of the airline's markets, such as Peoria, Illinois, are served only by commuter service requiring a connection at an airline hub.[27] In October 2009, Allegiant had competition on just five of its 136 routes.[28]
Although it does not fly to Canada, Allegiant advertises extensively there and flies from about a dozen small airports near the Canada–US border. Many of its customers at airports such as Bellingham, Washington (BLI), Niagara Falls, New York (IAG), Ogdensburg, New York (OGS), Grand Forks, North Dakota (GFK) and Plattsburgh, New York (PBG) are Canadians, who can save money by flying from U.S. airports.[29]
To keep ticket prices relatively low, Allegiant offers a lower frequency of flights and no amenities such as frequent flier points or on-board entertainment.[27][30]
It prefers to use smaller/secondary airports where landing fees cost less, such as Orlando Sanford International Airport. At Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, Allegiant is now the only carrier. However, since 2015, Allegiant has been growing at major airports, such as Cincinnati, Memphis, Raleigh/Durham, Indianapolis, and San Antonio.
Allegiant already flies into many major airports, including McCarran International (Las Vegas) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. In June 2013, Allegiant deviated from this strategy with plans to compete with Southwest Airlines by offering direct flights between Las Vegas and Austin, a medium hub served by 10 carriers with non-stop routes to over 40 destinations. The airline also flies less frequently compared to the major airlines, operating routes two or three times per week. That requires fewer crews and allows less time-pressured aircraft maintenance.
In February 2011, Allegiant proposed to sell two types of tickets to passengers: advance tickets at a fixed higher rate and time-of-departure tickets that cost less but may have fees added based on the price of aviation fuel.[31] In 2012, the U.S. Department of Transportation banned the practice as part of wider regulations that also require taxes and fees to be included in airfares. Allegiant, along with Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines, sued the DOT to overturn these new rules. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the DOT on 24 July 2012[32] and the US Supreme Court denied certiorari on 1 April 2013.[33]
Ancillary revenue[edit]
Like Ryanair, the low-cost airline founded by the Ryan family of Ireland, who also have invested in Allegiant, the airline seeks ancillary revenue to supplement ticket revenue.[34] These ancillary fees include those for checking luggage, carrying on luggage (other than a small personal item), buying food and drinks on board, obtaining advance seat assignments, paying by credit card, and more.[27][35][36] Allegiant CEO Maurice Gallagher said in 2009, "We collect $110 from you at the end of your trip. If I tried to charge you $110 up front, you wouldn't pay it. But if I sell you a $75 ticket and you self-select the rest, you will."[37]
Allegiant also earns commissions by offering hotel rooms, car rentals and admission to tourist attractions on its website. It sells package vacations under the brand name Allegiant Vacations. The company has arrangements with 34 hotels in Las Vegas and 21 in the Orlando and Daytona Beach, Florida, areas. In 2008, the airline sold 400,000 hotel room nights.[37] Commissions on hotel and rental car packages are up to one-third of the airline's revenue.[35][37]
In 2009, ancillary revenues were $33.35 per passenger.[38]
Charter flights[edit]
Allegiant's air charter operation contributed 7% of its revenue in 2009.[39]
In March 2011, Allegiant took over charter service to Wendover Airport for Peppermill Casinos, Inc. to shuttle customers to Peppermill's three casinos in West Wendover, Nevada; the Montego Bay Resort, the Rainbow Wendover and the Peppermill Wendover.[40] Allegiant based one 150-seat, MD-80 series jet aircraft in Wendover and more than 20 employees, including maintenance, flight crews and stations personnel.[41]
Allegiant also transports firefighters for the United States Forest Service as well as college basketball teams.[39]

Allegiant had a contract to supply charter flights from Miami to four cities in Cuba beginning June 2009. One aircraft was committed to the contract.[39] The contract was for fixed-fee flying, meaning all the airline was required to do was provide the dry aircraft and the flight crew. The contractor was responsible for all other costs including fuel. However, Allegiant ended this service in August 2009.[42]
The company had charter contracts with Caesars Entertainment to ferry customers to Caesars casino properties through Reno-Tahoe International Airport, Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport and Tunica Municipal Airport.[43] These contracts ended in December 2012 when Caesars Entertainment signed a new contract with Republic Airways to provide the charter service to Caesars properties in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Tunica, Mississippi and Laughlin, Nevada.[44]
Costs[edit]
The airline tends to offer lower fares, which requires strict cost control.[27] Part of the airline's lower cost structure includes operation of McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets, which the airline can purchase and refurbish for as little as $4 million.[35] While the aircraft are less fuel-efficient than newer planes, Allegiant is able to purchase used MD-80s outright for one-tenth the cost of a new Boeing 737 although Allegiant has subsequently purchased used Boeing 757-200s, Airbus A319s and Airbus A320s.[34] (the 757s were acquired for its Hawaii service while the Airbus jets are beginning to replace MD-80 aircraft). Given the low cost of ownership, Allegiant is able to operate its aircraft less (seven flight hours per day on average versus 13 hours per day at JetBlue Airways), which helps keep labor costs lower.[34] Overall, Allegiant operates with 35 full-time workers per plane compared to more than 50 at other carriers. Allegiant schedules their crew members so that they always return to their domicile at the end of the day, thus avoiding the need for hotel rooms which can be a costly expense for airlines.[35]
The airline seeks to maintain a low permanent operating cost at the airport.[45] Allegiant rents ticket counters on an hourly basis and in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Springfield, Missouri, many duties are handled by airport employees contracted to Allegiant.[34][46]
Allegiant maintains control over pricing by offering flights exclusively through its website, which also sells these ancillary products. It has no toll-free phone number and does not use Internet travel agencies.[27]
Criticism of the business model[edit]
The airport director in Worcester, Massachusetts, felt that Allegiant reneged on a commitment to serve the airport for five years given the use of federal grants to assist its startup. However, the airline responded that the market was immediately unprofitable and starting service there was a poor decision; flights were reported to be 80% full.[45] Allegiant's flights average 90% full.[37]
The United States Department of Transportation cited the airline in 2009 for not including the "convenience fee" in the initial price quote on the website.[28]
Criticism of workers' right to organize[edit]
Flight attendants at the carrier voted to organize their workgroup under the Transport Workers Union of America in December 2010, citing scheduling concerns among other issues in their work rules and the airline's pilots elected to vote on whether to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in July 2012.[47] In August 2012, the pilots voted to organize and joined the Teamsters.[48] Allegiant's chairman and CEO, Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., has been critical of the unionization of airline employees and has stated that "Unionization is one of those things that clogs the arteries and makes you less quick and not as nimble as you need to be on top of your game... In this industry and others that are heavily unionized, you ultimately end up with bankruptcy as the primary driver" [47]
Safety concerns[edit]
Allegiant Air has been closely monitored by the FAA due to many emergency landings and aborted takeoffs.[49] ABC interviewed a former Allegiant mechanic, who said "Dedicated steps were not being performed with maintenance manuals or even with general practices, before an aircraft is released.".[50] Many of these incidents have involved Allegiant's MD80 aircraft, which are expected to be replaced by Airbus A320 family aircraft. 46 of the 86 aircraft have made emergency landings, all of which were on MD-80's. [51] In March 2016 an Allegiant Air Airbus A320 was forced to make an emergency landing at Jacksonville.[52]
In May 2016, the FAA confirmed that Allegiant was under investigation.[53] On August 17, 2016, Allegiant Flight 436 aborted its take-off from McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada due to an uncommanded early rotation at about 120 knots (220 km/h) indicated airspeed. An investigation by the FAA found that maintenance procedures had not been followed by Allegiant's maintenance provider, AAR Air Services Inc. This resulted in a nut becoming detached from an elevator boost cylinder. The aircraft had made 216 flights in an unairworthy condition. The FAA investigation revealed two similar occurrences. The FAA intend to prosecute over each offence.[54] The result of the 2016 FAA audit was to give the airline a clean bill of health.
A November 2016 analysis by the Tampa Bay Times noted that Allegiant's planes were four times more likely to have in flight failures than other major US airlines.[55]
Destinations[edit]
Main article: Allegiant Air destinations
As of March 2017, Allegiant offers service to 177 destinations throughout the United States, mostly to smaller non-hub regional airports and all usually only a few times each week. It chooses its routes after calculating expected costs and revenue and adds or ends service to particular destinations as demand warrants.

Fleet development[edit]
Allegiant Air is the only US-based carrier to have operated all five subtypes of the MD-80 series. On January 4, 2010, the SAS Group sold 18 surplus MD-80 series aircraft, built in the 1980s, to Allegiant Travel Company.[77]
In March 2010, Allegiant purchased six Boeing 757-200 aircraft from Thomson Airways for flights to Hawaii with the delivery of the first two in the following months. In September 2011, Allegiant Air introduced the 757 into service from their main hub in Las Vegas. Allegiant later began using the ETOPS configured 757s for service to Hawaii.[78] Fresno and Las Vegas were the inaugural destinations with nonstop service to Honolulu, Hawaii. Nonstop service to Honolulu was then added from Bellingham, Boise, Eugene, Phoenix (via Mesa Gateway Airport), Santa Maria, Spokane and Stockton.[79] Nonstop service to Hawaii was also planned from Monterey, CA but was not actually operated. Allegiant then began to reduce its Hawaii service and currently only operates Las Vegas-Honolulu nonstops with all Honolulu service scheduled to end in November 2017 due to Allegiant determining that the extensive and costly maintenance check that happens about every 6 years and costs upwards of $1,000,000USD would not be efficient. [80]
In September 2010, Allegiant began to reconfigure their MD-80 fleet from 150 seats to 166 seats per plane. The project would involve removing galleys from the planes to add the 16 additional seats. All of the MD-80 conversions were completed by the end of September 2013.[81][82]
In July 2012, Allegiant announced the future addition of the Airbus A319-100 aircraft to its fleet. The aircraft are used and formerly belonged to easyJet and Cebu Pacific. Two former easyJet aircraft entered service in 2013, with another in 2014 and 6 in 2015.[83] In December 2012, Allegiant cancelled the agreement with Cebu Pacific citing an inability to agree on economic provisions.[84] On May 1, 2013, Allegiant purchased another A319 aircraft previously operated by easyJet and would enter service in the third quarter of 2013.[85] On February 23, 2015, Allegiant purchased 6 more A319s from Cebu Pacific which will be delivered starting this year until 2016.[86]
In 2013, Allegiant acquired 9 Airbus A320-200 aircraft from Spanish flag carrier Iberia.[87][88] Seven of the A320s were delivered in 2013 and were used for growth into new markets, including destinations in Mexico, the Rocky Mountains as well as airfields such as Charlottesville and Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and Trenton, New Jersey.[84] On February 24, 2015, Allegiant announced the purchase of 2 additional A320s from Philippine Airlines which will enter into service by 2015.[89] Later in 2015 the airline announced a firm order for an Airbus A320 direct from Airbus, the first time it has directly purchased new aircraft from the supplier.[90]
In May of 2017, Allegiant Air took delivery of its first brand new A320. Allegiant will take delivery of 10 new A320s in 2017 and 2 in 2018. All Allegiant Airbuses will be repainted in Allegiant's new livery. Old Aircraft will be retired with Allegiant old liveries. All new Airbuses will have sharklets and painted in Allegaint's new livery.
Livery[edit]
Allegiant Air's livery features a bright sunburst design on the tail, emphasizing the airline's "sun" destinations. The livery has a bold, contemporary look that was created for the airline by Tiami Designs, Atlanta, Georgia.[91]

History[edit]
Early years (1997-2000)[edit]




An Allegiant Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83 at McCarran International Airport


Allegiant Air was founded in January 1997 by Mitch Allee (owner, CEO), Jim Patterson (president) and Dave Beadle (chief pilot), under the name WestJet Express.[1] After losing a trademark dispute with West Jet Air Center of Rapid City, South Dakota and recognizing the name's similarity to WestJet Airlines of Canada, the airline adopted the name Allegiant Air and received FAA and DOT certification for scheduled and charter domestic operations on June 19, 1998. The airline also has authority for charter service to Canada and Mexico.
Scheduled service began on October 15, 1998, between Las Vegas and the airline's original hub in Fresno, California, at the Fresno Yosemite International Airport, with Douglas DC-9-21 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-51 jetliners. During the second half of 1999, the airline was operating nonstop flights between Fresno and Las Vegas, Burbank and Lake Tahoe, and Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe as well as flying one-stop direct service between Fresno and Lake Tahoe via Las Vegas.[9] Shortly after WinAir Airlines closed in 1999, Allegiant Air opened a small hub in Long Beach, CA (LGB) and in 2000 was operating nonstop flights to Fresno and Las Vegas in addition to Fresno-Las Vegas nonstop service.[10] Later in 2000, Allegiant continued to expand and was operating the only nonstop jet service between Lake Tahoe Airport from Long Beach in addition to operating new flights into Portland, Oregon and Reno with Portland-Reno and Reno-Fresno nonstops and direct one-stop service between Portland and Fresno via Reno.[11] However, Allegiant was unable to bring in enough revenue to cover its costs and on December 13, 2000, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Restructuring (2001-02)[edit]
The bankruptcy allowed Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr., one of the airline's major creditors, to gain control of the business. A veteran leader of low-cost airlines, Gallagher had worked with WestAir and as CEO of ValuJet Airlines; his tenure included the Flight 592 tragedy. In June 2001, Gallagher restructured Allegiant to a low-cost model, focusing on smaller markets that larger airlines did not serve with mainline aircraft. Now chief executive officer and chairman, he moved the headquarters and operations to Las Vegas.
In March 2002, Allegiant exited bankruptcy and entered into a long-term contract with Harrah's to provide charter services to its casinos in Laughlin and Reno, Nevada. At the same time, the airline acquired its first McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliner. From 2002 through 2004, the airline developed its scheduled-service business model. By 2004, Allegiant was flying from 13 small cities to Las Vegas offering bundled air and hotel packages.
Expansion (2006-08)[edit]
In November 2006, Allegiant filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in anticipation of a planned initial public offering of its Common Stock. It is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ALGT".
On October 25, 2007, the airline opened a fourth focus city and operations base at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport in Mesa, Arizona, connecting 13 cities already served by Allegiant and one new city to the Phoenix metropolitan area.[12] The airport announced a 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) expansion in August 2008, which increased the number of gates from two to four and allowed Allegiant to triple the number of flights from Phoenix. The expansion was funded by a loan from Allegiant which will be repaid by passenger fees.[13]
On November 14, 2007, Allegiant opened its fifth focus city and operations base at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, connecting other Allegiant cities to South Florida.
In January 2008, Allegiant opened its sixth base at Washington's Bellingham International Airport. The airline bases two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft in Bellingham as part of the expansion.[14] Routes served exclusively from Bellingham include Las Vegas, Palm Springs, San Diego, San Francisco and Phoenix. Expansion in Bellingham has been largely driven by its proximity to Vancouver, British Columbia.
2010s[edit]
On July 1, 2010 Allegiant returned to Long Beach Airport (LGB) in Long Beach, California having previously served LGB with DC-9 jets with nonstop flights to Las Vegas (LAS) and Lake Tahoe (TVL) in 2000.[15][16] The airline also intended to fly from Bellingham International Airport and Stockton several times a week; however, there is no service at present flown between these two cities although Allegiant continues to serve Stockton with flights to Las Vegas, Phoenix/Mesa and San Diego.[17]
In February 2010, Allegiant opened its ninth base at Grand Rapids' Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Michigan. The airline based two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft in Grand Rapids, but ended their airport's status as a hub in 2011. The airline continues to fly out of Grand Rapids in a reduced capacity.[18]
In March 2010, Allegiant purchased six used Boeing 757-200 jetliners as part of plans to begin flights to Hawaii, with deliveries from early 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011.[19] It gained the approval for type with the FAA in July 2011,[20] and then worked with the FAA to obtain the appropriate ETOPS rating in order to be able to serve Hawaii. Allegiant currently operates nonstop Boeing 757 service to Honolulu from Las Vegas.[21]
In November 2011, Allegiant closed its Long Beach facility and consolidated all Los Angeles area flights at Los Angeles International (LAX).
In 2014, Cincinnati became Allegiant's largest O&D (Origination & Destination) city, with over 11 destinations and 40 weekly departures. This has grown to 17 destinations and 63 weekly flights as of summer 2017.
In summer 2015, a rash of midair breakdowns drew federal scrutiny. "Before the night was finished on June 25, 2015, five Allegiant flights had been interrupted in four hours, all because different planes had failed in midair," reported the Tampa Bay Times.[22] Since October 2015, the Federal Aviation Authority has kept Allegiant under close supervision.[23][24][25] In July 2015, Allegiant Air announced bases would be established at Asheville Regional Airport and Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, becoming the first base at a non-vacation destination.[citation needed]
Corporate affairs[edit]

Business model[edit]




An Allegiant Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83 in old livery


Allegiant aims primarily to serve leisure travelers, particularly those in colder northern climates, going to warm-weather tourist destinations such as Punta Gorda, Tampa Bay, Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles and Phoenix.[26] It also serves smaller destinations that see few direct flights by major carriers. Many of the airline's markets, such as Peoria, Illinois, are served only by commuter service requiring a connection at an airline hub.[27] In October 2009, Allegiant had competition on just five of its 136 routes.[28]
Although it does not fly to Canada, Allegiant advertises extensively there and flies from about a dozen small airports near the Canada–US border. Many of its customers at airports such as Bellingham, Washington (BLI), Niagara Falls, New York (IAG), Ogdensburg, New York (OGS), Grand Forks, North Dakota (GFK) and Plattsburgh, New York (PBG) are Canadians, who can save money by flying from U.S. airports.[29]
To keep ticket prices relatively low, Allegiant offers a lower frequency of flights and no amenities such as frequent flier points or on-board entertainment.[27][30]
It prefers to use smaller/secondary airports where landing fees cost less, such as Orlando Sanford International Airport. At Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, Allegiant is now the only carrier. However, since 2015, Allegiant has been growing at major airports, such as Cincinnati, Memphis, Raleigh/Durham, Indianapolis, and San Antonio.
Allegiant already flies into many major airports, including McCarran International (Las Vegas) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. In June 2013, Allegiant deviated from this strategy with plans to compete with Southwest Airlines by offering direct flights between Las Vegas and Austin, a medium hub served by 10 carriers with non-stop routes to over 40 destinations. The airline also flies less frequently compared to the major airlines, operating routes two or three times per week. That requires fewer crews and allows less time-pressured aircraft maintenance.
In February 2011, Allegiant proposed to sell two types of tickets to passengers: advance tickets at a fixed higher rate and time-of-departure tickets that cost less but may have fees added based on the price of aviation fuel.[31] In 2012, the U.S. Department of Transportation banned the practice as part of wider regulations that also require taxes and fees to be included in airfares. Allegiant, along with Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines, sued the DOT to overturn these new rules. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the DOT on 24 July 2012[32] and the US Supreme Court denied certiorari on 1 April 2013.[33]
Ancillary revenue[edit]
Like Ryanair, the low-cost airline founded by the Ryan family of Ireland, who also have invested in Allegiant, the airline seeks ancillary revenue to supplement ticket revenue.[34] These ancillary fees include those for checking luggage, carrying on luggage (other than a small personal item), buying food and drinks on board, obtaining advance seat assignments, paying by credit card, and more.[27][35][36] Allegiant CEO Maurice Gallagher said in 2009, "We collect $110 from you at the end of your trip. If I tried to charge you $110 up front, you wouldn't pay it. But if I sell you a $75 ticket and you self-select the rest, you will."[37]
Allegiant also earns commissions by offering hotel rooms, car rentals and admission to tourist attractions on its website. It sells package vacations under the brand name Allegiant Vacations. The company has arrangements with 34 hotels in Las Vegas and 21 in the Orlando and Daytona Beach, Florida, areas. In 2008, the airline sold 400,000 hotel room nights.[37] Commissions on hotel and rental car packages are up to one-third of the airline's revenue.[35][37]
In 2009, ancillary revenues were $33.35 per passenger.[38]
Charter flights[edit]
Allegiant's air charter operation contributed 7% of its revenue in 2009.[39]
In March 2011, Allegiant took over charter service to Wendover Airport for Peppermill Casinos, Inc. to shuttle customers to Peppermill's three casinos in West Wendover, Nevada; the Montego Bay Resort, the Rainbow Wendover and the Peppermill Wendover.[40] Allegiant based one 150-seat, MD-80 series jet aircraft in Wendover and more than 20 employees, including maintenance, flight crews and stations personnel.[41]
Allegiant also transports firefighters for the United States Forest Service as well as college basketball teams.[39]




An Allegiant Air Boeing 757–200 at McCarran International Airport


Allegiant had a contract to supply charter flights from Miami to four cities in Cuba beginning June 2009. One aircraft was committed to the contract.[39] The contract was for fixed-fee flying, meaning all the airline was required to do was provide the dry aircraft and the flight crew. The contractor was responsible for all other costs including fuel. However, Allegiant ended this service in August 2009.[42]
The company had charter contracts with Caesars Entertainment to ferry customers to Caesars casino properties through Reno-Tahoe International Airport, Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport and Tunica Municipal Airport.[43] These contracts ended in December 2012 when Caesars Entertainment signed a new contract with Republic Airways to provide the charter service to Caesars properties in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Tunica, Mississippi and Laughlin, Nevada.[44]
Costs[edit]
The airline tends to offer lower fares, which requires strict cost control.[27] Part of the airline's lower cost structure includes operation of McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets, which the airline can purchase and refurbish for as little as $4 million.[35] While the aircraft are less fuel-efficient than newer planes, Allegiant is able to purchase used MD-80s outright for one-tenth the cost of a new Boeing 737 although Allegiant has subsequently purchased used Boeing 757-200s, Airbus A319s and Airbus A320s.[34] (the 757s were acquired for its Hawaii service while the Airbus jets are beginning to replace MD-80 aircraft). Given the low cost of ownership, Allegiant is able to operate its aircraft less (seven flight hours per day on average versus 13 hours per day at JetBlue Airways), which helps keep labor costs lower.[34] Overall, Allegiant operates with 35 full-time workers per plane compared to more than 50 at other carriers. Allegiant schedules their crew members so that they always return to their domicile at the end of the day, thus avoiding the need for hotel rooms which can be a costly expense for airlines.[35]
The airline seeks to maintain a low permanent operating cost at the airport.[45] Allegiant rents ticket counters on an hourly basis and in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Springfield, Missouri, many duties are handled by airport employees contracted to Allegiant.[34][46]
Allegiant maintains control over pricing by offering flights exclusively through its website, which also sells these ancillary products. It has no toll-free phone number and does not use Internet travel agencies.[27]
Criticism of the business model[edit]
The airport director in Worcester, Massachusetts, felt that Allegiant reneged on a commitment to serve the airport for five years given the use of federal grants to assist its startup. However, the airline responded that the market was immediately unprofitable and starting service there was a poor decision; flights were reported to be 80% full.[45] Allegiant's flights average 90% full.[37]
The United States Department of Transportation cited the airline in 2009 for not including the "convenience fee" in the initial price quote on the website.[28]
Criticism of workers' right to organize[edit]
Flight attendants at the carrier voted to organize their workgroup under the Transport Workers Union of America in December 2010, citing scheduling concerns among other issues in their work rules and the airline's pilots elected to vote on whether to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in July 2012.[47] In August 2012, the pilots voted to organize and joined the Teamsters.[48] Allegiant's chairman and CEO, Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., has been critical of the unionization of airline employees and has stated that "Unionization is one of those things that clogs the arteries and makes you less quick and not as nimble as you need to be on top of your game... In this industry and others that are heavily unionized, you ultimately end up with bankruptcy as the primary driver" [47]
Safety concerns[edit]
Allegiant Air has been closely monitored by the FAA due to many emergency landings and aborted takeoffs.[49] ABC interviewed a former Allegiant mechanic, who said "Dedicated steps were not being performed with maintenance manuals or even with general practices, before an aircraft is released.".[50] Many of these incidents have involved Allegiant's MD80 aircraft, which are expected to be replaced by Airbus A320 family aircraft. 46 of the 86 aircraft have made emergency landings, all of which were on MD-80's. [51] In March 2016 an Allegiant Air Airbus A320 was forced to make an emergency landing at Jacksonville.[52]
In May 2016, the FAA confirmed that Allegiant was under investigation.[53] On August 17, 2016, Allegiant Flight 436 aborted its take-off from McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada due to an uncommanded early rotation at about 120 knots (220 km/h) indicated airspeed. An investigation by the FAA found that maintenance procedures had not been followed by Allegiant's maintenance provider, AAR Air Services Inc. This resulted in a nut becoming detached from an elevator boost cylinder. The aircraft had made 216 flights in an unairworthy condition. The FAA investigation revealed two similar occurrences. The FAA intend to prosecute over each offence.[54] The result of the 2016 FAA audit was to give the airline a clean bill of health.
A November 2016 analysis by the Tampa Bay Times noted that Allegiant's planes were four times more likely to have in flight failures than other major US airlines.[55]
Destinations[edit]
Main article: Allegiant Air destinations
As of March 2017, Allegiant offers service to 177 destinations throughout the United States, mostly to smaller non-hub regional airports and all usually only a few times each week. It chooses its routes after calculating expected costs and revenue and adds or ends service to particular destinations as demand warrants.

Fleet development[edit]
Allegiant Air is the only US-based carrier to have operated all five subtypes of the MD-80 series. On January 4, 2010, the SAS Group sold 18 surplus MD-80 series aircraft, built in the 1980s, to Allegiant Travel Company.[77]
In March 2010, Allegiant purchased six Boeing 757-200 aircraft from Thomson Airways for flights to Hawaii with the delivery of the first two in the following months. In September 2011, Allegiant Air introduced the 757 into service from their main hub in Las Vegas. Allegiant later began using the ETOPS configured 757s for service to Hawaii.[78] Fresno and Las Vegas were the inaugural destinations with nonstop service to Honolulu, Hawaii. Nonstop service to Honolulu was then added from Bellingham, Boise, Eugene, Phoenix (via Mesa Gateway Airport), Santa Maria, Spokane and Stockton.[79] Nonstop service to Hawaii was also planned from Monterey, CA but was not actually operated. Allegiant then began to reduce its Hawaii service and currently only operates Las Vegas-Honolulu nonstops with all Honolulu service scheduled to end in November 2017 due to Allegiant determining that the extensive and costly maintenance check that happens about every 6 years and costs upwards of $1,000,000USD would not be efficient. [80]
In September 2010, Allegiant began to reconfigure their MD-80 fleet from 150 seats to 166 seats per plane. The project would involve removing galleys from the planes to add the 16 additional seats. All of the MD-80 conversions were completed by the end of September 2013.[81][82]
In July 2012, Allegiant announced the future addition of the Airbus A319-100 aircraft to its fleet. The aircraft are used and formerly belonged to easyJet and Cebu Pacific. Two former easyJet aircraft entered service in 2013, with another in 2014 and 6 in 2015.[83] In December 2012, Allegiant cancelled the agreement with Cebu Pacific citing an inability to agree on economic provisions.[84] On May 1, 2013, Allegiant purchased another A319 aircraft previously operated by easyJet and would enter service in the third quarter of 2013.[85] On February 23, 2015, Allegiant purchased 6 more A319s from Cebu Pacific which will be delivered starting this year until 2016.[86]
In 2013, Allegiant acquired 9 Airbus A320-200 aircraft from Spanish flag carrier Iberia.[87][88] Seven of the A320s were delivered in 2013 and were used for growth into new markets, including destinations in Mexico, the Rocky Mountains as well as airfields such as Charlottesville and Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and Trenton, New Jersey.[84] On February 24, 2015, Allegiant announced the purchase of 2 additional A320s from Philippine Airlines which will enter into service by 2015.[89] Later in 2015 the airline announced a firm order for an Airbus A320 direct from Airbus, the first time it has directly purchased new aircraft from the supplier.[90]
In May of 2017, Allegiant Air took delivery of its first brand new A320. Allegiant will take delivery of 10 new A320s in 2017 and 2 in 2018. All Allegiant Airbuses will be repainted in Allegiant's new livery. Old Aircraft will be retired with Allegiant old liveries. All new Airbuses will have sharklets and painted in Allegaint's new livery.
Livery[edit]
Allegiant Air's livery features a bright sunburst design on the tail, emphasizing the airline's "sun" destinations. The livery has a bold, contemporary look that was created for the airline by Tiami Designs, Atlanta, Georgia.[91]

Allegiant Travel Co (NAS:ALGT)
Gross Property, Plant and Equipment
=GURUF("ALGT","Gross Property, Plant and Equipment")

$1,610 Mil (As of Mar. 2017)
Allegiant Travel Co's quarterly gross PPE increased from Sep. 2016 ($1,510 Mil) to Dec. 2016 ($1,561 Mil) and increased from Dec. 2016 ($1,561 Mil) to Mar. 2017 ($1,610 Mil).
Allegiant Travel Co's annual gross PPE increased from Dec. 2014 ($1,048 Mil) to Dec. 2015 ($1,273 Mil) and increased from Dec. 2015 ($1,273 Mil) to Dec. 2016 ($1,561 Mil).

Definition
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are the fixed assets of the company. Fixed assets are also known as non-current assets.
Property, plant, and equipment includes assets that will - in the normal course of business - neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers.
Some of the most common parts of property, plant, and equipment are:

	Land
	Buildings (and leasehold improvements)
	Transportation equipment
	Manufacturing equipment
	Office equipment
	Office furniture

Companies with lots of property, plant, and equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes:

	Track
	Ties
	Ballast
	Bridges
	Tunnels
	Signals
	Locomotives
	Freight Cars

There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a companys 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns.
The market value of property, plant, and equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of property, plant, and equipment.
For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the companys manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment away. That property, plant, and equipment was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land.
All property, plant, and equipment other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost.
The property, plant, and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property, plant, and equipment. This means it is the cost of the property, plant, and equipment less accumulated depreciation.

Explanation
A company with durable competitive advantage doesnt need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive. The company replaces when it wears out. On the other hand, a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace.
Difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows, whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance.
Producing a consistent product that doesnt change equates to consistent profits. There is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures. Think Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson etc.

THAT made everything go bad. WE were suppose to be in Las Vegas around 2pm, we did not get to Las Vegas until 8:30pm. That was a really bad experience. MAYBE next time have another flight ready on another airline available.GregFresno, CA Fresno Air Terminal - Las Vegas Mccarran International Airport (FAT - LAS)From: $78Average Rating2.6/5Reviews:27plane was delayed going and returning.total of three hours. I wanted to make changes to flight , So I called and I was put on hold for three hours. i tried online Istill couldn't get any response.John Q PublicAustin, TX Austin-Bergstrom International Airport - Las Vegas Mccarran International Airport (AUS - LAS)From: $107Average Rating3.0/5Reviews:16Your airline is horrible. We were delayed for 2 hours in Austin, then the flight was cancelled. Leaving our group with limited options to get to Las Vegas. We had to spend an additional $1800.00 to get to Las Vegas. Our flight came in too late for us to enjoy a $3000.00 table & bottle service we had pre-purchased at a nightclub. So, your inferior lackluster service cost us $4,800.00.JCFort Lauderdale, FL Hollywood Intl Apt - Indianapolis, IN Indianapolis International Airport (FLL - IND)From: $139Average Rating4.0/5Reviews:4Overall keep up the good service. The only little upsetting issue was my daughter and I had to come back 8 days before our scheduled flight (we had a family emergency back home) and even though we were giving all that time of advance notice we were given a BS excuse that there was a $75.00 cancellation fee so we could not be reimbursed for the leg of the flight we were not going to use. Like all the other airlines they wanted to charge us an arm and a leg for making the changes. After some internet shopping I found a completely new one way trip for both of us $100.00 less than we were being charged directly with Allegiant. Like I said I know that is a common practice among all airlines.JCCLas Vegas Mccarran International Airport - Kansas City, MO Kansas City International Airport (LAS - MCI)Average Rating1.0/5Reviews:1The Stewards were outstanding, capable, and friendly. they were the one pleasant part of the experience. The flight was a rough and bumpy flight, but that was due to weather. The air vents never started working in my row; and it made for a quite warm and unpleasant flight. I booked this flight last minute because of a death in the family. My party and I were disappointed that the airline would not work with us to change flights and I feel it was not worth the money. It was quite an expensive flight to make it back for a funeral. Other family members dealing with other airlines had much better experiences and were accommodated in their time of grief. I feel like we were taken advantage of in a tough time where we had no other options. When my sister asked to change her flight due to a death, they said they required an obituary. This was not available until the day of our flight. In this day and age, funerals happen very quickly and things like obituaries are not always available in time for travel. I think this is a ridiculous requirement that is insensitive.CariMemphis, TN Memphis International Airport - Fort Lauderdale, FL Hollywood Intl Apt (MEM - FLL)From: $166Average Rating3.0/5Reviews:5I check in my bag in and i had a lock on my bag. My bag lock was cut and my shoes were stolen out of there. They are a poplar shoe the all black retro 12s. The airline siad ots nothing they can do about it. They also said TSA could have cut but TSA said if the went in tje bag it would have be some info in to staye they went in there. THIS MY FIRST AN LAST TIME FLYING WITH ALLGAINT AIRLINE AND I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE. THE PEOPLE AT FORT LAUDERDALE WHERE RUDE ABOUT WHEN SHE GAVE ME MY BAG AND TOLD THEM RIGHT THEN AN THERE. . I. WILL TELL EVERYONE NOT TO FLY WITH THEMMonteLas Vegas Mccarran International Airport - Fresno, CA Fresno Air Terminal (LAS - FAT)From: $86Average Rating3.8/5Reviews:5Had to pay for a bag that was carry on. Wasn't disclosed at time of booking. Confusing. Airport staff very rude for Allegiant. Had to pay $50 for a carry on bag. Very upset about it but no choice because flight was leaving.Twyla DixonBellingham, WA Bellingham International - Las Vegas Mccarran International Airport (BLI - LAS)From: $102Average Rating3.0/5Reviews:7Have your planes running on time and don't cancel flights. It messes up everyone's vacation. When you have plans and are meeting others it cuts your vacation time.LindaLos Angeles Intl Airport - Albuquerque International Airport (LAX - ABQ)From: $123Average Rating4.5/5Reviews:2Hidden charges for seat assignment and carry-on baggage make the "deal" considerably less sweet. Be honest from the first page--not the last.JPhwy101San Antonio, TX San Antonio Intl - Las Vegas Mccarran International Airport (SAT - LAS)From: $150Average Rating3.3/5Reviews:6I don't really like super cheap airlines. You get what you pay for. I would rather pay a little more and have a better and more comfortable flight.CindySt. Petersburg, FL St Petersburg - Clearwater Intl - Grand Rapids, MI Kent County International Airport (PIE - GRR)Average Rating4.0/5Reviews:5When I arrived at St Pete airport to leave & the line was outrageous. I thought I was going to miss my flight. There were too many flights leaving Alliganace at the same time. After awhile, they were pulling the most recent flights to leave to another line, which helped but it was very stressful.KarenOrlando Sanford International - Belleville Scott Afb - Midamerica (SFB - BLV)Average Rating2.5/5Reviews:2Really good overall. Loved the ticket pricing & no fees for parking. Refreshments were pricey so didn't buy.

I asked at the terminal if I could be reimbursed and was told my carry-on and seat charges would be returned but I havent seen it yet.JamieTulsa, OK Tulsa International - Las Vegas Mccarran International Airport (TUL - LAS)Average Rating4.2/5Reviews:10Please provide free snacks and drinks for customers.... I have never flown with an airline that didn't provide these things...This is a major drwback from flying with you again.RashellLouisville, KY Standiford Field - Fort Lauderdale, FL Hollywood Intl Apt (SDF - FLL)Average Rating1.0/5Reviews:1Allegiant departure flight was 2 1/2 hours late causing us to arrive in FLL around 3am.

Unsatisfactory serviceJakeValparaiso, FL Fort Walton Beach - Belleville Scott Afb - Midamerica (VPS - BLV)Average Rating4.0/5Reviews:1Had an emergency and wasn't able to alter the flight information because flight wasn't booked through the airline.

TOO MANY EXTRA PAYMENTS!!!! didn't takePatSt. Petersburg, FL St Petersburg - Clearwater Intl - Huntington, WV Tri-State (PIE - HTS)Average Rating3.0/5Reviews:2The delays going to Huntington was inconvenient. However, the 5 1/2 hour return delay was so badly handled. I am not sure for a first time customer, this is going to be a repeat occurrence. NOT a pleasant experience, life is too short to spend mine in that much stress.DebbieSee more reviewsCloseOther Allegiant Air RoutesFlights Las Vegas (LAS) - Oakland, CA (OAK)$71Flights Kansas City, MO (MCI) - Las Vegas (LAS)$107Flights Las Vegas (LAS) - Reno, NV (RNO)$139Flights Pasco, WA (PSC) - Las Vegas (LAS)$164Flights Newark - Nj (EWR) - Savannah, GA (SAV)$102Flights Los Angeles (LAX) - Memphis, TN (MEM)$291Flights Columbus, OH (LCK) - Fort Lauderdale, FL (FLL)$113Flights Indianapolis, IN (IND) - Fort Lauderdale, FL (FLL)$113Flights Covington, KY - Cincinatti, OH (CVG) - Newark - Nj (EWR)$98Flights Indianapolis, IN (IND) - Las Vegas (LAS)$174Flights Los Angeles (LAX) - Boise, ID (BOI)$272Flights Reno, NV (RNO) - Las Vegas (LAS)$123Flights Orlando (SFB) - Knoxville, TN (TYS)$95Flights Covington, KY - Cincinatti, OH (CVG) - Las Vegas (LAS)$151Flights El Paso, TX (ELP) - Las Vegas (LAS)$80Flights Fort Lauderdale, FL (FLL) - Asheville, NC (AVL)$121Flights Memphis, TN (MEM) - Los Angeles (LAX)$359Flights McAllen, TX (MFE) - Las Vegas (LAS)$161Flights Albuquerque (ABQ) - Los Angeles (LAX)$91Flights Fort Lauderdale, FL (FLL) - Memphis, TN (MEM)$222This Site is published by eDreams for comparison, information and commercial purpose and it has no link with the official website of the airline here above mentioned.eDreams ® 2015© Copyright 1999 - 07/26/2017 eDreams.

Average Airfare to Costa Rica is Down 31 Percent

BOSTON, MA–(Marketwired) – It’s a perfect storm for summer travelers, and it has nothing to do with the weather. A combination of a strong dollar, lower fuel prices and more competition from discount airlines has conspired to create the lowest airfares we’ve seen in the past five years.
Cheapflights.com, the online leader in finding and publishing travel deals, took a look at airfares for the top 50 most-searched destinations from January to April of this year and then compared average prices to the same destination for each of the past five years. 2016 was hands-down the winner. So the team dug a little deeper, compiling 10 Places to Go While Airfares Are Low, showcasing the 10 destinations (five domestic, five international) where airfares had shown the biggest drops in the last year — all of them down more than 25 percent.
With hot spots from Atlanta to Sydney, this year’s line-up of destinations with airfares on the decline should inspire a great vacation season. Here are the five destinations with the biggest drops, by percentage, heading into summer:
Costa Rica – Who doesn’t dream of a Costa Rica vacay? Make the dream a reality while average flight prices to Juan Santamaria International are down this year (31 percent). With rain forests, waterfalls, volcanoes and rivers to explore, natural beauty abounds. Add to that, rich culture and tasty affordable dining options, and you will want to start packing immediately.





Chicago – Fly into Chicago-O’Hare International and save this summer — airfares are down 41 percent compared with last year. But that’s hardly the only reason to head to the Windy City. Chicago boasts multiple free festivals this summer, including the Chicago Blues Festival in June and the Chicago Jazz Festival held Labor Day weekend, among many other must-see events. Pop culture enthusiasts should also be sure to grab some grub at the summer-long “Saved by the Bell” pop-up diner in Wicker Park, “Saved by the Max.”
Florida – Florida has always been a popular summer travel destination for all ages and interests. From family-friendly Disney World to the vibrant nightlife of Miami, there is no shortage of summer adventures to be had in the Sunshine State. And those looking for a Florida vacay this summer are in luck. Four airports in the state have seen big average airfare drops this year: Southwest Florida International (serving Fort Myers and the Florida Gulf) is down 35 percent, Orlando International is down 32 percent, Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International is down 32 percent and Miami International is down 25 percent, making all four great options for summer 2016. Head to Disney, enjoy the Southern Florida sunshine, party in Miami, relax in Fort Lauderdale or, perhaps, all of the above.
London, England – Thanks to some healthy competition for international travelers between Gatwick and Heathrow, average airfares to London are down (29 percent into Gatwick and 33 percent into Heathrow) and deals are there for the taking. So why not hop across the pond this summer? June brings the Trooping of the Colour, a parade in honor of the Queen’s birthday, as well as a two-day floating cinema tour. If you’re in Londontown later in the summer, head to the Notting Hill Carnival — Europe’s biggest street festival.
Sydney, Australia – Australia is a dream destination for many Americans, and now is a great time to head Down Under while prices are down. Fly into Kingsford Smith Airport in Sydney to save on airfare (with average flight prices down 33 percent). While it may be winter in Australia, that doesn’t mean there isn’t plenty to keep you busy. After all, Aussie winters are typically mild, making it a great time to get outdoors. July is actually the best month of the year for a whale watching excursion in Sydney, with sightings almost guaranteed – providing a refund or second trip should you not see a whale. It’s also the perfect time to hike the Blue Mountains, which become even more scenic during Sydney’s winter months.
With airfares so low, here are some more deeply discounted destinations to consider when planning your trips this year: Punta Cana, Dominican Republic (down by 31 percent); New York (down by 31 percent); Atlanta, Georgia (down by 28 percent); Los Angeles, California (down by 27 percent) and Bangkok, Thailand (down by 26 percent).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
