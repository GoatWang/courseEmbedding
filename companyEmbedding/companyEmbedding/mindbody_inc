Additional Information 

Add Product

Click the Home tab.
Select Products from the submenu.
Click the Add New button.  
This opens the Add a New Product form.

Under the "Basic Information" section, you can begin entering the required product details, like the product’s name and price.
Below the Basic Information section, you’ll find additional sections where you can add more details about each product, or add multiple product variants at once. Note: These fields are optional.

Required fields marked by asterisks
After you have enter a product name and price in the Basic Information section (1), you have the option to skip to the bottom (ignoring all the other fields in this screen), and clicking on one of the add buttons (2).
 

If you click the Add button, you’ll go right back to the Manage Products screen, where you can search to see your new product.
If you click the Save & Add Next button, a new Add a Product form will open, and you can continue adding products.

Basic Information


Product name (required): Enter the product’s name. If you are adding a group of products, this name will apply to all color and size combinations (which we call variants) that you add. 
Product price (required): Enter the price that clients will pay for this product. 
Sales tax: If you have tax rates enabled, you’ll see all of them here. Make sure to check only the rates that you want to apply when clients purchase this product.
Wholesale cost: Type in the amount of money the supplier charged you for this product. Your markup percentage will display to the right of the product price.
Barcode: Enter a barcode manually, or click your cursor in the field and scan the product’s barcode. You can also leave the barcode field blank to let MINDBODY generate one for you. If you use variable barcodes, check the “Use variable pricing” box and enter only the five-digit product ID portion of the barcode into the field. You can search for retail products by barcode, or even use them to take physical inventory with our Inventory Tickets feature.
Sold at locations: Leave this set at “All locations” or choose the specific locations where this product will be sold.
Category: Choose the main revenue category for this product. If you don’t see one that fits, choose + Add a New Category and enter a new category name. If you do not make a selection, sales of this product will show up under the “Unassigned” category in reports. Note: You can use the category to organize your online store. 
Subcategory:  Add a subcategory to give more definition to your products. For example, Men’s, Women’s, or Kids’ could be subcategories within your Clothing category. 
Second category: Second categories aren’t dependent on the main category; they just add another searchable label to a product. For example, if you have a workout mat that’s made of recycled material, you could put it in the Equipment category and add Green Products as the second category. Sales and Holiday are other common second categories. You can enable second categories on the General Setup & Options screen.

Sell Online


Sell online: Check the box to allow clients to purchase this product in Consumer Mode.
Online Price: By default, the online sale price will match the in-store price. If you want to set a different online price, click this link, and then change the price in the field.

If you create a single product (i.e., a product that comes only in one size and color), this image will be linked to it automatically. Clients will see the image when they browse your products in the online store, and when they select the item for purchase.
If you add more than one size or color option at once (i.e., you create multiple variants), the image will be added to the first color and size combo you added—also known as the default product variant. This means that clients will see the image when they browse products in the online store. However, it won’t appear if clients select the item and then look at a variant other than the default. 


Note: If you want to add images to each product variant, or choose a new default product variant, you can. Just add the product group, and then find and edit the individual items.

Image  & Image hover text: Select Choose Image to upload. Clients will see this text when they hover over a product image after they click the Products tab in your online store. Enter a maximum of eighty characters.
Online product description: This is a longer, more detailed description that clients will see after they click on a product picture. Enter it into the text editor, and then format it using the tools at the top. Or, click the HTML button and use approved HTML tags. 
Shipping weight: Enter the item’s shipping weight. The minimum is 0.1 pounds or kilograms.
Online store inventory location: Choose the location that will ship the item to the client. If you do not make a choice, the system will default to the “E-Commerce Order Fulfillment Location” set in your General Setup & Options screen.

Check the box to "Update inventory location for all colors and sizes."


Click here to learn more about shipping products sold in your online store.

Color and Size 


Color: Choose the color, or colors, that this product comes in. If the right color isn’t available in the list, click + Add a new color and create it. You could even use this field to record scents, flavors, fabrics, etc.
Size: Choose the size, or sizes, that this product comes in. If the right size isn’t available in the list, click + Add a new size and create it. Remember, size isn’t limited to Small, Medium, and Large. You could even use this field to record product weights in pounds or kilograms, bottle sizes in ounces or milligrams, etc. 

Important notes:

As you add colors and sizes, the system creates one product variant for every possible size and color combination. If you end up with any variants that you don’t actually carry (maybe your blue shirts come in large and medium, but yellow shirts are available only in medium), you can discontinue them on the Manage Products screen.


When you add a group of products, the same price will apply to all size and color variants you add. You can edit this from Manage Products after
The product name applies to all size and color variants. So, if one variant must have its own name—Fundraiser T-shirt instead of Logo T-shirt, for example—you should add it as a separate item instead of a variant. 

Back to top
Inventory
 

Number in stock: Enter the number of units for sale at each location. If you added more than one color or size, you’ll need to add the number in stock later. It’s easiest to do this from the Inventory on Hand report, but you can also edit an individual variant and enter the number in stock there.
Manufacturer ID: Enter the number given to the product by its manufacturer. You can adjust your Retail Settings on the General Setup & Options screen so that the Manufacturer ID prints on sales receipts.
Barcode label text: By default, the barcode label will print the product name above the product color and size. To change this, click the “Edit” link to the right of either line and enter new text. You can also quickly print a barcode from this page by clicking Print Barcode. Note: The ability to print barcode will appear after the product has been added.
Purchase order options: These fields help you generate purchase orders automatically. Select the item’s supplier, and then fill in the maximum inventory level, reorder level, and lot size. Note: Lot size is the minimum number of units that can be ordered from the supplier. Your orders will always be a multiple of the lot size.

Membership Restrictions & Discounts


Restrict who can purchase this product? 

If anyone can buy it, leave this set at “No.”
If only those clients with certain memberships can buy it, select “Yes.” Then, click into the field to the right of “Who can purchase this?” and check the boxes next to any applicable memberships. 
Please note that if you restricted the purchase of this product to specific memberships, only those memberships will show up in this list.

Do any member discounts apply to this product?

If membership discounts do not apply, leave this set at “No.”
If certain membership discounts apply, select “Yes.” Then, click into the field to the right of “Who gets discounts on this?” and check the boxes next to any applicable memberships.

Product Commissions

Do staff members receive standard commission for this product?

Choose “Yes” if staff should receive commission for this product. You must also enter a standard commission rate on the staff member’s Staff/Hourly/Pay Rates screen.

If you want staff to earn the standard commission rate listed on the Staff/Hourly/Pay Rates screen, leave this one set at 0.00. If you want staff to earn additional commission for this product on top of the standard rate (or if the standard rate is set at 0.00, but you want staff to earn money for this sale), then enter that additional percentage rate or flat amount here. 



Choose “No” if staff do not receive commission for this product.

Do staff members receive promotional commission for this product? 


Choose “Yes” if staff should receive commission for this product. You must also enter a promotional commission rate on the staff member’s Staff/Hourly/Pay Rates screen. If you want staff to earn that promotional commission rate, leave this one set at 0.00. If you want staff to earn additional commission for this product on top of the promotional rate (or if the promotional rate is set at 0.00, but you want staff to earn money for this sale), then enter that additional percentage rate or flat amount here. 
Choose “No” if staff do not receive commission for this product


Note: If you choose to enter an amount in all commission rates, then you are indicating to the the system that the staff member will receive 4 different commissions for that one product

Additional Information
 

Product notes:

Enter notes about this product.
These are internal notes that will display only when you or your staff look up the product from the Retail screen. 

Product type: 

This is a costume: Check the box if you want to be able to rent or sell this product to clients when they check out of a class or an enrollment.  Click here to learn more about costumes and costume tracking.
This is a professional product: Check the box if you want to sell this item to your staff members only. When staff members buy professional products, the purchase price is deducted from their pay. Because of this, professional products cannot be sold online (and products that are sold online cannot be marked as professional products). If you want to make the same product available to your clients, create two separate items: one that is a professional product, and one that isn’t.

Quick cash product: 

Quick Cash products are items that you can sell quickly without having to navigate away from your class sign-in screen while you are enrolling clients. Click here to learn more.
Note: If you would like to use the Quick Cash option, the product must be added first.

Favorite products:

Use this feature if you sell certain items more often than others, and you want them to show up in a condensed Favorite Products menu on your Retail screen. Click here to learn more.
You’ll be able to skip the search and click just once to select it.
Note: If you would like to use the Favorite Products option, the product must be added first.

Leveraging technology to improve the wellness of the world
MINDBODY emerged from a simple idea: small business owners deserve the time to do what they love. From its first iteration, MINDBODY software has turned that vision into the technology that links tens of thousands of health, wellness, and beauty professionals to the millions of clients they serve.
Today, we’re the leading global online marketplace for wellness services — and like the speed of technology itself, we’re blazing ahead toward limitless possibilities.






Living by our core values
As a company, we strive to uphold the seven guiding principles that make us who we are and shape where we’re headed:



1 Purpose Driven

Recognizing that finding our purpose and meaning is the most important goal of life.
Achieving our highest potential through lives of integrity and accountability.
Conscious that MINDBODY is serving a global cause greater than ourselves.



2 Humble & Helpful

Proud of MINDBODY and humble about our own role, because MINDBODY’s success is the result of the entire team working together. 
Freely sharing expertise and knowledge throughout the company.
Openly hearing and respecting everyone’s ideas, as true inspiration may come from anyone. 



3 Caring & Happy

Caring equally for our clients, our vendors, our community, and each other. 
Striving for “Win-Win” relationships and avoiding “Win-Lose”.
Taking actions that lead to sustained happiness in ourselves and others.
Committed to the spirit of “Woo Hoo!,” remembering to have fun no matter how stressful the moment may be. 



4 Committed to Wellness: Mind, Body & Spirit

Embracing all dimensions of wellness: physical, intellectual, emotional, social, environmental, occupational, and spiritual.
Loving what we do and doing what we love.
Aware that we must take care of ourselves today, so that we may serve others tomorrow.
Striving for lives that balance responsibilities, relationships, recreation, and rest.

Competence – they know what they are doing.

Compassion – they care as much about others as they do about themselves.
Catalyst – they remove obstacles and make things happen. 
Courage – they speak truth to authority and take responsibility for the performance of their team.

Recognizing that each of us is completely free to wake up tomorrow and be just a little bit better.
Aware that MINDBODY must evolve to remain relevant and useful to the world.
Questioning the status quo, not accepting “...because it’s always been that way” as sufficient.

Chet Brandenburg
Chief Product Officer & Co-creator


 The history of MINDBODY is very closely tied to the efforts of Chet Brandenburg. A MINDBODY veteran, he joined the company in the summer of 2002, and has spent over a decade bringing new innovations to our software.
Like many in senior management, Chet began in tech support (back when there were only a handful of employees), learning the ins and outs of the software and fielding calls from clients in need of assistance. That experience compelled Chet to think big, to imagine what MINDBODY could be. And it still informs his decisions today. 
The defining project for Chet—and really, for MINDBODY—was his work on the web scheduler, which was the first in the industry to allow clients to sync online bookings with their installed desktop studio management software. Its instant success quickly led to a realization: why not bring all of MINDBODY’s capabilities online? Chet was the one to bring that idea to life, and it earned him the distinction of Co-Creator. He has been at the helm of the software’s continuous evolution ever since.
For Chet, exceptionally designed software walks the line between two equally important ideals—both naturally emerging from the fact that the user’s experience is the single most important factor. On one hand, we strive to be almost entirely transparent, a product that seamlessly assimilates into the client’s daily life as a business owner. At the same time, we strive to be a powerful addition to any business, providing capabilities that the same business owner never even imagined possible.
Chet holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Outside the office, he enjoys a good game of disc golf or magnetic darts, listening to the San Francisco Giants on the radio, and of course, watching the sun (and moon) set over the Pacific.
Chet is a CrossFit® Level 1 Trainer and regularly completes WODs at his local box.

During his stretch with Software Engineering, he was pivotal in transitioning the team from waterfall to agile scrum, and home-growing MINDBODY’s first mobile teams. By the time he left Product Development, he had grown the department from 5 engineers to around 150. In 2016, he shifted gears again to Vice President of Customer Service Operations, and in 2017 was promoted to Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Europe. In his role, Kevin oversees the marketing, sales and customer service teams in the MINDBODY UK offices.
He spends time outside of work with his wife and three children. 





Annie Woo
Senior Vice President of Customer Experience


 Annie is the Senior Vice President of Customer Experience. In summary, Annie does what she loves, loves what she does, and strives to do it all out of love.
Annie believes people are the most important assets in life- whether a client, employee, friend, or family. In her role at MINDBODY, Annie seeks ways to improve the level of service to clients, to employees and to better herself personally and professionally. She strives to do this by keeping a creative mind, an accurate view of herself (with help from those around her), and an understanding that we all have the power to choose from right and wrong, the power to respond correctly or incorrectly, and the power to change ourselves and situations.
Annie has a B.S. in General Engineering from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and loves to learn new things! She is an avid reader and particularly enjoys reading about other companies and their successes and challenges, then applying what she can to her work at MINDBODY. In her off time, she loves to run and is currently training for her second marathon with the SLO Road Runners Club. She also enjoys yoga, hiking with her husband and dog, and of course never missing her monthly facial at Savvi Skin & Body Studio (a MINDBODY client, of course) - it's the little things that keep her happy!

 





Amanda Patterson
Vice President of Marketing


 Amanda’s passion for marketing started early. She graduated summa cum laude with an English degree from Vanguard University in Southern California, and was hired by a large local company to write website and collateral copy while finishing her degree.  She quickly discovered her passion for harnessing the power of creativity and compelling communication to improve business performance. 
Her 13 years of experience includes both B2B and consumer advertising agency work for a wide array of industries, and in recent years, her focus has been software marketing. She’s managed effective, lead-generating programs via channels ranging from tradeshows to PPC, content marketing, email campaigns, online search, direct mail, video, webinars, PR and more. At MINDBODY, she drives strategy and execution for all marketing efforts, including branding, PR, product marketing and demand generation.
Amanda joined MINDBODY because the core values aligned so closely with her own. She loves working for a purpose-driven company that cares so deeply about its customers and employees. An Orange County native, she feels she has truly “escaped” the rat race and enjoys driving past vineyards and farms on her traffic-free commute to work. When she’s not working, she spends time with her husband and two daughters enjoying the local beaches, trails and concerts.   





Eric Steinbroner
Corporate Controller


  Eric Steinbroner is MINDBODY’s Corporate Controller and oversees all of the company’s accounting functions. 
Prior to MINDBODY, Eric held the role of Executive Director of Accounting at Maxim Integrated, a $2.5 billion public semiconductor company. Before working at Maxim Integrated, Eric was the Corporate Controller at Global Locate (acquired by Broadcom) and the Chief Financial Officer for Centerpoint Broadband Technologies. 
Eric holds a B.B.A. in Business Administration from the University of San Diego and an M.B.A. from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. 
In his spare time, Eric enjoys cooking, hiking and bike riding with his wife, as well as spending time with his daughter. 





Nate Starrett
Vice President of Growth


 As MINDBODY’s Vice President of Growth, Nate oversees the sourcing and management of strategic partnerships and new business opportunities.
Prior to joining MINDBODY, Nate held product and business development leadership roles at American Express and FiveStars, a loyalty and marketing automation startup servicing small businesses. He started his career in mergers and acquisitions and corporate restructuring, and later took on roles in strategy and business development at MTV Networks and Nickelodeon.
Nate received his degree from Princeton University where he studied economics and computer science.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        MINDBODY Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 12 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

                Your relationship with your clients is fundamental to your salon’s well being. MINDBODY’s web-based software gives you the tools to strengthen that relationship by giving your clients more flexibility and control over when and how they schedule appointments with you. All for about the price of a haircut! 

(Online Booking) 
Once you have it, you’ll never go back. Salon owners love online booking because it cuts down on no shows, increases revenue and eliminates phone tag. Clients love it because it makes the salon seem more professional and it accommodates their busy lifestyle. And don’t worry, you decide what appointments can be booked online. You can even use overlapping and double booking features to maximize your efficiency. 

(Time Savers)
Send appointment confirmations automatically via email or text, use the appointment finder feature to quickly see availability, post tasks for staff, and track stylist productivity.

(Revenue Generators) 
Combine integrated credit card processing with an online store to sell products, gift certificates, or take advantage of Rewards Points for loyal customers.

(Client Tracking Features) 
Segment and market to clients by type (e.g., by past services purchased, color formula, first-time client, age), track visit and payment history, and target big spenders.

(Sales & Marketing Reports)
Easily generate reports that show your client retention, sales by category, inventory (including shelf life), payroll and staff performance.

With MINDBODY’s suite of mobile applications, you can access your schedule from anywhere (and ditch that appointment book once and for all!). And since MINDBODY backs up your client and financial records each day, you’ll never have to worry about losing your data again. 

MINDBODY offers a special rate for single providers of just $29 a month! This deal is for those of you who run a “one man” or “one woman” show or only need one log-

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif., March 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MINDBODY (NASDAQ:   MB), the leading provider of cloud-based business management software for the wellness services industry, today announced the acquisition of Lymber Wellness, an early-stage tech company specializing in breakthrough yield management solutions for class and appointment based businesses.  








Built on MINDBODY's API platform, Lymber's technology enables business owners to set dynamic pricing parameters for class and appointment sessions.  The technology identifies open class and appointment inventory, and automatically adjusts session prices in real time to match supply and demand.  
Similar to yield management solutions found in the hospitality and travel industries, automated dynamic pricing enables wellness business owners to increase class and appointment sales without degrading their existing full-price paying customer base. The net effect is to enhance the business' revenue and profitability, while providing a broader audience of price sensitive wellness seekers with more affordable options.  
"The Lymber team has created a breakthrough technology addressing the holy grail of our industry – yield management," said Rick Stollmeyer, MINDBODY CEO and Co-founder. "By embedding this technology into our business software, consumer apps and the MINDBODY Network, we intend to enable our subscribers to better achieve their business goals by more effectively selling the millions of available classes and appointments they offer each day. This is a win-win for wellness business owners, practitioners and consumers everywhere, and a huge step forward in our mission of creating a global wellness services marketplace." 
Deep integration of Lymber's technology into the MINDBODY platform will begin immediately, with initial rollout expected in the second half of 2017.
About MINDBODY
MINDBODY (NASDAQ:    MB) is the leading provider of cloud-based business management software for the wellness services industry and a rapidly growing consumer brand. Over 60,000 local businesses and 329,000 wellness practitioners in over 130 countries and territories use MINDBODY's integrated software and payments platform to run, market and build their businesses. These practitioners provide a variety of wellness services to millions of consumers who use the MINDBODY platform to more easily evaluate, engage and transact with them to live healthier and happier lives.
