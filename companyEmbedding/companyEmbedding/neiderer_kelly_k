Education: Bachelor’s degree in economics, West Chester University
Primary job function: Oversee the bank’s 14-branch retail network while providing business development efforts, marketing and community involvement
Company description: Financial institution
Professional/community affiliations: e ARC of Cumberland and Perry Counties, president, board of directors; Cumberland County Affordable Housing Trust Fund Review Board; United Way of Carlisle, campaign cabinet, women’s leadership committee
Advice to pass along: I would encourage people to take advantage of opportunities presented to them not for the monetary gain, but for the learning process involved. I have found that if you take on additional responsibility for the love of learning something new or to challenge yourself, you are often rewarded in the end. Don’t expect it from the beginning!
Philosophy to live by: I have always loved the quote, “e harder I work, the luckier I get.” If you are truly enjoying what you are doing, it doesn’t feel like work. And, if you are good at it, you can experience success and it can be really fun. It’s the opposite of a vicious cycle!

Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
