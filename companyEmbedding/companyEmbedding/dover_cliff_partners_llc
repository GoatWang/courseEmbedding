Dover Partners | Dover Partners, a Registered Investment Advisor providing you disciplined investment management along with superior personal service.










































 


Welcome to Dover Partners, a Registered Investment Advisor providing you disciplined investment management along with superior personal service.
At our website, you’ll discover why an individually managed account with Dover offers so many advantages over a mutual fund or a money manager with whom you rarely have contact and read our market commentary in our newsletter – MarketLine.
Dover acts as your “compass”, guiding you through the investment markets toward your destination – the achievement of your investment goals.
Dover’s portfolio managers assume the daily management responsibilities of your account. Dover directs all trades on the market exchanges (e.g., NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.) through your designated broker. Your assets are custodied with that broker or can be held at a trust institution of your choice.
