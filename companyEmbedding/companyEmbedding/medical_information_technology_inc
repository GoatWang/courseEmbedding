Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and it's coming faster than we can imagine.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

“My entire world sort of clicked off. I didn't hear anything. I didn't see anything. And the only thing that I could think of was: I'm going to be dead in six months.”
This is James, looking back at 1988, the year the Dow closed above 2100, the Hubble Space Telescope was turned on, and James was diagnosed with HIV. “I'm a survivor of domestic violence, child molestation, depression,” he says with some pride. Even so, James knew he was about to enter the toughest fight of his life.
 After all, while HIV/AIDS awareness was still relatively new in 1988, James was seeing growing evidence of something much bigger. “First, there would be the fever and then there was the immense weight loss along with the Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions that would appear on the body,” James says. “A person would die and sometimes it would happen over a week.”
 James also explained that, since doctors had just begun researching HIV, there were almost no treatment options available. “The medication at the time was fairly nonexistent,” he recalls. Of the side effects, he says “the medication that they had at the time was even worse than the disease itself.”
 Thanks to years of investment and hard work by America’s biopharmaceutical companies, and other health care stakeholders, things have changed dramatically – and patients likes James, who can look back 29 years in near-disbelief, are proof.
 Brian, a researcher developing HIV/AIDS medications for nearly 20 years, is astounded by how far treatment has come. “The progress is actually quite miraculous,” he says. “In the early days, the goal was just keeping patients alive as long as possible.  Resistance was rampant and the regimens were not tolerable for many patients, but the alternative was death.  Frankly, both options were horrible.  Fast forward 30 years and now we have several one-pill, once-a-day treatment options for patients and their physicians to choose from.”  
 “They can live a normal life – a healthy, successful life.”
 Today, the outlook has never been more promising with more than 50 medicines and vaccines in development to treat, prevent, or help with the disease impact of HIV/AIDS.
 As Brian explains, treatment is no longer simply about survival, but enabling individuals to regain the quality of life they once had. “It is extremely motivating when we hear that a physician has a patient who is benefiting, that the new [medicines] we've brought forward have allowed the patient to regain weight, reverse the progression of their disease and essentially have a new life ahead of them.”
James understands the sentiment personally – and recognizes the network that helped him back. “My family, my doctors who were trying to make sure that I got the right medications to keep me going,” he says, “the programs that helped me find housing, sent me back to school, and helped me to better myself.” 
  “I have a great doctor. Most of doctors that I've had have been very good and this last one has been just fantastic.  We have gotten me to a point now where my numbers are just fantastic.”
 James’s experience motivated him to help others. He began volunteering at San Francisco City Hall by taking calls, helping around the office, and any job in between. This volunteer work led to HIV community activism – and a run for office. While he may not have won his election, James continued to give back to others, providing the same kind of support he is so thankful to have received. 
 James recently lost his partner to AIDS and his brother to cancer. Still, he knew he had to keep moving forward. 
 “The thing that gives me hope is just being able to wake up every day,” he says. “I will get back up.”
 Brian knows there’s still a long way to go. “There are people who are alive today because of the work that we do,” he acknowledges. “The work is often very quiet, very slow moving, very frustrating. But over time it has a major impact on thousands of people.”
And Brian sees even greater hope ahead.
“I don't take no for an answer,” he says. “The power of imagination and innovation is incredible and I see it every day in the eyes of my colleagues.”  “Science is real and the key to solving problems. We just need to find the right people to bring together, collaborate, and find a solution.”  
James is grateful for Brian’s – and many other researchers’ – tenacity. “I'm not sure how to explain it any better,” he says, “than it just makes me feel a little more normal.”

America’s biopharmaceutical companies are driving the future of medicine through bold advances in genomics, personalized medicine and immunotherapy. The new era of genomics provides better understanding of the genes that can cause certain diseases and equips researchers with the tools they need to tailor treatments like never before. Personalized medicines are at the center of this revolution, offering patients individualized therapies unique to each patient. Immunotherapy is transforming cancer care in new ways by harnessing the patient’s immune system to eliminate the disease or slow its growth. Together, these advancements are helping patients live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

Personalized Medicine
Personalized medicine — sometimes referred to as precision or individualized medicine —is an emerging field of medicine that uses diagnostic tools to identify specific biological markers, often genetic, to help assess which medical treatments and procedures will be best for each patient.
Personalized medicine may change the healthcare treatment landscape forever. Learn how

What works for one patient may not for another. See how researchers are at the forefront of treatment.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is an alternative to traditional treatments, like radiation or chemotherapy, which focus on killing cancer cells directly. With immunotherapy, the body’s own immune system is harnessed to eliminate cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread.
Immunotherapy offers millions of Americans a brighter future. Read more.
Innovation is our best weapon in the fight against cancer. Learn how.
Genomics
Genomics is the study of the genome – or the complete set of genes in the human body – and its function. Genomics provides us with the understanding of how different genes work together and play a role in health and disease.
Our genetics are involved in nearly every human ailment. Visit the National Human Genome Research Institute to learn more.

About MEDITECH
MEDITECH was founded on the idea of pushing healthcare forward. Now, here we are, doing it again.





Remember when EHRs were supposed to help you do more? We do. Healthcare IT is long overdue for genuine disruption and innovation, so MEDITECH is leading the charge by helping organizations reclaim their productivity and do more for their patients. Our solutions are empowering users all over the world to provide higher quality care, with greater efficiency, to more people, at a lower cost. And our customers are impacting their communities like never before. 
Working ahead of the curve is part of our identity. Founded in 1969, MEDITECH was one of the first software companies. MEDITECH’s chairman and founder Neil Pappalardo was a true pioneer, creating the industry’s first codified medical software language and building a company around the idea that computer systems could not only orchestrate care processes, but improve them. 
Today, we’re applying this guiding principle to a very different healthcare industry, with our most innovative product to date. MEDITECH’s mobile, patient-centered Web EHR was designed by physicians to exceed expectations and make patient care both easier and more efficient. You get the data you need, automatically pushed forward to you in easy-to-use, personalized workflows. Interoperability has always been at the heart of MEDITECH, and our dynamic solutions have a proven track record of seamlessly and securely sharing data across all care environments, for care coordination that tells the entire patient story. Whether your goals are clinical, analytical, or financial, MEDITECH will partner with you to make them happen.
After nearly five decades of continuous growth and innovation, MEDITECH has never been more energized. We’re building the next generation of EHR leaders - transform with us, and become one of them!

Ontario Hospitals Join Partnership to Deliver Seamless Patient Care with Meditech's Web Electronic Health Record
Mar 29 17
Located in Ontario, where 58% of hospitals are using MEDITECH's Electronic Health Record (EHR), Markham Stouffville Hospital (MSH), Southlake Regional Health Centre, and Stevenson Memorial Hospital announced a new partnership to integrate their Health Information System (HIS) and accelerate the adoption of MEDITECH's 6.1 Web EHR across all three organizations. Over the next year, Southlake and Stevenson will implement MEDITECH's latest platform which will be hosted by MSH, a current customer for over 25 years and first in Canada to implement MEDITECH's Web Ambulatory solution. The first of its kind since the start of the province's new eHealth 2.0 guidelines, a blueprint set forth to help healthcare organizations collaborate and exchange health information, the historic and strategic partnership will enable all three sites to improve the quality of care and patient safety with seamless care coordination across the continuum. In addition to improving patient care and the overall patient experience, the partnership will increase physician productivity with an integrated EHR across all points of care.

Medical Information Technology, Incorporated (Meditech), is a Massachusetts-based software and service company selling information systems for health care organizations. The privately-held company was founded around 1969 by A. Neil Pappalardo.[3]

History[edit]
In 1969, Antonino Neil Pappalardo began development of the programming language MIIS. This was one of several proprietary implementations of MUMPS, a programming language which at the time had not been standardized. MIIS users and developers later influenced efforts toward MUMPS standardization during the early 1970s; the MUMPS standard was complete by 1974 and approved by 1977. Between 1971 and 1979, Pappalardo developed various other systems, but those associated with integrated health care information remained his primary focus.[4]
In 1982, Meditech adopted the then-new MAGIC programming language for its health care information systems. In 1994, the company adopted client/server, a second software platform. While client/server utilized the same programming language, MAGIC runs all code on a central server, and clients are in effect dumb terminals. Client/server executes the code on a user's PC, although all code remained centralized. Client-server supports only Microsoft Windows-based operating systems. Meditech announced its version 6.0 in 2006.[5] In 2003, Howard Messing was named president, and in 2010 also became chief executive officer.[1] After peaking in 2012 at almost $580 million, revenues fell to about $476 million by 2015.[2]
Markets[edit]
With over 2,200 customers,[6] Meditech expanded from the United States and Canada into the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and several other communities, including the Spanish-speaking world.[7]
Meditech supplies Sheehan Medical in Ireland in their two hospitals, the Galway Clinic and Blackrock Clinic. For the Cork Medical Centre as third clinic was made a deal[8] to supply, but that clinic did not go completely into operation and closed. HMC in Lucan, Ireland (west of Dublin) and Beacon Hospital in South Dublin also had Meditech magic and C/S ITS since 2006.[citation needed]
Products and services[edit]
Meditech offers software for health care organizations of various types and sizes. Some of the software modules include: health information management, revenue cycle, scanning and archiving, scheduling and referral management, emergency department management, cost accounting, data repository, general accounting, human resource planning, supply chain management, operating room management, patient discharge instructions, long term care, behavioral health, and home health.[citation needed]
Some other developments include:

Working with partners and other companies to provide new technology in the areas of business continuance, identity management, and RFID
Incorporating evidence-based medicine into practice through integration with Zynx Health, Inc.
The development of an oncology product to manage the needs of oncology departments
Expanding medication management capabilities to include e-prescribing and medication reconciliation from DrFirst, Inc.
Offering standard interoperability suites to help customers transition to electronic health record standards

Partnerships[edit]
Meditech has one wholly owned subsidiary, LSS Data Systems, acquired in Spring 2011. At that time, Joanne Wood, Meditech took on the additional titles of president and chief operating officer (COO) of LSS Data Systems, overseeing all operations of the company. Meditech South Africa, founded in 1982, provides software and services to the health care industry in Africa and the Middle East. Other companies such as BridgeHead Software produce software designed to be used with Meditech software. On June 6, 2012, Meditech announced its partnership with Intelligent Medical Objects to provide mapping of clinician-friendly diagnosis and procedure terminologies to billing codes and medical concepts.[9]
Locations[edit]
Meditech owns eight facilities in eastern Massachusetts located in Westwood (two offices, three buildings), Norwood, Canton, Framingham, Fall River, Foxboro and Waltham, in the former Adobe office building. Meditech also has a facility in Atlanta, Georgia that was formerly Patient Care Technologies (PtCT).[10] It is chiefly responsible for the company's Home Care line of clinical and billing software.[11] Meditech also owns a building in Minnetonka, Minnesota.

History[edit]
In 1969, Antonino Neil Pappalardo began development of the programming language MIIS. This was one of several proprietary implementations of MUMPS, a programming language which at the time had not been standardized. MIIS users and developers later influenced efforts toward MUMPS standardization during the early 1970s; the MUMPS standard was complete by 1974 and approved by 1977. Between 1971 and 1979, Pappalardo developed various other systems, but those associated with integrated health care information remained his primary focus.[4]
In 1982, Meditech adopted the then-new MAGIC programming language for its health care information systems. In 1994, the company adopted client/server, a second software platform. While client/server utilized the same programming language, MAGIC runs all code on a central server, and clients are in effect dumb terminals. Client/server executes the code on a user's PC, although all code remained centralized. Client-server supports only Microsoft Windows-based operating systems. Meditech announced its version 6.0 in 2006.[5] In 2003, Howard Messing was named president, and in 2010 also became chief executive officer.[1] After peaking in 2012 at almost $580 million, revenues fell to about $476 million by 2015.[2]
Markets[edit]
With over 2,200 customers,[6] Meditech expanded from the United States and Canada into the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and several other communities, including the Spanish-speaking world.[7]
Meditech supplies Sheehan Medical in Ireland in their two hospitals, the Galway Clinic and Blackrock Clinic. For the Cork Medical Centre as third clinic was made a deal[8] to supply, but that clinic did not go completely into operation and closed. HMC in Lucan, Ireland (west of Dublin) and Beacon Hospital in South Dublin also had Meditech magic and C/S ITS since 2006.[citation needed]
Products and services[edit]
Meditech offers software for health care organizations of various types and sizes. Some of the software modules include: health information management, revenue cycle, scanning and archiving, scheduling and referral management, emergency department management, cost accounting, data repository, general accounting, human resource planning, supply chain management, operating room management, patient discharge instructions, long term care, behavioral health, and home health.[citation needed]
Some other developments include:

Working with partners and other companies to provide new technology in the areas of business continuance, identity management, and RFID
Incorporating evidence-based medicine into practice through integration with Zynx Health, Inc.
The development of an oncology product to manage the needs of oncology departments
Expanding medication management capabilities to include e-prescribing and medication reconciliation from DrFirst, Inc.
Offering standard interoperability suites to help customers transition to electronic health record standards

Partnerships[edit]
Meditech has one wholly owned subsidiary, LSS Data Systems, acquired in Spring 2011. At that time, Joanne Wood, Meditech took on the additional titles of president and chief operating officer (COO) of LSS Data Systems, overseeing all operations of the company. Meditech South Africa, founded in 1982, provides software and services to the health care industry in Africa and the Middle East. Other companies such as BridgeHead Software produce software designed to be used with Meditech software. On June 6, 2012, Meditech announced its partnership with Intelligent Medical Objects to provide mapping of clinician-friendly diagnosis and procedure terminologies to billing codes and medical concepts.[9]
Locations[edit]
Meditech owns eight facilities in eastern Massachusetts located in Westwood (two offices, three buildings), Norwood, Canton, Framingham, Fall River, Foxboro and Waltham, in the former Adobe office building. Meditech also has a facility in Atlanta, Georgia that was formerly Patient Care Technologies (PtCT).[10] It is chiefly responsible for the company's Home Care line of clinical and billing software.[11] Meditech also owns a building in Minnetonka, Minnesota.

Between 1971 and 1979, Pappalardo developed various other systems, but those associated with integrated health care information remained his primary focus.[4]
In 1982, Meditech adopted the then-new MAGIC programming language for its health care information systems. In 1994, the company adopted client/server, a second software platform. While client/server utilized the same programming language, MAGIC runs all code on a central server, and clients are in effect dumb terminals. Client/server executes the code on a user's PC, although all code remained centralized. Client-server supports only Microsoft Windows-based operating systems. Meditech announced its version 6.0 in 2006.[5] In 2003, Howard Messing was named president, and in 2010 also became chief executive officer.[1] After peaking in 2012 at almost $580 million, revenues fell to about $476 million by 2015.[2]
Markets[edit]
With over 2,200 customers,[6] Meditech expanded from the United States and Canada into the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and several other communities, including the Spanish-speaking world.[7]
Meditech supplies Sheehan Medical in Ireland in their two hospitals, the Galway Clinic and Blackrock Clinic. For the Cork Medical Centre as third clinic was made a deal[8] to supply, but that clinic did not go completely into operation and closed. HMC in Lucan, Ireland (west of Dublin) and Beacon Hospital in South Dublin also had Meditech magic and C/S ITS since 2006.[citation needed]
Products and services[edit]
Meditech offers software for health care organizations of various types and sizes. Some of the software modules include: health information management, revenue cycle, scanning and archiving, scheduling and referral management, emergency department management, cost accounting, data repository, general accounting, human resource planning, supply chain management, operating room management, patient discharge instructions, long term care, behavioral health, and home health.[citation needed]
Some other developments include:

Working with partners and other companies to provide new technology in the areas of business continuance, identity management, and RFID
Incorporating evidence-based medicine into practice through integration with Zynx Health, Inc.
The development of an oncology product to manage the needs of oncology departments
Expanding medication management capabilities to include e-prescribing and medication reconciliation from DrFirst, Inc.
Offering standard interoperability suites to help customers transition to electronic health record standards

Partnerships[edit]
Meditech has one wholly owned subsidiary, LSS Data Systems, acquired in Spring 2011. At that time, Joanne Wood, Meditech took on the additional titles of president and chief operating officer (COO) of LSS Data Systems, overseeing all operations of the company. Meditech South Africa, founded in 1982, provides software and services to the health care industry in Africa and the Middle East. Other companies such as BridgeHead Software produce software designed to be used with Meditech software. On June 6, 2012, Meditech announced its partnership with Intelligent Medical Objects to provide mapping of clinician-friendly diagnosis and procedure terminologies to billing codes and medical concepts.[9]
Locations[edit]
Meditech owns eight facilities in eastern Massachusetts located in Westwood (two offices, three buildings), Norwood, Canton, Framingham, Fall River, Foxboro and Waltham, in the former Adobe office building. Meditech also has a facility in Atlanta, Georgia that was formerly Patient Care Technologies (PtCT).[10] It is chiefly responsible for the company's Home Care line of clinical and billing software.[11] Meditech also owns a building in Minnetonka, Minnesota.

About MEDITECH
MEDITECH was founded on the idea of pushing healthcare forward. Now, here we are, doing it again.





Remember when EHRs were supposed to help you do more? We do. Healthcare IT is long overdue for genuine disruption and innovation, so MEDITECH is leading the charge by helping organizations reclaim their productivity and do more for their patients. Our solutions are empowering users all over the world to provide higher quality care, with greater efficiency, to more people, at a lower cost. And our customers are impacting their communities like never before. 
Working ahead of the curve is part of our identity. Founded in 1969, MEDITECH was one of the first software companies. MEDITECH’s chairman and founder Neil Pappalardo was a true pioneer, creating the industry’s first codified medical software language and building a company around the idea that computer systems could not only orchestrate care processes, but improve them. 
Today, we’re applying this guiding principle to a very different healthcare industry, with our most innovative product to date. MEDITECH’s mobile, patient-centered Web EHR was designed by physicians to exceed expectations and make patient care both easier and more efficient. You get the data you need, automatically pushed forward to you in easy-to-use, personalized workflows. Interoperability has always been at the heart of MEDITECH, and our dynamic solutions have a proven track record of seamlessly and securely sharing data across all care environments, for care coordination that tells the entire patient story. Whether your goals are clinical, analytical, or financial, MEDITECH will partner with you to make them happen.
After nearly five decades of continuous growth and innovation, MEDITECH has never been more energized. We’re building the next generation of EHR leaders - transform with us, and become one of them!

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."
For more information, download the PhRMA report.

    Tech-Infused Degree Programs In The Healthcare Field
  


Technology is becoming increasingly integrated into the healthcare industry, including medical records and health information systems. If you are interested in these essential healthcare industries, the programs in DeVry University’s College of Health Sciences can help prepare you for a variety of specializations. Get started in a tech-infused undergraduate certificate or bachelor’s degree program and earn a credential employers recognize.



    Take the TechPath
  


TechPath is our distinctive learning approach that grew out of the understanding that students need a different kind of education to prepare them for a world that’s tech-intense, constantly changing and connected as never before through the digital mesh – an ever-expanding dynamic interaction of smart machines, information, applications and human beings.
Every TechPath class you take, whether it’s in a business, health or tech program, revolves around a unique learning rubric developed at DeVry. We call it People-Process-Data-Devices or P2D2. You’ll gain real skills in collaboration, be able to adapt to new structures, create innovative ways of working, and be comfortable working with data and using a wide spectrum of tech-forward tools.
P2D2 is a key component of what makes TechPath a smart, new way of getting the knowledge you need to be ready to hit the ground running in the new way successful companies work today.
We’re proud to offer our TechPath Associate and Bachelor’s degree programs to new students at a 20% savings1. TechPath degree programs are noted below
1TechPath Associate and Bachelor’s degree programs are offered to new students at the cost of $487 per credit hour, which is 20% lower than our Non TechPath rate at $609. 20% savings is applicable to those who apply after 4/21/2017. New TechPath pricing savings do not apply to certificate programs.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
