  17 February 2017
  

  KRAKEN FPSO IN THE FIELD AND HOOKED UP
  
The Kraken Floating Production Storage and Offloading (‘FPSO’) vessel arrived at the field on Monday 13 February, anticipating good weather conditions. The hook up of the Submerged Turret Production (‘STP’) buoy mooring system, to the FPSO was completed on 15th February and a full rotation test performed so that the vessel is now on station and securely moored.  Commissioning work will continue on the topsides. Reconstruction of the turret area pipework and connection of the risers and umbilicals to the swivel stack is being undertaken followed by commissioning of the subsea infrastructure. Delivery of first oil in Q2 2017 is on track.

  Trading and Operations Update
  
Key 2016 highlights

Production averaged 39,751 Boepd in 2016, up 8.7% on 2015, with production in the UK North Sea up 11.3%
		This was EnQuest’s highest annual production since the company started in 2010. Final production was adversely affected by the shutdown period at the end of the year, where the maintenance shutdown of the Brent Pipeline System took over a week longer than was anticipated, with winter weather also hampering the work necessary to bring production fully back onstream.

Final reported 2016 unit opex is expected to be around the lower end of latest full year guidance range of $25/bbl to $27/bbl.
Reported 2016 cash capex is also expected to be around the lower end of the range, of $620 million to $670 million.
Net debt as at 31 December 2016 expected to be approximately $1.8 billion

Welcome to EnQuest


EnQuest is an oil and gas development and production company focused on turning opportunities into value by targeting maturing assets and undeveloped oil fields.

EnQuest is one of the largest UK independent oil producers in the UK North Sea and has a presence in Malaysia. EnQuest’s assets include producing oil fields, new developments and a portfolio of discoveries.


            Vision and Strategy
            






                  EnQuest’s 2016 Full Year Results 
                
EnQuest’ CEO Amjad Bseisu said:
“EnQuest further streamlined its operations in 2016 and delivered cash capital expenditure at $609 million and unit opex at $24.6/bbl, both well down on the previous year. Operationally EnQuest worked at high levels of production efficiency and safely delivered production averaging 39,751 Boepd, our highest annual production figure, supporting our financial objectives.

2016 saw the successful restructuring of our balance sheet, designed to strengthen EnQuest’s liquidity position, to reduce the level of its cash debt service obligations and to enable it to bring the Kraken development onstream.

In early 2017, EnQuest securely moored the Kraken FPSO on station in the North Sea, where commissioning work continues on the vessel and the subsea infrastructure; preparations for the handover to operations are ongoing. The project remains below budget and on track to deliver first oil in Q2 2017.

In early 2017, EnQuest and BP announced EnQuest’s proposed acquisition of interests in the Magnus oil field and the Sullom Voe oil terminal. The innovative structure of the acquisition recognises EnQuest’s differential strength in managing maturing assets and infrastructure, whilst generating significant potential for future growth.

EnQuest’s combination of integrated technical capabilities and high levels of production efficiency and cost control ideally positions us to create value from assets such as Magnus and from the substantial potential in our existing asset portfolio, with 215 MMboe of net 2P reserves at the end of 2016. Our journey to optimise and increase production and reduce costs continues, with average 2017 production anticipated to be between 45,000 Boepd and 51,000 Boepd. Following delivery of Kraken, EnQuest will begin moving from a period of heavy capital investment into one focused on cash generation and deleveraging the balance sheet.”
