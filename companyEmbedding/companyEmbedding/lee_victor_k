I had previous exams in Toronto, negative each of 3 times. Dr Lee denounced the professionalism of the clinic I was seen at and argued every way about my need for a scope now vs another 5 years. He then decided he needed to examine me including a rectal exam. I am an RN and am aware of one informs and gets consent from a patient. This happened so fast that I felt somewhat violated. He has limited people skills at the very leastWas this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted June 6, 2016 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeHonest, caring and took time to explain everything to us more than once..highly recommend himWas this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted May 25, 2016 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeSo, no one likes Dr. Victor Lee, what a surprise. I started working for him 1 day, he was so abrupt and rude to me (Considering it was my first day and wasn't used to his way of doing things) ripped a strip off me for something in front of a patient. I quit the first day. No one should be treated like dirt by anyone.Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted January 15, 2016 5Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeToday I had the second colonoscopy ten years apart with Dr. Lee. I requested him for the following reasons. He is very thorough and does not rush through the procedure. He makes you very comfortable with the drug to relax you during it so that you might not even remember it . There was no pain involved and he told me that if I am experiencing any discomfort to tell him and he will administer a bit more. I found him to be professional but kind and I would not hesitate to recommend him. He tells you the results right away so you are not worried waiting for a report. His staff is excellent - very kind with a good sense of humour. Wendy , his nurse today was just great with me, funny and sweet.
Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted October 27, 2015 5Staff 5Punctuality 4Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Lee is an excellent practitioner and has always been forthright, thoughtful and caring of me. I have had 4 colonoscopies with him with polyps removed. At one point he ordered additional blood tests because of his concern for my weight loss. I agree he appears arrogant but I believe it is a cultural thing rather than unconcern.Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted November 29, 2013 5Staff 2Punctuality 1Helpfulness 2KnowledgeWas this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted March 17, 2012 4Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeAFter being referred, I checked here and was worried because of some of the negative comments & ratings. A neighbour, who had already seen this MD, assured me as they had had a positive experience. I found the MD thorough and knowledgeable and forthcoming in sharing his views, answering all questions. His style and humour may be of a different culture and age but shouldn't be an issue. The office and MD also happily answered a question by phone I had well after being "discharged".Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted November 8, 2011 2Staff 3Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeLost a very close family member a few years ago who went in for a mere ERCP (outpatient visit)and passed away aprox 10 hrs later.

Michael R. Hsing





	It started with a vision. Michael Hsing, pioneering engineer and CEO, founded Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (MPS) in 1997 with the belief that an entire power system could be integrated onto a single chip, which would greatly enhance system performance and eliminate most of the iterative design efforts. Prior to founding MPS, Michael was a Senior Silicon Technology Developer at several analog IC companies, where he developed and patented key technologies, which set new standards in the Power Electronics industry. 

	In order to execute his vision, he created groundbreaking enabling technologies using a fully integrated power process in a CMOS foundry. In May of 1998, a single-chip solution for powering CCFL backlighting in Notebooks was launched. The product substantially reduced the total solution cost and design complexity, as well as significantly improved power conversion. As a result, this product stormed the laptop market by taking 40% market share in 2003 and 80% in 2005. 

	Immediately the company diversified into DC/DC products, which again reset the industry standard. In November 2004, Michael took the company IPO. Since then, the company has grown to 6 product lines with more than 1000 products and thousands of customers. In 2013, Michael fulfilled his vision: MPS introduced an industry first – a cost effective Monolithic Power Module that truly integrates an entire power system onto a single package, entering the industry into a new era of power management.

	Today with 18 years of nonstop innovation, MPS is pushing technology to an unprecedented level: 1200 volts and 80A current with the 5th generation of process technology, continuing to lead the power semiconductor industry.

	Whether he is flying planes, white water kayaking, or mountain biking, Michael is constantly creating cutting-edge solutions to improve the quality of life with green, easy-to-use power solutions. Under his passionate and creative leadership, MPS has succeeded not only in developing a monolithic power module that truly integrates an entire power system in a single package, but also it continues to defy industry expectations with its patented groundbreaking technologies.
