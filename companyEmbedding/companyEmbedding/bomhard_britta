Excellent book to give to your people, 9 Feb. 2014


By Britta Bomhard


This review is from: Financial Times Guides Management: How to be a Manager Who Makes a Difference and Gets Results (Financial Times Series) (Paperback)

This is a very rounded and practical book for anyone who is in junior or middle management. I found key concepts explained so well that I actually gave copies of the book to the junior people in my company. A fantastic simple guide to managment.
