Shelley Simpson
AUSTRALIA (1963)


Based in Sydney, Australian designer Shelley Simpson studied music and dramatic arts before finding herself seated at the pottery wheel in her roommate’s backyard. It took her two years to muster the courage to approach the pottery shed, but when she finally did, she threw a pot on her first try. Two years later, in 1994, a shortage of sophisticated dinnerware suitable for cosmopolitan settings but simple enough for everyday use prompted Simpson to found Mud Australia. She enlisted friends in Sydney’s restaurant industry to test her pieces, ensuring that the thicknesses and curves were as pleasing to use as they were to the eye.

Rather than seek out a manufacturer, Simpson differentiated her product from already-available mass-produced ceramics by starting her own factory. Although doing so is labor intensive, she believes her decision to handcraft each piece “accentuates the handmade nature of the items by leaving unique ‘fingerprints’ that don’t compromise the functionality but allow the user an emotional connection that machine-made ceramic can’t replicate.” Today, Simpson continues to expand her porcelain dinnerware by adding new shapes to the collection and experimenting with glazing techniques.

                            Helping others maximize their potential through better health and nutrition is my focus. Trained as an attorney licensed in Michigan and Florida, and having worked in health policy in DC I have the coaching and teaching skills necessary to help others resolve issues related to their physical and financial well being.  Early in my career, I represented people living with AIDS/HIV and worked with interdisciplinary teams of doctors and nurses on behalf of newborns with health issues. Later, as the Assistant Dean of Students and Detroit College of law (Now Michigan State University) I taught law and worked with students to help them develop the skills necessary to pursue their career goals.  Now as an independent distributor with NSA, the maker of JuicePlus I share simple solutions for living a healthy and happy lifestyle.  I enjoy teaching, training, coaching, energizing, and encouraging people to follow their dreams and live full, active and financially flexible lives

Major shout out to John Buscarello!  I thought we were going to hear about how to get Broadway tickets. He did share some great websites for obtaining tickets - some at deep discounts - but it was way more than that.  I love his passion for the theater and now I have some good tips to use when looking for tickets for myself or my friends and family visiting the City. Thanks John!

The Gotham Book Club is another thing that makes Gotham a special way to network.  I love to read and I read a lot.  But I tend to stay in the same few genres.  With the book club I try new things. "The Art Forger" is a book I would never have noticed. I read and enjoyed the story and learning a little bit about the art world.  I am looking forward to what reading adventure I can enjoy with the next selection.

Love the theater but find getting tickets a challenge?  Not sure how to get the best seats, the best dates or the best price! Not sure whether to buy online or at the theater!  What about those special deals or online discounts!   Join the Commerce Group for lunch at the Friars on October 1st @12:30 and get the inside answers to these questions and more from John Buscarello who will share his knowledge and experience  as a theater maven. 

This is a perfect time as the new season is getting underway.Ride the circuit, invite guests, bring your business cards and your questions!

The Gotham High Line tour was , once again, amazing. Joshua Zinder, our own award winning architect,  stays on top of every change to the High Line no matter how large or small. We get the inside skinny on the history and even a little insight into the future of the Park.  Thank you Josh for another wonderful NYC experience and thanks to this of you who came out to walk the High Line with us. We had a great turnout for this amazing perk for members of Gotham City Networking.

On June 2nd from 6:30- 9:30pm Gotham’s Lynn Chiavaro is co-chairing an amazing event - the MC will be NFL Reporter Kimberly Jones - at the City Winery on Varick Street in NYC.  PowerPlay offers girls one-of-a-kind opportunities to gain the skills and confidence for successful adulthood. Through an amazing combination of year-round sports, academic enrichment and life skills, our girls get to play hard and dream big. I know there is a lot you could consider in your charitable giving--I'm inspired by this organization and if you have any questions before you commit, please let me know.
 
Each year, PowerPlay hosts this SuperSTARS Celebration Reception to recognize our Leadership Academy graduates and honor SuperSTAR Role Models, adults whose leadership qualities champion the values that we seek to instill in our girls.  This is a great opportunity for us to step up and support Lynn and the girls.  You can find out more and sign up at the PowerPlay NYC site  http://powerplaynyc.mydagsite.com  or you can get in touch with Lynn at   lynn.chiavaro@nm.com

    Sonia and I sometimes drink first and toast second - so what? Here's to Gotham! And I have no idea why this is upside down.

Shelley Simpson + mud australia – Design*Sponge

Shelley Simpson + mud australia 
by
Grace Bonney


















I love mud australia’s tableware.  I love Shelley Simpson.  I love Shelley’s story.  Usually I save such strong emotion for my little dog Crash!, but when I think about how much I really like tableware, serving dishes, having parties, having people over to eat (on nice dishes), no other tableware evokes the same reaction for me that mud australia’s does.  And I see a lot of products in a year!
mud’s porcelain range offers almost every color you could ask for from soft pastels to vibrant red and orange (perhaps lilac/lavender is missing?) and the shapes are elegant enough for ‘important’ dining, but simple enough for every day.  They are oven safe, dishwasher safe, and handmade (including Shelley’s own two hands– she’s in the studio every day).  What else could you want out of your tableware?  To see the complete range, visit mud’s website.
For Shelley’s story, how she started mud, how she gets her products into new markets, and all sorts of other fun things, keep checking Three Layer Cake, where a full interview with her will be posted soon…  (Below:  Shelley in production)

If you could do it all over again, the one thing you wouldn’t change.Trick question? I donâ€™t think I would/wouldnâ€™t change anything. The whole process is what it isâ€¦ 
The best business advice you’ve been given.In any day, do the hardest thing you have to do first. 
As a mentor, the most important concept you’d want a mentee to take away from your relationship.Work ethic and personal courage.   And the knowledge that design goes nowhere without marketing, unfortunately. 
In a design studio, money invested in people is always well spent…However, work environment is really important, too.   We just moved into a new space where weâ€™ve finally merged studio, factory, office and showroom and Iâ€™m loving it!
