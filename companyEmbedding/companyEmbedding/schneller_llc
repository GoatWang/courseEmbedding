WHAT SETS US APART...


It all dates back to 1964, with founder John Schneller's development of a vinyl-coated fiberglass cloth that would provide an attractive and durable headliner for the fabled Douglas DC3 aircraft. It was the beginning of transforming interior aircraft environments and later passenger rail cars, architectural offices and displays.
In response to growing customer needs for interiors that were more attractive, comfortable and compliant with safety regulations, Schneller developed a world class portfolio of engineered decorative materials.


Those materials include: film laminates, reinforced laminates, thermoplastic sheets, utility flooring and an ever-expanding array of custom applications.
Today, virtually all the world's airlines and major aircraft and rail car manufacturers are introducing revolutionary new design solutions with Schneller as their creative partner. From design to product development, to manufacturing, installation and technical service, Schneller is the one resource that surrounds you with solutions. That's what sets us apart.

Airbus A350 Canvas Catalog




Schneller was selected as the exclusive supplier of the Canvas Catalog decorative laminates for the A350 XWB aircraft cabin interiors in 2012. For 2 years, Schneller worked closely with Airbus and its Risk Sharing Partners on the development and validation of materials to support the launch of the innovative new wide-body aircraft.  Utilizing cutting edge technology, Schneller was able to provide original new designs and textures in the most cost effective, high yield format available. Our unique ability to provide 60 inch wide, continuous roll product with our proven texture retention technology was a key factor in being selected as the decorative laminate provider.  This capability not only provided the critical width needed for the panels on the A350 but did so in the most cost effective format.
You must be logged into the website to access the A350 Canvas Catalog.

Offered in unlimited colors, patterns, and textures, Indura GTform is ideal for high yield, and low-cost continuous roll form applications.
