Company Summary





Globalization and immigration are having profound impact on enterprises for which the need for cross-cultural communication is at its highest point in history. As a result, today’s companies require capabilities for communicating with the vast number of people with limited English proficiency (LEP). Limited supply of interpreters and other issues have given rise to huge demand for real-time video-based remote interpreting, enabled by iCONNECT.
