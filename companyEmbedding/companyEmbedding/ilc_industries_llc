ILC INDUSTRIES, LLC Revenue and Financial Data

   You'd be forgiven if you thought that ILC Industries stood for I Love Companies. ILC is a holding company for a group of businesses. Its mainstay subsidiary, Data Device Corp. (DDC), makes and sells microelectronic components used in data conversion and networking products (cards, software, and fiber channel switches) by the defense, space, and aerospace industries. Its oldest subsidiary, ILC Dover, was spun-off in 2011, cutting ILC's ties to engineering and making softgoods for industrial, military, and space applications (blimps, spacesuits, and chemical-biological warfare protection gear). ILC customers have included Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and NASA. Buyout firm Behrman Capital owns a majority stake in ILC.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
