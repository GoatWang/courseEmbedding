Summit Street Capital Management










 

















A disciplined focus on value is at the core of everything we do





Welcome to Summit Street Capital Management
Summit Street is an SEC registered investment advisor. We invest in shares of public companies that have strong competitive positions and sound balance sheets when they are available at deep discounts to our estimate of their true value.
We believe superior investment performance is best achieved through a disciplined commitment to our value philosophy combined with a long-term investment horizon. We deliberately construct our portfolios to capture the opportunities created by investor over-reactions and market dislocations.
Summit Street was founded in 2009. The firm is owned and run by founding partners Arthur Williams, Jennifer Wallace and Judd Kahn who together have more than 50 years of investing and business management experience.
info@ssvfunds.com


Successful investing boils down to answering two basic questions: “Is this a good business?” and “Is it trading at a discount to what it’s worth?
With our concentrated portfolios, we believe our clients get the equity returns they require without exposing themselves to owning the whole market.
