America’s Most Admired Lawbreaker: Chapter 10 - The Huffington PostAmerica’s Most Admired LawbreakerHuffington Post Highline Letter From the Editors Credits       Chess, At$1,000An Hour Chapter 10 By Steven BrillWhat Happened in the Previous ChapterThe New CEOJ&J Press Release re: Gorsky's PromotionFeb. 21, 2012On February 21, 2012, five weeks after Johnson & Johnson paid $158 million to Texas and made Allen Jones a multimillionaire, the company announced that the board had appointed Alex Gorsky to succeed William Weldon as the new chief executive officer. The press release noted that Gorsky had begun at J&J in 1988 as a salesman for Janssen and then worked his way up to president of the unit. Although he had left in 2004 to run rival Novartis’ North American division, he had returned to the fold in 2008 to assume a variety of top positions, including vice chairman. The announcement quoted Weldon, the outgoing CEO, describing the “rigorous, thorough, and formal multi-year” board selection process.Like all Johnson & Johnson CEOs before him, Alex Gorsky came from within the organization.Board Members Who Appointed GorskyI tried to reach each member of the J&J board that chose Gorsky to ask how Gorsky’s involvement in the Risperdal marketing and sales campaigns had factored into his or her decision. Of the 12—who include the former president of the University of Michigan and five retired Fortune 500 CEOs—I was able to reach eight by phone or email either directly or through their designated assistants. All declined comment on that question, and despite being independent board members, technically unaffiliated with the company, all referred me to J&J’s public relations department.But Michael Johns, a board member, physician and former chancellor of Emory, did say, “As I understand it, Risperdal was a drug that treats symptoms of a disease, not any disease. So maybe it’s the system that’s screwed up.” That rationale aligns with how the company’s lawyers, according to one of them, saw the cases—that the government’s off-label argument puts the company in an impossible position when it comes to drugs like Risperdal. “These diseases,” the lawyer explained, “don’t have a blood test or anything else; they are all about symptoms. And many different types of people can have those symptoms, which our drug does a great job of alleviating.”Gorsky was described in the Wall Street Journal story covering his promotion as a “former Army ranger, who had “edged out fellow Vice Chairman Sheri McCoy, 53, for the top spot. Both inside and outside the company,” the Journal reported, “Ms. McCoy was thought to have an edge over Mr. Gorsky in the horse race to become the 126-year-old company’s ninth leader.”The story’s concluding sentence quoted a health industry consultant saying he “thinks the board chose Mr. Gorsky partly because ‘he has been responsible for the largest acquisition in the history of J&J,’ the Synthes deal.”J&J Synthes Press ReleaseApril 27, 2011Synthes is a large manufacturer of surgical equipment and supplies whose $19.3 billion buy-out by Johnson & Johnson was announced in 2011. As Gorsky prepared to take over as CEO, the deal, which he had helped steer, was about to close.For aficionados of illegal off-label sales, Synthes was a special company.Synthes AccusationsJune 16, 2009 (p. 1-2)In 2009, a Pennsylvania-based subsidiary of Synthes was accused by federal prosecutors of illegally marketing and aiding in the misuse of “trauma products to treat damaged human bone” during surgery.The subsidiary, called Norian, and Synthes itself, were charged with a total of 52 felonies and 44 misdemeanors, all involving an alleged conspiracy to encourage doctors to conduct unauthorized clinical trials of the company’s products on patients being treated for compression fractures of the spine, a painful condition suffered mostly by the elderly.“Before the marketing program began,” federal prosecutors in Philadelphia alleged, “pilot studies showed the company that the bone cement reacted chemically with human blood in a test tube to cause blood clots. The research also showed, in a pig, that such … clots became lodged in the lungs.”The company had not stopped marketing the product “until after a third patient had died on the operating table,” the government charged, adding that “after the death of the third patient in January 2004, Norian and Synthes did not recall the [bone cement] from the market—which would have required them to disclose details of the three deaths to the FDA. … Instead, the company compounded their crimes by carrying out a cover-up in which they lied to the FDA during an official inspection in May and June 2004.”In short, according to the government, the new J&J acquisition had, prior to being acquired by J&J, illegally experimented on humans and killed three of them in the process, then lied to the FDA about it.What would become known as the bone cement case would end up with four Norian executives pleading guilty and serving five to nine months in prison, and Synthes agreeing in 2010 to pay a $23 million fine.As follow-on suits by patients or the heirs of dead patients then worked their way through the courts, the case became the subject of a riveting September 18, 2012 story in Fortune Magazine. The most telling item in Mina Kimes’ report might have been this: When Johnson & Johnson’s purchase of Synthes was announced a few months after the highly publicized guilty pleas and fines, the Johnson & Johnson press release, Kimes wrote, cited “Synthes’s ‘culture’ and ‘values’ as evidence of its appeal, even as former Synthes executives awaited sentencing on charges of grievous conduct.”Tossing Gorsky a Hand GrenadeAlex Gorsky was scheduled to become Johnson & Johnson’s chief executive on April 26, 2012. Fifteen days before, an Arkansas judge ordered the company to pay $1.1 billion for illegal Risperdal marketing in his state. (The verdict would be thrown out two years later by the state Supreme Court, which ruled that the Arkansas false claims act did not apply to false statements about prescription drugs.)Brief re: Gorsky InvolvementApril 11, 2012 (p. 7-8)But the Arkansas case wasn’t the J&J lawyers’ top concern that day. They were more worried, according to one company lawyer, about a brief that Boston federal prosecutors had just filed with a judge contesting the company’s refusal to make Alex Gorsky available for a deposition in its civil suit over the Risperdal/Omnicare nursing home case.In March, the prosecutors handling the Omnicare case had sent Johnson & Johnson’s lawyers a letter matter-of-factly asking for dates when Gorsky could be deposed. The prosecutors knew that they were putting J&J and its new boss in a tight spot.These kinds of chess plays are why lawyers on both sides of the highest stakes, white-collar litigation love the game.Gorsky’s lawyers could make him available and expose him to a barrage of questions under oath about the Omnicare deal and about the alleged off-label promotion of Risperdal to the elderly. Or they could refuse to make him available by arguing that his testimony was not necessary; federal rules give corporations the right to refuse to make a top executive available if the judge believes the purpose of deposing him or her is harassment rather than a quest for real information. However, arguing that Gorsky testimony wasn’t relevant because he did not have direct knowledge opened the door for the government to go to the judge with a brief spelling out of why his testimony was relevant—in other words, all the details of his hands-on involvement.These kinds of chess plays are why lawyers on both sides of the highest stakes, white collar litigation love the game. The prosecutors, who are typically lawyers with elite credentials, get to match moves with some of the most highly paid private-sector litigators anywhere. Like friends engaged in a fierce tennis match, there’s a collegiality binding both sides.In fact, they often switch sides; by now, Michael Loucks, who had led the Boston office’s drug company investigations, had left to become a partner handling corporate securities fraud and white collar criminal defense in the Boston office of Skadden, Arps, one of the country’s top firms.Gorsky and the J&J lawyers chose the lesser of the bad choices. “Mr. Gorsky had no reasonable connection to the subject matter of the Government’s complaint and was not involved in the facts underlying this case,” they wrote back on March 26, explaining why the new CEO shouldn’t have to sit for the deposition.The government responded to this invitation to spell out Gorsky’s “reasonable connection” and his “involvement in the facts” underlying the charges that Omnicare had already settled. Its brief to the judge was not made part of the public record. But it was there for all the Johnson & Johnson lawyers, and their client, to read—a hand grenade whose pin could be pulled with a leak to the press, or, if it came to that, by cutting and pasting much of it into an amended suit naming the boss.The Rise of Alex GorskyThis was the first time any government document had tied Alex Gorsky to the Risperdal scandal. It did so in unrelenting detail, with each point followed by a reference to a document that the government had obtained through subpoenas to Johnson & Johnson and Janssen:“From October 1998 to October 2001, Mr. Gorsky was Janssen’s Vice President of Marketing, and from October 2001 to early 2003 he was President of Janssen.”“During all of that time he was responsible for selling Risperdal, a drug whose biggest customer was Omnicare.”“He regularly received Monthly Reports on J&J’s Long Term Care Group, including reports which commented on Omnicare’s efforts to promote prescribing of Risperdal and other J&J products.”“He met repeatedly with senior Omnicare executives to discuss those efforts.” (The meeting dates were then listed.)As the government’s brief went on, the description of Gorsky’s involvement got more specific, as if the prosecutors meant to tighten the vise on the incoming CEO of the Credo company.“In advance of the May 1, 2000, meeting with Omnicare, for example, he received information that Risperdal’s 53.3% market share of Omnicare ‘represents Omnicare’s ability in persuading physicians to write Risperdal in the areas of Behavioral Disturbances associated with Dementia.’” (This was a quote from a document, referenced as an exhibit to the brief.)“As Vice President of Marketing and having previously worked closely with J&J’s Medical Development group (which was responsible for developing clinical trial data for Risperdal), he was in a position to know why J&J chose not to inform Omnicare (or members of Jansen’s own sales staff) that, in January 1999, the Food & Drug Administration (‘FDA’) had warned J&J that marketing Risperdal as safe and effective in the elderly would be false and misleading.”“Likewise, he was in a position to know why J&J did not disclose to Omnicare executives that, in 1999, the FDA had rejected J&J’s attempt to get approval to market Risperdal for treatment of psychotic and behavioral disturbances in dementia (by far the most prevalent use of Risperdal in Omnicare-served nursing facilities) because of inadequate safety data.”“Mr. Gorsky was also involved in approving payments [for data] to Omnicare under the 2000 Consulting and Services Agreement.”In short, the reason Johnson & Johnson’s incoming CEO was needed to testify didn’t have to do with his current position. It was all about the positions he had held and been promoted from—the positions where he had demonstrated that he had the right stuff to lead the entire company, according to the board that had just anointed him. It was simply a matter of getting a company marketing manager, who happened to have become the CEO, to explain his conduct on the way up the ladder.“We wanted to deal with everything at once,” recalls one Johnson & Johnson lawyer. “Just pay and be done with it all. And so did the government.”It seemed like a strong argument. But the government actually didn’t care much about getting Gorsky’s deposition. This was all part of the chess game, which by the early half of 2012 was being played across a national map. Boston had its Risperdal/Omnicare investigation. And Philadelphia had its qui tam suits brought by Vicki Starr (and, by now, four others in a group Sheller was leading) involving the broader off-label marketing allegations. There was even a smaller-bore federal investigation in San Francisco related to the marketing of another Johnson & Johnson product, the heart failure drug Natrecor.Boston Risperdal Omnicare ComplaintPhiladelphia Qui Tam ComplaintSan Francisco Complaint“We wanted to deal with everything at once,” recalls one Johnson & Johnson lawyer. “Just pay and be done with it all. And so did the government.”For that reason, and because of the stakes and the big-name company involved, the Justice Department in Washington was now calling the shots. The man in charge was Tony West, who had been head of the Justice Department’s civil division, but had since been promoted to associate attorney general.Assistant Attorney General Tony West projected a “sense of disgust” at the conduct of drug companies. Getty ImagesAlthough West had been a corporate lawyer in San Francisco, one line in his resume suggested that he was a bit more of a free spirit than other colleagues who rotate from corporate defense practices to the government and back again. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, while working at his San Francisco firm, he had vigorously defended, pro bono, John Walker Lindh, the alleged “American Taliban,” who had been captured and tortured by American soldiers in Afghanistan. In fact, West’s work for Lindh, which included charging the Justice Department with a variety of abuses, had almost sidetracked his Senate confirmation when President Obama appointed him to the Justice Department in 2009.“Tony was determined to make a mark with these drug cases,” says one defense lawyer. “He really projected a sense of disgust with the whole thing.”West allowed the talks in Philadelphia to proceed. That was the place where the offenses likely to yield the most money (through the qui tam false claims) were being negotiated. But he kept close tabs on their progress and made it clear that he would be involved in the final deal.Negotiations between the two sides in Philadelphia, which had begun in 2011, had proceeded into spring 2012 according to what had become something of a standard script. It was a script that had been followed in deals for off-label offenses that had been completed, with West signing off, in Philadelphia with Eli Lilly (in 2009), AstraZeneca (in 2010) and Novartis (also in 2010); and in Boston with Pfizer (in 2009) and Merck (in 2011). In fact, for the drug companies, it was sometimes the same lawyers representing different clients who were called in to lead the negotiations.“We knew how this was going to be played,” recalls a defense lawyer who had been involved in one of those earlier deals and who was also involved in the J&J negotiations. “We also knew that these guys had a habit of wanting to raise the bar, so that if Lilly had paid $800 million and the guys they competed with in the Boston office had gotten $2.3 billion from Pfizer [although that involved allegations of four illegally marketed drugs], they were going to come after us hard.”As was generally true in those cases, initially, the lawyers for the drug companies—one or two partners and a few lower-level associates each from as many as three different law firms hired by the company—would troop into a conference room at the prosecutor’s office and protest to Philadelphia U.S. Attorney Zane Memeger’s assistants that their client had done nothing wrong. The meeting might last an hour or two, during which the government would flash hints of its evidence and the defense lawyers would say something about how flimsy it all sounded.The defense lawyers’ bills, at hourly rates of $400 to $1,000, totaled 7 to 12 thousand dollars an hour.Sometimes Memeger would drop in to ask how things were going. It would all be friendly.Memeger, an affable lawyer with a sterling resume, was part of the club. He had won awards as a government prosecutor before becoming a partner and white collar crime specialist at one of Philadelphia’s largest corporate firms. He had then been appointed U.S. attorney by Obama in 2010, allowing him to catch the tail end of the office’s high profile drug cases.Months would go by as the government continued to examine documents and talk to witnesses, including some who would be put before a grand jury because this was proceeding as a criminal case, as well as a civil case potentially involving damages for false claims.Then the defense lawyers would return and allow as how maybe some salespeople had gone off the reservation and done things they shouldn’t have done. The prosecutors would chuckle or feign outrage, and talk vaguely (or not so vaguely if the other side had managed to tempt them) about the evidence showing that higher-ups were involved and that this was all part of a company plan. Charlene Fullmer, one of the assistant U.S. Attorneys leading the investigation, would occasionally mention an especially bad piece of evidence, according to one lawyer. One of her favorites was the fact that an entire Risperdal ElderCare sales unit had been set up.“There were innumerable meetings,” Memeger recalls. “They’d present. We’d present. Eventually, we would narrow the issues.”Holding No One ResponsibleActually, the issues were only one issue: money.Both sides had long since agreed in principle on a single misdemeanor criminal plea by the corporation—not by any individual.The only question was how much all of this was going to cost Johnson & Johnson in civil damages and criminal fines.Technically, the amount of the civil penalties was supposed to be calibrated to the amount of actual false claims—the amount paid by Medicare, veterans or others receiving federal health benefits resulting from the impermissible off-label selling. “We’d come in with economic analyses showing it was fifty or a hundred or two hundred million or whatever, but we knew they’d ignore that,” says one of the drug company negotiators. “They’d counter with three billion or something, maybe five. But they would never really tell us how they got there, because they had no idea. For them, it was easy.”There was also the question of how the money would be split between a civil damages payment (for those false claims) and a criminal fine for the misdemeanor. In most situations civil payments are tax deductible; criminal fines are not. At a corporate tax rate of roughly 30 percent, that was a big difference; a lawyer who can move $100 million from the fine column to the civil column saves his client $30 million, making his $1,000 hourly rate negligible.Meantime, according to another lawyer, the Johnson & Johnson executives, Gorsky included, were of two minds. They wanted to put this behind them, and the money, however off the charts by any rational standard, would not hurt the company’s financials too much or its standing on Wall Street. In fact, settling for almost any amount would help on Wall Street by resolving uncertainty. On the other hand, says this lawyer, “They were angry about the charges, because they thought they had a First Amendment right to sell products that they believed in, and they knew they were a good company.”That single misdemeanor plea was also a standard part of the script. It was the deal all the big companies had made in their off-label cases, and, according to lawyers on both sides, nothing different was ever contemplated by either side in this case. This was despite the fact that the prosecutors in the negotiations with defense lawyers argued that the drug Johnson & Johnson sold was particularly powerful and that the off-label use was intended for the most vulnerable patients, the elderly and children.‘What Can You Prove to a Jury?’Misbranding Definition; Misdemeanor and Felony Penalties(p. 42, 49)An individual is guilty of a misdemeanor, technically known as misbranding, if he or she causes an FDA-approved drug to be put into interstate commerce with the intention of having it be sold off-label. With all of the business plans and marketing campaigns targeted at children and the elderly that could be linked to Gorsky, that was something for which the prosecutors seemed to have convincing evidence.The same offense is a felony if it is done with the intent to defraud. That’s a harder case to prove when it comes to the Janssen executives, such as Gorsky, although prosecutors might have been able to argue that this happened with the promotions to the elderly, especially through Omnicare, and with the company’s repeated efforts to get approval from the FDA to market to children at the same time that they were actually marketing to children.“It’s really a matter of the quality of the evidence you have, and what you think you can prove to a jury,” Memeger told me, when asked about why no effort was made to name individuals.“The statute of limitations also comes into play,” he added, referring to a federal criminal law that generally does not allow prosecutions to be initiated more than five years after the crime was allegedly committed. Had the government’s investigation not dragged out over so many years, that would not have been an issue, given that the prosecutors had begun their investigations in 2003 and the company’s allegedly illegal marketing had continued at least through 2004. And it would not have been an issue at all if the FDA had been monitoring the same prescription data that drug companies routinely purchase and if it had seen that within a year of Risperdal’s launch a high percentage of prescriptions were being written by doctors, such as pediatricians and those working at nursing homes, who treated patients in the prohibited markets.However, as soon as the government and Johnson & Johnson began talks, the government asked that the company waive its statute of limitation protections for the corporation—in effect freezing the date for any criminal prosecution of the company as if it were occurring the day of the first discussions. Corporations almost always agree to the waiver, and J&J did in this case. Otherwise, the government lawyers told the J&J team, they might be forced to bring a criminal case immediately without considering all that the other side might offer in terms of countervailing evidence or settlement concessions. Waiving the statute of limitations for a corporation was also part of the dance that eased some of the rough edges off of the adversary process so that a deal could be struck.As for the executives, “no lawyer is ever going to waive the statute for an individual,” Memeger explains. “The corporation, yes. But not for a person.”Too Big to NailAs with not holding any individual responsible, a misdemeanor plea for the corporation had also become almost automatic. This was true even if evidence proving intent to defraud was strong.The government’s explanation for this is a variation on the “too big to jail” rationale used to explain why errant banks were treated leniently following the 2009 financial collapse. Under the law, any health care company convicted of, or pleading to, a felony is automatically disqualified from selling any of its products to Medicare. That could effectively put the company out of business, because Medicare is the country’s dominant health care buyer. Misdemeanors do not carry that penalty.“These companies make hundreds of great products and have tens of thousands of people working for them,” is how one prosecutor put it. “Do you really want to shut them down and eliminate those products?”Per the usual playbook, the company would plead to one misdemeanor. No individual executive would be charged.In fact, you don’t have to. Under the same law, waivers of the disqualification provision are allowed so that Medicare can buy drugs or other products it needs, or so that the units of a company not involved in the wrongdoing can be walled off.“Who wants to take a chance on a waiver?” was how one government lawyer responded when I raised that with him. “These companies would never agree to that.”Vicki Starr Goes House-HuntingBy March 2012, according to lawyers on both sides, the prosecutors in Philadelphia and the Johnson & Johnson lawyers thought they had reached the broad outlines of a deal. J&J would pay fines and civil damages totaling about $1.3 billion. The numbers were still in flux and might go up or down a bit, but that was the target everyone was focused on.And, per the usual playbook, the company would plead guilty to one misdemeanor.No individual executive would be charged.Ultimately the private qui tam lawyers led by Sheller had to approve any settlement, or their clients could withdraw and fight on. The discussions were now far enough long that the government lawyers thought it necessary at least to give their ostensible co-counsel the courtesy of sharing the $1.3 billion figure. The mix would be something like $300 million for the fine and $1 billion for the civil award under the False Claims Act.“In April, I got the call,” Starr recalls. “The lawyers weren’t specific and said nothing was certain, but that I should think about being in a home in Washington [state] by the end of June.”Starr started house-hunting. But then news began circulating in the financial press in May that the talks were, as the Wall Street Journal put it, “on hold.” The lawyers assured her, again, that nothing was certain but that the reason for the reported glitch was that the government wanted even more money. Everything seemed to be on track.But, in fact, the process was becoming bogged down.Memeger was not going to be allowed to close the deal by himself. Tony West had decided it was time to roll up all three prospective deals—the big case in Philadelphia, the not-as-big Omnicare case in Boston and the relatively small case in San Francisco—into one big deal. Besides, West didn’t think Memeger had been tough enough in negotiating his piece. In fact, he wanted the sum of each of the three pieces to be larger than their parts.“What happened was that ultimately our friends at Main Justice stepped in and wanted more money for a global resolution,” explains Memeger, referring to his bosses in Washington.According to one lawyer involved in the bargaining, West (who is now general counsel of PepsiCo and would not discuss any aspect of his work in his old job) wanted $3 billion to make all of J&J’s troubles go away.The talks were moved mostly to a conference room at Department of Justice headquarters, where the same routine of seemingly endless back and forth presentations would start to play out.It now looked like Vicki Starr might have plenty of time to get used to her new home before she realized any tax savings from it.There was, however, one development, in spring 2012, that was a surprise: Starr’s former boss, Alex Gorsky, was about to be forced to testify under oath about how he had marketed Risperdal.‘I Don’t Remember the Specific Exercise’“I may remember from time to time during the course of the year [that] their management may provide the opportunity for additional investment in different areas of the business that was called a ‘money on the table’ exercise. But I don’t remember the specific exercise.”That was how Alex Gorsky answered a question about the “money on the table” reference in his email that precipitated the decision by his company to fund Dr. Joseph Biederman’s Center for Children and Adolescent Bi-Polar Disorders.His reference to “their management” was, of course, a reference to himself. At Janssen during that time, he was management.Gorsky DepositionMay 26, 2012 (p. 23-24, 50, 156-159, 237-238)On May 26, 2012, Gorsky, supported by four lawyers, was forced to sit for a deposition at the Philadelphia office of one of Johnson & Johnson’s law firms. But this was not the session that had been demanded by the government. Federal prosecutors had suspended that fight while they tried to iron out a settlement.Instead, his questioner was a lawyer in Sheller’s firm. The deposition was carried out in advance of the personal injury cases Sheller had brought on behalf of boys with gynecomastia, which were scheduled to begin later in 2012. This was Gorsky’s opportunity to tell his and Johnson & Johnson’s side of the story and explain all of those seemingly damning internal documents.Most of his answers were similar to what he had to say about “money on the table.” He either only vaguely remembered, or didn’t remember at all. For example:His favorite adjective was “appropriate.” For example:Question:[About the FDA’s warning that marketing Risperdal as safe andeffective in the elderly was “false and misleading”] Do you agree with that statement, Mr. Gorsky?Gorsky:I think throughout the time we felt that we were promoting Risperdal in an appropriate manner based upon the label at the time.Question:Well, if Johnson & Johnson marketed Risperdal to the children and adolescent market when Risperdal was not approved for a pediatric use by the FDA, would that be illegal?Gorsky:Based on my knowledge and my review of the information, I don’t believe that we—that is, Johnson & Johnson or Janssen—marketed the product in an inappropriate manner.Question:If Johnson & Johnson promoted Risperdal to the children and adolescent market when it was not approved for any pediatric use by the FDA, would you consider that a breach of the Johnson & Johnson Credo?Gorsky:I would consider inappropriate promotion of our products not consistent with the Johnson & Johnson Credo. But I’m not aware, other than very unique or specific situations that can occur in a large organization, I’m not aware of any concerted effort on the part of Janssen or Johnson & Johnson to promote the drug inappropriately.Question:Mr. Gorsky, did Janssen or Johnson & Johnson market or promote Risperdal to the child and adolescent market before Risperdal was approved or indicated by the FDA for pediatric use?Gorsky:Based upon my recollection and the documents I’ve seen, we promoted it in an appropriate manner.According to Gorsky, the various business plans he had been in charge of were not what they appeared to be. For example:Question:[Referring to one of the internal Janssen business plans] The next sentence says, “Although the RISPERDAL Base business is rooted in the Schizophrenia marketplace, another fast-growing portion of this market is in children and adolescents.” Did I read that right?Gorsky:Yes, you did.Question:And because of the growth of the child and adolescent antipsychotic market … did Johnson & Johnson begin to approach this market in a different way in or around 2001?Gorsky:Not that I’m aware of, other than we were continuing to pursue the clinical development program of the product in that area.Question:Turn to the top of the next page, please. … Down below it says, “RISPERDAL use in the child/adolescent population is exploding.” But in this time frame, 2001/2002, Risperdal is not indicated by the FDA for any pediatric use, is it?Gorsky:Again, we did not have the specific indication, as we discussed earlier, until 2006. I don’t remember exactly what the labeling said regarding use in children, but as I discussed earlier, there was a significant—there appeared to be a significant increase in the recognition of this condition in children and adolescents during this time … which was substantiated by data and its occurrence. And physicians have an opportunity to use a treatment that they perceive to be appropriate and effective in a particular patient population, and that’s clearly what we were seeing happening in this area.Question:Look down at the heading that says “Key Base Business Goals and Objectives.” Do you see that?Gorsky:Yes.Question:And the fifth of the Key Base Business Goals says, “Grow and protect share in child/adolescents.” Is that right?Gorsky:Yes, that’s correct.Question:My question is, how can Johnson & Johnson grow a share in a child and adolescent market when the drug isn’t even indicated for use in the child and adolescent market?Gorsky:Well, my interpretation of that is, this is in fact a marketing plan, not a selling plan. As a marketing plan, its intent is to cover a wide range of activities regarding the development as well as the promotion of Risperdal. That being said, all of our actual promotion to the physicians would follow what was outlined in our package insert and all of our materials went through a significant review process, and that’s the way our representatives were trained. And in an area such as this, this is a marketer versus a sales representative, their language.It added up to an effective tap dance that must have made his lawyers proud. But Gorsky’s testimony was not nearly as important to his company as finishing the deal with federal prosecutors.Feb. 21, 2012The J&J board, citing a “rigorous, thorough, and...The J&J board, citing a “rigorous, thorough, and formal multi-year” selection process, announces that Alex Gorsky has been chosen to become the company’s next chief executive.April 2012Two weeks before Gorsky is to become CEO...Two weeks before Gorsky is to become CEO, government prosecutors file a stinging memo demanding that he be forced to sit for a deposition.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Alex Gorsky, the newly named chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, shares a crucial biographical detail with William C. Weldon, the man he is succeeding. Both got their starts as pharmaceutical sales representatives, a notoriously grueling job that — because it demands stamina, charisma and a near devotion to making the sale — has become a crucible for future drug company executives in recent years.Also like Mr. Weldon, Mr. Gorsky is a Johnson & Johnson insider who served during one of the most tumultuous periods in the company’s history, when there were manufacturing lapses, government inquiries and recalls affecting popular over-the-counter consumer products.Mr. Gorsky served as head of the company’s medical device and diagnostics group at the same time that critical decisions were made about an artificial hip implant that has failed in thousands of patients, crippling some of them.Their shared history has led some to speculate that not much will change when Mr. Gorsky takes over in April.

“As somebody steeped in J.& J. culture, I would be very surprised to see big changes,” said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at Miller Tabak & Company who owns the stock. And even if Mr. Gorsky plans such changes, “It’s so big that it would take a very long time to move a big battleship like that.” Continue reading the main story

Mr. Gorsky declined to be interviewed. But in a statement on Tuesday, he said: “I’m honored that the board has placed such confidence in me, and I am also aware of the serious responsibilities that come with this office. Johnson & Johnson is a strong and extraordinary company with enormous opportunities to advance health and well being.”Mr. Gorsky, who is 51, fits the mold of someone who once “carried the bag” — industry slang for working as a sales representative. He is known as a polished speaker and an intense yet likable manager who is a quick study when it comes to learning new topics. That skill may serve him well at Johnson & Johnson, which sells things as diverse as baby shampoo, Band-Aids and antipsychotic drugs.“It’s the school of hard knocks,” said Nona Footz, who leads the health care practice at RSR Partners, an executive search firm. “You’re out there. You’re knocking on doors. You have very tough sales targets. You get a lot of exposure. You learn the business and then you’re promoted.”But the ethos of the sales representative may not be what Johnson & Johnson needs right now, said Erik Gordon, who teaches business at the University of Michigan. “That culture was very much the Weldon culture writ large — we will make our numbers for the analysts, period,” he said. “And if that means we have to cut costs on things that affect quality, then by God, we’re going to make those numbers.”By contrast, Mr. Gorsky’s main competitor for the chief executive job, Sheri S. McCoy, got her start at the company as a scientist in research and development.As is typical for rising stars at large corporations, Mr. Gorsky held many jobs after starting with the company in 1988, including running Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical businesses in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

In 2004, Mr. Gorsky left the company to head the North American pharmaceuticals business at Novartis. He returned to Johnson & Johnson in 2008. In September 2009, he took over the medical device and diagnostic group.It was a particularly tumultuous time for the company’s orthopedic unit, DePuy. Just a few weeks earlier, the Food and Drug Administration refused to let it sell one of its hip implants in this country because it had failed to meet regulatory standards. Meanwhile, complaints about that device and a companion version that was used in this country were mounting from doctors here and regulators abroad.

It is not known what role, if any, Mr. Gorsky played in DePuy’s decision not to disclose the F.D.A. action. But at the start of his tenure, DePuy decided to phase out the implants marketed as the ASR and shut a factory in England that made them.DePuy recalled the ASR in August 2010, amid rising failure rates. But before then, DePuy executives repeatedly insisted that the ASR was safe. And Mr. Gorsky stated publicly in 2010 that the company had decided to drop it for business reasons, not safety concerns.In a recently disclosed DePuy e-mail, a top executive wrote that the F.D.A. had refused to approve the device after seeing data showing it failing prematurely in significant numbers during company studies in patients.Johnson & Johnson did not answer questions about whether Mr. Gorsky had known about the problems associated with the artificial hips. But his promotion to chief executive surprised Dr. Robert Hauser, a cardiologist and an advocate for improved safety of medical devices.“I mean, come on. What is this?” Dr. Hauser said. “He’s been overseeing one of the major J.& J. quality issues and the board of J.& J. sees fit to name him the new C.E.O.”Others dismissed the issue, saying it was unclear what knowledge Mr. Gorsky had had of the trouble with the hips. “It came out under his watch, but it had nothing to do with his watch,” said Lewis C. Pell, a medical devices entrepreneur who does business with the company and knows Mr. Gorsky.Mr. Funtleyder, the portfolio manager, said Mr. Gorsky would face three challenges: fixing the problems at the plants that make over-the-counter products, ensuring that there are lucrative prescription drugs in development and addressing a global dip in consumer use of medical services. The company also must close its deal to buy Synthes, a medical device maker. Mr. Gorsky negotiated the acquisition.Despite its troubles, the company has several new prescription drugs that have been selling well, including Zytiga, a prostate cancer drug. The company earned $218 million, or 8 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 2011, an 89 percent drop from $1.9 billion, or 70 cents, a year earlier. The drop was largely caused by a $3 billion charge related to the recall of its artificial hips.

This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.... thinking about how many products and Johnson Johnson for use before you even when out the door this morning so ... no ... thanks ... my eyes with a ... aam that's good ... the the the ... the uh seventy billion dollars and I'm going to intern fifty different company is ... under your gigantic we of course ... we know baby powder but they're also in biologics hands ... every aspect of cancer immunology medical devices consumer products ... and cost only investing in acquiring and getting into all kinds of new and carry ... a areas ... just talking about even begun as we know this a big election coming up ... what the first question they will be is ... the health law ... it's been one the most controversial was ever passed ... can you have one can say this is can throw down the aisle and officials can fix it ... defended and do some things like go after the drug companies prices can now ... what's your view about how ... the law has done so far and what can be done in the future ... again ... a health plan for this country works sure ... offers all just a real pleasure to be here and a ... got some always humble ... it's in deal represent Johnson Johnson ... and a hundred and thirty thousand people plus around the world to ... really do get up every day trying to make sure the people excuse me a live longer ... healthier and happier lives ... and I'm really happy you got appeasing those products the small ... village ... with most people ... recognize is for our consumer products that ... meet its two foot pole when I say Johnson's baby shampoo ... coming and you can actually smell ... right now ... that's a pretty good brand ... I needed it touches you in a very special way and that something to remind you of the baby ... and put you in a good place in ... and we realize that there is an incredible responsibility that goes along with that kind of bringing ... in a in this country level around the world something we take seriously ... but so ... health care ... it wasn't for him where's it going to go ... clearly we're in a very political season right now ... and I guess my fame with his regardless of who gets elected ... of ... healthcare is going in the aviary dominant force and dynamic in issue ... the likely the next several generations are going to be dealing with not only in this country but around the world ... and ... you know why is that well ... I think first of all ... represents about ... eighteen percent of the economy here in United States ... about three trillion dollars ... I think secondly it's incredibly complex ... if you think about the system ... between the hospitals the providers insurance companies ... the product makers ... it's a it's a complex ... law urge ... very complicated system ... and a certain him as soon as you pull on one spraying it affects another it's a bit of a Rubik's cube ... and you know what may seem obvious looking at it from one thousand ... always isn't so obvious when you look at it from the other ... hence it makes it challenging ... in the third and third part of it but I'd ... I think is probably most important Laurie you and I were talking off right when you get to be about our age we start talking about well what the hell plays with me and says ... oh yes this ... year we were ... come is are eating about that ... healthcare is really personal ... the thing about those times when ... you have a health care issue ... the first thing that happens is the physician talks to when you're going ... what he she just ... it's complicated signs ... you're you're confused ... you can even pronounce the words many times ... in the next thing is you're thinking about the system in your going okay do I see a specialist who was determined to go to hospital the APUs who's gonna pay for this is a good one being reimbursed ... and so at a very personal level it touches it's ... insight between those three things together ... it helps explain why ... Healthcare such ... you know seminal issue ... right now and when you combine that frankly ... with the macro forces that we see around the world ... Asian populations in the good news is we're living longer ... much of the specimens country because the health care that we get ... the challenges ... a living patient ... a healthy one will consume or the economy than one that's not what it's ... and ... they knew you go from there and you look at technology with all the other factors ... to go outside the United States is to see developing economies continuing to improve ... as you move up the economic ladder as you can shelter as if it was the next thing you're likely to consume one to consume more ... often ... and so ... wherever I go around the world and I'd talk with leaders ... this issue of ... we're going to have this increasing demand ... that is just a secular trend ... and how are we going to pay for How one picture quality ... we can win and make sure that you know frankly in some cases to maintain stability in society ... by doing a thoughtful way ... I wish I could do no wave along ... with the right so my I think it's ... it's going to require a lot to like you get back to the end of the Affordable Care Act what's taking place in the United States ... but I think it's ... there's some good news ... the good news is is that we got about twenty five million people here in United States are now covered ... by insurance were covered ... a couple years ago ... when Timmy was untenable think between forty or forty five million people in this country ... really didn't have access to ensure its we have that now ... about eleven million exchanges the fifty million more the expansion of Medicaid ... that's very good ... I think the other dynamic is over the last two years was a little bit of tempering of inflation around health care ... what we can attribute that to be difficult to say I think it's a combination of forces I think employers ... than paying a lot more attention people of the more thoughtful ... we can talk about copays to talk about a lot of other things that the economy ... the wee seen some tempering which has a huge impact on the ... twenty percent ... in the end of the purse of unemployed in this country is gone from about seventeen percent to ten percent ... we're still not all the way it is still more work to do obviously got work to do an exchange is to ensure competition ... the challenge that we have going for is what we increase access ... now we have the hard work ahead as we address ... this balance here ... and costs ... and we haven't ... they haven't faced in new a lot of those issues ... and many of those things were further down the road in the law ... we're starting to get there now ... you were coming up with some models of moving from a fee for service system ... the really disconnect utilization of services ... with because ... towards more of an outcomes based approach ... or a episode of care based approach ... which I think is much much better way to do it but we're early days ... we're starting to take in a much more holistic approach that ... you know with patient care around infections of the house in a hospital treatment ... longer term bungling of different issues ... in so doing that in a very thoughtful way that openly keeps the pace in the center ... that helps ensure we balance ... you care quality cost ... it sustains the innovation that we're going to need to take on future issues ... and health care ... that's the hard work ... I still think that sprouts ... of course that got the population itself when you make the numbers about Americans know maybe thirty or more adults are obese ... I think the one in four has two or more chronic diseases ... we see the data that says we spend more ... or less health and other countries although ... as you mentioned before we were not Finland where everybody's got the same issues the same genes ... but um ... how do you go about than addressing the other side of the equation which is ... Americans who aren't ... doing well this convention on me taking care of themselves on eating right exercising ... here you ... corporations have a big role to play in this and you know this is interesting things going on around that area ... I feel Johnson Johnson itself has done a lot there in this companies all getting together to try to figure out ... I get emails for our company you know ... here's something you can do to be well and I don't know how many people pay attention to those that ... I mean get people to ... you get ... a partnership between eighty employ years and people ... to start into these areas where you're not can it ... Italy's Klingon to quit smoking or canning exercise ... yet what the guide ... again I don't think there's a silver bullet he is going to take a combination of approaches I think ... it's other things I mentioned earlier so we go to from fee for service to so to care outcomes Bespoke's starts there ... are we better integrate some of the knowledge that we have systems ... you are still incredibly disconnected in many ways yes we have electronic medical records ... were starting to make some of those connections but they that offers great promise ... I think the third biggest area that is exactly what he mentioned ... how we prevent these things from happening for sports ... how we address and ... phone in ... but what is ... the best parts of my job ... is that ... I get to go into these rooms filled with remarkable scientists ... they can be talking about the next BT can do better ... in lymphoma ... I can walk in the next room has a bunch of engineers talking about ... you know we're going to do it all TROW ... Philharmonic ... um ... surgical instruments ... that can cut Colletti late this kind of rate and reduce morbidity XPO's surgery I don't the next room I see Jennifer Anniston commercial Neutrogena ... so you really get says see ... the full stop them ... but if I if you get the scientists are um I think what motivates them most is ... how we ... can we stop these things from ever happening because ... with no harm ... done psychologists will tell you ... is that ... no by the time we can detect to work today ... it shows up when CTU an MRI ... the cells of probably replicated somewhere between thirty or forty cents ... if they replicate about five or six more times in public stage ... and what can we get to that that that that that the town ... and and to do that ... you know what what can we learn from whether it's genomics with its protein with its DNA RNA ... how can we ... heal go from the class will test all the state today is members and how can we have similar scans as relates to things like apology Alzheimer's another ... were we can intervene much earlier in the process ... and stop this cascade ... combined with the Cascade ... it existing cancer ... it exists in all its I it's ... you know we've invested literally billions of dollars on some of the things we find ... is that we're probably ... intervening in the eight am ... it's far too late ... to really be able to make a difference ... and in here to look I think some of that is less ... about seventy five percent ... of any of the chronic conditions ... the old smoothly and that taking most of its things like cardiovascular disease ... things like smoking ... and ... diabetes ... are significantly influenced by what we do every day ... what we are in our caloric intake our activity level ... in a do we choose to smoke or do we not smile ... we manage stress ... and yet something more paying a lot of attention to were one of you know we are early company to invest in health and wellness I can tell it's a tough business ... there's a diet ... in just about every corner ... in doing it in a database meaningful way in changing behavior is not easy you probably know that with the families and spouses ... my answer was that ... and ... but that it's ... it's got to be part of that and look we ... we've been doing a Johnson Johnson for about forty years Jim Bourke you know Sobel presence is back said you know ... before them the biggest health care company ... we should be the obvious health care ... and ... we've we've invested a lot of things ranging from the food we offer our cafeteria it's ... the things that we put in the gyms that we put ... more more we're finding is will we designed the workplace ... to encourage people to stand up and was standing just walk around more ... little things ... how do we make sure that they've got access ... to health and wellness programs now online all the time given ... to the absence of seven metre that you can do ... so there's no excuse ... and that the canal so we make sure someone is that when people have reported that in their family to ... the franking Amanda Jane ... you know the psychological part of that as well as the physical as we know that those two are tied together ... an old one we believe that look if you create a healthy environment ... if somebody can show up at work ... in their best a divinity the US ... and and ... and that's in your ... the long-term impact you can have on how they can end up on the company is directly correlated ... but they help them Wellness prevention intervention is gonna be a big part ... of the ... long term solution for help ... well of course a bow to invest a lot in research and all the currency were talking about that it's a lot of money to find something if you're in the extinction Oscar is now ... to get back to the convention for states to take a lot of money ... and of course the drug companies are ... less recognized public release for the money to spend in the search than they are ... the prices they charge so ... all of ... the coverage in all of the media tends to be ... about ... prices and obviously the latest flap was about the epi pen ... how do you address that issue about ... to get the public to understand ... how is it possible to ... do the research you have to do and yet ... charge prices that are not going to cause ... such consternation ... in the southern ranges many people coming in ... below a dead ... I would start this doesn't look this is a challenging issue ... and I think it's representative and an act of a lot of things that we face in health care ... because of the complexity ... in other issues but let me maybe provide a little bit perspective ... I think it really starts ... with its belief in innovation ... and um ... again I think we are at a remarkable time in history ... why think over the next ten to fifteen years we could see some of the most promising unremarkable breakthroughs ... that we seen over the last generation ... think of Moore's law applied to health care and outsourcing ... and again when you're able to complying ... so many different approaches ... to really understand the real because the underlying have the physiology ... of things like all signers cancer ... cardiovascular disease ... the schools that we have now to do that pretty remarkable ... look ... the reason we have those ... a significant portion is because ... we get the government the NIH investing about thirty billion dollars ... we've got the bio pharmaceutical industry investing about fifty billion dollars ... we've been doing that over a long period of time ... and ... were ... were reading some of the fruits of that as we speak we have a discussion later about is that the right amount is wrong about that ... I think that's really important we ... we continue to think about the role of innovation I think the ... the second part of it is ... yet to come step back look of the system and all ... again ... every time it's a Rubik's cube every time you turn one side has an impact on the other ... and ... you what you see in the in United States for example ... is about ... fourteen percent of the three trillion dollars that we invest in healthcare ... is spent on farms ... that's not retell sites will is the hospitals ... and and that certainly is an important point about fifty percent is in healthcare it isn't the provider side there's a lot of other buckets ... that particular area tends to get a lot the spotlight ... if you look at the data over the last twenty or thirty years ... we would suggest is ... the increase in longevity ... and it makes life expectancy ... and the reason why several years ago ... two or three patients with cancer diagnosed with cancer I would die within five years and that's when ... think of it not what ... I was just graduating college HIV was hitting the news ... if you are diagnosed with HIV ... in the early eighties ... you would probably have about five years ... today ... it takes about two years of the average life expectancy ... if you follow the right drug rich ... that's pretty remarkable we have changed a death sentence to chronic disease alike ... now we still have more work to do ... or working hard on vaccines a lot of other things ... but ... I think it's important ... that to recognize that there's been a tremendous amount of benefit and ... unfortunately that's really difficult to communicate times to sell my ... and again in in in in again ... if philosophically emotionally ... someone doesn't agree ... with a market based approach to health care we can go through the facts and figures all day long that ... it will be as meaningful ... I think it all to lead the way that we think about it is look it's most important prices the weekend ... and we bring products to market the really make a difference for patients ... and because we don't continue to innovate ... I can say right now we don't come up with the way to take on all sides going forward ... even if we hold health care costs where they are today ... we are going to be really challenge this generation is its stock ... so we we wanted it that we wanna ... we wanna make sure that we've got something that's the next pandemic trouble for see ... where ... did that ... pray well I mean that again is this idea that ... as we spending all this money and yours for existing diseases you keep getting this rising tide of ... infectious diseases in emerging infections in re emerging infectious diseases you have ... I think that antibiotic resistance and people were opposed to vaccines ... so ... you work with them that know obviously we have the Gates Foundation president here last and to talk about some the things are going to ... mess with mosquitoes so they can ... these diseases and some questions it and you know what should we or I keep the species ... ALM that ethically correct ... when the ... other one ... when you say they serve anyway the lead ... so what in the new work ... aerial ... investing in vaccines that can be also very ... it's difficult and challenging aam with where you stand on the pandemic ... diseases ... you know you're working really we are the God of all significantly um ... both with the bowler and see the ... and look you know what we find is that your pandemic preparedness truly been read or ... something that we've worked hard with the government on ... the leisure Nenad states that ... about two years ago stemming in Scotland on time with England Merkel ... in European countries Doctor Paul Stoffels laudanum R and D in fact ... was in the UK just of the last few days and Belgium talking about this very issue ... and ... you know if I was ... so important ... is that we harmonize some of the regulatory summit clinical development guidelines ... around these pandemics because ... you'll be fine now is because of the way we're all connected flying around the world daily ... you know the the ability of these pandemics to spread very very quickly ... is just gone up its financial ... and yet the science behind it is much more challenging ... so it starts with ... we can in ... its rear of one company ... or one governments can coupled with the solution is to know why all this to work together ... that ... you know we work very hard on as with the number of regulators in the number of government is what is our playbook for doing that ... because a we don't wanna be is in the middle of the of bowl a free pandemic ... and trying to figure out should we or should we not be doing a placebo controlled trial in a bid to complex ... it will be too late ... and frankly hundreds or thousands or more ... could die in that intervening time ... so ... getting regulars coming together to agree ... around what's the standard outs of the week and be prepared for that ... opening a door so the companies can work together ... and that we don't let Ikea we don't let other issues in the way to the third thing that we find is ... how we make sure we got the capacity ... me there's a couple parts of axing ... really hard part is getting on the works ... that actually goes inspected the other really hard part is ... he produce enough of that ... the challenge with some of the vaccines as they can take two or three years to have an adequate number of doses teaming up to a few million ... so we've been working really hard some other techniques that ... instead of that we move into a beaker ... last but not least ... we make sure that we can get the last mile we work with the Gates Foundation with other and she owes ... so they ... not only do we get the vaccines to the dock to the health care system ... but how can we make sure that they actually get to the climate ... that they can be delivered the health care workers that can do it in the right way ... that is a huge pass ... and that but I think the good news is ... these last several times ... companies governments and a lot of people are working very hard together ... to streamline the whole process ... because one ... one thing I can say with certainty ... is there will be ... other things that we can't predict happening in the future we need to do a better job ... we maintained IP intellectual property in ... two grades or ten K and what things it's that and there was that Dom if you've never been in that time when there's been a more hostile regulatory environment towards into actual property ... received many drugs that are still on patent but ... already have ... competitors in the generic field ... coming in the China market ... competitors to that of the aisle similar steps ... aam ... when you ... and you got FDA regulations are sometimes most drugs are approved in Europe before their approves here ... how do you see that regulatory and intellectual property environment ... in the future is that if you think it can be done to improve that or can you operate in that ... I'm in a ... it might seem strange for somebody of my role to stop by say is that you not be the first one to tell you ... that I think ... having a responsible pathway for generics were ... up ... by some lawyers ... is absolutely critical for health care system ... it's actually I think ... a very healthy ... part ... of a innovative ... HealthCare ... marketplace and in what I mean how well ... we did have hustlers if you don't have generics over time ... it that's that's the ... that's the benefit if you're investing for the future like you mean that's about nine billion dollars last year ... and and we do that knowing that we can all would be rewarded well if there are no generics in any Catholic pressure of system in some way ... that's just not sustainable ... I think if your company that is investing ... look there's been a lot of actors lately that have been investing we think that's important ... in and provides for a whole the overall uses ... sets number one number two though gotta make sure that we keep the patient this time ... and what I mean by that is ... let's make sure you know what number one the ... companies follow the appropriate on the lawns ... number two ... that that all the right regulatory pathways ... you're there there's a difference between generic some but so much for assembling of toll is basically a chemical compound that can be replicated here ... biologic is approaching celebratory ... so ... Protea name ... isn't it said was similar it's never an exact replica ... the same ... we know we are the first in the field of ... TF ANA's and ... biologics ... and very minor differences in the protein can have a pretty significant fact that they get to make sure the winners and then another use ... so ... we think you're absolutely parts and we think that it's gotta be done and a thoughtful way ... and ... that were working with regulators and you know and others to ensure that in the current system is it's ... a sign that devices because that's the other big area of courts ... and most of us can fall for me things in place I think that is close to him ... everything is brand ... and identity of the people of having these in the hands and this is still there over here ... the elites post surgery ... the the the the ... you know that's that's an area of ... you know those surgeries even though they're incredibly ... um you changed people's lives they can also have risks attached to know I know you're some some of your devices and the TV Calder ... know people are thinking of these infections that happened during surgery ... what can you do in the surgical field of advanced safety make this all by on a can ... E-mail get an idea ... his ankle replacements now ... look there's a few just a couple things couple Monday the first of all ... making surgery is ... of ... minimally invasive as possible ... and among enemies might have as an example so your today there's a couple ways you can do that there's a post I will do Lyndon Johnson and you promise ... to lead to ... Syria approach with a basically go into blue teal ... and they had that having to cut quite a bit of muscle than of you out there are places that they get very ... good in ... a traditionally you going to be very good positioning ... of the head ... and however it would take you ... several ... several months actually recover because you would have to kill your boss was was the joint ... today the news was called answer for some adds another my pocket is ... little even system like that ... they can go and because of improvements in surgical technique ... and floss compete with the imaging that they can use ... baking go and basically they did my second procedure no muscles with minimal muscle was cut by the way that that is the most part outside ... their place in Shawnee ... to three hours after surgery I was able to walk with a walker ... the next morning I walked around the floor with the came ... within three days I walked a mile ... now traditionally that would have taken years that the way they close all four layers ... you know of ... muscle tissue that's a scan ... they can do it now was sutures that helps reduce the infection ... than would normally occur ... in the way that was pre operative Liam post op we treated with ... antibiotics ... so if you put all that together ... you reduce infection in Euro disco morbidity is ... you've got good pre operative preparation and post operative care physical therapy ... you get those results ... in you know more more we're finding is ... that we use a smaller incision ... we get more tools ... and other devices ... to cut Poletti Lake control bleeding to all those things ... you know again to intro car rather than having to open someone up that's that's the first ... the other area that I'm really excited about ... is how we migrate some of the technology that we usually play in Silicom Valley on our I Phones sensing devices ... into devices that we normally nothing to others but once it's it's the Gugle partnership the Gugle partnership so ... what did you two examples one is in surgery any other ... let's talk about might ... well imagine a device in the future ... instead of just putting and ... stab a ball of clay your Cavill on your pelvis ... one of those heads sensor devices and ... to the point that is talked about earlier ... ok the biggest concern ... for a orthopedist doing hip replacement couple things one is making she get the positioning just right so the forces are correct ... and say don't have one leg shorter and they don't develop issues ... on that if we had a sensor in that device that can measure those forces ... and they can give them a very early indicator if they were all lying ... so that they could do it for actively versus what we're doing now gets ... imagine if we had thermal sensors in the same things ... so we can determine an infection weeks before it manifests itself ... the way that it does now elevation ... best group best Milton on what I'm talking about things being worked on today ... ok which is so ... meaty another example ... everyone is very excited right now but the driverless car ... what if we take some of that same global technology that we're doing right now in a partnership ... with verily ... and we apply Ch Robotics are ... euroglut is urging the silly decision ... to go in this isn't going to be instrumental in all this bad ... you know ... there's so much that we can do a lot of great surgeons is great certain how can we take ... a good surgeon and make them an even better soon ... and by applying some of the same vision capability ... algorithms that can be tight in the thousands and thousands of surgeries that no word to cut along the margin ... you know of a ... cancerous I was not where to cut the particular area for doing an orthopedic replacement ... something they can help guide them along the way ... the key to the ongoing track record of what what's occurred ... we think can make a tremendous difference long-term again in overall surgical outcome so those are a couple of examples that ... were very excited ...

Supports K@W's Leadership Content 

Alex Gorsky, a 26-year veteran of Johnson & Johnson, was appointed chairman and CEO of J&J in 2012. The New Brunswick, N.J.-based health care enterprise has close to 130,000 employees, revenues of approximately $70 billion and more than 250 operating companies around the world. Gorsky discusses his leadership style, approach to decision making and common leadership myths during a recent interview with Wharton management professors Michael Useem and Adam Grant. 
An edited transcript of the conversation follows. 
Michael Useem: Alex, welcome. I am going to start with a question about the toughest decision that you have made in the last year or so. Describe that decision: What were the conflicting concerns and then how did you work it through, given the fact that you lead a rather large company?







Alex Gorsky: Fortunately or unfortunately during my career, I have had a chance to take part in some pretty significant decisions along the way, be it strategic, business or operational. But I’ve got to say I think some of the most challenging, and probably the most challenging, have been related to very significant organizational and people changes within our company, particularly when you know this is something that can impact employees’ future, that can affect families. Those are things that you always want to do with a lot of thought, with a lot of care and a lot of empathy. Those types of decisions for me personally have always been some of the most challenging.
There are a few things that we try to do. Obviously the first is make sure that you’ve got the right team around you. So many of the decisions that ultimately wind their way to me have, by and large, been decided by a great group of leaders who have a tremendous amount of responsibility in terms of their businesses and the organizations that they represent.
Second, it’s to make sure that as you’re going through and making those decisions, you provide an atmosphere where you can really have debate, where you can really have challenge, where there’s not just a pre-ordained recommendation – and, frankly, where one plus one can equal four or five in the whole decision making process. I’ve always found that encouraging a diversity of opinion by different members, sometimes even challenging people to come in and argue the opposite of the direction that we’re heading in, really makes sure that you have thought through the implications.
Last but not least, it’s once you’ve made that decision — recognizing that there’s going to be different points of view – then getting full alignment around your leadership team so that you’re speaking in one voice and in a common direction. That’s what I’ve seen be one of the biggest challenges, but that’s the way that we tried to deal with it — to make sure that we’re ultimately making the best decisions for the company and all our stakeholders.
Adam Grant: Alex, is there an example that stands out, particularly when it comes to challenging people to bring different opinions or maybe even argue for the opposite of what they believe? Were you able to stimulate that, and did it have a positive effect?
Gorsky: I’ve had a number [of examples] along the way. But I think one in particular stands out for me related to one of our products where we were making a specific recommendation about it on the market. There was a lot of pressure tied to the issue. Right before we made that decision, I remember calling our chief counsel that night and saying: “I’d like you to talk to a law firm and actually have them argue the opposite point of view.” So, we went outside the company…. What I found through that process was that we ended up staying with the right decision. But taking that pause made sure that we had much more confidence and conviction in our position…. Yes, you want to be a decision [maker], but you also have got to realize the impact that your decisions can have. I think taking that extra moment, having that extra challenge, is good practice.
Useem: Alex, you came out of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and took a job pretty much at the ground level in a unit at Johnson & Johnson. In your first job, as I recall, you led nobody, you were pretty much on your own. But you moved up to 30 [employees], 300, 3,000 and now 130,000. How have you had to change your leadership style going from nobody to a few, then a lot and now over 100,000? How has your thinking about leadership evolved? What’s different now from the way you would have led say, 10 years ago, in the way you operate?


Knowledge@Wharton High School






Gorsky: Your leadership does need to evolve as you move through an organization. I think there are a lot of lessons that you learn along the way. Number one is learning the importance of, “It’s not really what I do but it’s about what the people who you work with do,” and working through others. I think that’s one of the biggest challenges facing you — just learning that skill where you’re no longer the individual contributor but you’re contributing by bringing together a group of people who have different skills, different capabilities and working through them to accomplish a particular task. I see that as being a significant challenge facing many leaders as they move through an organization. That was certainly one for me.
The second one is understanding the global impact of your decision when you’re starting in one particular area and have a rather local impact, to today where every decision you make can have an impact globally — from Mumbai to Minneapolis, from Warsaw to Miami. And always considering what that true global impact of a particular decision can be.
Last but not least, it’s about always trying to predict what the strategic implications are. So, what are the second or third order consequences of a particular decision versus the immediate impact? Johnson & Johnson fortunately is a company that has been around for over 126 years. I’m always trying to think about, “What is it over the next 10 years?” — not the next just one year or two years. Certainly there’s always an issue du jour that we’re working on. But I’m trying to think about what are the decisions that we can make, what are the directions we can go in, that are going to continue our track record and sustainability for the next decade, for the next 100 years.
“Encouraging a diversity of opinion by different members … makes sure that you have thought through the implications.”
Grant: Alex, you’re known not only as someone who cares a lot about developing leaders but also about your leaders developing leaders below them. How do you figure out one, who those people are who are likely to be good at leadership development and two, what do you actually teach them?
Gorsky: That’s a great question. I do believe that one of the best indicators of leadership is a leader’s track record in developing leaders. I will frequently focus on three areas when I’m interviewing or when I’m talking to people. One is certainly on performance because you always want to have leaders who are committed to high performance and … handling a wide range of different scenarios.
Second, I always focus on what’s their track record of developing future leaders. One of my favorite questions is to ask people is, “If I asked you who had the biggest impact on your career and how they did that, who are those four people that you would name?” At a senior level, if they can’t name three or four fairly senior level people, then immediately I question their wherewithal in people development.
“People are not looking for a perfect leader. They want a leader who cares about them and is going to help them try to be better.”
Last, I’ll ask how do they move their businesses, how do they develop talent with our credo in mind. It gives me an indication of how committed they are to developing individuals, to developing teams and frankly, figuring out how to work through others to get their jobs done.
Useem: At Johnson & Johnson, what do you think is the perception of leadership in general, maybe leadership in particular in your own experience, that turns out to be most incorrect? What do people looking at leaders often not see?
Gorsky: I think that one of the most significant myths about leadership is that the top leader is there to just make the decision versus taking much more of a service-oriented approach [knowing that] you are in service to many of those who are going to be impacted by your decision. I can tell you right now that I definitely approach the job from the latter [perspective], always trying to understand the consequences, the implications that your decisions are going to have on your different stakeholders, ranging from customers, the communities that you work in, your shareholders, your employees, all the people who might be touched, and learning that at the end of the day we’re really in service to them — that the jobs that we do … have got to ultimately be helping all of those stakeholders realize their objectives. I think frequently it’s not about the “boss” making a certain decision; it’s the decisions we make in service to those stakeholders that are really important.
Grant: Building on that, what is the success or accomplishment over your career that you’re most proud of?
Gorsky: The thing that I’m most proud of are the great leaders that I’ve had a chance to work with along the way who have gone on to take great positions of responsibility and, frankly, made a difference within J&J and of course in other areas as well. I’ve had the opportunity to work with a broad number of people through my several decades [at the firm]. Frankly, starting with my time in the military, and with my time as a coach with my son’s teams, to my time at Johnson & Johnson, and some time at New Artists as well, there’s nothing that gives me greater satisfaction than knowing that people have been able to go on and do a lot of good things for patients, for consumers, along the way. That [gives me] a great deal of satisfaction and, of course most importantly, just knowing that the products and the services that we’re offering every day hopefully are helping people live longer, healthier and happier lives. That’s a great sense of satisfaction.
“How do you make sure every day — when decisions are made in many different areas around the world and in different business organizations – that the credo remains our moral compass, the glue that holds us together?”
Useem: A question for people who are just coming into leadership responsibilities. Think about the first job where you had a responsibility for others. Think maybe even later on, but especially for those who are first taking on a significant leadership role. From your own experience, what are the one or two lines of advice that you’d like to pass on to them so they can get to where they want to go in taking on that leadership obligation?
Gorsky: A couple of things. One [is that] it’s really important for early leaders to be themselves. So often leaders get into a role and maybe have some ideal of what it is to be a leader. I think the most important thing that a new leader can have stepping into a role is humility, understanding that they’re going to learn, that they’re going to make mistakes, and to approach the scenario as something where they’re going to have to grow into [the position]. Having that kind of a mind-set will immediately endear the people who are working with you and around you. They’re not looking for a perfect leader. They want a leader who cares about them and is going to help them try to be better. I think as a new leader if you remember this, that they expect you to be human, that you’re going to make mistakes and that as long as you learn and care for the people who are working with you, I think that’s the most important thing you can do.
Useem: Quick final question on that…. You’ve got people all over the world, and thus the tone you set at the top, the culture, the ethics, the values become critical. Johnson & Johnson has a very famous credo, about 300 words that say, “We’re here on earth to serve people who need our products, great community, great employment setting and then we work for shareholders as well.” When I was in your headquarters a couple of years ago, I noticed that this credo is carved in stone on the main floor of headquarters. What happens if you want to change the credo?
Gorsky: Well, Mike, as you know, the credo … was written over 70 years ago by General Robert Wood Johnson himself. It’s been a great source of inspiration, and it does outline our responsibilities to our different stakeholders — all that you mentioned, [including] customers, employees, communities, as well as shareholders ultimately. And through the years, there have been a few times when it has been updated. But the core principles are something that we don’t think should change. As I stepped into this role, just as my predecessors, I think one of the first things we’ve always tried to do is reaffirm our commitment to those core principles embodied in that document.
Now I think what’s more important for us in the organization is how we bring that credo to life. How do you make sure every day — when decisions are made in many different areas around the world and in different business organizations – that the credo remains our moral compass, the glue that holds us together? That’s something that we constantly reinforce through town hall meetings, through outreach programs. In fact, this year is the 70th anniversary of our credo. We’re having a Credo Challenge Session where every board of the 250 companies that you mentioned earlier is challenging the relevance of our credo and going through it line by line. It’s by … keeping this alive in the organization — which we think is incredibly important – that we make sure we do the right thing.

Petition ClosedPetitioning  Alex GorskyDecision makersAlex GorskyJohnson & Johnson: Tell The Talc Truth!Jere Beasley Montgomery, ALJere BeasleyMontgomery, AL575SupportersOn Feb. 22, 2016, a jury found Johnson & Johnson liable for the ovarian cancer death of a woman who had used the company’s talcum powder products for more than 35 years.
During the trial, internal documents came to light that showed the company was warned of the link between talcum powder and ovarian cancer by its own medical consultants. Despite this, J&J failed to warn consumers of the risk.
Nobody – other than the jurors – had ever seen the incriminating documents. That includes the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These documents comprise of reports on medical studies as well as internal letters and memos about talc dangers.
In spite of the jury verdict, Johnson & Johnson continues to publicly deny the risk of ovarian cancer associated with its talc-containing products. The public is entitled to have access to these internal documents so they can decide for themselves.
This petition calls on Alex Gorsky, Chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson, to make these internal documents public, and to publish them on the company’s website where they can be easily accessed by consumers.
