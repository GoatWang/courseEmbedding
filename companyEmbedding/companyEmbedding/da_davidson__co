Testimonials are not to be considered representative of the experience of all clients, and do not represent a guarantee of future performance or success. Neither D.A. Davidson & Co. or our clients were paid for any testimonials included. 



























































Our Philosophy




Our philosophy is derived from the firm’s long-standing mission: to deliver reliable, insightful, trustworthy advice that drives favorable outcomes for our clients. Today, our unwavering commitment to our clients' success, the breadth of our capabilities and our industry-specific expertise differentiate us from more traditional competitors. Unlike smaller, niche firms or larger “product” driven firms, our wide array of advisory and financing capabilities enables us to offer more objective advice, resulting in solutions truly tailored to your needs.





We marry the firm's extensive resources with active, senior-banker leadership to provide the highest level of service and the best possible outcome for our clients. Over 80 years we’ve learned a lot of things. Things like client trust is paramount and sometimes the best advice is to not do the deal. We believe that quality, candid advice not only creates the best outcomes, it also creates enduring client trust and long-term relationships.

          Only 41% of U.S. workers have tried to determine how much they will need to save for a
          comfortable retirement.
        

          Source: Employee Benefit Research Institute, 2017
        


        How much retirement income will you need? How much life insurance is enough? What type of IRA is right for you?
      

        Our financial calculators are designed as educational tools to help you estimate
        answers to common financial questions. They are not intended to predict future
        returns or results. Simply click on one of the general financial topics below and
        you'll find a selection of easy-to-use calculators about related financial topics.
      
These calculators are hypothetical examples used for illustrative purposes and do not represent the performance of any specific investment or product.
