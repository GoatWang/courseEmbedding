News – Snap Inc.
























Press Inquiries: press@snap.comJun282017Design a Custom Geofilter from Your Phone!Each day, Snapchatters submit tens of thousands of Geofilter designs for their engagements and weddings, parties, vacations, graduations, and so much more.Starting today, we’re making it easier to design a custom Snapchat filter! Snapchatters can now create filters right in the Snapchat app, and customize them with many of the same Creative Tools available to decorate Snaps!To get started, simply tap “On-Demand Geofilters” in Settings to check out our all-new mobile creative studio. From there, you can pick a theme for your filter and add personal flair with text, Bitmojis, and Stickers.Once your masterpiece is complete, choose where you’d like your filter to appear and when. Your Geofilter can cover an event or entire block — for an hour or up to ninety days. Pricing starts at $5.99. You’ll hear from Snapchat when your Geofilter is approved to confirm payment and details.Check out our Geofilters Support Center for more!Happy Snapping!Jun212017Introducing Snap Map!We've built a whole new way to explore the world! See what's happening, find your friends, and get inspired to go on an adventure!It's easy to get started — just pinch to zoom out and view the Map! You decide if you want to share your location with friends, or simply keep it to yourself with Ghost Mode.If your friends are sharing their location with you, their Actionmoji will appear on the Map. Actionmojis only update when you open Snapchat.We hope you enjoy the new Map as much as we do!Happy Snapping!Team SnapMay232017A Whole New StoryToday we’re announcing a new way to create custom Stories – about anything, with any of your friends, even for a specific location! It's perfect for a trip, a birthday party, or a new baby story just for the family.You decide who can add to the Story and who can view it – you can also choose to Geofence the Story to a location.It’s super easy to create a new Story. Simply tap the “Create Story” icon located in the top right corner of the Stories page.Stories disappear if no one has contributed to them in the past 24 hours.We hope you enjoy creating custom Stories!Love,Team SnapMay92017Limitless SnapsToday we’re making a pretty big change to the way you create and send Snaps. We’re reorganizing the layout of our creative tools, adding a Magic Eraser (you’ll find this under the Scissor tool), and adding a new setting to the timer: infinity!We’ve all felt the frustration of not being able to fully enjoy a Snap – even after replaying it – and we wanted to give you the option of allowing the recipient to enjoy your Snap as long as they’d like. After your friend finishes viewing the Snap and taps to close it, it will delete as usual.There’s also a new Loop tool for videos so you can decide if your Snap plays once or loops until your friend is ready to tap to the next Snap.These changes allow us to continue evolving the Snapchat service and provide a foundation for introducing even more creative tools for making fun Snaps! We hope you enjoy it!Love,Team SnapApr182017Introducing New World LensesWe launched Lenses over a year ago as a whole new way to express ourselves on Snapchat. Since then, we've become puppies, puked rainbows, face-swapped with our best friends — and begun to explore how Lenses can change the world around us.Today, we’re adding new ways to use Lenses.While Snapping with the rear-facing camera, simply tap the camera screen to find new Lenses that can paint the world around you with new 3D experiences!Happy Snapping,Team SnapMar312017A Story for EverythingSince we launched Stories in October 2013, Stories have evolved from singular, personal perspectives to include collective narratives created by our entire community with Snaps submitted to Our Story and curated by our team.Our Stories have provided behind the scenes Snaps from interesting events all around the world — from the field of the Super Bowl to the summit of Mount Everest! Over time, the number of Snaps that were created by our community and added to Our Story simply overwhelmed our curation team — and inspired us to create something new.We’ve built a new way to understand what’s happening in Snaps that are submitted to Our Story, and to create new Stories using advanced machine learning. The results have been amazing: you can search over one million unique Stories on Snapchat!In addition to our professionally curated Stories, you can watch a local basketball game, check out the scene at your favorite bar, view your favorite Fashion Week shows, get inspired by a faraway place, or simply tap through a Story full of puppies — there’s a Story for everything!The best part of Stories is seeing the world through the eyes of our community. It’s easy to add your point of view — simply take a Snap and add it to Our Story! You might see it included in relevant Stories depending on what you’re Snapping.We’re rolling out Stories in Search starting today in select cities and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do!Love,Team SnapJan102017International GrowthToday, the media reported that we selected London as our International HQ. That is not true. We have one HQ, in Venice, and many offices throughout the world.We did, however, make a change to the way we operate our business in London. Going forward, we will bill our advertising revenue from the U.K. (and a few other countries) through a U.K. entity. This allows us to pay taxes in the U.K., which we believe is part of being a good local partner as we grow our business.We want to pay taxes in the countries where we sell advertising, and this is an important step in building the infrastructure to achieve that goal. Team SnapDec132016Happy Holidays!The holidays are a great time to hang out with friends and spend time with family – it’s always better together! We couldn’t think of a better time to announce Groups, a new way to communicate with up to 16 friends on Snapchat. Groups can be created while sending a Snap, or when you’re making a new Chat. When your friends are present in a Group Chat, we show their name at the bottom of the Chat. Simply tap their name to start a 1:1 Chat, and then easily return to the Group in one swipe! We call this Quick Chat, and it’s the fastest way to keep the conversation going with one friend without spamming the entire Group.Chats sent to a Group are deleted by default after 24 hours. Snaps sent to a Group can be opened and replayed just once by each recipient. If a Snap isn't opened, it's deleted after 24 hours, just like Chats.We’ve also introduced two new Creative Tools – Scissors and Paintbrush. Use Scissors to cut out part of a Snap on the Preview Screen to turn it into a sticker! The Paintbrush can be applied to Snaps in Memories, and turns a Snap into an artistic masterpiece! We’re so grateful for your support. Thank you for another terrific year – we love building products for all of you! Wishing you a wonderful 2017.Merry Snapping,Team SnapOct72016Story PlaylistWhen we first built Auto Advance we wanted to make it easier to catch up with your friends by playing all of your Stories in recent updates back-to-back.Unfortunately, this change made it impossible to individually choose which Story to watch. Sometimes we just want to see what our close friends or family are up to – not all of our friends – and Auto Advance prevented that.Starting today for select Snapchatters in our Android community and rolling out soon across all Android and iOS, the Auto Advance feature will be removed to give you control of your Story viewing experience once again!Simply tap on a Story to view it. We won’t automatically advance you to the next Story in recent updates.We haven’t given up entirely on this idea of making it easier to catch up with friends – so we took what we learned from Auto Advance and built Story Playlist.Story Playlist is an easy way to select the Stories you want to watch and seamlessly view them full screen in the order you selected them.  Tap on the Story thumbnail to the left of your friend’s name to add their Story to your playlist. Hit the play button at the bottom of the screen to watch!Happy Snapping!Team SnapchatSep242016Introducing Spectacles!We’ve been working for the past few years to develop a totally new type of camera. We call it Spectacles!Imagine one of your favorite memories. What if you could go back and see that memory the way you experienced it? That’s why we built Spectacles.Spectacles are sunglasses with an integrated video camera that makes it easy to create Memories.We’ve created one of the smallest wireless video cameras in the world, capable of taking a day’s worth of Snaps on a single charge, and we integrated it seamlessly into a fun pair of sunglasses – available in 3 different colors!Spectacles connect directly to Snapchat via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and transfer your Memories directly into the app in our brand new circular video format.Circular video plays full screen on any device, in any orientation, and captures the human perspective with a 115 degree field of view. We can’t wait for you to see it!Spectacles will be available soon.Happy Snapping!Team Snap







Terms of Service – Snap Inc.
























DanskDeutschEnglish (US)English (UK)EspañolFrançaisItaliano日本語NederlandsNorskPortuguês (Brasil)SuomiSvenskaIf you live in the United States, you are agreeing to the Snap Inc. Terms of Service.
If you live outside the United States, you are agreeing to the Snap Group Limited Terms of Service.
Snap Inc. Terms of Service
(If you live in the United States)
Effective: January 10, 2017
Welcome!
We’re thrilled you’ve decided to use Snapchat and our other products and services, all of which we refer to simply as the “Services.”
We’ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the “Terms”) so you’ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: These Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and Snap Inc. So please read them carefully.
By using the Services, you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don’t agree with them, then don’t use the Services.
ARBITRATION NOTICE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE A LITTLE LATER ON. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND SNAP INC. AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.
1. Who Can Use the Services
No one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms carefully.
By using the Services, you state that:

You can form a binding contract with Snap Inc.
You are not a person who is barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction—meaning that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition.
You will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.

If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity. If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity of the U.S. Government, you agree to the Amendment to Snap Inc. Terms of Service for U.S. Government Users.
2. Rights We Grant You
Snap Inc. grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Services’ benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies, such as our Community Guidelines, allow.
Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings.
You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.
3. Rights You Grant Us
Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the Settings you have selected.
For all Services other than Live, Local, and any other crowd-sourced Service, you grant Snap Inc. and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.
Because Live, Local, and any other crowd-sourced Services are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, the license you grant us for content submitted to those Services is broader. In addition to granting us the rights mentioned in the previous paragraph, you also grant us a perpetual license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicense, publicly perform, and publicly display content submitted to Live, Local, or any other crowd-sourced Services in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). To the extent it’s necessary, when you appear in, create, upload, post, or send Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced content, you also grant Snap Inc., our affiliates, and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from Snap Inc., our affiliates, or our business partners if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced Services, either on the Snapchat application or on one of our business partner’s platforms.
For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our Privacy Policy and Support Site.
While we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service.
The Services may contain advertisements. In consideration for Snap Inc. letting you access and use the Services, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services. Because the Services contain content that you and other users provide us, advertising may sometimes appear near your content.
We always love to hear from our users. But if you volunteer feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use your ideas without compensating you.
4. The Content of Others
Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it. Although Snap Inc. reserves the right to review or remove all content that appears on the Services, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.
Through these Terms and our Community Guidelines, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.
5. Privacy
Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how we handle your information when you use our Services by reading our Privacy Policy. We encourage you to give the Privacy Policy a careful look because, by using our Services, you agree that Snap Inc. can collect, use, and share your information consistent with that policy.
6. Respecting Other People’s Rights
Snap Inc. respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services in a manner that:

violates or infringes someone else’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual-property right.
bullies, harasses, or intimidates.
defames.
spams or solicits our users.

You must also respect Snap Inc.’s rights. These Terms do not grant you any right to:

use branding, logos, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials used in our Services.
copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or otherwise use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as set forth in these Terms.
use the Services, any tools provided by the Services, or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes without our consent.

In short: You may not use the Services or the content on the Services in ways that are not authorized by these Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.
7. Respecting Copyright
Snap Inc. honors the requirements set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. And if Snap Inc. becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user’s account.
We make it easy for you to report suspected copyright infringement. If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please fill out this form. Or you may file a notice with our designated agent:

  Snap Inc.
  Attn: Copyright Agent
  63 Market Street
  Venice, CA 90291
  email: copyright@snap.com

If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, it must comply with the requirements set forth at 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3). That means the notice must:

contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.
identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material.
provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.
provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

8. Safety
We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can’t guarantee it. That’s where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that:

You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.
You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract other user’s information.
You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users’ content or information without our written consent.
You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services.
You will not use or attempt to use another user’s account, username, or password without their permission.
You will not solicit login credentials from another user.
You will not post content that contains pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech, or incitements to violence.
You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.
You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorized to access.
You will not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.
You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.

We also care about your safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never Snap and drive. And never put yourself or others in harm’s way just to capture a Snap.
9. Your Account
You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your Snapchat account. So it’s important that you keep your account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don’t use for any other account.
By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:

You will not create more than one account for yourself.
You will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our written permission to do so.
You will not buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your Snapchat account, Live, Snaps, a Snapchat username, or a friend link without our written permission.
You will not share your password.
You will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications or clients.

If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately reach out to Snapchat Support.
10. Memories
Memories is our data-storage service that makes it easier for you to reminisce anytime, anywhere. By agreeing to these Terms, you automatically enable Memories. Once Memories is enabled, it will remain enabled for as long as you maintain your Snapchat account. But you can always turn off certain Memories features through Settings.
One of the options we provide with Memories is the ability to create a restricted area by setting a passcode, which might be a PIN or a passphrase or some other mechanism. This is similar to the device-lock option you may be using on your mobile device; by setting a passcode, you make it less likely that another person who gets ahold of your device will be able to see what you saved to the restricted area of Memories. But here’s a big warning: IF YOU LOSE OR FORGET YOUR MEMORIES PASSCODE, OR IF YOU ENTER THE WRONG ONE TOO MANY TIMES, YOU WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ANY CONTENT YOU SAVED IN THE RESTRICTED AREA OF MEMORIES. We don’t offer any passcode recovery features for this restricted area. You are solely responsible for remembering your passcode. Please go to our Support Site for more details on passcodes.
Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons, including things like an operational glitch or a decision on our end to terminate your account. Since we can’t promise that your content will always be available, we recommend keeping a separate copy of content you save to Memories.
We make no promise that Memories will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs. We reserve the right to set storage limits for Memories, and we may change these limits from time to time in our sole discretion. And just as with our other Services, your use of Memories may take up space on your device and may incur mobile data charges.
You may not resell any Memories features. This means you can’t do something like use Memories to operate your own file-storage or distribution service for other people.
11. Data Charges and Mobile Phones
You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and data charges. If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.
If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a Snapchat account, you must update your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages intended for you.
12. Third-Party Services
If you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party’s terms will govern the respective party’s relationship with you. Snap Inc. is not responsible or liable for a third party’s terms or actions taken under the third party’s terms.
13. Modifying the Services and Termination
We’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.
While we hope you remain a lifelong Snapchatter, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.
Snap Inc. may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason, and without advanced notice. That means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.
Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Snap Inc. continue to be bound by Sections 3, 6, 9, 10, and 13-22 of the Terms.
14. Indemnity
You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Snap Inc., our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c) your breach of these Terms.
15. Disclaimers
We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WHILE SNAP INC. ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR TIMELY; (B) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS; OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.
SNAP INC. TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER, OR A THIRD PARTY CREATES, UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR STORES ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, MISLEADING, OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE, NONE OF WHICH SNAP INC. WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.
16. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SNAP INC. AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF SNAP INC. HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL SNAP INC.’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID SNAP INC., IF ANY, IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
17. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU AND SNAP INC. TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.

Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You and Snap Inc. agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Snap Inc. are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. To be clear: The phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms.
Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, available here as of the date of these Terms, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
Fees. If you choose to arbitrate with Snap Inc., you will not have to pay any fees to do so. That is because Snap Inc. will reimburse you for your filing fee and the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules provide that any hearing fees and arbitrator compensation are our responsibility. To the extent another arbitral forum is selected, Snap Inc. will pay that forum’s fees as well.
Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snap Inc. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Snap Inc.
Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Snap Inc. are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Snap Inc. over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 18.
Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.
Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Snap Inc. can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Snap Inc. in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Snapchat username and the email address you used to set up your Snapchat account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: Snap Inc., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 63 Market Street, Venice, CA 90291, or email the opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out@snap.com.
Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Snap Inc. may bring an individual action in small claims court.
Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Snap Inc.

18. Exclusive Venue
To the extent that these Terms allow you or Snap Inc. to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Snap Inc. agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. If, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. You and Snap Inc. consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts. 
19. Choice of Law
Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of California, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter. 
20. Severability
If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
21. Additional Terms for Specific Services
Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be available with the relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services. If any part of those additional terms and conditions conflicts with these Terms, the additional terms and conditions will prevail.
22. Final Terms

These Terms (together with any additional terms applicable to specific Services you use) make up the entire agreement between you and Snap Inc., and supersede any prior agreements.
These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.

Snap Group Limited Terms of Service
(If you live outside the United States)
Effective: January 10, 2017
Welcome!
We’re thrilled you’ve decided to use Snapchat and our other products and services, all of which we refer to simply as the “Services.”
We’ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the “Terms”) so you’ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: These Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and Snap Group Limited. So please read them carefully.
By using the Services, you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don’t agree with them, then don’t use the Services.
These Terms apply to you if you live outside the United States or if you are using the Services on behalf of a business located outside the United States. If you live in the United States or are using the Services on behalf of a business located there, the Snap Inc. Terms of Service apply.
ARBITRATION NOTICE: IF YOU’RE USING THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF A BUSINESS, THEN YOUR BUSINESS WILL BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE THAT APPEARS LATER IN THESE TERMS.
1. Who Can Use the Services
No one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms carefully.
By using the Services, you affirm that:

You can form a binding contract with Snap Group Limited.
You are not a person who is barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom, or any other applicable jurisdiction—meaning that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition.
You will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.

If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you affirm that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity. 
2. Rights We Grant You
Snap Group Limited grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Services’ benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies, such as our Community Guidelines, allow.
Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings.
You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services. Nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.
3. Rights You Grant Us
Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the Settings you have selected.
For all Services other than Live, Local, and any other crowd-sourced Service, you grant Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., and their affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content for as long as you use the Services. This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.
Because Live, Local, and any other crowd-sourced Services are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, the license you grant us for content submitted to those Services is broader. In addition to granting us the rights mentioned in the previous paragraph, you also grant us a license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicense, publicly perform, and publicly display content submitted to Live, Local, or any other crowd-sourced Services in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). To the extent it’s necessary, when you appear in, create, upload, post, or send Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced content, you also grant Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., and our affiliates  and business partners the unrestricted, worldwide right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., or our affiliates and business partners if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced Services, either on the Snapchat application or on one of our business partner’s platforms.
For more information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our Privacy Policy and Support Site.
While we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Services.
The Services may contain advertisements. In consideration for Snap Group Limited letting you access and use the Services, you agree that we, Snap Inc., our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services, including personalized advertising based upon the information you provide us or we collect or obtain about you. Because the Services contain content that you and other users provide us, advertising may sometimes appear near your content.
We always love to hear from our users. But if you volunteer feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use your ideas without compensating you.
4. The Content of Others
Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it. Although Snap Group Limited reserves the right to review all content that appears on the Services and to remove any content that violates these Terms, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.
Through these Terms and our Community Guidelines, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.
5. Privacy
Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how your information is handled when you use our Services by reading the Privacy Policy . We encourage you to give the Privacy Policy a careful look because, by using our Services, you agree that your information may be collected and processed by Snap Group Limited in the UK and Snap Inc. in the U.S., as well as their affiliates, and transferred outside of the country in which you reside, including to countries that may not have the same data-protection laws as your country. 
6. Respecting Other People’s Rights
Snap Group Limited respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services in a manner that:

violates or infringes someone else’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual-property right.
bullies, harasses, or intimidates.
defames.
spams or solicits our users.

You must also respect the rights of Snap Group Limited and its affiliates, including Snap Inc. These Terms do not grant you any right to:

use branding, logos, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials used in our Services.
copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or otherwise use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as set forth in these Terms.
use the Services, any tools provided by the Services, or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes without our consent.

In short: You may not use the Services or the content on the Services in ways that are not authorized by these Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.
7. Respecting Copyright
We respect copyright law. We therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. And if Snap Group Limited becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user’s account.
We make it easy for you to report suspected copyright infringement. If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please fill out this form. Or you may file a notice with our designated agent:

  Snap Inc.
  Attn: Copyright Agent
  63 Market Street
  Venice, CA 90291
  email: copyright@snap.com

If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, it must:

contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.
identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material.
provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.
provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

8. Safety
We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can’t guarantee it. That’s where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that:

You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.
You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract other user’s information.
You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users’ content or information without our written consent.
You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services.
You will not use or attempt to use another user’s account, username, or password without their permission.
You will not solicit login credentials from another user.
You will not post content that contains pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech, or incitements to violence.
You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.
You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorized to access.
You will not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.
You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.

We also care about your safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never Snap and drive. And never put yourself or others in harm’s way just to capture a Snap.
9. Your Account
You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your Snapchat account. So it’s important that you keep your account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don’t use for any other account.
By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:

You will not create more than one account for yourself.
You will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our written permission to do so.
You will not buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your Snapchat account, Live, Snaps, a Snapchat username, or a friend link without our written permission.
You will not share your password.
You will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications or clients.

If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately reach out to Snapchat Support.
10. Memories
Memories is our data-storage service that makes it easier for you to reminisce anytime, anywhere. By agreeing to these Terms, you automatically enable Memories. Once Memories is enabled, it will remain enabled for as long as you maintain your Snapchat account. But you can always turn off certain Memories features through Settings.
One of the options we provide with Memories is the ability to create a restricted area by setting a passcode, which might be a PIN or a passphrase or some other mechanism. This is similar to the device-lock option you may be using on your mobile device; by setting a passcode, you make it less likely that another person who gets ahold of your device will be able to see what you saved to the restricted area of Memories. But here’s a big warning: If you lose or forget your Memories passcode, or if you enter the wrong one too many times, you will lose access to any content you saved in the restricted area of Memories. We don’t offer any passcode recovery features for this restricted area. You are solely responsible for remembering your passcode. Please go to our Support Site for more details on passcodes.
Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons, including things like an operational glitch or a decision on our end to terminate your account. Since we can’t promise that your content will always be available, we recommend keeping a separate copy of the content you save to Memories.
We make no promise that Memories will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs. We reserve the right to set storage limits for Memories, and we may change these limits from time to time in our sole discretion. And just as with our other Services, your use of Memories may take up space on your device and may incur mobile data charges.
You may not resell any Memories features. This means you can’t do something like use Memories to operate your own file-storage or distribution service for other people.
11. Data Charges and Mobile Phones
You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and data charges. If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.
If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a Snapchat account, you must update your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages intended for you.
12. Third-Party Services
If you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party’s terms will govern the respective party’s relationship with you. Neither Snap Group Limited nor Snap Inc. is responsible or liable for a third party’s terms or actions taken under the third party’s terms.
13. Modifying the Services and Termination
We’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we will try to notify you beforehand, but this won’t always be possible.
While we hope you remain a lifelong Snapchatter, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.
Snap Group Limited may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason. And while we’ll try to give you advance notice, we can’t guarantee it. Our right to terminate these Terms means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use the Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.
Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Snap Group Limited continue to be bound by Sections 3, 6, 9, 10, and 13-22 of the Terms.
14. Indemnity
You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., and our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c) your breach of these Terms.
15. Disclaimers
We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.
The Services are provided “as is” and “as available” and to the extent permitted by law without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties, conditions, or other terms relating to merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, non-infringement, or arising from a course of dealing. In addition, while Snap Group Limited attempts to provide a good user experience, we do not represent or warrant that: (a) the Services will always be secure, error-free, or timely; (b) the Services will always function without delays, disruption, or imperfections; or (c) that any content or information you obtain through the Services will be timely or accurate.
Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., and their affiliates take no responsibility and assume no liability for any content that you, another user, or a third party creates, uploads, posts, sends, receives, or stores on or through our Services. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to content that might be offensive, illegal, misleading, or otherwise inappropriate, none of which Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., nor their affiliates will be responsible for.
16. Limitation of Liability
When permitted by law, Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., and our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents, will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or multiple damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from: (a) your use of the Services or inability to use the Services; (b) your access to or inability to access the Services; (c) the conduct or content of other users or third parties on or through the Services; or (d) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your content, even if Snap Group Limited has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event will Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., or their affiliates’ aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Services exceed the greater of £100 GBP or the amount you paid Snap Group Limited, if any, in the last 12 months.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some or all of the exclusions and limitations in this section may not apply to you.
17. Dispute Resolution, Arbitration 
If you have a concern, let’s talk. Go ahead and contact us first and we’ll do our best to resolve the issue.
Some of our Services may have additional terms that contain dispute-resolution provisions unique to that Service or your residency.
If you are using the Services on behalf of a business (rather than for your personal use), you and Snap Group Limited agree that to the extent permitted by law, all claims and disputes between us arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services will be finally settled under the LCIA Arbitration Rules, which are incorporated by reference into this clause. There will be one arbitrator (to be appointed by the LCIA), the arbitration will take place in London, and the arbitration will be conducted in English. If you do not wish to agree to this clause, you must not use the Services.
18. Exclusive Venue
To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Snap Group Limited agree that all claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the courts of England in the United Kingdom, unless this is prohibited by the laws of the country where you reside.  You and Snap Group Limited consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. 
19. Choice of Law
The laws of England and Wales govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter. The courts in some countries may not apply the laws of England and Wales to some disputes related to these Terms. If you reside in one of those countries, the laws of your home country may apply to those disputes.    
20. Severability
If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
21. Additional Terms for Specific Services
Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be available with the relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services. If any part of those additional terms and conditions conflicts with these Terms, the additional terms and conditions will prevail. 
22. Final Terms

These Terms (together with any additional terms applicable to specific Services you use) make up the entire agreement between you and Snap Group Limited and supersede any prior agreements.
These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.

Product Sales Terms and Conditions – Spectacles by Snap Inc.





SpectaclesShopIf you live in the United States, you are agreeing to the Product Sales Terms and Conditions found here.
If you live outside the United States, you are agreeing to the Product Sales Terms and Conditions found here.
Product Sales Terms and Conditions
(If you live in the United States)
Effective: June 2, 2017
ARBITRATION NOTICE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION PROVISION A LITTLE LATER ON. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THE ARBITRATION PROVISION OF OUR TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND SNAP INC. AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.
Introduction
Please read these Product Sales Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) carefully. These Terms apply to the purchase and use of Spectacles and other products available at spectacles.com (“Products”). They also govern your use of the software and firmware (“Licensed Software”) that lets you pair and use your Spectacles with Snapchat. Our Products and Licensed Software are “Services” as defined in our Terms of Service.
If you live in the United States or if you are using the Services on behalf of a business with its principal place of business located in the United States, these Terms form a legally binding contract between you and Snap Inc. If you live outside the United States or are using the Services on behalf of a business with its principal place of business located outside of the United States, a separate set of Product Sales Terms and Conditions applies.
These Terms are important as they include details about payment, refunds, and cancellations. Please print a copy of these Terms and keep them for your reference.
By submitting your online order to purchase Products, or pairing your Spectacles to Snapchat, you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms.
These Terms incorporate by reference our Terms of Service and our Products Warranty, so please read each of them carefully. Among other things, that means your purchase is subject to the disclaimers and limitations of liability in our Terms of Service. Please review our Privacy Policy to learn how we handle information when you use the Services. You agree that we can collect, use, and share your information consistent with that policy. To the extent these Terms conflict with our Terms of Service or any written insert included in the packaging with your Products, these Terms govern.
If you purchase Spectacles from us online, you may be asked to agree to these Terms at different times—once when you place an order and again when you pair your Spectacles—so it’s important to know which version you are agreeing to. Whenever you submit an order or pair your Spectacles, we’ll present you with the Terms then in effect, so you’ll always be able to review what you’re agreeing to ahead of time. The Online Orders provision of these Terms will apply to your order even if we later update that provision. For all other provisions of these Terms, the Terms in effect when you pair (or re-pair) your Spectacles will supersede the Terms you agreed to when you bought your Spectacles.
For any other Spectacles purchased from us, the Terms in effect will be made available when you make your purchase. The Returns & Exchanges policies in force at the time of your purchase will apply to your purchase even if we later update those policies. For all other provisions of these Terms, you’ll be asked to agree to the Terms then in effect when you pair (or re-pair) your Spectacles. Those Terms will supersede any prior versions you may have agreed to.
You affirm that you are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority where you live) and are competent and authorized to agree to and abide by these Terms. If you want to make a purchase and are under the age of majority, you must have the express permission from your authorized parent or guardian.
If you submit an order on behalf of a business, you affirm that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business. You agree that the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout these Terms, apply to both you and the business, as applicable.
1. Your Use of the Products
All Products are sold only for personal, non-commercial use or to give as a gift. You may not make the Products available for commercial resale, or use the Products for any commercial purpose without our prior consent.


    Spectacles Compatibility and Warnings. Please read our Spectacles Compatibility & Attribution and Spectacles Warnings pages to assess whether your device is compatible with Spectacles and to read our product warnings. We will not be liable to you (to pay a refund or otherwise) if your device does not meet the compatibility requirements in the Spectacles Compatibility & Attribution page or for any issue we make you aware of in the Spectacles Warnings page or at the time of purchase.

    Also keep in mind that you’ll need the Snapchat application to download, view, and store the content you create on Spectacles.


    Third-Party Products. Any warranties we provide only apply to the Products specifically named in our Products Warranty. We are not responsible for any loss of data or damage to the Products if you use them with third-party products, and we are not responsible for any damage to third-party products you use with the Products. Please see our Products Warranty for more information on what is and is not covered.
  

    Licensed Software Grant. For Spectacles, we grant you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable license to use the Licensed Software on the following terms:

    This license terminates automatically if you fail to comply with the restrictions described below. You may use the Licensed Software solely as incorporated into the Spectacles and for your personal use. We may provide, and automatically download and install, upgrades, updates, or other new features to the Licensed Software, all of which will be subject to the rights and restrictions of these Terms. You may not, and will not allow any third party to (or facilitate their ability to): (i) alter, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Licensed Software (except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restrictions); (ii) attempt to (1) defeat, avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or otherwise circumvent any software protection mechanisms in the Licensed Software, including any such mechanism used to restrict or control the functionality of the Licensed Software; or (2) derive the source code or the underlying ideas, algorithms, structure, or organization from the Licensed Software; (iii) create derivative works based on the Licensed Software, or any portion thereof; (iv) copy the Licensed Software; (v) remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Products or Licensed Software; or (vi) use the Licensed Software in any manner other than as embedded in the Spectacles.
None of the Licensed Software may be downloaded, exported, or re-exported in contravention of law. The Licensed Software is licensed, not sold, under these Terms. Title, ownership rights, and IP rights in and to the Licensed Software remains in (as applicable) us and our licensors and affiliates.


2. Online Orders
This Section applies exclusively to online orders.


    Orders, Pricing, and Shipping
    

        Orders. After you submit your order, we’ll process it and, if your order is accepted, we’ll send you an order confirmation email to the email address you provided. That email will include an estimated shipping date. We may need to carry out verifications before accepting your order. If you have any questions or notice an error in an order you’ve submitted, please contact us through our Support page. All orders are subject to availability of stock.

        We reserve the right any time prior to sending an order confirmation email to reject or cancel your order, or change quantities available for purchase.


        Pricing. We may in our sole discretion change, suspend, or end any service, or modify Product prices prospectively without notice. While we do our best to describe the Products as accurately as possible, we do not warrant that specifications or pricing are complete, accurate, current, or error-free. In the event of any pricing or specification error, we have the right to refuse or cancel your order in our sole discretion. Please note that we do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.
      

        Shipping. We offer delivery of Products to valid addresses within the United States. Estimated shipping dates are not guarantees. You’ll need to provide us with your shipping address when you submit your order. We’re not responsible for any errors in what you submit, and we are not obligated to determine correct shipping information if what you’ve submitted is not correct. Please carefully review the shipping address in your order before you submit it, and notify us of errors or omissions as soon as possible.

        All items purchased on Spectacles.com are purchased pursuant to a shipment contract. Risk of loss and title for all Products you order from us transfers to you as soon as we deliver the Products to the carrier. If Products arrive damaged or defective, please check our Return Policy and contact us.




    Payment, Cost, Fees, and Taxes
    

        Payment Methods. We accept a variety of payment methods, as reflected in the purchase tool. Before you can submit your order you will be required to provide us or our third-party payment processor with a valid payment card number and associated payment information that you are authorized to use. By submitting that information to us or to our third-party payment processor, you authorize us or the payment processor (as applicable) to charge your card or other payment method at our convenience, including as early as at the time you submit your order. We will bill your card or other payment method for the price of the Products you have purchased, plus shipping and taxes as noted in the purchase tool.
      

        Cost, Fees, and Taxes. Please confirm that all details of your purchase are correct before submitting your order. If your order is subject to sales taxes or other governmental fees, this will be included in the price displayed at checkout. When you submit your order, you agree to pay us the cost of the Products in your order, along with any delivery charges, taxes and fees as stated in the purchase tool. Failure to pay us those costs will result in cancellation of your order.

        You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your purchase, at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. For example, if you purchase with a payment card issued through a bank based outside the United States, your bank may charge you foreign transaction fees and other similar fees.
Your payment will be processed before the Products are sent for delivery. You authorize us or our third-party payment processor to store your payment card information to charge your payment method and handle refunds in connection with your order.
If we do not receive payment from your payment card or other payment method issuer or their agents, you remain obligated and agree to pay all amounts due upon request from us or our agents.
Unless you notify us of any discrepancies within 60 days after they first appear on your payment card or other payment statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you.


        Account Codes/Credits. We may on occasion provide a code or credit in an amount determined by us. These codes and credits will be subject to additional terms and restrictions that we will provide to you, including expiration dates, non-transferability, and limitations on the products and services to which they may be applicable.
      

        Other Payment Terms. Your payment card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card, and you must refer to that agreement and not these Terms to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. If you elect to pay by using the services of a third-party provider made available in the purchase tool, your use of those services is subject to the third-party provider’s terms and conditions.

        YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY UNAUTHORIZED AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD BY A THIRD PARTY.




    Communications from Us. We may send you other emails about your order, including about status, payment processing, refunds, and any changes, updates, or cancellations to your order. We may also send you emails about the Products or our other products and services. By submitting your order, you consent to receive the email communications described in these Terms from us and our affiliates.

    You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that they be in writing.


    Our Right to Cancel. We reserve the right to decline or cancel your order in our sole discretion (prior to order confirmation) or for specific reasons (at any time). We may need to decline your order, for example, if the Product you ordered is no longer available, if there is a pricing error, if you live in an area or at an address where we cannot or do not deliver Products, or if we suspect you are purchasing Products to resell them or use them for commercial purposes.

    If we decline or cancel your order we’ll notify you at the email address you submitted with your order and, if your payment card has already been charged, we will refund the amount we billed you.


    Your Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant that all information you have provided to us in connection with your order and your purchase is accurate and complete; and you will not use any payment card or other form of payment to purchase a Product unless you have all necessary legal authorization to do so.

    If you are submitting an order on behalf of a business, you further represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the business with the authority to bind the business to these Terms and agree on behalf of the business to be bound by these Terms.


3. Refunds, Exchanges, Returns, and Cancellations
For information about cancelling your order, or processing a refund or exchange, please see our Returns & Exchanges page. For information about our right to cancel online orders, please see the Online Orders provision of these Terms.
4. Your Representations and Warranties


    You represent and warrant that (i) neither you, nor, if you are a business, any affiliated company, are included on any of the restricted party lists maintained by the U.S. Government, including the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) and the Denied Parties List, Unverified List, and Entity List maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security; (ii) you (if you are a business) are not owned or controlled by such a restricted party; and (iii) you are not resident in, located in, or organized under the laws of any country with which trade is prohibited by OFAC or other applicable sanctions.
  

    You acknowledge that Spectacles are subject to U.S. and other export control, sanctions, import, and customs laws—for example, 15 C.F.R. Parts 730-774 and 31 C.F.R. Parts 500-599 (collectively, “Trade Control Laws”). You agree to comply with Trade Control Laws and will not export, reexport, transfer, or import the Spectacles contrary to Trade Control Laws or for use in any sanctioned countries, by any restricted parties, or for any restricted end uses.
  

    For your representations and warranties related to online orders, please see the Online Orders provision of these Terms.
  

5. Your Indemnification to Us
You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Snap Inc., our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to (a) your use of the Products; (b) your violation or alleged violation of any laws in connection with your use of the Products; (c) any fraud or misrepresentation by you; or (d) any violation or alleged violation of these Terms by you, including any actual or alleged breach of your representations, warranties, and obligations.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL SNAP INC., SNAP INC.’S LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, MULTIPLE, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OF THE PRODUCTS. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    From time to time, we may revise these Terms. You can determine when these Terms were last revised by referring to the “Effective” date at the top of the Terms. Please read the Introduction to understand when the new Terms become effective. You will be bound by the version of the Terms you agree to when you purchase Products or pair your Spectacles.
  

    Any provision of these Terms that expressly or by its nature is intended to remain in effect on or after order cancellation, termination of these Terms, or the expiration of licenses granted in these Terms, will survive and will continue to bind you and us after that cancellation, termination, or expiration.
  

9. Events Beyond Our Control
We will not be responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our obligations under these Terms or for any Product failure if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control.
10. General Terms


    These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
  

    If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.
  

    We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
  

    If any provision of these Terms is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms.
  

    To the extent permitted by law, you waive any applicable statutory or common-law right that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter.

Product Sales Terms and Conditions
(If you live outside the United States)
Effective: May 1, 2017
ARBITRATION NOTICE: The Arbitration provision of our Terms of Service applies to any purchases made on behalf of a business.
Introduction
Please read these Product Sales Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) carefully. These Terms apply to the purchase and use of Spectacles and other products available at spectacles.com (“Products”). They also govern your use of the software and firmware (“Licensed Software”) that lets you pair and use your Spectacles with Snapchat. Our Products and Licensed Software are “Services” as defined in our Terms of Service.
If you live outside the United States or if you are using the Services on behalf of a business with its principal place of business located outside of the United States, these Terms form a legally binding contract between you and us as follows:


Online purchases: If you purchase Spectacles from us online, these Terms form a contract between you and Snap Group Limited. You will be asked to agree to these Terms at different times—once when you place an order and again when you pair (or re-pair) your Spectacles with Snapchat—so it’s important to know which version you are agreeing to. Whenever you submit an order or pair your Spectacles, we’ll present you with the Terms then in effect, so you'll always be able to review what you are agreeing to ahead of time. The Online Orders provision of these Terms will apply to your order even if we later update that provision. For all other provisions of these Terms, the Terms in effect when you pair (or re-pair) your Spectacles will supersede the Terms you agreed to when you bought your Spectacles.
  

Other purchases: For any other Spectacles purchased from us, your Spectacles are sold to you by Snap Group Limited (or a local Snap affiliate if a different company is named on your receipt). The Terms in effect will be made available when you make your purchase. The Returns & Exchanges policies in force at the time of your purchase will apply to your purchase even if we later update those policies. For all other provisions of these Terms, you’ll be asked to agree to the Terms then in effect when you pair (or re-pair) your Spectacles. Those Terms will supersede any prior versions you may have agreed to, and will form a contract between you and Snap Group Limited.
  

If you live in the United States or are using the Services on behalf of a business with its principal place of business located there, a separate set of Product Sales Terms and Conditions applies.
These Terms are important as they include details about payment, refunds, and cancellations. Please print a copy of these Terms and keep them for your reference.
Additional terms specific to the country in which you live (or if you are submitting an order on behalf of a business, the country in which the business’s principal place of business is located) may apply; please see the end of these Terms for details of those terms.
These Terms incorporate by reference our Terms of Service and our Products Warranty, so please read each of them carefully. Please review our Privacy Policy to learn how we handle information when you use the Services. You agree that we can collect, use, and share your information consistent with that policy. To the extent these Terms conflict with our Terms of Service or any written insert included in the packaging with your Products, these Terms govern.
By submitting your order to purchase Products, or pairing your Spectacles with Snapchat, you affirm that you are at least 18 years old (or older if the age of majority where you live so requires) and are competent and authorized to agree to and abide by these Terms. If you want to make a purchase and are under the age of majority, you must have the express permission from your authorized parent or guardian.
If you submit an order on behalf of a business, you affirm that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business. You agree that the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout these Terms, apply to both you and the business, as applicable.
1. Your Use of the Products
All Products are sold only for personal, non-commercial use or to give as a gift. You may not make the Products available for commercial resale, or use the Products for any commercial purpose without our prior consent.


    Spectacles Compatibility and Warnings. Please read our Spectacles Compatibility & Attribution and Spectacles Warnings pages to assess whether your device is compatible with Spectacles and to read our product warnings. We will not be liable to you (to pay a refund or otherwise) if your device does not meet the compatibility requirements in the Spectacles Compatibility & Attribution page or for any issue we make you aware of in the Spectacles Warnings page or at the time of purchase.

    Also keep in mind that you’ll need the Snapchat application to download, view, and store the content you create on Spectacles.


    Third-Party Products. Any warranties we provide only apply to the Products specifically named in our Products Warranty. We are not responsible for any loss of data or damage to the Products if you use them with third-party products, and we are not responsible for any damage to third-party products you use with the Products without our authorization. Please see our Products Warranty for more information on what is and is not covered.
  

    Licensed Software Grant. For Spectacles, we grant you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable license to use the Licensed Software on the following terms:

    This license terminates automatically if you fail to comply with the restrictions described below. You may use the Licensed Software solely as incorporated into the Spectacles and for your personal use. We may provide, and automatically download and install, upgrades, updates, or other new features to the Licensed Software, all of which will be subject to the rights and restrictions of these Terms. Unless such restrictions are prohibited by applicable law, you may not, and will not allow any third party to (or facilitate their ability to): (i) alter, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Licensed Software (except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restrictions); (ii) attempt to (1) defeat, avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or otherwise circumvent any software protection mechanisms in the Licensed Software, including any such mechanism used to restrict or control the functionality of the Licensed Software; or (2) derive the source code or the underlying ideas, algorithms, structure, or organization from the Licensed Software; (iii) create derivative works based on the Licensed Software, or any portion thereof; (iv) copy the Licensed Software; (v) remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Products or Licensed Software; or (vi) use the Licensed Software in any manner other than as embedded in the Spectacles.
None of the Licensed Software may be downloaded, exported, or re-exported in contravention of law. The Licensed Software is licensed, not sold, under these Terms. Title, ownership rights, and IP rights in and to the Licensed Software remains in (as applicable) us and our licensors and affiliates.


2. Online Orders
This Section applies exclusively to online orders.


    Orders, Pricing, and Shipping
    

        Orders. After you submit your order, we’ll process it and, if your order is accepted, we’ll send you an order confirmation email to the email address you provided. That email will include an estimated shipping date. We may need to carry out verifications before accepting your order. If you have any questions or notice an error in an order you’ve submitted, please contact us through our Support page. All orders are subject to availability of stock.

        We reserve the right any time prior to sending an order confirmation email to reject or cancel your order, or change quantities available for purchase.


        Pricing. We may in our sole discretion change Product prices prospectively without notice. While we do our best to describe the Products as accurately as possible, if any pricing or specification error occurs, we have the right to refuse or cancel your order in our sole discretion at any time prior to order confirmation (or later if the error is obvious). Please note that we do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.
      

        Shipping. We offer delivery of Products to valid addresses within these territories. Estimated shipping dates are not guarantees, but your Products will not arrive later than 8 weeks from your order confirmation. You’ll need to provide us with your shipping address when you submit your order. We’re not responsible for any errors in what you submit, and we are not obliged to determine correct shipping information if what you’ve submitted is not correct. Please carefully review the shipping address in your order before you submit it, and notify us of errors or omissions as soon as possible.

        All items purchased on Spectacles.com are purchased pursuant to a shipment contract. Risk of loss and title for all Products you order from us transfers to you as soon as we deliver the Products to the carrier (unless otherwise stated in the Country-Specific Terms provision that apply to you). If Products arrive damaged or defective, please check our Return Policy and contact us.




    Payment, Cost, Fees, and Taxes
    

        Payment Methods. We accept a variety of payment methods, as reflected in the purchase tool. Before you can submit your order you will be required to provide us or our third-party payment processor with a valid payment card number and associated payment information that you are authorized to use. By submitting that information to us or to our third-party payment processor, you authorize us or the payment processor (as applicable) to charge your card or other payment method at our convenience, including as early as at the time you submit your order. We will bill your card or other payment method for the price of the Products you have purchased, plus shipping and taxes as noted in the purchase tool.
      

        Cost, Fees, and Taxes. Please confirm that all details of your purchase are correct before submitting your order. If your order is subject to value-added tax (VAT) or other governmental fees, this will be included in the price displayed at checkout. When you submit your order, you agree to pay us the cost of the Products in your order, along with any delivery charges, taxes and fees as stated in the purchase tool. Failure to pay us those costs will result in cancellation of your order.

        You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your purchase, at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. For example, if you purchase with a payment card issued through a bank based outside the territory where you make your purchase, your bank may charge you foreign transaction fees and other similar fees.
Your payment will be processed before the Products are sent for delivery. You authorize us or our third-party payment processor to store your payment card information to charge your payment method and handle refunds in connection with your order.
If we do not receive payment from your payment card or other payment method issuer or their agents, you remain obliged and agree to pay all amounts due upon request from us or our agents.


        Account Codes/Credits. We may on occasion provide a code or credit in an amount determined by us. These codes and credits will be subject to additional terms and restrictions that we will provide to you, including expiration dates, non-transferability, and limitations on the products and services to which they may be applicable.
      

        Other Payment Terms. Your payment card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card, and you must refer to that agreement and not these Terms to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. If you elect to pay by using the services of a third-party provider made available in the purchase tool, your use of those services is subject to the third-party provider’s terms and conditions.

        You are responsible for paying any unauthorized amounts billed to your payment method by a third party.




    Communications from Us. We may send you other emails about your order, including about status, payment processing, refunds, and any changes, updates, or cancellations to your order. We may also send you emails about the Products or our other products and services. By submitting your order, you consent to receive the email communications described in these Terms from us and our affiliates.

    You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that they be in writing.


    Our Right to Cancel. We reserve the right to decline or cancel your order in our sole discretion (prior to order confirmation) or for specific reasons (at any time). We may need to decline your order, for example, if the Product you ordered is no longer available, if there is a pricing error, if you live in an area or at an address where we cannot or do not deliver Products, or if we suspect you are purchasing Products to resell them or use them for commercial purposes.

    If we decline or cancel your order we’ll notify you at the email address you submitted with your order and, if your payment card has already been charged, we will refund the amount we billed you.


    Your Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant that all information you have provided to us in connection with your order and your purchase is accurate and complete; and you will not use any payment card or other form of payment to purchase a Product unless you have all necessary legal authorization to do so.

    If you are submitting an order on behalf of a business, you further represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the business with the authority to bind the business to these Terms and agree on behalf of the business to be bound by these Terms.


3. Refunds, Exchanges, Returns, and Cancellations
For information about cancelling your order, or processing a refund or exchange, please see our Returns & Exchanges page. For information about our right to cancel online orders, please see the Online Orders provision of these Terms.
4. Your Representations and Warranties


    You represent and warrant that (i) neither you, nor, if you are a business, any affiliated company, are included on any restricted party list maintained by the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, or other relevant government authority -- for example, the U.S. Specially Designated Nationals List, Foreign Sanctions Evaders List, Denied Parties List, Unverified List, and Entity List, and the UK and EU consolidated lists of persons and entities subject to financial sanctions targets; (ii) you (if you are a business) are not owned or controlled by such a restricted party; and (iii) you are not resident in, located in, or organized under the laws of any country with which trade is prohibited by the sanctions described above.
  

    The Products may be subject to import and export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international import and export laws, customs laws, regulations that apply in connection with the Products, including restrictions on destinations, users, and end use.
  

    For your representations and warranties related to online orders, please see the Online Orders provision of these Terms.
  

5. Your Indemnification to Us
You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., and our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to (a) your misuse of the Products; (b) your violation or alleged violation of any laws in connection with your use of the Products; (c) any fraud or misrepresentation by you; or (d) any violation or alleged violation of these Terms by you, including any actual or alleged breach of your representations, warranties, and obligations.
This section will not apply to the extent it is not permitted by the law in the country where you are located.
6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability
In addition to the disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions contained in our Terms of Service relating to the Services, and in our Products Warranty, the following disclaimers and limitations of liability apply specifically to the Licensed Software and the purchase and use of Products. Nothing in these Terms will affect any rights you are guaranteed under the laws of your country.


Licensed Software. To the fullest extent permitted by law, none of Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., our licensors or affiliates, nor their respective licensors, makes any warranty or representation, express or implied, with respect to the Licensed Software, and without limiting the foregoing, each expressly disclaims to the fullest extent permitted by law any implied warranties of merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement of third-party rights with respect to the Licensed Software.


Products. To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Snap Group Limited, Snap Inc., our licensors or affiliates, nor their respective licensors, be liable for any accident, injury, death, loss, or other claim related to or resulting from the misuse of the Products. We specifically advise you against using the Spectacles in a manner inconsistent with these Terms, our warnings, our compatibility page, and other accompanying documentation.



      General. If we fail to comply with any of our obligations under these Terms, we will be responsible for any loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of contract or negligence, but our aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Products or Licensed Software will not exceed the greater of Euro €100 or the amount you paid us for any Products in the last 12 months. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it is an obvious consequence of our breach of contract (or negligence) or if it was contemplated by you and us at the time you placed the order. We will not be responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable.

      We only supply Products for domestic and private use and therefore we will not be responsible if you suffer any loss of profit, business, business opportunity or business interruption that you may incur as a consequence of using the Products, the Licensed Software and/or any failure to comply with the Terms.



Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, nothing in this section affects (i) your statutory rights as a consumer; or (ii) any liability for death or personal injury resulting from our intent or negligence; fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law.


This section does not limit our own separate warranty with respect to the Products as set out in our Products Warranty.


The disclaimers and limitations set out in this section will not apply to the extent they are not permitted by the law in your country. Please see the Country-Specific Terms provision that apply to you.


7. Governing Law and Disputes Between You and Us

    From time to time, we may revise these Terms. You can determine when these Terms were last revised by referring to the “Effective” date at the top of the Terms. Please read the Introduction to understand when the new Terms become effective. You will be bound by the version of the Terms you agree to when you purchase Products or pair your Spectacles.
  

    Any provision of these Terms that expressly or by its nature is intended to remain in effect on or after order cancellation, termination of these Terms, or the expiration of licenses granted in these Terms, will survive and will continue to bind you and us after that cancellation, termination, or expiration.
  

9. Events Beyond Our Control
We will not be responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our obligations under these Terms or for any Product failure if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control. This does not affect your rights under the applicable law in your country.
10. General Terms


    These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
  

    If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.
  

    We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
  

    If any provision of these Terms is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms.
  

    To the extent permitted by law, you waive any applicable statutory or common-law right that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter.
  

    We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time with reasonable notice, where practicable. These Terms may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without our prior written consent.

12. Country-Specific Terms
If you live in or are using the Services on behalf of a business with its principal place of business located in any of the countries listed below, the additional terms listed for that country apply to you. If you live in or are using the Services on behalf of a business located within the European Union or EEA, the European Union and EEA terms apply to you in addition to any terms for your specific country.
European Union and EEA:
Faulty Products
We will provide you with the Products you’ve paid for in accordance with these Terms, as required by law. If you’re an individual consumer (not a business), the law requires that the Products we provide will be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, meet any description we give to you, and match any sample we may have provided to you.
If your Product is faulty or not as described, please refer to our Returns & Exchanges page. Our Return Policy and our Products Warranty are in addition to and do not affect your legal rights in your country, which may include a right for your Product to be repaired or replaced free of charge, a right to reject a Product and receive a full refund, and/or a right to a price reduction or full refund where the Product cannot be repaired or replaced after one or more attempts. In some countries, you only have these rights for a limited time. For example, if you live in Italy or France we will only be responsible for any non-conformity for a period of 2 years from delivery and in Italy you must notify us of any non-conformity within 2 months of discovering it.
Right to Cancel


    If you would like to exercise your 30 day right to change your mind set out in our Return Policy (“Right to Cancel”), you must notify us within the 30 day cancellation period referred to in that policy. You may do this using the form on the Returns & Exchanges page, or you may do this by completing this form and sending it to us at spectaclessupport@snap.com.

History[edit]
In December 2014 Snap Inc., then Snapchat Inc., acquired Vergence Labs, the developers of the Epiphany Eyewear smartglasses.[3] Epiphany Eyewear, which recorded wide-angle point-of-view videos, had been positioned as Vergence's first step toward eventually building biometrically-controlled augmented reality glasses which they hoped would someday "give people what would previously be called superpowers". [4] However, due to Vergence's extremely small engineering team (consisting solely of electrical engineer Jon Rodriguez, software engineer Peter Brook, and mechanical engineer David Meisenholder), the company had to scale back its ambitions in order to ship a much simpler first product, Epiphany Eyewear, which they could manage to deliver despite the extremely limited size of their team. [5] The successful development and launch of this minimum-viable product led to the company being noticed by Snapchat, which quietly acquired them, bringing them in-house to develop a similar but much more powerful and refined eyewear product for Snapchat. On October 2015, a video leaked online showed an early version of the new glasses, dubbed "Spectacles".[6] Furthermore, news outlets reported employee hirings from companies such as from Microsoft, Nokia and Qualcomm[7][8][9] and Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel was seen wearing the prototype in public according to a report by Business Insider in June.[10]
After Snapchat Inc.'s rebrand to Snap Inc. on September 24, 2016, the product was unveiled and announced on the same day.[11] The product was released on November 10, 2016 when the first Snapbot, a proprietary vending machine for the smartglasses, was located near Snap's headquarters in Venice, Los Angeles.[12]
Design[edit]
Hardware[edit]
The glasses consist of two separate houses within the sides of the frame for the battery and camera. The camera lens has a 115° field of view and records in a circular format that adapts to a smartphone's screen size and orientation.[13] The smartglasses record when the user presses a button on the top left of its frame, up to a maximum of 10 seconds and syncs with its designated smartphone via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.[14] The camera also houses a ring of LED lights that indicate the battery level, when the camera is recording, etc. The pair of glasses charge in a yellow case that has a built-in battery and connects to its proprietary cable.[15] The cable can be attached either to the case or directly to the glasses. According to the manufacturer, the fully charged case will hold enough power to recharge the glasses four times.[16] The lithium-ion batteries in both the case and the glasses draw power from a standard 5 volt USB power supply, and connect via a USB cable which is held in place by small magnets.
Software[edit]
The glasses are exclusive to Snap Inc.'s service, Snapchat. They are paired by looking at the user's account Snapcode and pressing the button on the glasses frame, as well as connecting to them via Bluetooth (for iOS devices).[17] [18] The videos taken on the glasses are stored internally within the camera and can be viewed and individually uploaded in the "Memories" section of Snapchat.[19]
Snapbot[edit]




A Snapbot vending machine in Berlin.


A Snapbot is a proprietary pop-up vending machine developed and manufactured by Snap Inc.[20] It is designed for the exclusive distribution of Spectacles and is randomly placed anywhere in the United States for the duration of a day, with the exception of Venice, Los Angeles, as well as a previous location in New York City, operating through a pop-up store. The machine has three buttons for the Spectacles' color options: coral, black and teal and has a dispenser in the shape of a semicircle-esque smile.[21] It allows the person to virtually "try on" the glasses using Snapchat's lens technology and the dispenser illuminates when the Spectacles are dispensed.[22]

Spectacles are a pair of smartglasses[clarification needed] developed and manufactured by Snap Inc., announced on September 23, 2016, during Snap Inc's rebrand from Snapchat Inc. and released on November 10. They are made for Snap's image messaging and multimedia platform Snapchat and were initially distributed exclusively through Snap's pop-up vending machine, Snapbot. On February 20, 2017, Snap Spectacles became available for purchase online.[2]

History[edit]
In December 2014 Snap Inc., then Snapchat Inc., acquired Vergence Labs, the developers of the Epiphany Eyewear smartglasses.[3] Epiphany Eyewear, which recorded wide-angle point-of-view videos, had been positioned as Vergence's first step toward eventually building biometrically-controlled augmented reality glasses which they hoped would someday "give people what would previously be called superpowers". [4] However, due to Vergence's extremely small engineering team (consisting solely of electrical engineer Jon Rodriguez, software engineer Peter Brook, and mechanical engineer David Meisenholder), the company had to scale back its ambitions in order to ship a much simpler first product, Epiphany Eyewear, which they could manage to deliver despite the extremely limited size of their team. [5] The successful development and launch of this minimum-viable product led to the company being noticed by Snapchat, which quietly acquired them, bringing them in-house to develop a similar but much more powerful and refined eyewear product for Snapchat. On October 2015, a video leaked online showed an early version of the new glasses, dubbed "Spectacles".[6] Furthermore, news outlets reported employee hirings from companies such as from Microsoft, Nokia and Qualcomm[7][8][9] and Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel was seen wearing the prototype in public according to a report by Business Insider in June.[10]
After Snapchat Inc.'s rebrand to Snap Inc. on September 24, 2016, the product was unveiled and announced on the same day.[11] The product was released on November 10, 2016 when the first Snapbot, a proprietary vending machine for the smartglasses, was located near Snap's headquarters in Venice, Los Angeles.[12]
Design[edit]
Hardware[edit]
The glasses consist of two separate houses within the sides of the frame for the battery and camera. The camera lens has a 115° field of view and records in a circular format that adapts to a smartphone's screen size and orientation.[13] The smartglasses record when the user presses a button on the top left of its frame, up to a maximum of 10 seconds and syncs with its designated smartphone via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.[14] The camera also houses a ring of LED lights that indicate the battery level, when the camera is recording, etc. The pair of glasses charge in a yellow case that has a built-in battery and connects to its proprietary cable.[15] The cable can be attached either to the case or directly to the glasses. According to the manufacturer, the fully charged case will hold enough power to recharge the glasses four times.[16] The lithium-ion batteries in both the case and the glasses draw power from a standard 5 volt USB power supply, and connect via a USB cable which is held in place by small magnets.
Software[edit]
The glasses are exclusive to Snap Inc.'s service, Snapchat. They are paired by looking at the user's account Snapcode and pressing the button on the glasses frame, as well as connecting to them via Bluetooth (for iOS devices).[17] [18] The videos taken on the glasses are stored internally within the camera and can be viewed and individually uploaded in the "Memories" section of Snapchat.[19]
Snapbot[edit]




A Snapbot vending machine in Berlin.


A Snapbot is a proprietary pop-up vending machine developed and manufactured by Snap Inc.[20] It is designed for the exclusive distribution of Spectacles and is randomly placed anywhere in the United States for the duration of a day, with the exception of Venice, Los Angeles, as well as a previous location in New York City, operating through a pop-up store. The machine has three buttons for the Spectacles' color options: coral, black and teal and has a dispenser in the shape of a semicircle-esque smile.[21] It allows the person to virtually "try on" the glasses using Snapchat's lens technology and the dispenser illuminates when the Spectacles are dispensed.[22]

  military, ground, naval, or air service.


  An "active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran" means a veteran who served on active

  Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our
  employees to update their information every five years.  You may voluntarily
  self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment
  because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.

How do I know if I have a disability?

No, I don't have a disability
I don't wish to answer

Reasonable Accommodation Notice

  Federal law requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified
  individuals with disabilities. Please tell us if you require a reasonable accommodation
  to apply for a job or to perform your job.  Examples of reasonable accommodation
  include making a change to the application process or work procedures, providing
  documents in an alternate format, using a sign language interpreter, or using
  specialized equipment.
