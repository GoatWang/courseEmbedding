SummaryGlenhaven Global II LP utilizes a fully systematic approach intended to capture trends, both long and short, across 60+ diversified futures markets.  The Fund is calibrated for a high degree of volatility in an aim to offer investors an efficient vehicle for gaining exposure to trend following.  Investment Strategy  The Fund employs several different systems that are all trend following in nature, but set to capture moves within different time frames that range from the medium-term to the long-term.  The Fund's strategy underwent a major change in mid-2015 that became fully implemented by January 2016.  Prior to the change, the Fund employed a single, medium-term trend following system that only took on long positions.  After several years of research, Glenhaven implemented the addition of a longer-term system to handle long positions and a separate system for handling short positions that we believe together strongly enhance the risk/return profile of the overall Program.Risk ManagementInstead of relying on large concentrated positions in an effort to generate outsized returns, the Fund strategy is intentionally agnostic to the market being traded and applies the same sizing formula to all positions.  The result is that no single position should be a significant driver of performance relative to the overall volatility of the Fund.
