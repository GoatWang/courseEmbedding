Leading Litigators Richard Wallace and Peter Condron Join Crowell & Moring's Mass Tort, Product, and Consumer Litigation Group
Both focus  on mass tort and product liability defense involving states, municipalities, and  plaintiffs  
Washington – June 1, 2017: Crowell & Moring LLP is  pleased to announce the arrival of partners Richard E. (Rick) Wallace Jr. and  Peter C. (Pete) Condron to the firm's Mass Tort, Product, and Consumer  Litigation Group. Wallace and Condron are recognized trial lawyers in  commercial, toxic tort, product liability, and environmental matters, and they  are among the foremost litigators handling high-exposure environmental  litigation brought by state attorneys general, municipalities, consumer  advocates, and plaintiffs. Their arrival strengthens Crowell & Moring’s  capabilities to defend clients in product liability and environmental  litigation in courts across the United States.
Both lawyers join the firm from Sedgwick LLP. Wallace has  35 years of experience handling complex civil litigation and arbitration. He  serves as national trial counsel and coordinating counsel for major clients in  mass tort matters and has structured and implemented settlements worth hundreds  of millions of dollars in the aggregate. Condron offers more than 25 years  of experience in toxic torts and commercial cases, including class actions and  multidistrict litigation. 
“Rick and Pete are highly regarded in the industry and  are significant additions to the firm,” said Angela Styles, chair of Crowell &  Moring. “They have successfully represented some of the largest corporations in  the world, including major oil companies and other corporate clients, and their  arrival further bolsters the firm’s environmental litigation capabilities  nationwide.” 
“Rick and Pete have a demonstrated record of success  handling nationwide mass tort cases,” said Scott L. Winkelman, chair of Crowell &  Moring’s Mass Tort, Product, and Consumer Litigation Group. “Their capabilities  in the area of product liability defense and environmental litigation are  unsurpassed and will be an invaluable addition to our practice. As important,  both share our values, are collegial and team-oriented, and are committed to  top-flight client service.”
Wallace has defended hundreds of tort and contract cases  nationwide, with these matters often spanning multiple venues and involving  hundreds, thousands or millions of claimants. His practice focuses on product  liability defense and environmental matters. Additionally, he has prosecuted  civil claims ranging from intellectual property to insurance coverage. He has  represented clients across state and federal courts in nearly 40  jurisdictions, including at the appellate level, and arbitrated cases  around the world. 
One concentration that Wallace and Condron share is litigation  over a gasoline additive known as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Together,  they have defended hundreds of product liability cases over MTBE from across  the country, most of them consolidated in a multidistrict litigation in federal  court in Manhattan. 
Wallace has also represented four oil companies in a  putative nationwide class action in which he was appointed by the court as  liaison counsel for the industry. He represented three companies in another  putative national class action and several companies in putative statewide and  regional class actions around the nation. Wallace is recognized as a leading  litigator by Chambers, Super  Lawyers, and Who’s Who. He  is a fellow of Litigation Counsel of America and the Chartered Institute of  Arbitrators.
“Crowell & Moring offers one of the finest platforms  to represent major clients in need of regulatory and trial counsel, including  companies in the energy sector,” Wallace said. “Our clients will benefit from  the firm’s deep experience amid the fast-changing regulatory environment.” He  added, “The world-class resources of Crowell & Moring enable us to  litigate effectively and efficiently the most complex, high-exposure cases,  including cases by state attorneys general and government agencies.”
Condron defends major oil companies in product  liability litigation, class action lawsuits, and property damage claims. He  obtained a defense verdict for a major gasoline refiner in a gasoline additive  product liability action in New York state court and successfully defended that  verdict on appeal. On behalf of a major oil company, he helped obtain dismissal  of a putative class action alleging that certain gasoline products were  defective. He also represents corporate clients in contract disputes, antitrust  matters, arbitrations, and other commercial litigation at both the trial court  and appellate levels in federal and state courts, and he counsels clients on  non-litigation matters. 
“I have long known Crowell & Moring as a firm of  tremendous caliber, and I am delighted to join its ranks,” Condron said. “I  look forward to working with my new colleagues on our clients’ most challenging  litigation matters.”
Wallace received his J.D. from Harvard Law  School and his B.A. from the University of Massachusetts at  Amherst, magna cum laude.  Condron earned his J.D. from William and Mary Law School and his B.S. from St.  John's University. Condron is the co-chair of the American Bar  Association’s Environmental Litigation and Toxic Torts Committee, Section of  Environment.
The arrival of Wallace and Condron comes just more than a  month after the firm welcomed partner Peter Gray and senior  counsel John D. Conner Jr., authorities on chemicals  and pesticides law, to the firm's Environment & Natural Resources  Group.

Leading Litigators Richard Wallace and Peter Condron Join Crowell & Moring’s Mass Tort, Product, and Consumer Litigation Group

Thursday, June 1, 2017








Crowell & Moring LLP is pleased to announce the arrival of partners Richard E. (Rick) Wallace Jr. and Peter C. (Pete) Condron to the firm’s Mass Tort, Product, and Consumer Litigation Group. Wallace and Condron are recognized trial lawyers in commercial, toxic tort, product liability, and environmental matters, and they are among the foremost litigators handling high-exposure environmental litigation brought by state attorneys general, municipalities, consumer advocates, and plaintiffs. Their arrival strengthens Crowell & Moring’s capabilities to defend clients in product liability and environmental litigation in courts across the United States.
Both lawyers join the firm from Sedgwick LLP. Wallace has 35 years of experience handling complex civil litigation and arbitration. He serves as national trial counsel and coordinating counsel for major clients in mass tort matters and has structured and implemented settlements worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the aggregate. Condron offers more than 25 years of experience in toxic torts and commercial cases, including class actions and multidistrict litigation.
“Rick and Pete are highly regarded in the industry and are significant additions to the firm,” said Angela Styles, chair of Crowell & Moring. “They have successfully represented some of the largest corporations in the world, including major oil companies and other corporate clients, and their arrival further bolsters the firm’s environmental litigation capabilities nationwide.”
“Rick and Pete have a demonstrated record of success handling nationwide mass tort cases,” said Scott L. Winkelman, chair of Crowell & Moring’s Mass Tort, Product, and Consumer Litigation Group. “Their capabilities in the area of product liability defense and environmental litigation are unsurpassed and will be an invaluable addition to our practice. As important, both share our values, are collegial and team-oriented, and are committed to top-flight client service.”
Wallace has defended hundreds of tort and contract cases nationwide, with these matters often spanning multiple venues and involving hundreds, thousands or millions of claimants. His practice focuses on product liability defense and environmental matters. Additionally, he has prosecuted civil claims ranging from intellectual property to insurance coverage. He has represented clients across state and federal courts in nearly 40 jurisdictions, including at the appellate level, and arbitrated cases around the world.
One concentration that Wallace and Condron share is litigation over a gasoline additive known as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Together, they have defended hundreds of product liability cases over MTBE from across the country, most of them consolidated in a multidistrict litigation in federal court in Manhattan.
Wallace has also represented four oil companies in a putative nationwide class action in which he was appointed by the court as liaison counsel for the industry. He represented three companies in another putative national class action and several companies in putative statewide and regional class actions around the nation. Wallace is recognized as a leading litigator by Chambers, Super Lawyers, and Who’s Who. He is a fellow of Litigation Counsel of America and the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators.
“Crowell & Moring offers one of the finest platforms to represent major clients in need of regulatory and trial counsel, including companies in the energy sector,” Wallace said. “Our clients will benefit from the firm’s deep experience amid the fast-changing regulatory environment.” He added, “The world-class resources of Crowell & Moring enables us to litigate effectively and efficiently the most complex, high-exposure cases, including cases by state attorneys general and government agencies.”
Condron defends major oil companies in product liability litigation, class action lawsuits, and property damage claims. He obtained a defense verdict for a major gasoline refiner in a gasoline additive product liability action in New York state court and successfully defended that verdict on appeal. On behalf of a major oil company, he helped obtain dismissal of a putative class action alleging that certain gasoline products were defective. He also represents corporate clients in contract disputes, antitrust matters, arbitrations, and other commercial litigation at both the trial court and appellate levels in federal and state courts, and he counsels clients on non-litigation matters.
“I have long known Crowell & Moring as a firm of tremendous caliber, and I am delighted to join its ranks,” Condron said. “I look forward to working with my new colleagues on our clients’ most challenging litigation matters.”
Wallace received his J.D. from Harvard Law School and his B.A. from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, magna cum laude. Condron earned his J.D. from William and Mary Law School and his B.S. from St. John’s University. Condron is the co-chair of the American Bar Association’s Environmental Litigation and Toxic Torts Committee, Section of Environment.
The arrival of Wallace and Condron comes just more than a month after the firm welcomed partner Peter Gray and senior counsel John D. Conner Jr., authorities on chemicals and pesticides law, to the firm’s Environment & Natural Resources Group.

Peter C. Condron is a partner in the Mass Tort,  Product, and Consumer Litigation Group. He is a veteran litigator who focuses  his practice on toxic tort, product liability, and commercial matters. He has  defended major oil companies in product liability litigation, class action  lawsuits, and property damage claims arising from gasoline spills. Pete has  also represented corporate clients in various contract disputes, antitrust  matters, arbitrations, and other commercial litigation at both the trial court  and appellate levels in federal and state courts. Along with representing major  oil companies, natural gas companies, and other corporate clients in  environmental, toxic tort, and product liability cases, Pete also counsels  clients on non-litigation matters.

                            Pete is committed to focused advocacy. Not all  issues in a dispute are of equal importance. Focused advocacy requires working  with a client to determine which issues are of primary importance to that  client and developing strategies to protect and defend those interests.

                            Pete has represented several major oil companies in  federal multidistrict gasoline additive litigation and a nationwide class  action involving underground storage tanks. He obtained a defense verdict for a  major gasoline refiner in a gasoline additive product liability action in New  York state court and successfully defended that verdict on appeal. On behalf of  a major oil company, he helped obtain dismissal of a putative class action  alleging that certain gasoline products were defective.
Representative Matters

Trial counsel for a  major oil company in an action alleging threats to water resources in New York  state court. Obtained defense judgment in a bench trial and successfully argued  appeal.
National counsel to major oil  companies in a putative class action alleging property damage resulting from  leaking underground gasoline storage tanks. Obtained summary judgment on behalf  of the client.
