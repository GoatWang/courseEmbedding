Suspect in custody after robbery of Derby AT&T store





WICHITA, Kansas – A man accused of shooting a woman inside a Derby AT&T store has made his first court appearance on Thursday.
James Michael Phillips appeared in a Sedgwick County courtroom Thursday. He is charged on several counts including attempted capital murder.
According to authorities, Phillips tried to rob the store Tuesday morning. Court documents say he ordered two employees to the back of the store at gunpoint and shot a 60-year-old woman multiple times. She was the only customer in the store at the time and was in critical condition at Wesley Medical Center as of Thursday evening.
Police say Phillips then led officers on a brief chase to south Wichita, during which he fired at a Derby police officer.
He is being held on $500,000 bond. It was not immediately clear if Philips has an attorney.

Man charged in Derby AT&T store robbery, shooting

James Michael Phillips, the man accused of holding up a Derby AT&T store on Tuesday and shooting a woman inside the store, made his first appearance Thursday in a Sedgwick County courtroom.
Phillips is charged with attempted capital murder, attempted first-degree murder, attempted aggravated kidnapping, two charges of attempted kidnapping, two charges of attempted aggravated robbery, one charge of criminal damage to property and one charge of fleeing or attempting to elude an officer.
According to police, Phillips attempted to rob the AT&T store at Rock and Madison shortly after 9 a.m. Tuesday. He ordered two employees to move to the back of the store at gunpoint, according to court documents.
Phillips then shot a 60-year-old woman, the only customer in the store, “multiple times,” Derby police said Tuesday.


He then led police officers on a brief chase on K-15 to south Wichita. During the chase, authorities said Phillips fired at a Derby police officer, leading to the attempted capital murder charge. 




A Wichita police officer had placed spike strips on K-15 near Pawnee, and when Phillips attempted to swerve around them, he crashed head-on into a patrol car, authorities said. The officer was outside of the vehicle and was not injured.
The woman who was shot in the AT&T store remained in critical condition at Wesley Medical Center on Thursday evening.
Appearing on a closed-circuit television monitor in Judge Joe Kisner’s courtroom, Phillips asked no questions when the charges were read against him.
Phillips is scheduled for a preliminary hearing at 9 a.m. Aug. 27. He is being held on a $500,000 bond.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Phillips James Michael carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Phillips James Michael



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Phillips James Michael



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Phillips James Michael



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
