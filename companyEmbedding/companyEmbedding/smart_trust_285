Dr. John LechleiterChairman, president and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company"Smart Trust is a deep look into a subject that is truly foundational to our collective success. It provides both practical and philosophical wisdom about what it takes to grant and gain trust. Recommended with enthusiasm!"
Warren BennisProfessor, University of Southern California, and author of Still Surprised: A Memoir of a Life in Leadership“Smart Trust is without doubt one of the most powerful and seminal books of our
age. It exposes and helps solve the most dangerous crisis apparent in almost all
human institutions: how to trust in a low-trust world.”
Larry King“From all the people I’ve interviewed, I’ve learned that trust is everything. Smart
Trust powerfully shows us how to increase it, which is more important than ever in
this low-trust world. The best leaders I’ve ever met have the ability to create trust.
Smart Trust is a great read! This is an important addition to your library.”


Bill GeorgeProfessor, Harvard Business School, and author of True North“Covey and Link hit the mark—again—with Smart Trust! As they illuminate
convincingly in this beautifully written book, nothing is more important than
building trust in relationships and in organizations. Trust is the glue that binds us
together. Everywhere I go I see a remarkable loss of trust in leaders, and once lost,
trust is very hard to regain. I feel this loss is tearing at the fabric of society, as so
many people love to blame others for their misfortunes but fail to look in the mirror
at themselves. They would do well to learn Smart Trust.”
Indra NooyiChairman & CEO, PepsiCo“...today’s volatile environment requires all companies—big and small—to think
again about what we do to build and rebuild trust, and to think again about how to
create, give, and add value. And most of all, it requires all companies to ensure that
we embrace not just the commercial idea of value, but the ethical ideal of values
too. Again, in a word, trust. These are our new realities. Stephen M. R. Covey and
Greg Link have written a wonderful book, Smart Trust, that confronts these new
realities head on—with practical solutions—and they do so in a way that is timely,
relevant, and actionable.” (from the Foreward)
Randall StephensonChairman, President, and CEO, AT&T“Trust is a critical component for any organization looking to improve productivity
and accelerate growth, and no one understands this as well as the Coveys. Their
approach helps companies move faster, make better decisions, and deliver quality
to customers; it can also help transform a corporate culture. That’s why we’ve
turned to Stephen M. R. Covey to help us train more than 100,000 AT&T managers,
and why I recommend Smart Trust to anyone trying to succeed in today’s fastpaced,
global business environment.”


Clayton M. ChristensenProfessor, Harvard Business School, and author of The Innovator’s Dilemma“Smart Trust is an insightful and actionable guidebook for creating high-trust
teams and cultures that spark innovation and growth. It teaches how to analyze
both people and situations and to make ‘smart’ decisions by managing risk and
optimizing possibilities. Those aspiring to influence people, enhance performance,
and increase innovation will want to read this insightful book and master its
principles.”
Michael WhiteChairman, President, and CEO, DirecTV“Trust is the essential ingredient for better teamwork. In this book, Covey and Link
provide inspirational stories and practical tips on how to practice Smart Trust,
which builds teamwork and high performance in life and in business. Smart Trust
takes trust to a whole new level of understanding. It is a must-read for anyone
looking to strengthen teamwork across functions and across entities, and even
within your own family.”
John GrayAuthor of Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus“Smart Trust elegantly addresses the most important relationship at home and at
work: Trust. It teaches you how to harmonize your head and your heart, resulting
in sound judgment. This is a life skill that few have mastered and is the key to
optimizing relationships for increasing success and fulfillment. Both Mars and
Venus can learn tremendously from reading Smart Trust.” 


Al CareyPresident and CEO, Frito-Lay, North America"We have employed Smart Trust in our entire culture. My team is now a different
team. It’s the most exciting change in the culture I’ve seen in the twenty-eight
years that I’ve been at PepsiCo, with most of those years at Frito-Lay. There’s a
buzz in this building. The team works as a team better than we’ve ever done
before. Our recent profit growth was the best in the last ten years in the worst
economic climate in ten years—I credit the principles in Smart Trust for our
breakthrough performance. I feel optimism for our future as next-generation
employees come up through the ranks mastering Smart Trust and learning to lead
with trust from the start.”
James QuigleyCEO, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu“At a time when confidence in business, government, and other institutions is at an
all-time low, leaders must be committed to building and maintaining trust. Smart
Trust offers powerful examples of how visionary leaders in all fields have
understood and addressed the challenges of sustaining trusting relationships—and
realized the unique benefits they confer.” 
Robert A. McDonaldChairman, President, and CEO, Procter & Gamble Company“Trust is the most fundamental currency of business, and it has long been one of
P&G’s five core values. Without public trust in our company and our brands, and
without internal trust in one another as colleagues and partners, we have no
business. It’s that simple. But with trust, we have unlimited opportunities to
collaborate, to grow, and to fulfill our purpose as a company. The job of every
leader at every level is to cultivate and protect trust, but this is especially
challenging in a distrustful world. Smart Trust shows the way; it is both a mind set
and a toolbox for 21 st-century leadership. I recommend it highly.” 


Muhammad Yunus2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner“Smart Trust persuasively demonstrates that trust is the key to our new global reality.
Growth in society can be traced to one individual trusting another. We have lost
our way and are afraid to trust. This powerful book shows how to regain trust,
prosper, and experience more energy and joy in the process. I highly recommend
it.” 
Yang YuanqingCEO, Lenovo“When Lenovo acquired IBM PC, we quickly realized that our biggest challenges
would not be in technology, supply chain, or even organizational structure. Our
biggest challenge was in building trust among our teams, with our customers and
partners, and with key influencers around the world. We partnered with Stephen M.
R. Covey to help us build trust and turn this challenge into an advantage. His ideas
worked then—and they are even more relevant and important today as we grow
globally. Global businesses must view trust as a top strategic priority. A company
can have an innovative spirit, great products, a strong strategy, and an efficient
business model. But only by creating, embracing, and leveraging trust can a
company truly thrive on the global landscape. Smart Trust delivers ideas that are
thought provoking, tools that work, and a perspective that I think is essential for
survival and success on the global stage.”

Discover the five trust actions that will help individuals minimize risk while maximizing possibilities.

















THE CHALLENGE
We live in a low-trust world surrounded by crises and challenges. Who can you trust? How can you trust? 

Choosing Smart Trust will enable you to operate with high-trust in a low-trust and unpredictable marketplace. The more unpredictable it becomes, the more your sound judgment and ability to trust in this low-trust world will give you a tremendous competitive advantage—and the capacity to navigate the uncertainty low trust creates.
 
Based on the book, Smart Trust, by Stephen M. R. Covey and Greg Link, this LiveClicks on-demand workshop will help you understand how trust issues impact every situation in life. In fact, trusted people are more likely to get hired or promoted, get the best projects and bigger budgets, and are last to be laid off. In Smart Trust, you will learn the five trust actions that will help you minimize risk while maximizing possibilities. This course will teach you the tools you need to extend Smart Trust, which will help you enjoy greater prosperity, energy, and joy—both personally and professionally.



























Attend a Workshop
    






















								“The first job of a leader—at work or at home—is to inspire trust. It’s to bring out the best in people by entrusting them with meaningful stewardships, and to create an environment in which high-trust interaction inspires creativity and possibility.” 
-Stephen M. R. Covey

FAQ

What are UITs?Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are a fixed portfolio of stocks, bonds or other securities. These types of portfolios allow investors to know what securities are held within a UIT as of the date of deposit, as well as the mandatory termination date of the trust. While it is not common, a trust may terminate early as described in the prospectus. UITs offer an attractive opportunity for investors to own a portfolio of securities via a low minimum, typically liquid investment. As a point of contrast, while many actively managed funds continually buy and sell securities, thereby changing their investment mix, the securities held in a UIT generally remain fixed.
How are UIT securities chosen?Some UIT securities are chosen according to a quantitative selection process determined by a sponsor while some are based on an index. Other UITs are chosen by experienced analysts or portfolio managers, who research the securities and screen them for various characteristics, according to specific objectives. Once securities are selected, the UIT portfolios are then supervised accordingly throughout the life of the trust.
Can a security held in a UIT be removed at any time?While it is rare, a security held in a UIT may be removed from a portfolio under certain circumstances, such as a significant decline in credit rating. By and large, securities held in a UIT remain fixed for the life of the trust, regardless of market value.
What are the minimum investments in SmartTrust® UITs?Typical minimums are 100 units, however, the minimums may vary based on the UIT. Higher minimums may also be required by each respective brokerage firm.
Are UITs suitable for my retirement accounts?Unit trusts may be an appropriate investment vehicle for IRAs or self-employed retirement plans. They offer a variety of investment opportunities — ranging from relatively conservative to more aggressive investments — in both domestic and international markets.
What are my options when a UIT matures?Option #1: Rollover at a reduced sales charge
At a reduced sales charge, investors may roll over into a new series of the same trust, if available, or any other SmartTrust® UIT available in the primary market*
*Maturity rollover is considered a taxable event. Please refer to each trust’s prospectus for complete rollover option information. Investors should be aware that there is a time limit to notify the trustee of the rollover.
Option #2: Maturity
Investors may do nothing and allow the portfolio units to mature. The trust will liquidate and they will receive a cash distribution of the trust’s proceeds, if any.
Option #3: In-kind distribution
Investors may generally request an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying the units if they own 2,500 or more units at either the time of purchase or maturity. Please see additional provisions set forth in the prospectus. SmartTrust® Unit Investment Trusts are generally long-term investment strategies and investors should consider their ability to invest in successive portfolios, if available. Investors should consult their tax advisor to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next, if available. Neither Hennion & Walsh, Inc. or Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, Inc. provide tax advice. Please refer to the trust prospectus for more complete in-kind distribution information. In-kind distribution is generally available for stocks traded and held in the United States. In-kind distribution may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice.
Can I sell my units?You may sell all, or a portion of, your units any day the stock market is open. You will receive the then-current net asset value of the units, based on the current market value of the underlying securities in the portfolio, less any remaining deferred sales charge, as of the evaluation time. As the market fluctuates, of course, so will the value of your units. Therefore, your units may be worth more or less than what you originally paid.
How are UITs priced?UITs are priced at the end of each business day similar to mutual funds. The price is based on the market value of the underlying securities and includes cash and other assets and liabilities held by the trust.
Are UITs eligible in commission and fee/wrap accounts?UITs are available in a sales charge structure for commission accounts as well as for fee/wrap accounts. It is best to check with your individual brokerage firm to see if UITs are eligible for your fee/wrap platform.
Are UITs regulated?Unit investment trusts are one of three basic types of investment company. Investment companies are subject to stringent federal laws and oversight by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is important to note that the SEC does not approve or disapprove of UITs or the securities within a given UIT or pass upon the adequacy of any prospectus for a given UIT. Investment companies are regulated primarily under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This federal statute is highly detailed and governs the structure and day-to-day operations of investment companies. Investment companies are also subject to regulations of the Securities Act of 1933, FINRA, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.

Please follow the installation trouble shooting guide.







         Usage



Can I change the functions of the multimedia keys?


















No, these are fixed functions.







         Solving problems



I get the wrong letters and/or symbols when typing on my computer.


















Set the correct language as explained in the keyboard settings page




The multimedia keys are not working.


















Not all programs are supporting multimedia keys.

For best compatibility, use Windows Mediaplayer and Internet Explorer. 
Ensure that the Multimedia program you wish to control is selected as Default in the system properties.

Clean your keyboard from dust and crumbles.  





Where is your service center? Or where can I send my product to be repaired?


















Unfortunately, we do not have service centers to repair products.
A defective product should be replaced by your point of purchase during the warranty period.




My Trust product is not working.


















Follow the steps in the trouble shooting guide.




The file on the website won't download (completely)


















Possibe causes blocking the download:


Firewall is blocking the download.
 Adjust your firewall software to allow downloads.

An antivirus/internet security software suite is blocking the download.
If you have internet security software make sure it is configured to allow downloads.

Your browser is blocking the download.
It can help to clear the cache to be able to download again.
It can also help to reset browser settings when clearing the cache doesn't work.
Alternatively use a different browser to download the file.

Network/ISP issues.
It can be related to a problem with the connection to your Internet service.







When I download the file on the website, I receive a message about a corrupt or invalid signature.



















This is a false alarm by Microsoft browsers.

The digital signatures of the file are neither corrupt nor invalid. Windows requires drivers to be digitally signed by the author; otherwise, Windows will not load the driver out of precaution.

It is possible that several drivers of Trust do not have this Windows signature, as there are extra costs for this signature. However, we can confirm that even without this signature the driver is safe to install.

If you can't ignore the warning, please use any non-Microsoft browser such as Google Chrome for downloading and installing the driver.




My product is faulty. What do I do?


















We offer a 'return to retailer' warranty on our products.
In case of a defect, you can return the product to your retailer with failure description, proof of purchase and all accessories.
