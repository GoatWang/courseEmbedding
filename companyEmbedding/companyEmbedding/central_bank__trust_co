Central Trust Company























































Objective Advice 
Central Trust is a fiduciary, which means we always look out for your best interests. We are legally and ethically bound to put the administration of your account before any other interests in our business. Our relationship managers will provide your organization with unbiased advice, guidance and recommendations.
 


Succession Planning 
Whether a business is a for-profit or nonprofit organization, one of management's top priorities should be to have successors ready to fill key positions upon vacancy. In succession planning, managers pinpoint employees at risk to leave and analyze the impact their departure would have on the company; examine the bench strength of current employees; profile position requirements; analyze employees' skill sets to forecast their readiness for promotion; and identify potential successors. Developing internal talent can be a significant source of savings, considering external recruitment and training can be twice as expensive as finding internal replacements.Our team includes individuals who have assisted many large organizations and their outside advisors with business succession planning. 
 


Investment Management 
Our portfolio managers focus on aligning the depth of our investment expertise with your organization’s goals and aspirations. We consider ourselves smart allocators across a broad group of asset classes. By including a broad range of asset classes; building allocations based on forward-looking market assumptions; utilizing industry-leading methods for portfolio construction; and leveraging many of the best investment management firms in the world, we can help your organization meet its objectives with lower volatility.  


Retirement Planning 
Central Trust Company has extensive experience in assisting employers with the management of all types of retirement plans, including 401(k), 403(b), pensions and profit-sharing plans. We can provide a state-of-the-art daily valuation plan that includes participant-directed accounts through a variety of no-load mutual funds, or we can provide the expert investment management necessary for a pension fund. Local expertise means on-site employee education and enrollment programs that will make your organization’s retirement plan an exceptional recruitment and retention tool.  
 















































Products and services offered by Central Trust Company are not insured by the FDIC, are not deposits of or guaranteed by any depository institution or affiliate bank and are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of the principal amount invested. Insurance products are
available through and underwritten by non-affiliated insurance companies.

Insurance sounds boring and dreary to most people. Not for us at Central Bank & Trust Co, however. While it is a serious business, we do not see insurance as boring - it is after all the business of keeping people in their homes, from going out of business and getting back on the road – essentially helping people lead normal lives and recover from disaster. This is interesting stuff! We are partnered with the right insurance carrier/s, people we have been doing business with for years. This enables us to comparison shop and gets you (our client) the best deal available. And the best deal is not always about price – but, hey – price is a big factor and we will never stop fighting to get you the best price. We help our clients with all kinds of insurance, but here are the main insurance types our agency focuses on -

Auto insurance – do you know what coverage you have? Most of our clients gloss over when we start talking liability, collision, comprehensive insurance coverages. And why do the limits have to be different based on your specific needs? Rest assured, we understand what is needed to operate a vehicle in and around Lexington, KY and will handle all the details for you.
Business Insurance – own or operate a business? Do you need insurance before you can execute on a job/contract? Not sure what type of insurance you need? Do you just need the minimum or are you thinking about future exposure to lawsuits and injury claims? Our commercial insurance agents are standing by to help you get the right policy to help your business succeed.
Homeowners insurance – who knows where the value lies in an insurance policy when it comes to something as local-specific as insurance for a structure, building, home in a specific location – your local insurance agent – that’s who! Let us showcase our knowledge of the area in and around Lexington, KY. You will be confident that you found the best local partner for your insurance needs.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services. Fiduciary standards or fiduciary duties do not apply, for example, when the Bank is offering or providing credit solutions, banking, custody or brokerage products/services or referrals to other affiliates of the Bank.
