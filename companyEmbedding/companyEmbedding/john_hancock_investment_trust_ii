1. The performance reflects the asset charges for Series I shares from inception to January 27, 2002, and the asset charges for Series II shares for the time periods subsequent to January 27, 2002. The performance for Series II shares will be lower than Series I shares due to the higher Series II 12b-1 fee.


2. During the time period shown in the chart, the Lifestyles, Science & Technology, Blue Chip Growth, Equity-Income, Health Sciences and Small Company Value portfolios expenses were reimbursed. If such expenses had not been reimbursed, returns would be lower. Expense reimbursement for the International Core portfolio was terminated 11/25/02. Expense reimbursement for the Capital Appreciation portfolio was terminated effective 5/15/01.


3. The portfolios in the John Hanocck Variable Insurance Trust described above are not retail mutual funds and are only available under variable annuity contracts, variable life policies, or through participation in tax qualified retirement plans.

John Hancock Insurance

Why Do You Need Life Insurance?



Life insurance can be one of the most important purchases you will make. You want your family or business to be financially secure, to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and even leave a legacy for your children and grandchildren. No matter what your goals are, the unique tax benefits and features of life insurance can help you to achieve them. 


Types of Life Insurance
Choosing the right type of life insurance depends on your circumstances and financial goals. Life insurance policies are designed to pay a death benefit when someone dies, but there are usually two basic categories to meet your different needs - term and permanent. 
Term life insurance in general, provides death benefit protection for a specific period of time.
Permanent life insurance offers lifetime death benefit protection with a cash value component. This can mean lifetime peace of mind for you and your family.
Different types of permanent life insurance are usually categorized as follows: Universal Life Insurance, Indexed Universal Life Insurance, and Variable Universal Life Insurance. To find out what life insurance solution best meets your needs, visit JohnHancockInsurance.com.



















We believe that life insurance should reward you for healthy living. That's why we introduced life insurance with the John Hancock Vitality Program. It's an innovative solution that gives you the protection you need, along with premium savings up to 15% and rewards from national brands for the everyday things you do to stay healthy, like exercising, walking, and eating well.

It’s Never Too Early to Think About the Future

                                    It might seem like your twenties is too early to start thinking about life insurance, but we disagree.
                                





5 Common Questions About Life Insurance

                                    Starting a family is one of the most exciting times in your life, but it can also feel overwhelming. You probably have questions, and that’s a good thing.
                                





Insuring a Long Life is More than a Policy

                                    Scott is at a stage of life that is full of new adventures and responsibilities, many of which bring new financial pressures for young families.
                                





Introducing Vitality Active Rewards with Apple Watch®

                                    What if you could earn Apple Watch just for being active? With John Hancock Vitality, now that’s possible. Learn More

       What You Should Know
       
    





            

The Fund's market price is the last sale price as of the close of the regular market trading session. The Fund's market price as of and after July 1, 2013 reflects the last sale price in the broad market; market price prior to July 1, 2013 reflects the last sale price on the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their NAV. The Fund’s cash available for distribution will vary over time, and there is no guarantee prior distribution levels will be maintained. If, for any calendar year, the total distributions made exceed the amount of the fund's earnings and profits as computed for federal tax purposes, the excess generally will be treated as a return of capital to holders of common shares (up to the amount of each shareholder’s basis in those shares) and thereafter as gain from the sale of common shares. Such return of capital reduces the shareholder’s adjusted basis for common shares, thereby increasing the potential gain or reducing the potential loss of a subsequent sale. Distributions in any year may include a substantial return-of-capital component. An investment in the fund's Common Shares is subject to investment and market risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested. An investment in common shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund, which are generally are traded on a securities exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. These securities will fluctuate in value, and an investor in the fund may lose some or all of his or her investment, even after accounting for any reinvestment of dividends and distributions. Fixed-income investments are subject to interest-rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. An issuer of securities held by the fund may default, have its credit rating downgraded, or otherwise perform poorly. The fund utilizes a Credit Facility Agreement (CFA) to increase its assets available for investment. Shareholders bear the fees associated with this “leverage” and may be disadvantaged from the use of leverage. It is important to recognize that use of leverage increases the Advisor’s fee. Leverage creates risks that may adversely affect the return for the holders of common shares, including:

the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares
the risk that the cost of utilizing the CFA will increase with rising interest rates
the risk of increased operating costs that can lower fund returns
the risk of a decline in the value of an investment acquired through leverage, while the fund’s obligations under such leverage remain fixed
the risk that the fund will have to sell securities in a volatile market in order to meet asset coverage or other debt compliance requirements

Fund returns will be lower if the cost of the leverage exceeds the income or capital appreciation derived from securities purchased with leverage. If the fund is unable to obtain replacement financing in the event the CFA is terminated, the fund would be required to sell securities at a potentially inopportune time, incurring tax consequences, and its ability to generate income would be adversely affected.
The Fund’s quarterly distributions may be from net investment income, capital gains or return of capital. The distribution rate and income amounts reflect past amounts distributed and may not be indicative of future rates or income amounts. Distribution rates and income amounts can change at any time.
Closed-end fund shares are not redeemable, but instead are traded in the secondary market on an exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. They frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. Specialized funds may carry additional risks.

ORGANIZATION OF THE FUND



The Fund is a series of the Trust,  an open-end  investment  management  company
organized as a Massachusetts  business trust under the laws of the  Commonwealth
of Massachusetts.


John Hancock Advisers,  Inc. (the "Adviser") is the Fund's  investment  adviser.
The  Adviser  is an  indirect,  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of John  Hancock  Life
Insurance  Company  (formerly John Hancock  Mutual Life  Insurance  Company)(the
"Life Company"),  a Massachusetts life insurance company chartered in 1862, with
national  headquarters at John Hancock Place,  Boston,  Massachusetts.  The Life
Company is wholly owned by John  Hancock  Financial  Services,  Inc., a Delaware
corporation organized in February, 2000.





INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES



The following  information  supplements the discussion of the Fund's  investment
objective and policies discussed in the Prospectus.  Appendix A contains further
information describing investment risks. The investment objective of the Fund is
non-fundamental. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment
objective.


The  Fund's  investment  objective  is  capital  appreciation.   Under  ordinary
circumstances,  the Fund will invest at least 65% of its total  assets in equity
securities of financial services companies.  For this purpose, equity securities
include common and preferred stocks and their equivalents (including warrants to
purchase and securities convertible into such stocks).


A  financial  services  company is a firm that in its most  recent  fiscal  year
either (i)  derived at least 50% of its  revenues  or  earnings  from  financial
services  activities,  or  (ii)  devoted  at  least  50% of its  assets  to such
activities. Financial services companies provide financial services to consumers
and  businesses  and  include the  following  types of U.S.  and foreign  firms:

commercial banks,  thrift  institutions and their holding  companies;  financial
holding  companies;  consumer  and  industrial  finance  companies;  diversified
financial  services  companies;   investment  banks;  securities  brokerage  and
investment advisory firms;  financial technology companies;  real estate-related
firms; leasing firms; insurance brokerages; and various firms in all segments of
the insurance  industry  such as  multi-line,  property and  casualty,  and life
insurance companies and insurance holding companies.


The Fund's  management  team invests in financial  services  companies  that are
currently  undervalued,  appear  to be  positioned  for a  merger,  or  are in a
position  to  benefit  from  regulatory  changes.  The  team  believes  that the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act, which allows banks to acquire  investment and insurance
firms,  should reinforce the ongoing pattern of consolidation in the banking and
investment sectors.


Since the Fund's  investments  will be  concentrated  in the financial  services
sector,  it will be  subject  to risks in  addition  to those  that apply to the
general equity and debt markets. Events may occur which significantly affect the
sector  as  a  whole  or  a  particular  segment  in  which  the  Fund  invests.
Accordingly,  the Fund may be subject to greater market  volatility  than a fund
that does not concentrate in a particular economic sector or industry.  Thus, it
is recommended  that an investment in the Fund be only a portion of your overall
investment portfolio.


In addition, most financial services companies are subject to extensive
governmental regulation which limits their activities and may (as with insurance
rate regulation) affect the ability to earn a profit from a given line of
business. Certain financial services businesses are subject to intense
competitive pressures, including market share and price competition. The removal
of regulatory barriers to participation in certain segments of the financial


2





services sector may also increase competitive pressures on different types of
firms. For example, recent legislation removing traditional barriers between
banking and investment banking activities will allow large commercial banks to
compete for business that previously was the exclusive domain of securities
firms. Similarly, the removal of regional barriers in the banking industry has
intensified competition within the industry. The availability and cost of funds
to financial services firms is crucial to their profitability. Consequently,
volatile interest rates and general economic conditions can adversely affect
their financial performance.


Financial  services  companies  in  foreign  countries  are  subject  to similar
regulatory and interest rate concerns.  In particular,  government regulation in
certain  foreign  countries  may  include  controls on  interest  rates,  credit
availability,  prices and currency movements. In some cases, foreign governments
have taken steps to  nationalize  the  operations  of banks and other  financial
services companies.


The Adviser  believes  that the  ongoing  deregulation  of many  segments of the
financial  services sector continues to provide new opportunities for issuers in
this sector. As deregulation of various financial services businesses  continues
and new segments of the financial  services  sector are opened to certain larger
financial  services  firms  formerly  prohibited  from doing  business  in these
segments,  (such  as  national  and  money  center  banks)  certain  established
companies in these market segments (such as regional banks or securities  firms)
may  become  attractive  acquisition  candidates  for the  larger  firm  seeking
entrance  into the  segment.  Typically,  acquisitions  accelerate  the  capital
appreciation of the shares of the company to be acquired.


In addition, financial services companies in growth segments (such as securities
firms during times of stock market expansion) or geographically  linked to areas
experiencing  strong economic growth (such as certain regional banks) are likely
to  participate  in and benefit from such growth  through  increased  demand for
their  products  and  services.  Many  financial  services  companies  which are
actively and  aggressively  managed and are expanding  services as  deregulation
opens  up new  opportunities  also  show  potential  for  capital  appreciation,
particularly in expanding into areas where  nonregulatory  barriers to entry are
low.


The Adviser will seek to invest in those  financial  services  companies that it
believes are well  positioned  to take  advantage of the ongoing  changes in the
financial  services sector. A financial  services company may be well positioned
for a number of reasons. It may be an attractive acquisition for another company
wishing to strengthen its presence in a line of business or a geographic  region
or to expand  into new lines of  business or  geographic  regions,  or it may be
planning  a  merger  to  strengthen  its  position  in a line of  business  or a
geographic  area.  The  financial  services  company may be engaged in a line or
lines of business  experiencing or likely to experience  strong economic growth;
it may be linked to a geographic  region  experiencing  or likely to  experience
strong economic growth and be actively seeking to participate in such growth; or
it may be expanding into  financial  services or geographic  regions  previously
unavailable to it (due to an easing of regulatory  constraints) in order to take
advantage of new market opportunities.


Investments in Debt Securities. The Fund may invest in debt securities of
financial services companies and in equity and debt securities of companies
outside of the financial services sector. The Fund may invest up to 5% of its
net assets in below-investment grade debt securities rated at the time of
purchase as low as CCC by Standard & Poor's Rating Group ("S&P") or Caa by
Moody's Investor Services, Inc. ("Moody's"). The Fund may invest in unrated
securities which, in the opinion of the Adviser, offer comparable yields and
risks to those securities which are rated.


3





To avoid the need to sell  equity  securities  in the Fund's  portfolio  to meet
redemption requests, and to provide flexibility to the Fund to take advantage of
investment  opportunities,  the Fund may  invest up to 15% of its net  assets in
short-term,  investment grade debt securities. Short-term debt securities have a
maturity of less than one year.  Investment  grade  securities  are rated at the
time  of  purchase  BBB or  higher  by S&P or Baa or  higher  by  Moody's.  Debt
securities include corporate obligations (such as commercial paper, notes, bonds
or debentures),  certificates of deposit,  deposit accounts,  obligations of the
U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities,  and repurchase agreements.
When  the  Adviser  believes  that  financial  conditions  warrant,  it may  for
temporary  defensive  purposes  invest up to 80% of the  Fund's  assets in these
securities rated in the four highest categories of S&P or Moody's.


Ratings as  Investment  Criteria.  In  general,  the  ratings of Moody's and S&P
represent  the  opinions of these  agencies as to the quality of the  securities
which they rate. It should be emphasized however,  that ratings are relative and
subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. These ratings will be used
by the Fund as initial criteria for the selection of debt securities.  Among the
factors which will be considered are the long-term  ability of the issuer to pay
principal and interest and general economic trends.  Appendix B contains further
information  concerning  the rating of Moody's  and S&P and their  significance.
Subsequent to its purchase by the Fund,  an issue of securities  may cease to be
rated,  or its rating may be reduced below minimum  required for purchase by the
Fund.  Neither of these  events will require the sale of the  securities  by the
Fund.


Investments  in  Foreign  Securities.  The  Fund  may  invest  directly  in  the
securities of foreign issuers as well as securities in the form of sponsored and
unsponsored  American Depository  Receipts (ADRs),  European Depository Receipts
(EDRs) or other securities  convertible into securities of foreign issuers. ADRs
are  receipts  typically  issued  by an  American  bank or trust  company  which
evidence  ownership of underlying  securities  issued by a foreign  corporation.
EDRs  are  receipts  issued  in  Europe  which  evidence  a  similar   ownership
arrangement.  Issuers of  unsponsored  ADRs are not  contractually  obligated to
disclose material information,  including financial  information,  in the United
States.  Generally,  ADRs are designed for use in the United  States  securities
markets and EDRs are designed for use in European securities markets.


Foreign Currency Transactions. The Fund's foreign currency transactions may be
conducted on a spot (i.e., cash) basis at the spot rate for purchasing or
selling currency prevailing in the foreign exchange market.


The Fund may also enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to
enhance return, to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates
affecting a particular transaction or portfolio position, or as a substitute for
the purchase or sale of a currency or assets denominated in that currency.
Forward contracts are agreements to purchase or sell a specified currency at a
specified future date and price set at the time of the contract. Transaction
hedging is the purchase or sale of forward foreign currency contracts with
respect to specific receivables or payables of the Fund accruing in connection
with the purchase and sale of its portfolio securities quoted or denominated in
the same or related foreign currencies. Portfolio hedging is the use of forward
foreign currency contracts to offset portfolio security positions denominated or
quoted in the same or related foreign currencies. The Fund may elect to hedge
less than all of its foreign portfolio positions as deemed appropriate by the
Adviser.

If the Fund  purchases  a  forward  contract  or sells a  forward  contract  for
non-hedging  purposes,  the Fund will segregate  cash or liquid  securities in a
separate account of the Fund in an amount equal to the value of the Fund's total
assets committed to the consummation of such forward contract. The assets in the
segregated  account  will be  valued  at  market  daily  and if the value of the
securities in the separate account declines,  additional cash or securities will
be placed in the  account  so that the  value of the  account  will be equal the
amount of the Fund's commitment with respect to such contracts.


Hedging  against  a  decline  in the  value of a  currency  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations  in the prices of  portfolio  securities  or prevent  losses if the
prices  of  such  securities  decline.   Such  transactions  also  preclude  the
opportunity for gain if the value of the hedged currency rises. Moreover, it may
not be possible for the Fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally
anticipated  that the Fund is not able to  contract  to sell the  currency  at a
price above the devaluation level it anticipates.


Risks of Foreign  Securities.  Investments  in foreign  securities may involve a
greater  degree of risk than those in domestic  securities.  There is  generally
less  publicly  available  information  about  foreign  companies in the form of
reports and ratings  similar to those that are  published  about  issuers in the
United  States.  Also,  foreign  issuers  are  generally  not subject to uniform
accounting,  auditing and financial reporting  requirements  comparable to those
applicable to United States issuers.


Because foreign  securities may be denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar,  changes in foreign  currency  exchange rates will affect the Fund's net
asset  value,  the value of  dividends  and  interest  earned,  gains and losses
realized on the sale of securities, and any net investment income and gains that
the Fund distributes to shareholders. Securities transactions undertaken in some
foreign  markets may not be settled  promptly so that the Fund's  investments on
foreign  exchanges  may be less  liquid and  subject to the risk of  fluctuating
currency exchange rates pending settlement.


Foreign  securities  will be purchased  in the best  available  market,  whether
through  over-the-counter  markets or exchanges  located in the countries  where
principal  offices of the issuers are located.  Foreign  securities  markets are
generally  not as developed or  efficient as those in the United  States.  While
growing in volume, they usually have substantially less volume than the New York
Stock Exchange,  and securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more
volatile than securities of comparable United States issuers.  Fixed commissions
on foreign exchanges are generally higher than negotiated  commissions on United
States exchanges,  although the Fund will endeavor to achieve the most favorable
net results on its portfolio  transactions.  There is generally less  government
supervision and regulation of securities  exchanges,  brokers and listed issuers
than in the United States.


With respect to certain foreign countries, there is the possibility of adverse
changes in investment or exchange control regulations, expropriation,
nationalization or confiscatory taxation limitations on the removal of funds or
other assets of the Fund, political or social instability, or diplomatic
developments which could affect United States investments in those countries.
Moreover, individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from
the United States' economy in terms of growth of gross national product, rate of
inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of
payments position.

The  dividends,  in some cases capital gains and interest  payable on certain of
the Fund's foreign portfolio  securities,  may be subject to foreign withholding
or other  foreign  taxes,  thus  reducing  the net  amount  of  income  or gains
available for distribution to the Fund's shareholders.


Repurchase Agreements.  In a repurchase agreement the Fund buys a security for a
relatively short period (usually not more than 7 days) subject to the obligation
to sell it back to the issuer at a fixed time and price plus  accrued  interest.
The Fund will enter into  repurchase  agreements  only with member  banks of the
Federal Reserve System and with "primary dealers" in U.S. Government securities.
The Adviser will continuously  monitor the  creditworthiness of the parties with
whom it enters into repurchase agreements.


The Fund has  established a procedure  providing that the securities  serving as
collateral  for  each  repurchase  agreement  must be  delivered  to the  Fund's
custodian  either  physically or in book-entry form and that the collateral must
be marked to market  daily to ensure  that each  repurchase  agreement  is fully
collateralized  at all times.  In the event of  bankruptcy or other default by a
seller  of  a  repurchase  agreement,   the  Fund  could  experience  delays  in
liquidating the underlying  securities during the period while the Fund seeks to
enforce its rights  thereto,  possible  subnormal  levels of income,  decline in
value of the  underlying  securities  or lack of access to  income  during  this
period as well as the expense of enforcing its rights.


Reverse Repurchase Agreements and Other Borrowings. The Fund may also enter into
reverse  repurchase  agreements  which  involve  the  sale  of  U.S.  Government
securities  held in its portfolio to a bank with an agreement that the Fund will
buy back the  securities  at a fixed future date at a fixed price plus an agreed
amount of "interest"  which may be reflected in the  repurchase  price.  Reverse
repurchase  agreements  are  considered to be  borrowings  by the Fund.  Reverse
repurchase  agreements  involve  the risk that the  market  value of  securities
purchased by the Fund with  proceeds of the  transaction  may decline  below the
repurchase  price of the  securities  sold by the Fund which it is  obligated to
repurchase.  The Fund will also  continue to be subject to the risk of a decline
in the market value of the securities sold under the agreements  because it will
reacquire those securities upon effecting their repurchase.  To minimize various
risks associated with reverse repurchase agreements, the Fund will establish and
maintain a separate  account  consisting  of liquid  securities,  of any type or
maturity, in an amount at least equal to the repurchase prices of the securities
(plus any accrued interest thereon) under such agreements.


The Fund will not enter into reverse repurchase  agreements and other borrowings
except from banks as a temporary measure for extraordinary emergency purposes in
amounts not to exceed 33 1/3% of the Fund's total assets  (including  the amount
borrowed)  taken at market  value.  The Fund will not use leverage to attempt to
increase  income.  The Fund will enter into reverse  repurchase  agreements only
with federally insured banks which are approved in advance as being creditworthy
by the Trustees. Under procedures established by the Trustees, the Advisers will
monitor the creditworthiness of the banks involved.


Restricted Securities. The Fund may purchase securities that are not registered
("restricted securities") under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act"),
including commercial paper issued in reliance on Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act
and securities offered and sold to "qualified institutional buyers" under Rule
144A under the 1933 Act. The Fund will not invest more than 15% of its net
assets in illiquid investments, which includes repurchase agreements maturing in
more than seven days, OTC options, securities that are not readily marketable
and restricted securities. If the Trustees determine, based upon a continuing
review of the trading markets for specific Section 4 (2) paper or Rule 144A


6





securities, that they are liquid, they will not be subject to the 15% limit on
illiquid securities. The Trustees have adopted guidelines and delegated to the
Adviser the daily function of determining and monitoring the liquidity of
restricted securities. The Trustees, however, will retain sufficient oversight
and be ultimately responsible for the determinations. The Trustees will
carefully monitor the Fund's investments in these securities, focusing on such
important factors, among others, as valuation, liquidity and availability of
information. This investment practice could have the effect of increasing the
level of illiquidity in the Fund to the extent that qualified institutional
buyers become for a time uninterested in purchasing these restricted securities.


Options on Securities,  Securities  Indices and Currency.  The Fund may purchase
and write (sell) call and put options on any  securities in which it may invest,
on any  securities  index based on  securities  in which it may invest or on any
currency in which Fund  investments  may be  denominated.  These  options may be
listed on national domestic securities exchanges or foreign securities exchanges
or traded in the  over-the-counter  market.  The Fund may write  covered put and
call options and purchase put and call  options to enhance  total  return,  as a
substitute  for the purchase or sale of  securities  or currency,  or to protect
against declines in the value of portfolio  securities and against  increases in
the cost of securities to be acquired.


Writing Covered Options.  A call option on securities or currency written by the
Fund obligates the Fund to sell  specified  securities or currency to the holder
of the option at a specified price if the option is exercised at any time before
the expiration  date. A put option on securities or currency written by the Fund
obligates the Fund to purchase specified  securities or currency from the option
holder at a specified  price if the option is  exercised  at any time before the
expiration  date.  Options  on  securities  indices  are  similar  to options on
securities,  except that the exercise of securities  index options requires cash
settlement  payments  and  does  not  involve  the  actual  purchase  or sale of
securities. In addition,  securities index options are designed to reflect price
fluctuations in a group of securities or segment of the securities market rather
than price  fluctuations in a single security.  Writing covered call options may
deprive  the Fund of the  opportunity  to profit  from an increase in the market
price of the securities or foreign  currency  assets in its  portfolio.  Writing
covered put options  may  deprive the Fund of the  opportunity  to profit from a
decrease in the market price of the securities or foreign  currency assets to be
acquired for its portfolio.


All call and put options written by the Fund are covered.  A written call option
or put  option  may be covered  by (i)  maintaining  cash or liquid  securities,
either of which may be quoted or  denominated  in any currency,  in a segregated
account with a value at least equal to the Fund's  obligation  under the option,

(ii) entering into an offsetting  forward  commitment and/or (iii) purchasing an
offsetting  option or any other option which, by virtue of its exercise price or
otherwise,  reduces the Fund's net exposure on its written  option  position.  A
written  call option on  securities  is  typically  covered by  maintaining  the
securities that are subject to the option in a segregated account.  The Fund may
cover call  options  on a  securities  index by owning  securities  whose  price
changes are expected to be similar to those of the underlying index.


The Fund may terminate its obligations under an exchange traded call or put
option by purchasing an option identical to the one it has written. Obligations
under over-the-counter options may be terminated only by entering into an
offsetting transaction with the counterparty to such option. Such purchases are
referred to as "closing purchase transactions."


7





Purchasing Options. The Fund would normally purchase call options in
anticipation of an increase, or put options in anticipation of a decrease
("protective puts"), in the market value of securities or currencies of the type
in which it may invest. The Fund may also sell call and put options to close out
its purchased options.


The purchase of a call option would  entitle the Fund, in return for the premium
paid, to purchase  specified  securities or currency at a specified price during
the option period. The Fund would ordinarily realize a gain on the purchase of a
call  option if,  during  the option  period,  the value of such  securities  or
currency  exceeded  the  sum  of  the  exercise  price,  the  premium  paid  and
transaction costs;  otherwise the Fund would realize either no gain or a loss on
the purchase of the call option.


The purchase of a put option would entitle the Fund, in exchange for the premium
paid, to sell specified  securities or currency at a specified  price during the
option  period.  The purchase of protective  puts is designed to offset or hedge
against a decline in the market value of the Fund's portfolio  securities or the
currencies in which they are  denominated.  Put options may also be purchased by
the Fund for the purpose of affirmatively benefiting from a decline in the price
of  securities or  currencies  which it does not own. The Fund would  ordinarily
realize  a gain if,  during  the  option  period,  the  value of the  underlying
securities or currency  decreased below the exercise price sufficiently to cover
the premium and  transaction  costs;  otherwise the Fund would realize either no
gain or a loss on the  purchase  of the put  option.  Gains  and  losses  on the
purchase of put options may be offset by countervailing  changes in the value of
the Fund's portfolio securities.


The Fund's options  transactions  will be subject to limitations  established by
each of the exchanges, boards of trade or other trading facilities on which such
options are traded.  These  limitations  govern the maximum number of options in
each class which may be written or  purchased  by a single  investor or group of
investors  acting in concert,  regardless  of whether the options are written or
purchased on the same or different  exchanges,  boards of trade or other trading
facilities or are held or written in one or more accounts or through one or more
brokers. Thus, the number of options which the Fund may write or purchase may be
affected by options written or purchased by other investment advisory clients of
the Adviser. An exchange, board of trade or other trading facility may order the
liquidation  of  positions  found to be in  excess of these  limits,  and it may
impose certain other sanctions.


Risks Associated with Options Transactions.  There is no assurance that a liquid
secondary  market on a domestic or foreign  options  exchange will exist for any
particular  exchange-traded  option or at any  particular  time.  If the Fund is
unable to effect a closing purchase  transaction with respect to covered options
it has written,  the Fund will not be able to sell the underlying  securities or
currencies  or dispose of assets held in a segregated  account until the options
expire or are  exercised.  Similarly,  if the Fund is unable to effect a closing
sale  transaction  with  respect to options it has  purchased,  it would have to
exercise  the options in order to realize any profit and will incur  transaction
costs upon the purchase or sale of underlying securities or currencies.


Reasons for the absence of a liquid secondary market on an exchange include the
following: (i) there may be insufficient trading interest in certain options;

(ii) restrictions may be imposed by an exchange on opening transactions or
closing transactions or both; (iii) trading halts, suspensions or other
restrictions may be imposed with respect to particular classes or series of
options; (iv) unusual or unforeseen circumstances may interrupt normal
operations on an exchange; (v) the facilities of an exchange or the Options


8





Clearing Corporation may not at all times be adequate to handle current trading
volume; or (vi) one or more exchanges could, for economic or other reasons,
decide or be compelled at some future date to discontinue the trading of options
(or a particular class or series of options). If trading were discontinued, the
secondary market on that exchange (or in that class or series of options) would
cease to exist. However, outstanding options on that exchange that had been
issued by the Options Clearing Corporation as a result of trades on that
exchange would continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms.


The Fund's  ability to terminate  over-the-counter  options is more limited than
with  exchange-traded  options  and may  involve  the risk  that  broker-dealers
participating  in such  transactions  will not fulfill  their  obligations.  The
Adviser  will  determine  the  liquidity  of  each  over-the-counter  option  in
accordance with guidelines adopted by the Trustees.


The  writing  and  purchase of options is a highly  specialized  activity  which
involves  investment  techniques and risks different from those  associated with
ordinary  portfolio  securities  transactions.  The  successful  use of  options
depends in part on the Adviser's  ability to predict  future price  fluctuations
and, for hedging transactions, the degree of correlation between the options and
securities or currency markets.


Futures  Contracts and Options on Futures  Contracts.  To seek to increase total
return or hedge against changes in interest rates, securities prices or currency
exchange  rates,  the  Fund  may  purchase  and sell  various  kinds of  futures
contracts,  and  purchase  and  write  call and put  options  on  these  futures
contracts.  The Fund may also enter into closing purchase and sale  transactions
with respect to any of these contracts and options. The futures contracts may be
based on various  securities (such as U.S.  Government  securities),  securities
indices, foreign currencies and any other financial instruments and indices. All
futures  contracts  entered  into by the  Fund are  traded  on U.S.  or  foreign
exchanges  or boards of trade that are  licensed,  regulated  or approved by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC").


Futures Contracts. A futures contract may generally be described as an agreement
between  two  parties  to buy  and  sell  particular  financial  instruments  or
currencies  for an agreed  price  during a  designated  month (or to deliver the
final cash settlement  price, in the case of a contract  relating to an index or
otherwise  not  calling  for  physical  delivery  at the end of  trading  in the
contract).


Positions taken in the futures markets are not normally held to maturity but are
instead liquidated through offsetting  transactions which may result in a profit
or a loss.  While  futures  contracts on  securities or currency will usually be
liquidated in this manner,  the Fund may instead make, or take,  delivery of the
underlying securities or currency whenever it appears economically  advantageous
to do so. A clearing  corporation  associated with the exchange on which futures
contracts are traded  guarantees  that, if still open, the sale or purchase will
be performed on the settlement date.


Hedging and Other Strategies. Hedging is an attempt to establish with more
certainty than would otherwise be possible the effective price or rate of return
on portfolio securities or securities that the Fund proposes to acquire or the
exchange rate of currencies in which portfolio securities are quoted or
denominated. When interest rates are rising or securities prices are falling,
the Fund can seek to offset a decline in the value of its current portfolio
securities through the sale of futures contracts. When interest rates are
falling or securities prices are rising, the Fund, through the purchase of
futures contracts, can attempt to secure better rates or prices than might later
be available in the market when it effects anticipated purchases. The Fund may
seek to offset anticipated changes in the value of a currency in which its
portfolio securities, or securities that it intends to purchase, are quoted or
denominated by purchasing and selling futures contracts on such currencies.


9





The Fund may, for example, take a "short" position in the futures market by
selling futures contracts in an attempt to hedge against an anticipated rise in
interest rates or a decline in market prices or foreign currency rates that
would adversely affect the dollar value of the Fund's portfolio securities. Such
futures contracts may include contracts for the future delivery of securities
held by the Fund or securities with characteristics similar to those of the
Fund's portfolio securities. Similarly, the Fund may sell futures contracts on
any currencies in which its portfolio securities are quoted or denominated or in
one currency to hedge against fluctuations in the value of securities
denominated in a different currency if there is an established historical
pattern of correlation between the two currencies.


If, in the opinion of the Adviser,  there is a sufficient  degree of correlation
between price trends for the Fund's portfolio  securities and futures  contracts
based on other financial  instruments,  securities indices or other indices, the
Fund may also enter into such futures contracts as part of its hedging strategy.
Although under some  circumstances  prices of securities in the Fund's portfolio
may be more or less volatile than prices of such futures contracts,  the Adviser
will  attempt to  estimate  the extent of this  volatility  difference  based on
historical patterns and compensate for any differential by having the Fund enter
into a greater or lesser number of futures contracts or by attempting to achieve
only a partial  hedge  against  price  changes  affecting  the Fund's  portfolio
securities.


When a short hedging  position is successful,  any  depreciation in the value of
portfolio  securities will be substantially  offset by appreciation in the value
of the futures position.  On the other hand, any  unanticipated  appreciation in
the value of the Fund's portfolio  securities would be substantially offset by a
decline in the value of the futures position.


On other  occasions,  the Fund may take a "long" position by purchasing  futures
contracts.  This  would be done,  for  example,  when the Fund  anticipates  the
subsequent purchase of particular securities when it has the necessary cash, but
expects the prices or currency  exchange  rates then available in the applicable
market to be less favorable than prices that are currently  available.  The Fund
may  also  purchase  futures  contracts  as a  substitute  for  transactions  in
securities or foreign currency,  to alter the investment  characteristics  of or
currency  exposure  associated with portfolio  securities or to gain or increase
its exposure to a particular securities market or currency.


Options on Futures Contracts. The Fund may purchase and write options on futures
for the same purposes as its transactions in futures contracts.  The purchase of
put and call options on futures  contracts will give the Fund the right (but not
the obligation) for a specified price to sell or to purchase,  respectively, the
underlying  futures  contract  at any time  during  the  option  period.  As the
purchaser  of an option on a futures  contract,  the Fund obtains the benefit of
the futures position if prices move in a favorable direction but limits its risk
of loss in the event of an unfavorable price movement to the loss of the premium
and transaction costs.


The writing of a call option on a futures contract generates a premium which may
partially offset a decline in the value of the Fund's assets. By writing a call
option, the Fund becomes obligated, in exchange for the premium (upon exercise
of the option) to sell a futures contract if the option is exercised, which may
have a value higher than the exercise price. Conversely, the writing of a put
option on a futures contract generates a premium which may partially offset an
increase in the price of securities that the Fund intends to purchase. However,
the Fund becomes obligated (upon exercise of the option) to purchase a futures
contract if the option is exercised, which may have a value lower than the
exercise price. The loss incurred by the Fund in writing options on futures is
potentially unlimited and may exceed the amount of the premium received.


10





The  holder or writer of an option  on a  futures  contract  may  terminate  its
position by selling or purchasing an offsetting option of the same series. There
is no guarantee  that such  closing  transactions  can be  effected.  The Fund's
ability to establish  and close out positions on such options will be subject to
the development and maintenance of a liquid market.


Other  Considerations.  The Fund will  engage in  futures  and  related  options
transactions  either for bona fide hedging purposes or to seek to increase total
return as  permitted by the CFTC.  To the extent that the Fund is using  futures
and related  options for hedging  purposes,  futures  contracts  will be sold to
protect  against a decline in the price of securities  (or the currency in which
they are quoted or denominated)  that the Fund owns or futures contracts will be
purchased to protect the Fund against an increase in the price of securities (or
the  currency in which they are quoted or  denominated)  it intends to purchase.
The Fund will determine that the price fluctuations in the futures contracts and
options on futures used for hedging purposes are substantially  related to price
fluctuations in securities  held by the Fund or securities or instruments  which
it expects to purchase. As evidence of its hedging intent, the Fund expects that
on 75% or more of the  occasions  on  which it takes a long  futures  or  option
position  (involving  the  purchase  of futures  contracts),  the Fund will have
purchased,  or will be in the  process  of  purchasing,  equivalent  amounts  of
related  securities (or assets  denominated in the related currency) in the cash
market at the time when the futures or option  position is closed out.  However,
in particular cases, when it is economically advantageous for the Fund to do so,
a long futures  position may be terminated  or an option may expire  without the
corresponding purchase of securities or other assets.


To the  extent  that the Fund  engages  in  nonhedging  transactions  in futures
contracts  and options on futures,  the  aggregate  initial  margin and premiums
required to establish these  nonhedging  positions will not exceed 5% of the net
asset  value of the Fund's  portfolio,  after  taking  into  account  unrealized
profits and losses on any such  positions and excluding the amount by which such
options  were  in-the-money  at the time of  purchase.  The Fund will  engage in
transactions  in futures  contracts and related  options only to the extent such
transactions  are consistent with the  requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986,  as amended  (the  "Code"),  for  maintaining  its  qualification  as a
regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes.


Transactions  in futures  contracts  and  options on futures  involve  brokerage
costs,  require  margin  deposits  and,  in the case of  contracts  and  options
obligating the Fund to purchase  securities or  currencies,  require the Fund to
establish a segregated  account  consisting  of cash or liquid  securities in an
amount equal to the underlying value of such contracts and options.


While  transactions  in futures  contracts  and  options  on futures  may reduce
certain risks,  these  transactions  themselves  entail certain other risks. For
example,  unanticipated changes in interest rates, securities prices or currency
exchange rates may result in a poorer overall  performance  for the Fund than if
it had not entered into any futures contracts or options transactions.


Perfect correlation between the Fund's futures positions and portfolio positions
will be impossible to achieve. In the event of an imperfect correlation between
a futures position and a portfolio position which is intended to be protected,
the desired protection may not be obtained and the Fund may be exposed to risk
of loss. In addition, it is not possible to hedge fully or protect against
currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in foreign
currencies because the value of such securities is likely to fluctuate as a
result of independent factors not related to currency fluctuations.


11





Some futures  contracts or options on futures may become  illiquid under adverse
market conditions. In addition, during periods of market volatility, a commodity
exchange may suspend or limit trading in a futures  contract or related  option,
which may make the  instrument  temporarily  illiquid  and  difficult  to price.
Commodity exchanges may also establish daily limits on the amount that the price
of a  futures  contract  or  related  option  can vary from the  previous  day's
settlement  price.  Once the daily limit is reached,  no trades may be made that
day at a price  beyond the limit.  This may  prevent  the Fund from  closing out
positions and limiting its losses.


Lending Securities.  The Fund may lend portfolio securities to brokers, dealers,
and  financial  institutions  if the  loan  is  collateralized  by  cash or U.S.
Government securities according to applicable regulatory requirements.  The Fund
may reinvest  any cash  collateral  in  short-term  securities  and money market
funds.  When the  Fund  lends  portfolio  securities,  there is a risk  that the
borrower may fail to return the  securities  involved in the  transaction.  As a
result, the Fund may incur a loss or, in the event of the borrower's bankruptcy,
the Fund may be delayed in or prevented from liquidating the collateral. It is a
fundamental  policy of the Fund not to lend portfolio  securities having a total
value exceeding 33 1/3% of its total assets.


Rights  and  Warrants.  The Fund may  purchase  warrants  and  rights  which are
securities  permitting,  but  not  obligating,  their  holder  to  purchase  the
underlying securities at a predetermined price, subject to the Fund's Investment
Restrictions.  Generally,  warrants and stock purchase  rights do not carry with
them the right to receive  dividends or exercise  voting  rights with respect to
the underlying securities, and they do not represent any rights in the assets of
the issuer.  As a result, an investment in warrants and rights may be considered
to entail greater  investment risk than certain other types of  investments.  In
addition,  the value of warrants and rights does not necessarily change with the
value of the underlying securities, and they cease to have value if they are not
exercised  on or prior to their  expiration  date.  Investment  in warrants  and
rights increases the potential profit or loss to be realized from the investment
of a given  amount of the Fund's  assets as  compared  with  investing  the same
amount in the underlying stock.


Short  Sales.  The Fund may  engage in short  sales in order to  profit  from an
anticipated  decline  in the value of a  security.  The Fund may also  engage in
short sales to attempt to limit its exposure to a possible market decline in the
value of its portfolio  securities.  The Fund may sell short securities that are
not in the Fund's portfolio,  but which the Adviser believes possess  volatility
characteristics similar to those being hedged. To effect such a transaction, the
Fund must borrow the security sold short to make delivery to the buyer. The Fund
is then  obligated  to replace the  security  borrowed by  purchasing  it at the
market price at the time of  replacement.  Until the  security is replaced,  the
Fund is required to pay to the lender any accrued  interest  and may be required
to pay a premium.


Forward Commitment and When-Issued Securities. The Fund may purchase securities
on a when-issued or forward commitment basis. "When-issued" refers to securities
whose terms are available and for which a market exists, but which have not been
issued. The Fund will engage in when-issued transactions with respect to
securities purchased for its portfolio in order to obtain what is considered to
be an advantageous price and yield at the time of the transaction. For
when-issued transactions, no payment is made until delivery is due, often a
month or more after the purchase. In a forward commitment transaction, the Fund
contracts to purchase securities for a fixed price at a future date beyond
customary settlement time.


12





When the Fund engages in forward  commitment and  when-issued  transactions,  it
relies on the seller to consummate the transaction. The failure of the issuer or
seller to  consummate  the  transaction  may  result in the  Fund's  losing  the
opportunity  to obtain a price  and yield  considered  to be  advantageous.  The
purchase  of  securities  on a  when-issued  or  forward  commitment  basis also
involves a risk of loss if the value of the  security to be  purchased  declines
prior to the settlement date.


On the date the Fund  enters  into an  agreement  to  purchase  securities  on a
when-issued or forward  commitment  basis, the Fund will segregate in a separate
account cash or liquid  securities,  of any type or maturity,  equal in value to
the  Fund's  commitment.  These  assets  will be  valued  daily at  market,  and
additional  cash or securities  will be segregated in a separate  account to the
extent  that the total  value of the assets in the  account  declines  below the
amount of the when-issued  commitments.  Alternatively,  the Fund may enter into
offsetting contracts for the forward sale of other securities that it owns.


Short-Term Trading and Portfolio Turnover. Short-term trading means the purchase
and subsequent sale of a security after it has been held for a relatively  brief
period of time.  The Fund may engage in short-term  trading in response to stock
market  conditions,  changes  in  interest  rates or other  economic  trends and
developments,  or to take advantage of yield  disparities  between various fixed
income  securities  in  order  to  realize  capital  gains  or  improve  income.
Short-term trading may have the effect of increasing  portfolio turnover rate. A
high rate of  portfolio  turnover  (100% or  greater)  involves  correspondingly
greater brokerage  expenses.  The Fund's portfolio turnover rate is set forth in
the table under the caption "Financial Highlights" in the Prospectus.



INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS



Fundamental Investment Restrictions.  The following investment restrictions will
not be changed  without the  approval  of a majority  of the Fund's  outstanding
voting  securities  which,  as used in the  Prospectus  and  this  Statement  of
Additional  Information,  means the approval of the lesser of (1) the holders of
67% or more of the Fund's  shares  represented  at a meeting if more than 50% of
the Fund's  outstanding shares are present in person or by proxy at that meeting
or (2) more than 50% of the Fund's outstanding shares.


The Fund may not:


(1) Issue senior securities,  except as permitted by paragraphs (2), (5) and (6)
below,  and as  otherwise  permitted  by the  1940  Act.  For  purposes  of this
restriction,  the issuance of shares of beneficial  interest in multiple classes
or series,  the  deferral of  trustees'  fees,  the purchase or sale of options,
futures contracts and options on futures contracts, forward commitments, forward
foreign exchange contracts and repurchase  agreements entered into in accordance
with the Fund's investment policies are not deemed to be senior securities.


(2) Borrow money,  except:  (i) for temporary or short-term  purposes or for the
clearance of  transactions  in amounts not to exceed 33 1/3% of the value of the
fund's total assets  (including the amount borrowed) taken at market value; (ii)
in  connection  with  the  redemption  of  fund  shares  or  to  finance  failed
settlements  of  portfolio  trades  without  immediately  liquidating  portfolio

13





purchase  additional  securities pending the anticipated sale of other portfolio
securities or assets;  (iv) in connection with entering into reverse  repurchase
agreements  and dollar  rolls,  but only if after each such  borrowing  there is
asset coverage of at least 300% as defined in the 1940 Act; and (v) as otherwise
permitted under the 1940 Act. For purposes of this investment  restriction,  the
deferral of trustees' fees and transactions in short sales,  futures  contracts,
options on futures  contracts,  securities  or indices  and  forward  commitment
transactions shall not constitute borrowing.


(3) Act as an  underwriter  of securities of other issuers  except to the extent
that in selling  portfolio  securities it may be deemed to be an underwriter for
purposes of the 1933 Act.


(4) Purchase, sell or invest in real estate, but subject to its other investment
policies and  restrictions  may invest in securities  of companies  that deal in
real estate or are engaged in the real estate business.  These companies include
real estate investment trusts and securities secured by real estate or interests
in real estate. The fund may hold and sell real estate acquired through default,
liquidation or other  distributions of an interest in real estate as a result of
the fund's ownership of securities.


(5) Invest in commodities or commodity futures  contracts,  other than financial
derivative  contracts.  Financial  derivative  include forward foreign  currency
contracts;   financial  futures  contracts  and  options  on  financial  futures
contracts; options and warrants on securities, currencies and financial indices;
swaps, caps, floors,  collars and swaptions;  and repurchase  agreements entered
into in accordance with the fund's investment policies.


(6) Make  loans,  except  that the Fund  (1) may lend  portfolio  securities  in
accordance with the Fund's investment policies up to 33 1/3% of the Fund's total
assets taken at market  value,  (2) enter into  repurchase  agreements,  and (3)
purchase  all  or  a  portion  of  an  issue  of  debt  securities,   bank  loan
participation  interests,  bank certificates of deposit,  bankers'  acceptances,
debentures  or other  securities,  whether or not the  purchase is made upon the
original issuance of the securities.


(7) Purchase the securities of issuers  conducting  their principal  activity in
the  same  industry  if,  immediately  after  such  purchase,  the  value of its
investments  in such  industry  would  exceed 25% of its total  assets  taken at
market  value  at the  time  of such  investment;  except  that  the  Fund  will
ordinarily invest more than 25% of its assets in the financial  services sector.
This  limitation  does  not  apply to  investments  in  obligations  of the U.S.
government or any of its agencies, instrumentalities or authorities.


(8) With respect to 75% of the Fund's total  assets,  purchase  securities of an
issuer  (other than the U.S.  Government,  its  agencies,  instrumentalities  or
authorities), if:


a. such purchase would cause more than 5% of the Fund's total assets
taken at market value to be invested in the securities of such issuer; or


b. such purchase would at the time result in more than 10% of the
outstanding voting securities of such issuer being held by the Fund.


14






NON-FUNDAMENTAL RESTRICTIONS:



The Fund may not:


(1)  Purchase  securities  on  margin,  except  that the Fund  may  obtain  such
short-term  credits  as  may  be  necessary  for  the  clearance  of  securities
transactions.


(2) Participate on a joint-and-several  basis in any securities trading account.
The  "bunching"  of orders  for the sale or  purchase  of  marketable  portfolio
securities  with other  accounts  under the  management  of the  Adviser to save
commissions  or to average  prices among them is not deemed to result in a joint
securities trading account.


(3) Purchase a security  if, as a result,  (i) more than 10% of the Fund's total
assets would be invested in the securities of other investment  companies,  (ii)
the Fund would hold more than 3% of the total  outstanding  voting securities of
any one  investment  company,  or (iii) more than 5% of the Fund's  total assets
would  be  invested  in the  securities  of any one  investment  company.  These
limitations do not apply to (a) the investment of cash  collateral,  received by
the Fund in  connection  with lending the Fund's  portfolio  securities,  in the
securities of open-end investment companies or (b) the purchase of shares of any
investment company in connection with a merger, consolidation, reorganization or
purchase  of  substantially  all of the  assets of another  investment  company.
Subject to the above  percentage  limitations,  the Fund may, in connection with
the John  Hancock  Group of Funds  Deferred  Compensation  Plan for  Independent
Trustees/Directors, purchase securities of other investment companies within the
John Hancock Group of Funds.


(4) Invest more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities.


(5) Purchase securities while outstanding borrowings (other than reverse
repurchase agreements) exceed 5% of the Fund's total assets.


(6) Invest for the purpose of exercising control over or management of any
company.


If a percentage restriction is adhered to at the time of investment, a later
increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in values of
portfolio securities or amounts of net assets will not be considered a violation
of any of the foregoing restrictions.


The Fund will invest only in countries on the Adviser's Approved Country
Listing.

As compensation for its services under the Advisory Agreement, the Fund pays the
Adviser monthly a fee based on a stated percentage of the average of the daily
net assets of the Fund as follows:



Average Daily Net Assets            Annual Rate




First    $500,000,000                 0.80%
Amount over  $500,000,000             0.75%


From time to time, the Adviser may reduce its fee or make other  arrangements to
limit the Fund's  expenses to a specified  percentage  of its average  daily net
assets.  The  Adviser  retains the right to reimpose a fee and recover any other
payments to the extent that,  at the end of any fiscal year,  the Fund's  annual
expenses fall below this limit.


For the fiscal year ended  October 31, 1997,  the Adviser's  management  fee was
$4,842,498. After the expense reduction by the Adviser, the Fund paid management
fees for the period of  $3,171,442.  For the fiscal year ended  October 31, 1998
and 1999, the Fund paid a management fee of $24,120,423  and  $25,040,294 to the
Adviser.


Securities  held by the  Fund may  also be held by  other  funds  or  investment
advisory  clients for which the  Adviser or its  affiliates  provide  investment
advice.   Because  of  different  investment  objectives  or  other  factors,  a
particular  security  may be bought for one or more funds or clients when one or
more are selling the same  security.  If  opportunities  for purchase or sale of
securities  by the  Adviser for the Fund or for other funds or clients for which
the Adviser renders  investment  advice arise for  consideration at or about the
same time, transactions in such securities will be made insofar as feasible, for
the respective  funds or clients in a manner deemed equitable to all of them. To
the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of the Adviser or
its  affiliates may increase the demand for  securities  being  purchased or the
supply of securities being sold, there may be an adverse effect on price.


Pursuant to the Advisory  Agreement,  the Adviser is not liable for any error of
judgment or mistake of law or for any loss  suffered  by the Fund in  connection
with  the  matters  to  which  the  Advisory  Agreement  relates,  except a loss
resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of
the Adviser in the  performance of its duties or from reckless  disregard by the
Adviser of its obligations and duties under the Advisory Agreement.


Under the Advisory  Agreement,  the Fund may use the name "John  Hancock" or any
name derived from or similar to it only for so long as the Advisory Agreement or
any extension,  renewal or amendment  thereof remains in effect. If the Advisory
Agreement is no longer in effect,  the Fund (to the extent that it lawfully can)
will cease to use such a name or any other name indicating that it is advised by
or otherwise  connected with the Adviser.  In addition,  the Adviser or the Life
Company may grant the  nonexclusive  right to use the name "John Hancock" or any
similar name to any other  corporation  or entity,  including but not limited to
any investment  company of which the Life Company or any subsidiary or affiliate
thereof or any successor to the business of any subsidiary or affiliate  thereof
shall be the investment adviser.


The continuation of the Advisory Agreement and Distribution Agreement (discussed
below) was approved by all of the Trustees. The Advisory Agreement and the
Distribution Agreement, will continue in effect from year to year, provided that
its continuance is approved annually both (i) by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding voting securities of the Trust or by the Trustees, and (ii) by a
majority of the Trustees who are not parties to the Agreement or "interested
persons" of any such parties. Both agreements may be terminated on 60 days
written notice by any party or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of the Fund and will terminate automatically if assigned.


22





Accounting and Legal Services Agreement.  The Trust, on behalf of the Fund, is a
party to an Accounting and Legal Services  Agreement with the Adviser.  Pursuant
to this agreement,  the Adviser  provides the Fund with certain tax,  accounting
and legal  services.  For the fiscal years ended October 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999
the Fund paid the Adviser  $110,155,  $521,376 and $539,115,  respectively,  for
services under this Agreement.


Personnel  of the  Adviser and its  affiliates  may trade  securities  for their
personal accounts. The Fund also may hold, or may be buying or selling, the same
securities.  To prevent the Fund from being  disadvantaged,  the adviser and its
affiliates  and the Fund  have  adopted  a code of ethics  which  restricts  the
trading activity of those personnel.



DISTRIBUTION CONTRACTS



The Fund has a  Distribution  Agreement  with  John  Hancock  Funds.  Under  the
agreement John Hancock Funds is obligated to use its best efforts to sell shares
of each  class  of the  Fund.  Shares  of the Fund  are  also  sold by  selected
broker-dealers  (the "Selling  Brokers")  which have entered into selling agency
agreements  with John Hancock  Funds.  These Selling  Brokers are  authorized to
designate  other  intermediaries  to receive  purchase and redemption  orders on
behalf of the Fund.  John Hancock Funds  accepts  orders for the purchase of the
shares  of the  Fund  that are  continually  offered  at net  asset  value  next
determined,  plus any applicable  sales charge,  if any. In connection  with the
sale of Fund shares, John Hancock Funds and Selling Brokers receive compensation
from a sales charge imposed, in the case of Class A shares, at the time of sale.
In the case of Class B or  Class C  shares,  the  broker  receives  compensation
immediately but John Hancock Funds is compensated on a deferred basis.


Total  underwriting  commissions  for sales of the Fund's Class A shares for the
fiscal years ended October 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 were $12,457,549, $18,521,423
and  $2,952,139,  respectively,  and  $1,938,173,  $2,713,902  and $283,445 were
retained  by John  Hancock  Funds in  1997,  1998 and  1999,  respectively.  The
remainder of the underwriting commissions were reallowed to Selling Brokers.


The Fund's Trustees adopted Distribution Plans with respect to each class of
shares (the "Plans"), pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of
1940. Under the Plans, the Fund will pay distribution and service fees at an
aggregate annual rate of up to 0.30% for Class A and 1.00% for Class B and Class
C shares of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to shares of that
class. However, the service fee will not exceed 0.25% of the Fund's average
daily net assets attributable to each class of shares. The distribution fees
will be used to reimburse John Hancock Funds for its distribution expenses,
including but not limited to: (i) initial and ongoing sales compensation to
Selling Brokers and others (including affiliates of John Hancock Funds) engaged
in the sale of Fund shares; (ii) marketing, promotional and overhead expenses
incurred in connection with the distribution of Fund shares; and (iii) with
respect to Class B and Class C shares only, interest expenses on unreimbursed
distribution expenses. The services fees will be used to compensate Selling
Brokers and others for providing personal and account maintenance services to
shareholders. In the event the John Hancock Funds is not fully reimbursed for


23





payments or expenses they incur under the Class A Plan, these expenses will not
be carried beyond twelve months from the date they were incurred. Unreimbursed
expenses under the Class B and Class C Plans will be carried forward together
with interest on the balance of these unreimbursed expenses. The Fund does not
treat unreimbursed expenses under the Class B and Class C Plans as a liability
of the Fund because the Trustees may terminate the Class B and/or Class C Plans
at any time. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 1999, an aggregate of $31,
656,236 of distribution expenses or 1.59% of the average net assets of the Class
B shares of the Fund, were not reimbursed or recovered by John Hancock Funds
through the receipt of deferred sales charges or Rule 12b-1 fees in the prior
periods. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 1999, an aggregate of $35,253 of
distribution expenses or 0.79% of the average net assets of the Class C shares
of the Fund, were not reimbursed or recovered by John Hancock Funds through the
receipt of deferred sales charges or Rule 12b-1 fees.


The Plans and all amendments were approved by the Trustees, including a majority
of the  Trustees  who are not  interested  persons  of the  Fund and who have no
direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in the  operation  of the  Plans  (the
"Independent  Trustees"),  by votes  cast in person at a meeting  called for the
purpose of voting on such Plans.


Pursuant to the Plans, at least quarterly,  John Hancock Funds provides the Fund
with a written  report of the amounts  expended  under the Plans and the purpose
for which these  expenditures  were made. The Trustees review these reports on a
quarterly basis to determine their continued appropriateness.


The  Plans  provide  that  they  will  continue  in  effect  only so long as its
continuance is approved at least annually by a majority of both the Trustees and
the Independent Trustees.  The Plans provide that they may be terminated without
penalty, (a) by vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees, (b) by a vote of
a majority  of the Fund's  outstanding  shares of the  applicable  class upon 60
day's written notice to John Hancock Funds,  and (c)  automatically in the event
of  assignment.  The  Plans  further  provide  that they may not be  amended  to
increase  the  maximum  amount of the fees for the  services  described  therein
without the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of the class of the
Fund which has voting rights with respect to the Plan. Each plan provides,  that
no material  amendment to the Plans will be effective unless it is approved by a
majority  vote of the Trustees  and the  Independent  Trustees of the Fund.  The
holders of Class A, Class B and Class C shares have exclusive voting rights with
respect to the Plan applicable to their respective class of shares.  In adopting
the Plans, the Trustees concluded that, in their judgment, there is a reasonable
likelihood  that the Plans will benefit the holders of the  applicable  class of
shares of the Fund.


Amounts paid to John  Hancock  Funds by any class of shares of the Fund will not
be used to pay the expenses  incurred  with respect to any other class of shares
of the Fund;  provided,  however,  that expenses  attributable  to the Fund as a
whole will be allocated,  to the extent permitted by law, according to a formula
based upon gross  sales  dollars  and/or  average  daily net assets of each such
class,  as may be approved  from time to time by vote of a majority of Trustees.
From time to time,  the Fund may  participate in joint  distribution  activities
with other Funds and the costs of those activities will be borne by each Fund in
proportion to the relative net asset value of the participating Fund.


During the fiscal year ended October 31, 1999, the Fund paid John Hancock Funds
the following amounts of expenses in connection with their services for the
Fund.

SALES COMPENSATION

As part of their business  strategies,  the Fund, along with John Hancock Funds,
pay compensation to financial services firms that sell the fund's shares.  These
firms  typically  pass along a portion of this  compensation  to your  financial
representative.

The two primary  sources of  compensation  payments  are (1) 12b-1 fees that are
paid out of the fund's assets and (2) sales charges paid by investors. The sales
charges  and  12b-1  fees  are  detailed  in  the   prospectus   and  under  the
"Distribution  Contracts"  in this  Statement  of  Additional  Information.  The
portions of these  expenses that are reallowed to financial  services  firms are
shown on the next page.

Whenever  you make an  investment  in the  Fund,  the  financial  services  firm
receives a  reallowance,  as described  below.  The firm also receives the first
year's  service  fee at this  time.  Beginning  with the  second  year  after an
investment is made,  the financial  services firm receives an annual service fee
of 0.25% of its total  eligible fund net assets.  This fee is paid  quarterly in
arrears by the Fund.

In addition, from time to time, John Hancock Funds, at its expense, may provide
significant additional compensation to financial services firms which sell or
arrange for the sale of shares of the Fund. Such compensation provided by John
Hancock Funds may include, for example, financial assistance to financial
services firms in connection with their conferences or seminars, sales or
training programs for invited registered representatives and other employees,
payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred by registered
representatives and other employees for such seminars or training programs,
seminars for the public, advertising and sales campaigns regarding one or more
Funds, and/or other financial services firms-sponsored events or activities.
From time to time, John Hancock Funds may make expense reimbursements for
special training of a financial services firm's registered representatives and
other employees in group meetings or to help pay the expenses of sales contests.
Other compensation, such as asset retention fees, finder's fees and
reimbursement for wire transfer fees, may be offered to the extent not
prohibited by law or any self-regulatory agency, such as the NASD.

NET ASSET VALUE



For purposes of  calculating  the net asset value ("NAV") of the Fund's  shares,
the following procedures are utilized wherever applicable.


Debt investment  securities are valued on the basis of valuations furnished by a
principal  market maker or a pricing  service,  both of which generally  utilize
electronic  data  processing  techniques  to  determine  valuations  for  normal
institutional  size trading units of debt securities  without exclusive reliance
upon quoted prices.


Equity  securities  traded on a  principal  exchange or NASDAQ  National  Market
issues  are  generally  valued  at last  sale  price  on the  day of  valuation.
Securities  in the  aforementioned  category for which no sales are reported and
other  securities  traded  over-the-counter  are  generally  valued  at the mean
between the current closing bid and asked prices.


Short-term debt investments  which have a remaining  maturity of 60 days or less
are generally  valued at amortized  cost which  approximates  market  value.  If
market  quotations are not readily available or if in the opinion of the Adviser
any quotation or price is not  representative of market value, the fair value of
the security  may be  determined  in good faith in  accordance  with  procedures
approved by the Trustees.


Foreign securities are valued on the basis of quotations from the primary market
in which  they are  traded.  Any  assets or  liabilities  expressed  in terms of
foreign  currencies are translated into U.S. dollars by the custodian bank based
on London currency exchange quotations as of 5:00 p.m., London time (12:00 noon,
New York time) on the date of any  determination of the Fund's NAV If quotations
are not readily available,  or the value has been materially  affected by events
occurring after the closing of a foreign  market,  assets are valued by a method
that the Trustees believe accurately reflects fair value.


The NAV for each fund and class is determined each business day at the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange (typically 4:00 p.m. Eastern
Time) by dividing a class's net assets by the number of its shares outstanding.
On any day an international market is closed and the New York Stock Exchange is
open, any foreign securities will be valued at the prior day's close with the
current day's exchange rate. Trading of foreign securities may take place on
Saturdays and U.S. business holidays on which the Fund's NAV is not calculated.
Consequently, the Fund's portfolio securities may trade and the NAV of the
Fund's shares may be significantly affected on days when a shareholder has no
access to the Fund.

INITIAL SALES CHARGE ON CLASS A AND CLASS C SHARES



Shares of the Fund are  offered at a price equal to their net asset value plus a
sales charge which, at the option of the purchaser, may be imposed either at the
time of purchase (the  "initial  sales charge  alternative")  or on a contingent
deferred basis (the  "deferred  sales charge  alternative").  The fund no longer
issues share  certificates.  Shares are  electronically  recorded.  The Trustees
reserve the right to change or waive the Fund's minimum investment  requirements
and to reject any order to purchase shares (including purchase by exchange) when
in the judgment of the Adviser such rejection is in the Fund's best interest.


The sales  charges  applicable to purchases of Class A and Class C shares of the
Fund are  described  in the  Prospectus.  Methods of  obtaining a reduced  sales
charges  referred to generally in the  Prospectus are described in detail below.
In  calculating  the sales  charge  applicable  to current  purchases of Class A
shares of the Fund,  the investor is entitled to  accumulate  current  purchases
with the greater of the current value (at offering  price) of the Class A shares
of the Fund, owned by the investor, or, if John Hancock Signature Services, Inc.
("Signature  Services") is notified by the investor's  dealer or the investor at
the time of the purchase, the cost of the Class A shares owned.


Without  Sales  Charges.  Class A shares  of the Fund may be  offered  without a
front-end  sales charge or contingent  deferred sales charge ("CDSC") to various
individuals and institutions as follows:


o        A Trustee or officer of the Trust; a Director or officer of the Adviser
and  its   affiliates   or   Selling   Brokers;   employees   or  sales
representatives of any of the foregoing; retired officers, employees or
Directors of any of the  foregoing;  a member of the  immediate  family
(spouse,  children,  grandchildren,  mother, father,  sister,  brother,
mother-in-law,  father-in-law,   daughter-in-law,   son-in-law,  niece,
nephew,  grandparent  and same  sex  domestic  partners)  of any of the
foregoing;  or any fund, pension,  profit sharing or other benefit plan
for the individuals described above.


o        A  broker,   dealer,   financial  planner,   consultant  or  registered
investment  advisor that has entered into a signed  agreement with John
Hancock  Funds  providing  specifically  for the use of Fund  shares in
fee-based  investment  products or  services  made  available  to their
clients.


o        A former  participant  in an employee  benefit  plan with John  Hancock
funds,  when he or she withdraws from his or her plan and transfers any
or all of his or her plan distributions directly to the Fund.


o        A member of a class action lawsuit against insurance companies who is
investing settlement proceeds.


o        Retirement plans participating in Merrill Lynch servicing programs,  if
the Plan has more than $3 million in assets or 500  eligible  employees
at the date the Plan  Sponsor  signs the  Merrill  Lynch  Recordkeeping
Service  Agreement.  See your Merrill Lynch  financial  consultant  for
further information.


o        Retirement plans investing through the PruArray Program sponsored by
Prudential Securities.


28





o        Pension plans transferring  assets from a John Hancock variable annuity
contract to the Fund pursuant to an exemptive  application  approved by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.


o        Participant  directed  retirement  plans  with at  least  100  eligible
employees at the inception of the Fund account. Each of these investors
may purchase Class A shares with no initial sales charge.  However,  if
the shares are redeemed  within 12 months after the end of the calendar
year in which the  purchase  was made,  a CDSC will be  imposed  at the
following rate:








Amount Invested                                 CDSC Rate
---------------                                 ---------

$1 to $4,999,999                                  1.00%
Next $5 million to $9,999,999                     0.50%
Amounts of $10 million and over                   0.25%








Class C shares may be offered without a front-end sales charge to:


o        Retirement  plans for which John Hancock  Signature  Services  performs
employer sponsored plan recordkeeping  services.  (these types of plans
include  401(k),  money  purchase  pension,  profit  sharing and SIMPLE
401(k)).


o        An investor who buys through a Merrill Lynch omnibus account.  However,
a CDSC may apply if the shares are sold within 12 months of purchase.


Class A and Class C shares may also be purchased without an initial sales charge
in  connection  with certain  liquidation,  merger or  acquisition  transactions
involving other investment companies or personal holding companies.


Combination  Privilege.  In calculating the sales charge applicable to purchases
of Class A shares  made at one time,  the  purchases  will be combined to reduce
sales charges if made by (a) an individual, his or her spouse and their children
under the age of 21, purchasing  securities for his or their own account,  (b) a
trustee or other  fiduciary  purchasing for a single trust,  estate or fiduciary
account and (c) groups  which  qualify  for the Group  Investment  Program  (see
below). A company's (not an individual's) qualified and non-qualified retirement
plan  investments can be combined to take advantage of this  privilege.  Further
information about combined purchases, including certain restrictions on combined
group  purchases,  is available  from Signature  Services or a Selling  Broker's
representative.


Accumulation Privilege. Investors (including investors combining purchases) who
are already Class A shareholders may also obtain the benefit of the reduced
sales charge by taking into account not only the amount being invested but also
the investor's purchase price or current value of the Class A shares of all John
Hancock funds which carry a sales charge already held by such person. Class A
shares of John Hancock money market funds will only be eligible for the
accumulation privilege if the investor has previously paid a sales charge on the
amount of those shares. Retirement plan investors may include the value of Class
B shares if Class B shares held are greater than $1 million. Retirement plans
must notify Signature Services to utilize. A company's (not an individual's)
qualified and non-qualified retirement plan investments can be combined to take
advantage of this privilege.


29





Group Investment Program. Under the Combination and Accumulation Privileges, all
members of a group may combine their  individual  purchases of Class A shares to
potentially  qualify for breakpoints in the sales charge schedule.  This feature
is  provided  to any  group  which (1) has been in  existence  for more than six
months,  (2) has a  legitimate  purpose  other than the  purchase of mutual fund
shares at a discount for its members,  (3) utilizes salary  deduction or similar
group methods of payment, and (4) agrees to allow sales materials of the fund in
its mailings to members at a reduced or no cost to John Hancock Funds.


Letter of Intention.  Reduced sales charges are also  applicable to  investments
pursuant to a Letter of Intention  (the "LOI"),  which should be read  carefully
prior to its execution by an investor. The Fund offers two options regarding the
specified  period for making  investments  under the LOI. All investors have the
option of making  their  investments  over a specified  period of thirteen  (13)
months.  Investors  who are using the Fund as a funding  medium for a retirement
plan, however,  may opt to make the necessary  investments called for by the LOI
over  a  forty-eight   (48)  month  period.   These   retirement  plans  include
traditional,  Roth and Education IRAs, SEP, SARSEP,  401(k),  403(b)  (including
TSAs),  SIMPLE IRA, SIMPLE 401(k),  Money Purchase  Pension,  Profit Sharing and

Section 457 plans. An individual's  non-qualified and qualified  retirement plan
investments  cannot be combined to satisfy LOI of 48 months.  Such an investment
(including   accumulations   and  combinations  but  not  including   reinvested
dividends) must aggregate  $50,000 or more during the specified  period from the
date of the LOI or from a date  within  ninety  (90) days  prior  thereto,  upon
written  request to  Signature  Services.  The sales  charge  applicable  to all
amounts  invested under the LOI is computed as if the aggregate  amount intended
to be invested had been invested  immediately.  If such aggregate  amount is not
actually  invested,  the  difference  in the sales charge  actually paid and the
sales  charge  payable had the LOI not been in effect is due from the  investor.
However,  for the purchases actually made within the specified period (either 13
or 48 months)  the sales  charge  applicable  will not be higher than that which
would have applied  (including  accumulations and combinations) had the LOI been
for the amount actually invested.


The LOI  authorizes  Signature  Services to hold in escrow a sufficient  Class A
shares  (approximately  5% of the  aggregate) to make up any difference in sales
charges on the amount intended to be invested and the amount actually  invested,
until such investment is completed  within the specified  period,  at which time
the escrowed Class A shares will be released.  If the total investment specified
in the LOI is not  completed,  the Class A shares held in escrow may be redeemed
and the  proceeds  used as required  to pay such sales  charge as may be due. By
signing the LOI, the investor authorizes Signature Services to act as his or her
attorney-in-fact  to redeem  any  escrowed  Class A shares  and adjust the sales
charge,  if  necessary.  A LOI does not  constitute a binding  commitment  by an
investor to purchase,  or by the Fund to sell, any additional Class A shares and
may be terminated at any time.



DEFERRED SALES CHARGE ON CLASS B AND CLASS C SHARES



Investments in Class B shares are purchased at net asset value per share without
the imposition of an initial sales charge so that the Fund will receive the full
amount of the purchase payment.


Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. Class B and Class C shares which are redeemed
within six years or one year of purchase, respectively, will be subject to a
CDSC at the rates set forth in the Prospectus as a percentage of the dollar
amount subject to the CDSC. The charge will be assessed on an amount equal to
the lesser of the current market value or the original purchase cost of the
Class B or Class C shares being redeemed. No CDSC will be imposed on increases
in account value above the initial purchase price or on shares derived from
reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions.


30





Class B shares are not available to full-service  retirement plans  administered
by  Signature  Services  or the Life  Company  that had more  than 100  eligible
employees at the inception of the Fund account.


The amount of the CDSC, if any, will vary  depending on the number of years from
the  time of  payment  for the  purchase  of Class B  shares  until  the time of
redemption  of such shares.  Solely for purposes of  determining  this number of
years from the time of any payment for the purchases of both Class B and Class C
shares,  all payments  during a month will be aggregated and deemed to have been
made on the first day of the month.


In determining  whether a CDSC applies to a redemption,  the calculation will be
determined in a manner that results in the lowest  possible rate being  charged.
It will be assumed  that your  redemption  comes first from shares you have held
beyond  the  six-year  CDSC  redemption  period  for  Class B or one  year  CDSC
redemption  period  for  Class C, or those you  acquired  through  dividend  and
capital  gain  reinvestment,  and next from the shares you have held the longest
during the six-year period for Class B shares.  For this purpose,  the amount of
any increase in a share's value above its initial  purchase price is not subject
to a CDSC.  Thus,  when a share that has appreciated in value is redeemed during
the CDSC period, a CDSC is assessed only on its initial purchase price.


When  requesting a redemption for a specific  dollar amount,  please indicate if
you require the proceeds to equal the dollar amount requested. If not indicated,
only the  specified  dollar  amount will be redeemed  from your  account and the
proceeds will be less any applicable CDSC.





Example:



You have purchased 100 Class B shares at $10 per share. The second year after
your purchase, your investment's net asset value per share has increased by $2
to $12, and you have gained 10 additional shares through dividend reinvestment.
If you redeem 50 shares at this time your CDSC will be calculated as follows:






oProceeds of 50 shares redeemed at $12 per shares (50 x 12)        $600.00
o*Minus Appreciation ($12 - $10) x 100 shares                      (200.00)
o Minus proceeds of 10 shares not subject to
  CDSC (dividend reinvestment)                                     (120.00)
                                                                   -------
oAmount subject to CDSC                                            $280.00








*The appreciation is based on all 100 shares in the account not just the shares
being redeemed.


Proceeds  from the CDSC are paid to John Hancock  Funds and are used in whole or
in part by John  Hancock  Funds to defray  its  expenses  related  to  providing
distribution-related  services  to the Fund in  connection  with the sale of the
Class B and  Class C  shares,  such as the  payment  of  compensation  to select
Selling  Brokers for selling Class B and Class C shares.  The combination of the
CDSC and the  distribution  and service fees facilitates the ability of the Fund
to sell the Class B and Class C shares  without a sales charge being deducted at
the time of the purchase.


Waiver of Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. The CDSC will be waived on
redemptions of Class B and Class C shares and of Class A shares that are subject
to CDSC, unless indicated otherwise, in the circumstances defined below:


31

you established  your periodic  withdrawal plan and 12% of the value of
subsequent  investments (less  redemptions) in that account at the time
you notify Signature  Services.  (Please note that this waiver does not
apply to periodic  withdrawal  plan  redemptions  of Class A or Class C
shares that are subject to a CDSC.)


*        Redemptions  by  Retirement   plans   participating  in  Merrill  Lynch

If you qualify for a CDSC waiver under one of these situations,  you must notify
Signature  Services  at the time you make your  redemption.  The waiver  will be
granted  once  Signature  Services  has  confirmed  that you are entitled to the
waiver.



SPECIAL REDEMPTIONS



Although  it  would  not  normally  do so,  the  Fund  has the  right to pay the
redemption  price  of  shares  of the  Fund in  whole  or in  part in  portfolio
securities as prescribed by the Trustees.  When the shareholder  sells portfolio
securities  received in this  fashion,  the  shareholder  will incur a brokerage
charge.  Any such  securities  would be valued for the  purposes  of making such
payment at the same value as used in determining net asset value.  The Fund has,
however,  elected to be governed by Rule 18f-1 under the Investment Company Act.
Under that rule,  the Fund must  redeem its shares for cash except to the extent
that the redemption  payments to any shareholder  during any 90-day period would
exceed  the  lesser of  $250,000  or 1% of the  Fund's  net  asset  value at the
beginning of such period.



ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS



Exchange Privilege.  The Fund permits exchanges of shares of any class of a fund
for shares of the same class in any other John Hancock fund offering that class.


Exchanges  between funds with shares that are not subject to a CDSC are based on
their  respective  net asset values.  No sales charge or  transaction  charge is
imposed.  Shares of the Fund which are subject to a CDSC may be  exchanged  into
shares of any of the other John Hancock funds that are subject to a CDSC without
incurring the CDSC; however,  the shares acquired in an exchange will be subject
to the CDSC schedule of the shares acquired if and when such shares are redeemed
(except that shares  exchanged into John Hancock 500 Index Fund and John Hancock
Intermediate  Government  Fund will retain the exchanged  fund's CDSC schedule).
For purposes of computing the CDSC payable upon redemption of shares acquired in
an exchange,  the holding period of the original  shares is added to the holding
period of the shares acquired in an exchange.


If a shareholder exchanges Class B shares purchased prior to January 1, 1994 for
Class B shares of any other John Hancock fund, the acquired shares will continue
to be subject to the CDSC schedule that was in effect when the exchanged  shares
were purchased.


The Fund  reserves the right to require that  previously  exchanged  shares (and
reinvested  dividends)  be in the  Fund  for 90 days  before  a  shareholder  is
permitted a new exchange.


The Fund may  refuse  any  exchange  order.  The Fund may  change or cancel  its
exchange policies at any time, upon 60 days' notice to its shareholders.


An exchange of shares is treated as a  redemption  of shares of one fund and the
purchase of shares of another for Federal  Income Tax purposes.  An exchange may
result in a taxable gain or loss. See "TAX STATUS".


Systematic Withdrawal Plan. The Fund permits the establishment of a Systematic
Withdrawal Plan. Payments under this plan represent proceeds arising from the
redemption of Fund shares which may result in realization of gain or loss for
purposes of Federal, state and local income taxes. The maintenance of a
Systematic Withdrawal Plan concurrently with purchases of additional shares of
the Fund could be disadvantageous to a shareholder because of the initial sales
charge payable on such purchases of Class A shares and the CDSC imposed on


34





redemptions of Class B and Class C shares and because redemptions are taxable
events. Therefore, a shareholder should not purchase shares at the same time a
Systematic Withdrawal Plan is in effect. The Fund reserves the right to modify
or discontinue the Systematic Withdrawal Plan of any shareholder on 30 days'
prior written notice to such shareholder, or to discontinue the availability of
such plan in the future. The shareholder may terminate the plan at any time by
giving proper notice to Signature Services.


Monthly Automatic Accumulation Program ("MAAP"). The program is explained in the
Prospectus. The program, as it relates to automatic investment checks, is
subject to the following conditions:


The investments will be drawn on or about the day of the month indicated.


The privilege of making investments through the MAAP may be revoked by Signature
Services  without  prior  notice  if  any  investment  is  not  honored  by  the
shareholder's  bank.  The  bank  shall  be under no  obligation  to  notify  the
shareholder as to the non-payment of any checks.


The program may be discontinued by the shareholder  either by calling  Signature
Services or upon written notice to Signature Services which is received at least
five (5) business days prior to the order date of any investment.


Reinstatement or Reinvestment Privilege. If Signature Services is notified prior
to reinvestment, a shareholder who has redeemed Fund shares may, within 120 days
after the date of  redemption,  reinvest  without  payment of a sales charge any
part of the  redemption  proceeds  in  shares  of the same  class of the Fund or
another John Hancock fund, subject to the minimum investment limit in that fund.
The proceeds  from the  redemption  of Class A shares may be  reinvested  at net
asset value  without  paying a sales  charge in Class A shares of the Fund or in
Class A shares of any John Hancock fund. If a CDSC was paid upon a redemption, a
shareholder may reinvest the proceeds from this redemption at net asset value in
additional  shares  of the  class  from  which  the  redemption  was  made.  The
shareholder's  account will be credited with the amount of any CDSC charged upon
the prior redemption and the new shares will continue to be subject to the CDSC.
The  holding  period of the  shares  acquired  through  reinvestment  will,  for
purposes of computing the CDSC payable upon a subsequent redemption, include the
holding period of the redeemed shares.


To protect the interests of other investors in the Fund, the Fund may cancel the
reinvestment  privilege  of any parties  that,  in the opinion of the Fund,  are
using market timing  strategies or making more than seven exchanges per owner or
controlling  party per calendar year. Also, the Fund may refuse any reinvestment
request.


The Fund may change or cancel its reinvestment policies at any time.


A redemption or exchange of Fund shares is a taxable transaction for Federal
income tax purposes even if the reinvestment privilege is exercised, and any
gain or loss realized by a shareholder on the redemption or other disposition of
Fund shares will be treated for tax purposes as described under the caption "TAX
STATUS."

Retirement plans participating in Merrill Lynch's servicing programs:


Class A shares  are  available  at net asset  value for plans with $3 million in
plan assets or 500 eligible  employees  at the date the Plan  Sponsor  signs the
Merrill Lynch Recordkeeping Service Agreement.  If the plan does not meet either
of these limits, Class A shares are not available.


For  participating  retirement  plans  investing in Class B shares,  shares will
convert  to Class A shares  after  eight  years,  or sooner if the plan  attains
assets of $5 million (by means of a CDSC-free  redemption/purchase  at net asset
value).






PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS THROUGH THIRD PARTIES



Shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed through certain  broker-dealers.
Brokers  may charge for their  services  or place  limitations  on the extent to
which  you may use the  services  of the  Fund.  The Fund will be deemed to have
received  a  purchase  or  redemption  order when an  authorized  broker,  or if
applicable,  a broker's authorized designee,  receives the order. If a broker is
an  agent  or  designee  of the  Fund,  orders  are  processed  at the NAV  next
calculated  after the broker  receives the order.  The broker must segregate any
orders it  receives  after the close of  regular  trading  on the New York Stock
Exchange  and  transmit  those  orders  to the  Fund for  execution  at NAV next
determined.  Some brokers that maintain nominee accounts with the Fund for their
clients charge an annual fee on the average net assets held in such accounts for
accounting,  servicing,  and distribution  services they provide with respect to
the underlying Fund shares. The Adviser,  the Fund, and John Hancock Funds, Inc.
(the Fund's principal distributor), share in the expense of these fees.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FUND'S SHARES



The Trustees of the Trust are  responsible for the management and supervision of
the Fund.  The  Declaration  of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited
number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest of the Fund, without
par value.  Under the  Declaration of Trust,  the Trustees have the authority to
create  and  classify  shares of  beneficial  interest  in  separate  series and
classes,  without  further  action  by  shareholders.  As of the  date  of  this
Statement of Additional Information,  the Trustees have authorized shares of the
Fund and two other  series.  Additional  series may be added in the future.  The
Trustees  have also  authorized  the issuance of three  classes of shares of the
Fund, designated as Class A, Class B and Class C.


The shares of each class of the Fund represent an equal  proportionate  interest
in the aggregate net assets  attributable to that class of the Fund.  Holders of
each class of shares have certain exclusive voting rights on matters relating to
their respective  distribution plans. The different classes of the Fund may bear
different  expenses  relating  to  the  cost  of  holding  shareholder  meetings
necessitated by the exclusive voting rights of any class of shares.


Dividends paid by the Fund, if any, with respect to each class of shares will be
calculated in the same manner, at the same time and on the same day will be in
the same amount, except for differences resulting from the fact that (i) the
distribution and service fees relating to each class of shares will be borne
exclusively by that class, (ii) Class B and Class C shares will pay higher
distribution and service fees than Class A shares and (iii) each class of shares
will bear any class expenses properly allocable to that class of shares, subject
to the conditions the Internal Revenue Service imposes with respect to
multiple-class structures. Similarly, the net asset value per share may vary
depending on which class of shares are purchased. No interest will be paid on
uncashed dividend or redemption checks.


36





In the event of  liquidation,  shareholders of each class are entitled to share
pro rata in the net  assets  of the Fund  available  for  distribution  to these
shareholders.  Shares  entitle their  holders to one vote per share,  are freely
transferable  and have no preemptive,  subscription or conversion  rights.  When
issued,  shares  are fully  paid and  non-assessable  except as set forth in the
Prospectus.


Unless  otherwise  required by the Investment  Company Act or the Declaration of
Trust,  the Fund has no intention of holding  annual  meetings of  shareholders.
Fund  shareholders  may  remove a Trustee  by the  affirmative  vote of at least
two-thirds of the Trust's  outstanding  shares,  and the Trustees shall promptly
call a meeting for such purpose when requested to do so in writing by the record
holders  of  not  less  than  10%  of  the  outstanding  shares  of  the  Trust.
Shareholders   may,  under  certain   circumstances,   communicate   with  other
shareholders in connection  with  requesting a special meeting of  shareholders.
However,  at any time that less than a majority of the Trustees  holding  office
were elected by the  shareholders,  the Trustees will call a special  meeting of
shareholders for the purpose of electing Trustees.


Under Massachusetts law,  shareholders of a Massachusetts  business trust could,
under certain  circumstances,  be held personally liable for acts or obligations
of the Trust.  However,  the Fund's  Declaration  of Trust  contains  an express
disclaimer  of  shareholder  liability for acts,  obligations  or affairs of the
Fund.  The  Declaration  of Trust also provides for  indemnification  out of the
Fund's  assets for all losses and expenses of any  shareholder  held  personally
liable by reason of being or having been a shareholder. The Declaration of Trust
also provides that no series of the Trust shall be liable for the liabilities of
any other series.  Furthermore, no fund included in this Fund's prospectus shall
be liable for the  liabilities  of any other John  Hancock  fund.  Liability  is
therefor  limited to  circumstances  in which the Fund itself would be unable to
meet its obligations, and the possibility of this occurrence is remote.


The Fund reserves the right to reject any  application  which conflicts with the
Fund's  internal  policies or the  policies of any  regulatory  authority.  John
Hancock Funds does not accept  starter,  credit card or third party checks.  All
checks  returned by the post office as  undeliverable  will be reinvested at net
asset  value in the fund or funds from which a  redemption  was made or dividend
paid. Information provided on the account application may be used by the Fund to
verify the accuracy of the  information or for  background or financial  history
purposes.  A joint account will be administered as a joint tenancy with right of
survivorship,  unless the joint owners notify Signature  Services of a different
intent.  A shareholder's  account is governed by the laws of The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. For telephone transactions, the transfer agent will take measures
to verify the identity of the caller,  such as asking for name,  account number,
Social Security or other taxpayer ID number and other relevant  information.  If
appropriate  measures are taken,  the transfer agent is not  responsible for any
losses that may occur to any account due to an unauthorized telephone call. Also
for your protection  telephone  transactions are not permitted on accounts whose
names or addresses have changed within the past 30 days. Proceeds from telephone
transactions can only be mailed to the address of record.


Selling activities for the Fund may not take place outside the U.S. except with
U.S. military bases, APO addresses and U.S. diplomats. Brokers of record on
Non-U.S. investors' accounts with foreign mailing addresses are required to
certify that all sales activities have occurred, and in the future will occur,
only in the U.S. A foreign corporation may purchase shares of the Fund only if
it has a U.S. mailing address.

TAX STATUS



The Fund, is treated as a separate  entity for accounting and tax purposes,  has
qualified and elected to be treated as a "regulated  investment  company"  under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),  and
intends to continue to qualify for each taxable  year.  As such and by complying
with the applicable  provisions of the Code regarding the sources of its income,
the timing of its distributions, and the diversification of its assets, the Fund
will not be subject to Federal income tax on its taxable  income  (including net
realized  capital gains) which is distributed to shareholders in accordance with
the timing requirements of the Code.


The Fund will be subject  to a 4%  nondeductible  Federal  excise tax on certain
amounts not distributed (and not treated as having been distributed) on a timely
basis in accordance  with annual  minimum  distribution  requirements.  The Fund
intends under normal  circumstances to avoid or minimize  liability for such tax
by satisfying such distribution requirements.


Distributions  from the  Fund's  current or  accumulated  earnings  and  profits
("E&P"), will be taxable under the Code for investors who are subject to tax. If
these  distributions  are  paid  from the  Fund's  "investment  company  taxable
income," they will be taxable as ordinary income;  and if they are paid from the
Fund's "net capital gain," they will be taxable as capital  gains.  (Net capital
gain is the excess (if any) of net  long-term  capital gain over net  short-term
capital loss,  and investment  company  taxable income is all taxable income and
capital  gains,  other than net capital  gain,  after  reduction  by  deductible
expenses.)  Some  distributions  may be paid in  January  but may be  taxable to
shareholders as if they had been received  December 31 of the previous year. The
tax treatment described above will apply without regard to whether distributions
are received in cash or reinvested in additional shares of the Fund.


Distributions,  if any,  in excess of E&P will  constitute  a return of  capital
under the Code, which will first reduce an investor's  federal tax basis in Fund
shares and then, to the extent such basis is exceeded,  will generally give rise
to capital gains.  Shareholders who have chosen automatic  reinvestment of their
distributions  will have a federal tax basis in each share received  pursuant to
such a  reinvestment  equal to the amount of cash they would have  received  had
they  elected to receive  the  distribution  in cash,  dividend by the number of
shares received in the reinvestment.


If the Fund invests in stock (including an option to acquire stock such as is
inherent in a convertible bond) of certain foreign corporations that receive at
least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as interest,
dividends, certain rents and royalties or capital gain) or hold at least 50% of
their assets in investments producing such passive income ("passive foreign
investment companies"), the Fund could be subject to Federal income tax and
additional interest charges on "excess distributions" received from such
companies or gain from the sale of stock in such companies, even if all income
or gain actually received by the Fund is timely distributed to its shareholders.
The Fund would not be able to pass through to its shareholders any credit or
deduction for such a tax. An election may be available to ameliorate these
adverse tax consequences, but could require the Fund to recognize taxable income
or gain without the concurrent receipt of cash. These investments could also
result in the treatment of associated capital gains as ordinary income. The Fund
may limit and/or manage its holdings in passive foreign investment companies or
make an available election to minimize its tax liability or maximize its return
from these investments.


38





Foreign  exchange  gains and  losses  realized  by the Fund in  connection  with
certain  transactions  involving foreign  currency-denominated  debt securities,
foreign  currency  forward  contracts,   foreign  currencies,   or  payables  or
receivables  denominated in a foreign currency are subject to Section 988 of the
Code,  which  generally  causes  such gains and losses to be treated as ordinary
income  and  losses  and  may  affect  the  amount,   timing  and  character  of
distributions to shareholders.  Transactions in foreign  currencies that are not
directly  related to the Fund's  investment  in stock or  securities,  including
speculative  currency positions could under future Treasury  regulations produce
income  not among  the types of  "qualifying  income"  from  which the Fund must
derive  at least 90% of its  gross  income  for each  taxable  year.  If the net
foreign exchange loss for a year treated as ordinary loss under Section 988 were
to exceed the Fund's  investment  company taxable income computed without regard
to such loss,  the  resulting  overall  ordinary loss for such year would not be
deductible by the Fund or its shareholders in future years.


The Fund may be  subject  to  withholding  and other  taxes  imposed  by foreign
countries with respect to its investments in foreign securities. Tax conventions
between  certain  countries  and the U.S.  may reduce or  eliminate  such taxes.
Investors may be entitled to claim U.S.  foreign tax credits or deductions  with
respect to foreign  income taxes,  or certain  other  foreign taxes  ("qualified
foreign taxes"), paid by the Fund, subject to certain provisions and limitations
contained in the Code,  if the Fund so elects.  If more than 50% of the value of
the Fund's total  assets at the close of any taxable  year  consists of stock or
securities  of  foreign  corporations,  the Fund may file an  election  with the
Internal  Revenue  Service  pursuant to which  shareholders  of the Fund will be
required  to (i)  include  in  ordinary  gross  income (in  addition  to taxable
dividends  and  distributions  actually  received)  their  pro  rata  shares  of
qualified  foreign  taxes paid by the Fund even though not actually  received by
them, and (ii) treat such  respective pro rata portions as foreign taxes paid by
them.


If the Fund makes this  election,  shareholders  may then  deduct  such pro rata
portions  of  foreign  income  taxes  in  computing  their  taxable  income,  or
alternatively,   use  them  as  foreign  tax  credits,   subject  to  applicable
limitations,  against their U.S.  Federal income taxes.  Shareholders who do not
itemize deductions for Federal income tax purposes will not, however, be able to
deduct their pro rata portion of foreign income taxes paid by the Fund, although
such shareholders will be required to include their share of such taxes in gross
income.  Shareholders  who claim a foreign tax credit for such foreign taxes may
be required to treat a portion of dividends received from the Fund as a separate
category of income for purposes of computing the  limitations on the foreign tax
credit.  Tax-exempt shareholders will ordinarily not benefit from this election.
Each year that the Fund files the election  described  above,  its  shareholders
will be  notified  of the  amount of (i) each  shareholder's  pro rata  share of
foreign  income  taxes paid by the Fund and (ii) the  portion of Fund  dividends
which represents  income from each foreign  country.  If the Fund cannot or does
not make  this  election,  the Fund will  deduct  the  foreign  taxes it pays in
determining the amount it has available for  distribution to  shareholders,  and
shareholders will not include these foreign taxes in their income, nor will they
be entitled to any tax deductions or credits with respect to such taxes.


The amount of the Fund's net realized capital gains, if any, in any given year
will vary depending upon the Adviser's current investment strategy and whether
the Adviser believes it to be in the best interest of the Fund to dispose of
portfolio securities and/or engage in options, futures or forward transactions
that will generate capital gains. At the time of an investor's purchase of Fund
shares, a portion of the purchase price is often attributable to realized or
unrealized appreciation in the Fund's portfolio or undistributed taxable income
of the Fund. Consequently, subsequent distributions from such appreciation or
income may be taxable to such investor even if the net asset value of the
investor's shares is, as a result of the distributions, reduced below the
investor's cost for such shares, and the distributions in reality represent a
return of a portion of the purchase price.


39





Upon a  redemption,  or other  disposition  of shares of the Fund  (including by
exercise of the exchange  privilege) in a transaction  that is treated as a sale
for tax purposes,  a shareholder will ordinarily  realize a taxable gain or loss
depending  upon his basis in his  shares.  Such gain or loss will be  treated as
capital  gain or loss if the  shares  are  capital  assets in the  shareholder's
hands. A sales charge paid in purchasing shares of the Fund cannot be taken into
account for purposes of  determining  gain or loss on the redemption or exchange
of such shares  within 90 days after their  purchase to the extent shares of the
Fund or another John Hancock fund are subsequently acquired without payment of a
sales  charge  pursuant  to  the  reinvestment  or  exchange   privilege.   This
disregarded  charge will result in an increase in the shareholder's tax basis in
the shares  subsequently  acquired.  Also,  any loss realized on a redemption or
exchange  may be  disallowed  to the extent the shares  disposed of are replaced
with  other  shares  of the Fund  within a period of 61 days  beginning  30 days
before and ending 30 days after the shares are  disposed of, such as pursuant to
automatic  dividend  reinvestments.  In such a case,  the  basis  of the  shares
acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized upon
the redemption of shares with a tax holding period of six months or less will be
treated as a  long-term  capital  loss to the extent of any  amounts  treated as
distributions   of   long-term   capital  gain  with  respect  to  such  shares.
Shareholders  should consult their own tax advisers  regarding their  particular
circumstances  to  determine  whether a  disposition  of Fund shares is properly
treated as a sale for tax purposes, as is assumed in the foregoing discussion.


Although its present  intention is to  distribute,  at least  annually,  all net
capital  gain, if any, the Fund reserves the right to retain and reinvest all or
any portion of the excess,  as computed for Federal income tax purposes,  of net
long-term  capital gain over net  short-term  capital loss in any year. The Fund
will not in any event  distribute  net capital gain  realized in any year to the
extent that a capital  loss is carried  forward  from prior years  against  such
gain.  To  the  extent  such  excess  was  retained  and  not  exhausted  by the
carryforward  of prior  years'  capital  losses,  it would be subject to Federal
income tax in the hands of the Fund.  Upon proper  designation of this amount by
the Fund, each  shareholder  would be treated for Federal income tax purposes as
if the Fund had  distributed  to him on the last day of its taxable year his pro
rata share of such excess,  and he had paid his pro rata share of the taxes paid
by the  Fund  and  reinvested  the  remainder  in the  Fund.  Accordingly,  each
shareholder  would (a) include his pro rata share of such excess as capital gain
in his return for his taxable  year in which the last day of the Fund's  taxable
year falls,  (b) be  entitled  either to a tax credit on his return for, or to a
refund of, his pro rata share of the taxes paid by the Fund, and (c) be entitled
to increase the adjusted tax basis for his shares in the Fund by the  difference
between his pro rata share of such excess and his pro rata share of such taxes.


For Federal  income tax  purposes,  the Fund is permitted to carry forward a net
realized  capital loss in any year to offset its own net capital gains,  if any,
during the eight years following the year of the loss. To the extent  subsequent
net capital  gains are offset by such  losses,  they would not result in Federal
income tax liability to the Fund, as noted above,  and would not be  distributed
as such to  shareholders.  The Fund  has  $140,635,246  of  capital  loss  carry
forwards  available to the extent  provided by regulations to offset net capital
gains. The carry forwards expire as follows:  October 31,  2006--$2,259,735  and
October 31, 2007--$138,375,511.


For purposes of the dividends received deduction available to corporations,
dividends received by the Fund, if any, from U.S. domestic corporations in
respect of the stock of such corporations held by the Fund, for U.S. Federal
income tax purposes, for at least 46 days (91 days in the case of certain
preferred stock) during a prescribed period extending before and after each such


40





dividend and distributed and properly designated by the Fund may be treated as
qualifying dividends. The Fund would generally have a portion of its
distributions treated as qualifying dividends. Corporate shareholders must meet
the holding period requirements stated above with respect to their shares of the
Fund for each dividend in order to qualify for the deduction and, if they have
any debt that is deemed under the Code directly attributable to such shares, may
be denied a portion of the dividends received deduction. The entire qualifying
dividend, including the otherwise deductible amount, will be included in
determining the alternative minimum tax liability, if any. Additionally, any
corporate shareholder should consult its tax adviser regarding the possibility
that its tax basis in its shares may be reduced, for Federal income tax
purposes, by reason of "extraordinary dividends" received with respect to the
shares and, to the extent such basis would be reduced below zero, that current
recognition of income would be required.


The Fund is required to accrue income on any debt securities that have more than
a de minimis amount of original issue discount (or debt securities acquired at a
market  discount,  if the Fund  elects  to  include  market  discount  in income
currently) prior to the receipt of the corresponding cash payments.  The mark to
market or  constructive  sale  rules  applicable  to certain  options,  futures,
forwards,  short  sales  or other  transactions  may  also  require  the Fund to
recognize  income or gain  without a concurrent  receipt of cash.  Additionally,
some countries  restrict  repatriation which may make it difficult or impossible
for the Fund to obtain  cash  corresponding  to its  earnings or assets in those
countries.  However,  the Fund must distribute to shareholders  for each taxable
year  substantially all of its net income and net capital gains,  including such
income or gain, to qualify as a regulated investment company and avoid liability
for any federal income or excise tax. Therefore, the Fund may have to dispose of
its portfolio securities under  disadvantageous  circumstances to generate cash,
or borrow cash, to satisfy these distribution requirements.


A state  income (and  possibly  local income  and/or  intangible  property)  tax
exemption is generally available to the extent (if any) the Fund's distributions
are derived from interest on (or, in the case of intangible  property taxes, the
value of its assets is  attributable  to) certain U.S.  Government  obligations,
provided in some states that certain thresholds for holdings of such obligations
and/or reporting  requirements are satisfied.  The Fund will not seek to satisfy
any  threshold or reporting  requirements  that may apply in  particular  taxing
jurisdictions,  although the Fund may in its sole  discretion  provide  relevant
information to shareholders.


The Fund will be required to report to the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS")
all taxable distributions to shareholders, as well as gross proceeds from the
redemption or exchange of Fund shares, except in the case of certain exempt
recipients, i.e., corporations and certain other investors distributions to
which are exempt from the information reporting provisions of the Code. Under
the backup withholding provisions of Code Section 3406 and applicable Treasury
regulations, all such reportable distributions and proceeds may be subject to
backup withholding of federal income tax at the rate of 31% in the case of
non-exempt shareholders who fail to furnish the Fund with their correct taxpayer
identification number and certain certifications required by the IRS or if the
IRS or a broker notifies the Fund that the number furnished by the shareholder
is incorrect or that the shareholder is subject to backup withholding as a
result of failure to report interest or dividend income. The Fund may refuse to
accept an application that does not contain any required taxpayer identification
number or certification that the number provided is correct. If the backup
withholding provisions are applicable, any such distributions and proceeds,
whether taken in cash or reinvested in shares, will be reduced by the amounts
required to be withheld. Any amounts withheld may be credited against a
shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability. Investors should consult their
tax advisers about the applicability of the backup withholding provisions.


41





Different tax treatment, including penalties on certain excess contributions and
deferrals, certain pre-retirement and post-retirement  distributions and certain
prohibited  transactions,  is  accorded  to  accounts  maintained  as  qualified
retirement  plans.  Shareholders  should  consult  their tax  advisers  for more
information.


Limitations imposed by the Code on regulated  investment companies like the Fund
may restrict the Fund's ability to enter into options, futures, foreign currency
positions, and foreign currency forward contracts.


Certain options,  futures and forward foreign currency  contracts  undertaken by
the Fund may cause the Fund to recognize  gains or losses from marking to market
even  though  its  positions  have not been sold or  terminated  and  affect the
character  as  long-term  or  short-term  (or,  in the case of foreign  currency
contracts,  as  ordinary  income or loss) and timing of some  capital  gains and
losses realized by the Fund. Additionally, the Fund may be required to recognize
gain,  but not loss,  if an  option  is  treated  as a  constructive  sale of an
appreciated  financial  position in the Fund's portfolio.  Also,  certain of the
Fund's  losses  on  its  transactions  involving  options,  futures  or  forward
contracts  and/or  offsetting or successor  portfolio  positions may be deferred
rather than being taken into account currently in calculating the Fund's taxable
income  or  gains.  Certain  of these  transactions  may also  cause the Fund to
dispose  of  investments  sooner  than  would  otherwise  have  occurred.  These
transactions may therefore affect the amount, timing and character of the Fund's
distributions to  shareholders.  The Fund will take into account the special tax
rules (including  consideration of available  elections)  applicable to options,
futures or forward  contracts  in order to minimize  any  potential  adverse tax
consequences.


The  foregoing  discussion  relates  solely to U.S.  Federal  income  tax law as
applicable to U.S. persons (i.e.,  U.S.  citizens or residents and U.S. domestic
corporations,  partnerships,  trusts or estates)  subject to tax under such law.
The discussion does not address special tax rules applicable to certain types of
investors,  such as  tax-exempt  entities,  insurance  companies,  and financial
institutions.  Dividends, capital gain distributions,  and ownership of or gains
realized on the  redemption  (including  an exchange) of Fund shares may also be
subject to state and local  taxes.  Shareholders  should  consult  their own tax
advisers as to the  Federal,  state or local tax  consequences  of  ownership of
shares  of, and  receipt of  distributions  from,  the Fund in their  particular
circumstances.


Non-U.S.  investors  not engaged in a U.S.  trade or  business  with which their
investment in the Fund is effectively  connected will be subject to U.S. Federal
income  tax  treatment  that is  different  from  that  described  above.  These
investors may be subject to nonresident alien withholding tax at the rate of 30%
(or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty) on amounts  treated as ordinary
dividends  from the Fund and,  unless an effective  IRS Form W-8, Form W-8BEN or
other authorized  withholding  certificate is on file, to 31% backup withholding
on certain other payments from the Fund. Non-U.S. investors should consult their
tax advisers regarding such treatment and the application of foreign taxes to an
investment in the Fund.


The Fund is not subject to Massachusetts corporate excise or franchise taxes.
The Fund anticipates that, provided that the Fund qualifies as a regulated
investment company under the Code, it will also not be required to pay any
Massachusetts income tax.

CALCULATION OF PERFORMANCE



As of October 31, 1999,  the average  annual total returns for Class A shares of
the Fund for the 1 year period and since commencement of operations on March 14,
1996 were 3.25% and 19.73%, respectively.


As of October 31, 1999,  the average  annual total returns for Class B shares of
the Fund for the 1 year period and since  commencement  of operations on January
14, 1997 were 2.93% and 11.69%, respectively.


As of October 31, 1999,  the  cumulative  total return for Class C shares of the
Fund since commencement of operations on March 1, 1999 was 0.35%.


Total  return is  computed by finding the  average  annual  compounded  rates of
return over the designated periods that would equate the initial amount invested
to the ending redeemable value, according to the following formula:


n _____

T = \ /ERV/P - 1








Where:

         P =      a hypothetical initial investment of $1,000.
         T =      average annual total return.
         n =      number of years.
         ERV =    ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1,000 investment
                  made at the beginning of the 1 year and life-of-fund periods.








Because each class has its own sales charge and fee structure,  the classes have
different  performance  results.  In the case of each  class,  this  calculation
assumes the maximum  sales charge is included in the initial  investment  or the
CDSC is applied at the end of the period, respectively. This calculation assumes
that all dividends and  distributions  are  reinvested at net asset value on the
reinvestment dates during the period.  The "distribution  rate" is determined by
annualizing the result of dividing the declared dividends of the Fund during the
period stated by the maximum offering price or net asset value at the end of the
period.  Excluding the Fund's sales charge from the distribution rate produces a
high rate.


In addition to average  annual total returns,  the Fund may quote  unaveraged or
cumulative total returns  reflecting the simple change in value of an investment
over a stated period.  Cumulative total returns may be quoted as a percentage or
as a dollar amount, and may be calculated for a single  investment,  a series of
investments, and/or a series of redemptions, over any time period. Total returns
may be quoted with or without  taking the Fund's  sales charge on Class A shares
or the CDSC on Class B or Class C shares  into  account.  Excluding  the  Fund's
sales  charge on Class A shares and the CDSC on Class B or Class C shares from a
total return calculation produces a higher total return figure.


From time to time, in reports and promotional literature, the Fund's total
return will be compared to indices of mutual funds such as Lipper Analytical
Services, Inc.'s "Lipper Mutual Performance Analysis," a monthly publication
which tracks net assets, total return, and yield on mutual funds in the United
States. Ibottson and Associates, CDA Weisenberger and F.C. Towers are also used
for comparison purposes, as well as the Russell and Wilshire Indices.


43





Performance  rankings and ratings  reported  periodically in, and excerpts from,
national financial publications such as MONEY MAGAZINE,  FORBES,  BUSINESS WEEK,
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,  MORNINGSTAR,  STANGER'S and BARRON'S, etc. may also be
utilized.  The Fund's promotional and sales literature may make reference to the
Fund's  "beta".  Beta is a reflection of the market  related risk of the Fund by
showing how responsive the Fund is to the market.


The performance of the Fund is not fixed or guaranteed.  Performance  quotations
should not be considered to be  representations  of  performance of the Fund for
any period in the  future.  The  performance  of the Fund is a function  of many
factors  including  its  earnings,  expenses and number of  outstanding  shares.
Fluctuating  market  conditions;  purchases,  sales, and maturities of portfolio
securities;  sales and redemptions of shares of beneficial interest; and changes
in  operating  expenses  are all examples of items that can increase or decrease
the Fund's performance.



BROKERAGE ALLOCATION



Decisions  concerning  the  purchase and sale of  portfolio  securities  and the
allocation  of  brokerage  commissions  are  made  by the  Adviser  pursuant  to
recommendations made by an investment  committee of the Adviser,  which consists
of officers  and  directors of the Adviser and  affiliates  and Trustees who are
interested persons of the Fund. Orders for purchases and sales of securities are
placed in a manner  which,  in the opinion of the  Adviser,  will offer the best
price and market for the  execution  of each such  transaction.  Purchases  from
underwriters  of portfolio  securities  may include a commission or  commissions
paid by the issuer  and  transactions  with  dealers  serving  as market  makers
reflect a "spread".  Debt securities are generally traded on a net basis through
dealers  acting  for their own  account as  principals  and not as  brokers;  no
brokerage commissions are payable on these transactions.


In the U.S. Government  securities market,  securities are generally traded on a
"net" basis with  dealers  acting as principal  for their own account  without a
stated commission,  although the price of the security usually includes a profit
to the  dealer.  On  occasion,  certain  money  market  instruments  and  agency
securities  may be  purchased  directly  from  the  issuer,  in  which  case  no
commissions  or  premiums  are paid.  In other  countries,  both debt and equity
securities  are traded on exchanges at fixed  commission  rates.  Commissions on
foreign  transactions are generally higher than the negotiated  commission rates
available  in the U.S.  There  is  generally  less  government  supervision  and
regulation of foreign stock exchanges and broker-dealers than in the U.S.


The Fund's  primary  policy is to execute all  purchases  and sales of portfolio
instruments  at the  most  favorable  prices  consistent  with  best  execution,
considering all of the costs of the transaction including brokerage commissions.
This policy governs the selection of brokers and dealers and the market in which
a transaction is executed.  Consistent with the foregoing  primary  policy,  the
Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers,  Inc. and other
policies  that the Trustees  may  determine,  the Adviser may consider  sales of
shares of the Fund as a factor in the selection of broker-dealers to execute the
Fund's portfolio transactions.


To the extent consistent with the foregoing, the Fund will be governed in the
selection of brokers and dealers, and the negotiation of brokerage commission
rates and dealer spreads, by the reliability and quality of services, including
primarily the availability and value of research information and to a lesser
extent statistical assistance furnished to the Adviser of the Fund, and their
value and expected contribution to the performance of the Fund. It is not
possible to place a dollar value on information and services to be received from
brokers and dealers, since it is only supplementary to the research efforts of
the Adviser. The receipt of research information is not expected to reduce
significantly the expenses of the Adviser. The research information and
statistical assistance furnished by brokers and dealers may benefit the Life


44





Company or other advisory clients of the Adviser, and, conversely, brokerage
commissions and spreads paid by other advisory clients of the Adviser may result
in research information and statistical assistance beneficial to the Fund. The
Fund will not make commitments to allocate portfolio transactions upon any
prescribed basis. While the Adviser's officers will be primarily responsible for
the allocation of the Fund's brokerage business, the policies and practices of
the Adviser in this regard must be consistent with the foregoing and at all
times be subject to review by the Trustees. For the fiscal years ended October
31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, the Fund paid negotiate brokerage commissions of
$1,819,800, $4,222,315, and $4,845,254, respectively.


As permitted by Section 28(e) of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, the Fund
may pay to a broker which provides  brokerage and research  services to the Fund
an amount of disclosed  commission  in excess of the  commission  which  another
broker would have  charged for  effecting  that  transaction.  This  practice is
subject  to a good  faith  determination  by the  Trustees  that  such  price is
reasonable  in  light  of the  services  provided  and to such  policies  as the
Trustees may adopt from time to time.  During the fiscal years ended October 31,
1999, the Fund paid $304,997 in  commissions to compensate  brokers for research
services  such as industry,  economic  and company  reviews and  evaluations  of
securities.


The  Adviser's  indirect  parent,  the  Life  Company,   is  the  indirect  sole
shareholder of Signator Investors, Inc., a broker-dealer (until January 1, 1999,
John Hancock Distributors,  Inc.) ("Signator" or "Affiliated Broker").  Pursuant
to procedures determined by the Trustees and consistent with the above policy of
obtaining best net results, the Fund may execute portfolio  transactions with or
through the Affiliated Broker. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 1997, 1998
and 1999, the Fund paid no brokerage commissions to the Affiliated Broker.


Signator  may act as  broker  for the Fund on  exchange  transactions,  subject,
however,  to the general  policy of the Fund set forth above and the  procedures
adopted by the Trustees pursuant to the Investment Company Act. Commissions paid
to an  Affiliated  Broker  must be at least as  favorable  as  those  which  the
Trustees believe to be contemporaneously  charged by other brokers in connection
with comparable  transactions  involving  similar  securities being purchased or
sold. A transaction  would not be placed with an  Affiliated  Broker if the Fund
would have to pay a commission rate less favorable than the Affiliated  Broker's
contemporaneous  charges for comparable transactions for its other most favored,
but unaffiliated,  customers except for accounts for which the Affiliated Broker
acts as clearing  broker for another  brokerage  firm,  and any customers of the
Affiliated  Broker not  comparable  to the Fund as determined by the majority of
the Trustees  who are not  "interested  persons"  (as defined in the  Investment
Company  Act) of the Fund,  the Adviser or the  Affiliated  Broker.  Because the
Adviser,  which is affiliated with the Affiliated Broker,  has, as an investment
adviser to the Fund, the obligation to provide investment  management  services,
which include elements of research and related investment skills,  such research
and  related  skills  will not be used by the  Affiliated  Broker as a basis for
negotiating commissions at a rate higher than that determined in accordance with
the above criteria.


Other investment advisory clients advised by the Adviser may also invest in the
same securities as the Fund. When these clients buy or sell the same securities
at substantially the same time, the Adviser may average the transactions as to
price and allocate the amount of available investments in a manner which the
Adviser believes to be equitable to each client, including the Fund. Because of
this, client accounts in a particular style may sometimes not sell or acquire
securities as quickly or at the same prices as they might if each were managed
and traded individually.


45





For  purchases  of equity  securities,  when a complete  order is not filled,  a
partial  allocation  will be made to each  account  pro rata  based on the order
size.  For high demand issues (for example,  initial public  offerings),  shares
will be  allocated  pro rata by account  size as well as on the basis of account
objective,  account  size ( a small  account's  allocation  may be  increased to
provide it with a meaningful  position),  and the account's other  holdings.  In
addition,  an account's  allocation may be increased if that account's portfolio
manager was  responsible  for generating  the  investment  idea or the portfolio
manager  intends to buy more shares in the  secondary  market.  For fixed income
accounts, generally securities will be allocated when appropriate among accounts
based on account size, except if the accounts have different objectives or if an
account is too small to get a  meaningful  allocation.  For new  issues,  when a
complete order is not filled, a partial  allocation will be made to each account
pro rata based on the order size.  However, if a partial allocation is too small
to be  meaningful,  it may be  reallocated  based  on such  factors  as  account
objectives,  duration  benchmarks  and  credit  and  sector  exposure.  In  some
instances,  this  investment  procedure may  adversely  affect the price paid or
received by the Fund or the size of the position obtainable for it. On the other
hand, to the extent permitted by law, the Adviser may aggregate securities to be
sold or  purchased  for the Fund with  those to be sold or  purchased  for other
clients managed by it in order to obtain best execution.



TRANSFER AGENT SERVICES



John Hancock Signature  Services,  Inc., 1 John Hancock Way, Suite 1000, Boston,
MA 02217-1000,  a wholly-owned  indirect  subsidiary of the Life Company, is the

account.  The Fund also pays certain  out-of-pocket  expenses and these expenses
are  aggregated and charged to the Fund and allocated to each class on the basis
of their relative net asset values.



CUSTODY OF PORTFOLIO



Portfolio  securities  of the Fund are held  pursuant to a  custodian  agreement
between the Trust and Investors  Bank & Trust  Company,  200  Clarendon  Street,

APPENDIX A - MORE ABOUT RISK



A fund's risk profile is largely  defined by the fund's  primary  securities and
investment  practices.  You may find the most concise  description of the fund's
risk profile in the prospectus.


A fund is permitted to utilize -- within limits  established  by the trustees --
certain other  securities  and  investment  practices that have higher risks and
opportunities  associated  with them. To the extent that the Fund utilizes these
securities  or  practices,  its  overall  performance  may be  affected,  either
positively  or  negatively.  On the  following  pages are brief  definitions  of
certain  associated  risks with them with  examples  of related  securities  and
investment  practices  included in brackets.  See the "Investment  Objective and
Policies" and "Investment Restrictions" sections of this Statement of Additional
Information  for a  description  of this Fund's  investment  policies.  The Fund
follows certain policies that may reduce these risks.


As with any mutual fund, there is no guarantee that the Fund will earn income or
show a positive return over any period of time -- days, months or years.





TYPES OF INVESTMENT RISK



Correlation risk The risk that changes in the value of a hedging instrument will
not match those of the asset being hedged  (hedging is the use of one investment
to offset the effects of another investment).  Incomplete correlation can result
in  unanticipated  risks.  (e.g.,  short sales,  financial  futures and options;
securities and index options, currency contracts).


Credit risk The risk that the issuer of a  security,  or the  counterparty  to a
contract,  will  default  or  otherwise  become  unable  to  honor  a  financial
obligation.   (e.g.,  borrowing;   reverse  repurchase  agreements,   repurchase
agreements,  securities  lending,   non-investment-grade  securities,  financial
futures and options; securities and index options).


Currency risk The risk that  fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S.
dollar and foreign  currencies  may  negatively  affect an  investment.  Adverse
changes in  exchange  rates may erode or reverse  any gains  produced by foreign
currency  denominated  investments  and may widen  any  losses.  (e.g.,  foreign
equities,  financial futures and options; securities and index options, currency
contracts).


Information risk The risk that key information about a security or market is
inaccurate or unavailable. (e.g., non-investment-grade securities, foreign
equities).


Interest rate risk The risk of market losses attributable to changes in interest
rates. With fixed-rate  securities,  a rise in interest rates typically causes a
fall in values, while a fall in rates typically causes a rise in values.  (e.g.,
non-investment-grade  securities,  financial futures and options; securities and
index options).


A-1





Leverage risk  Associated  with securities or practices (such as borrowing) that
multiply  small index or market  movements  into large changes in value.  (e.g.,
borrowing;  reverse repurchase  agreements,  when-issued  securities and forward
commitments).


o    Hedged  When a  derivative  (a  security  whose  value is based on  another
security or index) is used as a hedge against an opposite position that the
fund  also  holds,   any  loss  generated  by  the  derivative   should  be
substantially  offset by gains on the hedged  investment,  and vice  versa.
While  hedging  can  reduce  or  eliminate  losses,  it can also  reduce or
eliminate  gains.  (e.g.,  short  sales,   financial  futures  and  options
securities and index options; currency contracts).


o    Speculative  To the extent that a  derivative  is not used as a hedge,  the
fund is directly exposed to the risks of that  derivative.  Gains or losses
from  speculative  positions in a derivative may be  substantially  greater
than the derivative's original cost. (e.g., short sales,  financial futures
and options securities and index options; currency contracts).


o    Liquidity  risk  The risk  that  certain  securities  may be  difficult  or
impossible  to sell at the time and the price that the seller  would  like.
The seller may have to lower the price,  sell other  securities  instead or
forego an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect
on fund management or performance. (e.g.,  non-investment-grand securities,
short sales,  restricted  and illiquid  securities,  financial  futures and
options securities and index options; currency contracts).


Management risk The risk that a strategy used by a fund's management may fail to
produce the intended result. Common to all mutual funds.


Market risk The risk that the market  value of a security  may move up and down,
sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.  These fluctuations may cause a security to
be worth less than the price  originally  paid for it, or less than it was worth
at an earlier time. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry,  sector of
the  economy  or the  market as a whole.  Common to all stocks and bonds and the
mutual  funds that  invest in them.  (e.g.,  short  sales,  short-term  trading,
when-issued securities and forward commitments, non-investment-grade securities,
foreign equities,  financial  futures and options;  securities and index options
restricted and illiquid securities).


Natural event risk The risk of losses attributable to natural disasters, crop
failures and similar events. (e.g., foreign equities).


Opportunity  risk The risk of missing out on an investment  opportunity  because
the assets  necessary to take  advantage of it are tied up in less  advantageous
investments. (e.g., short sales, when-issued securities and forward commitments;
financial   futures  and  options;   securities  and  index  options,   currency
contracts).


A-2





Political  risk The risk of  losses  attributable  to  government  or  political
actions,  from  changes in tax or trade  statutes to  governmental  collapse and
war.(e.g., foreign equities).


Valuation risk The risk that a fund has valued certain of its securities at a
higher price than it can sell them for. (e.g., non-investment-grade securities,
restricted and illiquid securities).


A-3










APPENDIX B




DESCRIPTION OF BOND RATINGS*



Moody's Bond ratings


Bonds which are rated 'Aaa' are judged to be of the best quality.  They
carry the smallest  degree of investment  risk and are generally  referred to as
'gilt edge.' Interest  payments are protected by a large or by an  exceptionally
stable margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are
likely to change,  such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair
the fundamentally strong position of such issues.


Bonds  which are rated  'Aa' are  judged to be of high  quality  by all
standards.  Together with the 'Aaa' group they comprise what are generally known
as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of
protection  may  not be as  large  as in  'Aaa'  securities  or  fluctuation  of
protective  elements may be of greater  amplitude or there may be other elements
present  which make the long term risks  appear  somewhat  larger  than in 'Aaa'
securities .

Bonds which are rated 'A' possess many favorable investment  attributes
and are to be  considered  as upper medium  grade  obligations.  Factors  giving
security to principal and interest are  considered  adequate but elements may be
present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.


Bonds which are rated 'Baa' are considered as medium grade obligations,

i.e., they are neither highly  protected nor poorly secured.  Interest  payments
and principal  security appear  adequate for the present but certain  protective
elements may be lacking or may be  characteristically  unreliable over any great
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding  investment  characteristics  and in
fact have speculative characteristics as well.


Bonds  which are rated  'Ba' are judged to have  speculative  elements;
their future  cannot be  considered  as well  assured.  Often the  protection of
interest  and  principal  payments  may be very  moderate  and  thereby not well
safeguarded  during  both good and bad times  over the  future.  Uncertainty  of
position characterizes bonds in this class.


Bonds  which  are  rated  'B'  generally  lack  characteristics  of the
desirable  investment.  Assurance  of  interest  and  principal  payments  or of
maintenance  of other terms of the contract  over any long period of time may be
small.


Bonds which are rated 'Caa' are of poor standing. Such issues may be in
default or there may be present  elements of danger with respect to principal or
interest.


*As described by the rating companies themselves.


Standard & Poor's Bond ratings


AAA. This is the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt
obligation and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and
interest.


AA.  Bonds  rated AA also  qualify as  high-quality  debt  obligations.
Capacity to pay  principal  and interest is very strong,  and in the majority of
instances they differ from AAA issues only in small degree.


A. Bonds rated A have a strong  capacity to pay principal and interest,
although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions.


B-1





BBB. Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay
principal and interest.  Whereas they normally  exhibit  protection  parameters,
adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to
a weakened  capacity to pay  principal  and interest for bonds in this  category
than for bonds in the A category.


BB.  Debt rated BB has less  near-term  vulnerability  to default  than
other  speculative  issues.  However,  it faces major ongoing  uncertainties  or
exposure to adverse business,  financial or economic conditions which could lead
to inadequate  capacity to meet timely interest and principal  payments.  The BB
rating  category  is also  used for debt  subordinated  to  senior  debt that is
assigned an actual or implied BBB- rating.


B. Debt rated B has a greater  vulnerability  to default but  currently
has the capacity to meet  interest  payments and principal  repayments.  Adverse
business,  financial,  or economic  conditions  will likely  impair  capacity or
willingness to pay interest and repay  principal.  The B rating category is also
used for debt  subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied
BB or BB- rating.


CCC.  Debt  rated CCC has a  currently  identifiable  vulnerability  to
default,  and is  dependent  upon  favorable  business,  financial  and economic
conditions to meet timely payment of interest and repayment of principal. In the
event of adverse business,  financial, or economic conditions,  it is not likely
to have the  capacity to pay  interest  and repay  principal.  The 'CCC'  rating
category is also used for debt  subordinated  to senior debt that is assigned an
actual or implied CCC rating.


CC. The rating CC is typically applied to debt subordinated to senior
debt that is assigned an actual or implied 'CCC' rating.
