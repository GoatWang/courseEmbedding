        During Luke Voit's at-bat, opposing pitcher Robbie Ray took his line-drive shot right to the head, sending the ball flying past the foul line, at which point Ray's teammate made a diving catch for the out. Ray left the game on a cart to be treated by doctors.

If you’re not already receiving it you’re missing out on the latest and greatest musing of, well, me and the early childhood community.

Simply click the Contact Us button and ask to be added to the email list and I’ll get you started for next month’s issue.​Victims and Bullies- A Big DealThere seems to be so much being written about bullies and victims these days. Is this a new problem? Not really but it is becoming more of an issue. What is the cause of this sudden surge of news regarding these destructive behaviors?One thing is for sure, children don't wake up one day and declare themselves victims or bullies. These patterns of behavior are laid down in the preschool years and the adults are pivotal in the behavior choice process. Early childhood teachers need to think about the choices they are making when guiding children's behavior and start making decisions that will have a positive impact for the long term and not just fix the right now.Tip: Allow children to work through the problems they have with each other, with as little adult involvement as possible and safe.  Empowering children to solve their own problems is a great tool to prevent a victim pattern of thinking.WANT MORE INFORMATION?​If you've ever wanted a reminder, help for parents or just something to listen to in the car, I have the CD set for you! Here it from the master herself Madelyn Swift as she shares her expertise on guiding children, building character and avoiding the pitfalls of buying behavior and manipulation. Madelyn taught me everything I know, so this is a fantastic investment.3 CD topics available including self -esteem, Character Development and the two-CD set on Discipline for life.$15.00 each plus postage or $40.00 for all 4 CDs plus postage.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.
