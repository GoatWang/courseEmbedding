Find the swift code (also called BIC code) for every bank in the world

You have probably come across the need to find a swift code (or BIC code) because you were asked for it through web banking while trying to wire money to a different bank than yours. This is because almost all banks in the world are members of the swift network that is responsible for money transfers and messages between financial (and even non-financial) institutions, and this system requires the use of these codes. 


A swift code is a unique identifier for every institution's branch in the world. This code is absolutely vital for transferring money securely from one institution to another and our site is a specialized search engine for these codes and the institutions that carry them.


These codes are known as swift codes due to the organization that first introduced them (SWIFT - Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) but were later standardized as BIC (Business Identifier Codes). A swift code can be formed with either 8 or 11 characters. Generally speaking, most of the time, you will only need the eight-character swift code, that consists of 3 parts: the identifier of the institution (4 characters), the identifier of the country (2 characters), and the identifier of the location (2 characters). However, in some cases, if your bank processes payments through a specific branch you will need the eleven digit code which includes the branch identifier as well.


An example code would be BARCGB22XXX which is the unique identifier for the main offices of BARCLAYS BANK PLC based in London, UK.


When you browse the swift code database on this website, not only will you be able to locate the BIC code of the institution in question, but you will also be able to find out a plethora of other information related to it. This includes the institution's location as well as every branch's physical address. In addition to this, you will be able to find out both the country and city of origin. We believe that www.bank-codes.com is an absolutely vital tool when you are receiving or sending money, or simply wish to find out a bit more about how swift codes operate.


Searching through our website is incredibly easy. You have a number of different options. Firstly, you can type the name of the institution, the BIC code, or any other information you have into the search box on this page. Alternatively, you can browse our swift code database by country, which makes it very easy to find all the institutions that are members of the swift network in a particular country.
