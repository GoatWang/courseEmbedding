What you get with Symphony Link

Count on the most reliable LPWA technology on the market.

Guaranteed message receipt: Because Symphony Link acknowledges every message, you’ll know immediately if a message has been successfully transmitted from your device.
Real-time power and data rate control: Before every Symphony Link transmission, an end device calculates the reverse link to the gateway and adjusts its transmit power and modulation rate to match. This way, nodes throughout the network have a balanced link budget.
Multiple gateway coexistence: Symphony Link uses a dynamic channel mask controlled by the gateway, ensuring as few collisions as possible.
Bidirectional message acknowledgement: Symphony Link’s adaptive acknowledgement encoder allows nodes to transmit less frequently, which saves battery power and increases system reliability.
Interference avoidance: Up to 48 gateways (and their star networks) can coexist in the 915-MHz ISM band without affecting performance or adding redundant receive channels. This means adding a gateway truly increases capacity, unlike other LPWAN systems.



Utilize flexible architecture that fits your enterprise or industrial solution.

Extensible API: Symphony Link end users have the option of adding functionality directly into the gateway through an API, which allows for systems that receive a message from a local node to immediately process and generate a response without any internet connection.
Decentralized architecture: Symphony Link gateways perform a large portion of network processing locally, eliminating the need for a single, intensive processing server. This means gateways can continue performing most of their functions during a network outage or in a disconnected state, ensuring no data is lost once the network is running again.



Obtain government-grade security for your IoT application right out of the box.

Public key infrastructure (PKI): This over-the-air wireless channel used by Symphony Link is considered unbreakable by NSA standards, thus preventing spoofing and assuring the identity of the infrastructure.
Firmware over-the-air: The ability to patch vulnerabilities without physical device access lowers the cost, lowers the risk of deployment, and greatly improves security.
Real-time Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) key exchange.
Bank-grade Transport Level Security (TLS) for network traffic.



Easily deploy your network without the hassle of other LPWA networks present.

Repeaters: Expand the range of your Symphony Link network dramatically without impacting latency. Repeaters cost much less than an outdoor access point, allowing Symphony Link customers to cover larger areas without spending additional thousands on infrastructure. They are also power-efficient and can be solar- or battery-powered.
No per-device configuration: One of the biggest frustrations you can have when deploying a different LPWA network is managing multiple per-device encryption keys at the time of production and on the server side. With Symphony Link, the host device configuration is the same for all devices of the same type, and key exchange is handled via our world-class, PKI-based Diffie Hellman AES architecture.
Gateway roaming: With Symphony Link, nodes can easily roam from one gateway to another by scanning for availability. As your capacity grows, you can swap out small, single-channel gateways with high-capacity replacements.



Send your data quickly and efficiently, and enjoy four times the capacity of LoRaWAN.

Real-time adaptive data rate: Symphony Link is a synchronous system, which allows end nodes to determine what data rate to utilize on a frame-by-frame basis. When the link is strong, messages are fast to save power; when the link is weak, messages automatically lengthen to ensure delivery.
No duty cycle limit: A duty cycle limit prevents other technologies from being able to send large quantities of data at one time—a restriction Symphony Link does not have.
Quality of service: So an important alarm message doesn’t have to compete with a water meter message for channel access, Symphony Link nodes with important traffic have priority.
Fixed MTU of 256 bytes: The Symphony Link protocol handles all of the subpacketization and retries to send a message when necessary to ensure delivery.
