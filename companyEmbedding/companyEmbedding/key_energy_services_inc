About

 Get More
More. It’s what drives the oilfield to push harder, work faster and think bigger. Key has set the pace in the industry and has evolved into a modern solutions-oriented company with more resources to keep the oilfield running efficiently. When you work with Key, you always get more. The best trained people. The best equipment. The best technology. From drilling and completion, to production, to abandonment, it’s how Key is bringing more efficiency to the field.





Profile

 Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Key Energy Services offers clients a comprehensive array of onshore energy production services and solutions backed by decades of oilfield experience and industry knowledge.
People. Equipment. Technology. These three elements define how we work, and deliver on our promise to improve efficiency. It’s how our customers get more value and production from every well.
Our desire to provide the most efficient well services leads us to innovate and raise upstream service standards. We are using field technologies where none existed before, building equipment with unmatched speed and quality, and training our people to excel. 
Our story is one rooted in efficiency dating back to The Yankee Companies, a conglomerate of energy, environmental and banking businesses that in 1988 opted to concentrate its efforts on energy services. Restructuring under its West Texas well servicing division, Yale E. Key, the company began an aggressive acquisition program that ultimately led to the creation of Key Energy Services, Inc. 
In less than ten years Key grew from a company with fewer than fifty working rigs into the largest onshore well services company in the country.
Today, Key offers an entire suite of well servicing solutions, including: drilling and workover rigs, coiled tubing, frac stack and well testing, fluid services, onshore fishing and rental services. 
We employ more than 3,000 people worldwide. 
Key trades on the NYSE under the ticker symbol KEG.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
