Scott RandallFounderRandall Consulting
G: Hi, Scott. Thank you for being a part of NonStop Innovations. What has Randall Consulting been working on lately?
S: We've actually been working on a new product called SMART (system management and automatic recovery for Tandem), that will be released by the end of the year. It automates system recovery, and monitors and reports errors. We're currently looking for early adopters so we can move into beta.
 
G: That's great. Is this a unique solution or is it comparable to other solutions?
S: There is a more expensive product that some of our clients are currently using, but because the price tag is so high and the functionality is more than what most companies need, we saw an opportunity to develop our own solution. We've noticed that, in general, NonStop users want to learn from errors and recover from errors, but there are features of the existing product that are unnecessary or unwanted. For example, in a single day, there could be hundreds of individual error messages for users to deal with, which can be overwhelming, and also annoying. So, we are including a feature that will allow error messages to be grouped together, making it easier for customers to analyze and deal with errors. Our goal is really to provide the features that customers need and want.
 
G: Could you tell me a little bit about your other product, the NonStop Productivity Toolbox?
S: Sure. NPT is our flagship product, with over 50 integrated tools, all developed internally, and its main purpose is to increase productivity by automating tasks. For example, a customer was migrating from one footprint to another--S-series to Blades--and needed to move their data. One of the tools, called Repart (short for repartitioning) loads data in parallel, and was really essential to their migration. It took a task that would have taken weeks down to hours. This is the only software that automates the process of loading data in parallel, which is otherwise a cumbersome process.
 
G: I also saw that you're presenting on big data at the NonStop TBC.
S: Yes, the session is called “Big Data and SQL/MX Update.” It isn't a vendor theater, so it is purely educational.
G: Excellent. Well, I look forward to seeing you in San Jose.
 
[Abstract for "Big Data and SQL/MX", which will be presented by Scott at 2:30pm on Monday, November 4th at TBC:
Big Data means different things to different organizations. For some, it’s an avalanche of data. For others, it can be a hefty transaction load, wide rows or almost any extreme data metric. In either case, Big Data must be analyzed to provide value. This presents a number of challenges. Hadoop is a recently touted scalable solution for unstructured Big Data, relying on parallelism and distribution of data for performance. How different is SQL/MX? NonStop SQL/MX is designed for structured data and the deep analytics required for Business Intelligence. SQL/MX was built on the NonStop foundation that defined parallelism, scalability and availability, and with features that allow equal distribution of data through hash keys and partitioning features. Combine highly available, scalable, nearly unlimited enterprise SAN storage capacity and no data is too big for SQL/MX.]

My name is Scott Randall and I have had an interest in vehicles my whole life. I currently reside in Barrie and would consider this city as my hometown. In my spare time I like to spend my afternoons being active at either the gym or playing hockey. I am a Sales Consultant for Barrie Chrysler at 395 Dunlop St W and I am here to help you find the vehicle that suites your needs. My favorite aspect of being a Sales Consultant is meeting new people and working with Chrysler products.  The Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram lineup is fantastic but if I had to pick my absolute favorite model it would have to be either the Ram Laramie Limited or any model from the SRT series.

"No pressure and knowledgeable "
- Swany22


I recently bought a new Ram 1500 from Scott Randall and I was very happy with how I was treated.  I was not pressured to make the purchase or to purchase above what I wanted.  Scott was very knowledgeable and helpful in the buying process.

"A positive , successful, satisfied experience."
- Lynda Batchelor


We had visited several different Car Dealerships looking for the perfect vehicle to fit our needs.  We are Senior Citizens and my husband has specific needs in a vehicle because he suffers from Parkinson disease. ALL of the other car lots gave minimal help.  We are not car people and do not know much about makes, models, and the ins and outs of each brand name.  We where getting very discouraged with our hunt for the perfect fit for us. That is until we visited Barrie Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram.  We where met by Scott Randall as soon as we went through the doors.  We explained our situation and told him we had been told to look at the Dodge Journey.  He led us to one and My husband had a very difficult time getting into it.  Scott suggested that it was too big for our needs, He led us to the Jeep Cherokee and it was exactly what we needed for my husband to be able to enter and exit the vehicle with a certain amount of ease.  We are so grateful, I personally think that we would still be looking if it wasn't for Scotts perception, and caring manner.  Patricia Messier was the person who looked after the signing of the papers and explained the contract.  She was again professional, helpful, and treated us with respect and made us feel that we mattered.  Not one time in our whole experience with Barrie Chrysler did we get that "Car Salesman" feeling.  Every single person that we had contact with treated you with respect and had a caring attitude.  GOOD JOB BARRIE CHRYSLER.

"Exceptional Service!"
- Pmarshall93


Scott Randall went above and beyond for us for the purchase of my sons used Ranger that they had for sale. He made the sale seamless from the test drive to the time of pick up.
And Patricia Messier the finance manager made us feel relaxed and welcome while going over all the paperwork.
Barrie Dodge and all all its team members are top notch and I would Definatly recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a New or Used vehicle

Way to go guys!

"Great Service"
- Corey S


We went to Barrie Chrysler Dodge Jeep and Ram looking for a van, and without waiting we got greeted from Scott. He made our van buying experience extremely easy and simple. He was very knowledgeable with their products which made the van buying process fast. The van was extremely clean and ready for pick up in under 24 hours. We will definitely be back for another great customer service experience.

"Amazing Service! "
- Sarah Povey


I came into Barrie Chrysler looking to potentially buy my first car, which I thought would be a terrifying experience.  I met with Scott Randall and he was very knowledgeable and attentative towards what I was interested in while also keeping things affordable! He was genuine, informative and I never felt pressured! He got me the Jeep Patriot I fell in love with as soon as I sat in it! It was a very relaxing and smooth experience and I would highly recommend going to Barrie Chrysler to see Scott for anyone looking to purchase a vehicle!

"Great Service!"
- ambersaunders


My husband and I were in looking for a new vehicle in August 2016. We apologize for the delay in this review, as we have been meaning to acknowledge the great service we received. We were given Scott Randall and we truly could not have had a better experience. Scott was very professional and polite. We never have had such a fun, easy going experience while car shopping.

"Great Service"
- Kerry Eckstein


Great service. Friendly people. I bought a 2016 Dodge Grand Caravan. I went it looking for a used van and came out owning a new one with payments in my budget. So nice to have a new vehicle.

Randall Scott
Randall Scott is an internationally known wildlife artist who takes you on exciting adventures through his intriguing art, prints and posters of the underwater world. A native Californian and accomplished diver, Randall grew up fascinated by Jacques Cousteau’s adventures and “Sea Hunt”. Randall’s Passion for art was fuelled by his father who was himself a highly recognized Western landscape artist and his mother, a watercolor artist. In addition to passing on their natural talents, they shared with him many techniques, helped him explore varied styles and introduced him to other skilled artists. Art, like diving, gave Randall freedom and discovery of his own skills. Randall has successfully combined these two diverse pursuits in his art, prints and posters. After years of honing his artistic and diving skills, he is considered one of today’s finest underwater and marine artist. Offering a truly authentic and sensitive account of the underwater world, his ultimate goal with each new painting is to bring audiences under the water surface. Randall paints underwater scenes realistically; “I want to give people an opportunity to see ocean life as it really is, as if you would be going down with a mask for the first time”. He searches his subjects through observation and underwater photography. His travels have taken him all over the world. From his native California , to Australia, the South Pacific, the Caribbean Sea and Florida.
From his trips to Truk (scene of hellish World War II fighting) and Palau, in Micronesia came the inspiration for a series of underwater World War II era airplane wrecks that have become quite popular. These airplanes include: a P-51, a Japanese Zero, a P-38, a B-25 Bomber, a Dauntless Dive Bomber, a P-40, a ME-109, and a F4U Corsair. For a serious scuba diver, diving these wrecks is more exciting than anything other than perhaps finding a wrecked Spanish Galleon. Randall’s art, prints and posters are featured at both art and scuba shows and has been shown in many of the finest artistic, wildlife and diving magazines all over the world. Randall also contributed to two books: “Wildlife Painting Step by Step” and “Wildlife, the Artist’s view”. Randall and his wife Donna currently reside in Florida.
