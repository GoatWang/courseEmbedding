"Sierra maintains an exceptional level of professionalism in correlation to the products and services they provide to their customers. Customer service is very important to us here at Cain Millwork, and Sierra goes over and above on every project. I had to source veneer on a high level project that required myself and the Sierra team to go out of state and stand in a hot factory for eight hours sorting through veneer. They did it and made the entire process a blast…. Now that is customer service! From promptly answering questions, sending out samples and timely delivery, I can trust Sierra to get the job done. This has helped streamline our estimating processes and reduce inventory as Sierra can get me just about anything in a day or two! Keep up the good work!"
Mike CoticchioCain Millwork Inc





"I just wanted to take a moment to pass along a truly heartfelt THANK YOU for all of your help with our lumber needs. Every time we ask you to help us with something you go way above and beyond. Sierra has always provided exceptional products and a very competitive price, but your customer service is where you really excel and deliver the difference between Sierra and most of your competition. Thank you again."
The Unity Hardwoods Team





"Sierra Forest Products has been more of a partner than a supplier. Their unsurpassed service, top quality of lumber and prompt deliveries has been significant in Woodmac's success."
Jim McLaughlinWoodmac Industries, Inc





"Sierra Forest Products has been supplying Brakur with lumber and boards since Sierra Chicago opened in 2001. Never has a company been so attentive to details and the quality is unsurpassed. Sierra pioneered the Chicago distribution market to a customer orientated market. I cannot say enough about the quality, service and integrity that Sierra has provided Brakur Custom Cabinetry over the years. We thank Sierra for changing the distribution market in Chicago and offering Brakur the service and dependability that Sierra brings to the table. Thanks Sierra."
Chad Kurtz President Brakur Custom Cabinetry, Inc
