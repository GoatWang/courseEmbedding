Kroger Announces Financial Appointments

May 14, 2013, 14:00 ET
		  		  									
						 from   The Kroger Co. 











 
















































 

 




















 


CINCINNATI, May 14, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- The Kroger Co. (NYSE:   KR) today announced Scott M. Henderson has been named Vice President of Pension Investment and Strategy, and Todd A. Foley has been named Vice President and Treasurer, effective with their elections by Kroger's Board of Directors expected on June 27.
Scott M. Henderson Named Vice President of Pension Investment and Strategy
Mr. Henderson, 57, currently serves as Kroger's vice president and treasurer, a position he has held since 2003. He will lead a new team that is responsible for overseeing nearly $12 billion of assets. 
"We are very pleased that Scott has agreed to take on this important responsibility," said Mike Schlotman, Kroger's chief financial officer. "Scott brings investment expertise and steady financial leadership to our pension funds, as demonstrated by his more than 10 years as Treasurer and his contribution to the successful consolidation of four UFCW pension plans in 2011."
Mr. Henderson joined Kroger in 1981 as manager of financial reporting in Cincinnati. He has held various positions of responsibility, including vice president and controller for the company's Dillon division and vice president of planning for Kroger. 
Todd A. Foley Named Vice President and Treasurer
Mr. Foley, 43, currently serves as Kroger's assistant corporate controller. He replaces Mr. Henderson as treasurer. 
"Todd has been a valuable member of Kroger's financial leadership team for 12 years," said Mr. Schlotman. "Todd brings his financial acumen and extensive experience managing Kroger's business planning process to the role of Treasurer." 
Mr. Foley began his career with Kroger in 2001 as an audit manager in the Internal Audit department, after working for PricewaterhouseCoopers. He was named controller of Kroger's Cincinnati/Dayton division in 2003 before being promoted to his current role in 2006.
Mr. Foley's replacement will be named at a later date. 
Kroger, one of the world's largest retailers, employs 343,000 associates who serve customers in 2,424 supermarkets and multi-department stores in 31 states under two dozen local banner names including Kroger, City Market, Dillons, Jay C, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Fry's, King Soopers, QFC, Ralphs and Smith's. The company also operates 786 convenience stores, 328 fine jewelry stores, 1,169 supermarket fuel centers and 37 food processing plants in the U.S. Recognized by Forbes as the most generous company in America, Kroger supports hunger relief, breast cancer awareness, the military and their families, and more than 30,000 schools and grassroots organizations. Kroger contributes food and funds equal to 160 million meals a year through more than 80 Feeding America food bank partners. A leader in supplier diversity, Kroger is a proud member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber's Million Dollar Club.
