Publisher's Description▼▲
A Heartwarming Story Collection of Children's Encounters with God, Angels, and MiraclesChildren have a special place in Jesus' heart. He said they are the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, and their angels continually see the face of God. Perhaps that's why children seem to be more receptive to supernatural experiences than adults.This new collection reveals how God works in the lives of these precious little ones. It contains the touching true stories of children who have heard Jesus speak, encountered angels, and experienced miracles. We could all use more childlike faith, and these stories "from the mouths of babes" will encourage readers to be open to hear from the Lord in a fresh, sweet, and pure way.


Author Bio▼▲

And A Little Child Will Lead Them

            "Giants" with swords appear and protect children from bullies.  A little girl is given the words to write a song that touches hearts after the September 11, 2001 attack.  A homesick child receives spoken words of comfort during the night that bring peace and rest.  All of these stories and more will be found between the covers of this book.  The incidents are true and happened to children in different circumstances and places.


Some of these accounts have been written by the adult who had this happen to them as a child.  Most of the others are written by an adult, usually a parent.   The tales cover a gamut of experiences ranging from a child seeing a man "wearing a white dress," to saying someone played with them, to having a dream that contained an important message.  Forty-one different occurrences are chronicled in this volume, they are each fairly short, and easily read.  Because of that, the book lends itself to reading a little at a time, or all at once.  The back of the volume contains a small amount of information about the author of each event.  


I am always interested in true accounts of heavenly experiences, when they are told from a Christian perspective.  All of these definitely fit that category, and there is no offensive language or situations.   Since these are stories based a child's experience, some of them are a bit vague.  But I found others to be very touching.  As the Bible says, "a little child will lead them," and these children's encounters just might lead the reader to a deeper faith, or comfort from the Lord.  I recommend this 5 star book to those who like true stories or Heavenly encounters.


Bethany House Publishing has provided bookreadingtic with a complimentary copy of Jesus Talked To Me Today, for the purpose of review.   I have not been compensated in any other manner.  All opinions expressed are my own, and I was not required, or influenced, to give anything but an honest appraisal.  I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commissions 16 CFR, Part 255.

            Jesus Talked to Me Today is a compendium of true stories of childrens encounters with angels, miracles, and God. The book is compiled by James Stuart Bell, and is reminiscent of stories I remember my brother and I reading when we were kidspeeking into the experiences and encounters of the supernatural and spiritual kind. 


This book is a little different than what I expected. The child on the cover and the font used for the title gave me the impression that this was either a book for children, or to be read/shared with children, but I dont necessarily recommend that. It is more like adults revealing the encounters and experiences they had years agowhen they were young.


With that said, this is an enjoyable and inspiring read. Ive no doubt we entertain angels (sometimes unawares) for the Bible tells says soand have experienced things similar to some in this book. It is comforting, assuring, and in some ways eerie, but mainly affirming. 


God is with us; he comforts us, and works in our lives in mysterious and miraculous ways. It is with childlike faith and vulnerability that we are most open to recognize Gods messages and messengers.


The bottom line: The book contains approximately forty stories with diverse experiences and outcomes. Some are detailed, evocative, and stimulating, and others are somewhat vague and vapid.

            Jesus loved children, so it makes sense that he wants to talk with them, This book is filled with stories of these times when children were blessed with times with God, Angels and miracles. What better ways to open the ears and hearts of others than to hear from a child how they spent time with God.


It serves as a confirmation that when we are open to him, He loves to take time to share with each of us. I enjoyed the format of this book, stories straight from the children to our hearts.


I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys this acknowledgement that God wants to be with you.


I was given this book by Bethany House in return for my honest review.

            This is a compilation of heartwarming, inspirational accounts of actual miracles and heavenly encounters experienced by children.  Children are exceptionally open to believing in miraculous events, maybe because they have not yet become skeptical or cynical, as so many adults have.  Adults tend to seek a reasonable, explainable or even scientific reason to clarify how a miraculous event happens.  Some will dismiss them as coincidence.


Children, however, have the kind of faith that accepts all and endears them to Jesus heart.


Each story is as told by the child; some are now adults who still believe and others have told their stories to professional writers.  Each and every miraculous recipient gives unwavering testimony to the truth of his or her experience.


Many of these stories will bring tears to the eyes of readers.  This is a hard book to put down.  In these times of cynicism and lack of faith, these accounts of miracles are a breath of fresh air.  They remind us that God is always with us and will never abandon us.


We should all seek to have the faith of little children.  Admittedly, it is a challenge in todays society, but these miracle stories will bolster readers faith and encourage positive thinking.


I was given a free copy of this book by the publisher in return for an honest review and I highly recommend it to readers of all ages.

            "Jesus Talked To Me Today" by James Stuart Bell is a compilation of over 40 true stories of children's encounters with angels, miracles and God.  Each story tells the story from the child's perspective.  My favorite story was the story of a ten year old girl named Jenna who felt like God was telling her to write a song.  This was around the time of 911.  Her mother was a little skeptical, but Jenna really felt like God was telling her what to write.  She obeyed God, and ended up really ministering to many involved in 911.  I won't tell all the details.  You just need to read the stories.


This is a great book to read all at once like a novel, or read as a devotional.  Each story is a about 4-5 pages long, so it is a great book to read a story a day.  If you enjoy encouraging and true stories, you would enjoy this.


I received this book from Bethany House for my honest opinion.

Mark Gillen's world changes when his daughter, Maddie, is born. Formerly a self-obsessed struggling actor, Mark sees in his daughter a vision of greater things. But his wife soon asks for a divorce--and for Maddie. And so begins Mark's fight to keep his daughter in the face of betrayal, and a legal system that looks askance at any father who wants to keep a young daughter.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Remarkable True Stories of Miraculous Answers to PrayerMany people pray, but some don't really believe that God is listening. Answers to prayer can be so small and ordinary that they go unnoticed. But every so often we are powerfully reminded that God does indeed hear and answer prayer. What begins with simple faith and a basic prayer from an average Christian ends with an astounding gift from our loving heavenly Father.In this new collection, ordinary people recount miraculous answers to prayer--things that could only happen with God's supernatural intervention, such as unexplainable healings and amazing protection in life-threating situations. This book will inspire you to believe that God can answer even your most seemingly impossible prayers, fulfilling your deepest needs and biggest dreams.

            A book of stories from people who have had GOD touch their lives with a miracle from their prayers. As you read these stories from all over the globe, you will feel blessed and know that each day GOD is performing miracles that we don't see. It is many different stories of situations that will keep your interest for reading more. You can read this from cover to cover, just pick up and read any where or select to read a story each day, it is your choice.


I would recommend this to anyone that wants a good feeling when you are done. This is a very happy and inspirational book for any ages. As the title says, this book is a "Gift from Heaven", well worth the read.

Powerful Reminders Of God's Grace And The Power Of Prayer

                This review was written for Gifts from Heaven: True Stories of Miraculous Answers to Prayer.
            
 
            Gifts From Heaven: True Stories Of Miraculous Answers To Prayer compiled by James Stuart Bell is a collection of 40 real-life examples of God's answers to our everyday prayers. Reminiscent of articles found in Reader's Digest a couple decades ago (and maybe more recently, I haven't read one in years), these brief glimpses will leave you feeling refreshed and hopeful in times of grief or if you're stuck in a period of wandering.


Whether it's the miraculous healing of cancer, an angel watching over a baby in NICU, or walking away from car wrecks that should have been catastrophic, everyone will find something here that is close to home and touches their heart.


The story that touched me the most while reading through this book is one that took place in Germany in 1946, when a 13-year-old girl came down typhus. She became very ill,entered into a coma, and only survived by God's grace and the power of prayer. But the story doesn't stop there.Not only did God heal her from the immediatedanger oftyphus draining her life, but He also healed her womb from the long-term effects of the typhus so that she was able to overcome the doctors' verdict and become a mother in due time... Having bore two children myself, despite being told I could not have children, I found this particular story to be a reminder of my own story. This helped remind me to take the time to appreciate God's graces in my own life.


Borrowed from life's lessons all over the world and spanning decades, Gifts From Heaven could easily be read straight through, or taken in as a 40-day devotional to help you reconnect and feel closer to God and all of his miraculous possibilities for your life. 4/5 stars.


*Disclaimer: I received a free print copy of this book from Bethany House for the purpose of this honest review. All opinions are my own.*

                This review was written for Gifts from Heaven: True Stories of Miraculous Answers to Prayer.
            
 
              I have always enjoyed books that had multiple short stories in. They make for great reading when you are reading in small spurts. And when it is a book like this full of true miraculous stories, that makes it all the better.


  Sometimes it seems none of our prayers are getting answered, and it is easy to overlook the ones that are getting answered. It is good to hear of or read about answers to prayer other people have had as it can be encouraging to oneself. 




 This book has a lot of answers to prayer in it. There are around forty stories of answers to prayer in this book. They are by both men and women from all walks of life. Some are big answers to prayer, and others may seem small, but they are all true and miraculous.


 James Stuart Bell did a great job of compiling these stories and telling them in his own words. They are interesting, encouraging, and easy to read. I was encouraged and convicted as I read these stories and realized how easy I give up on praying for some things. Sure, God may not answer in the way I want Him to, but I give up too easily.


 I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially to those who feel like their prayers are not getting answered. This may be the boost of encouragement those people need.


I was given a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

            "The best and sweetest flowers of paradise God gives to His people when they are upon their knees. Prayer is the gate of heaven."  - Thomas Brooks


Happy Easter! On this special day of celebration of the One who's risen from death, I want to share this book, Gifts from Heaven with you. This book includes true stories of miraculous answers to prayers, compiled by James Stuart Bell.  These stories may not be relate to your specific journey, but it too speak of the love our Lord Jesus bestows on us. He listens! God listens! And He will answer our prayers, though it may not be what we expected, but He will answer.  Inspiring, encouraging and calming, these stories from ordinary people will speak to you, some more than others, but it will. I particularly like the fact that not all stories are easy breezy. There were struggles, not the struggles of what the author was praying about, but struggles to have the faith to believe that your prayers will be answered. Isn't that common for us, even those that have committed for years? Faith can seem easy, but sometimes it may be the hardest thing to acknowledge and truly trust. As Thomas Brooks said, prayers is the gate to heaven. Pray, seek and let Him into your life to carry your burdens with you. 


In all Gifts from Heaven spoke of the gifts of answered prayers in our lives. Our Lord Jesus is a gift to us. Will you accept Him?


Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book from the author/publisher. I was not required to write a positive review, and have not been compensated for this. This is my honest opinion.

            Loved the book of stories of everyday people and what God did in their lives. People say miracles don't happen today! Well I totally disagree with that thinking. If each of us just took time set back and thought on things that has happened in our lives we would see where God was working in our lives. I know trials are no fun in life but we go through those that we may grow closer to the Lord. All trials may not end well but in them we still can learn where we need to put our lives in God's hands. Not every story has a happy ending but through the loss we might gain. Through this book you will see answers to many situations in peoples lives.  Very emotional book especially when the stories hits part of your life. Great book and I believe it will revive you! God is so good and he is the mighty healer.  Great stories compiled by James Stuart Bell.
