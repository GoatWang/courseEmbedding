Recovery Methods

The main ingredient in natural gas is methane which is formed when organic material derived from the breakdown of plants and animals is included in sedimentary deposits. Over time, the sedimentary deposits change to rock, and the included organic material gets changed into fossil fuel as either coal, oil, or natural gas. The type of fossil fuel that is developed depends on both the original composition of the organic material and the temperature and pressure that it has been exposed to, deep in the earth.

Shale gas is defined as natural gas from a fine grained rock known as shale. The shale acts as the source, reservoir and seal for the natural gas. Older shale gas wells were usually vertical while more recent wells are primarily horizontal and are stimulated to produce gas by hydraulic fracturing. Only shale formations with certain characteristics will produce gas. The most significant trend in U.S. natural gas production is the rapid rise in production from shale formations. Shale gas deposits are usually classified as “continuous” type gas accumulations often extending throughout large areas. This means once the resource is proven in an area low risk development is possible over a large area.
A key element in the emergence of shale gas production has been the refinement of cost-effective horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies. These two processes, along with the implementation of protective environmental management practices, have allowed shale gas development to produce gas from previously unproductive areas.
Technology drives the exploration and production of shale gas which is comprised of either vertical or horizontal wells. In both cases, fresh water aquifers are protected by the use of casing and cement effectively isolating them from the deeper intervals. Most shale gas plays involve horizontal well completions to optimize recovery and well economics. Horizontal drilling has a big advantage over its vertical cousin, in that a large amount of the wellbore can come into contact with the reservoir. This also means that far fewer wells need to be drilled and the wells that are drilled can have many wells drilled from the same well pad site thus reducing surface impact.
The second critical element to the success of shale gas exploration and production is the use of hydraulic fracturing. This process involves the injection of mainly water and sand, or a similar “proppant” into a shale formation to generate fractures or cracks in the target rock formation. The sand or proppant holds the fractures open so that the gas in the shale can flow to the wellbore and thus be produced. The fluid, or fracture fluids, are mainly comprised of water and sand with a small balance consisting of additives that improve the efficiency of the fracture process. The particulars of each hydraulic fracture are based on the specifics and characteristics of the rock formation in question.
Given the importance of water to the fracturing process, it is critical that shale gas developers identify sufficient sources of water before the process begins and plan for the peaceful coexistence with the needs of the community for the same water resources. The volume of water used to stimulate a horizontal well to produce gas, ranges from 2 million to 4 million gallons, however, these amounts are small in comparison to water used for agriculture, electric power generation, and in general represent a small percentage of overall water consumption for an area.
At the completion of the drilling and fracturing process, the water used in the fracture stimulation process is produced back along with natural gas. This water requires management to protect surface and ground water resources, and ideally reduce future demands for fresh water. Stakeholders including local and federal governments and shale gas operators look for ways to “Reduce, Re-use, and Recycle” in order to minimize the impact on the environment and the community. Water treatment technologies have been developed for use on shale gas produced water so that it can be re-used.

							Regulatory							







							
									Will land be expropriated?								
									


Expropriation is never envisaged as an option by BNK. We consider ourselves a member of the community where we operate and work to ensure open and transparent dialogue throughout the entire process.








							
									Why are the district administrations/communes not involved in the concession application process?								
									


Local authorities are involved in the concession granting process. In the case of an exploration concession, opinions of local mayors from communes covered by the intended concession area are required, while in the case of the production concession, consent of the local mayor’s from the area covered by the concession application is required. The latter consent is to determine whether the intended production activity is compliant with the purpose or the manner of the use of the real property concerned, as set forth in the local spatial development plan or – should there be no such plan – in the study of conditions and directions of spatial management; and if it is compliant, the consent should be granted.
Also, the issuance of either an exploration or a production concession typically needs to be preceded by obtaining an environmental decision. This process involves local authorities, in particular the local mayor and the Regional Director for Environmental Protection.








							
									Who issues the exploration permits in Poland?								
									


The Minister of Environment with the participation of local authorities.








							
									How long does an exploration permit last?								
									


An exploration permit lasts 5 years.








							
									Describe what is involved in obtaining an exploration concession; a seismic permit; a drilling permit; and a production concession.								
									


Exploration concessions are issued by the Minister of the Environment, following a complex administrative procedure which involves the participation of other authorities.
Under the new Geological and Mining Law (January 1, 2012), the general principle is that exploration concessions shall be granted in the course of a tender process governed by non-discriminatory rules and giving priority to the best exploration systems (for example, technological and technical solutions that are to be used by the applicants). Prior to issuing an exploration concession, opinions from local mayors need to be otained by the Minister of Environment.
For seismic works there is no separate permit that would be required. Generally, these works are conducted based on the concession permits as they constitute geological field works. However, to conduct seismic works the seismic contractor needs to obtain consents from landowners on whose land such works shall be performed.
For drilling, the situation is similar to seismic works, meaning that there is no separate permit required. Drilling is conducted also based on the concession permit with an additional decision of the Mining Authority approving the drilling operation plan required (this decision is consulted with local authorities).
For a production concession, the procedure is more complex and there are basically four major requirements that need to be fulfilled to be granted a production concession:

Evidence of the existence of mineral deposits (in the case of BNK and its project companies - shale gas deposits) and approval of geological documentation of such;
Prepare the deposit development plan;
Determine the 'mining area' (the area where gas is to be produced) as well as the 'mining impact area' which is potentially a broader area than the 'mining area' and covers land where potentially negative consequences of mining works can possibly be observed;
Undergoing an Environmental Impact Assessment for the production stage.

Furthermore, with regard to both types of concessions (exploration and production), it is worth stressing that they have to be accompanied by a mandatory mining usufruct agreement executed between the entity which was granted the concession and State Treasury (represented by the Minister of Environment). Based upon this agreement, the State (as the owner of mineral deposits) entitles a concession holder to use the deposits in return for a mining usufruct fee.







							General Operations							







							
									What will the shale development look like?								
									


Each shale development project is different. At this stage of the exploration process, it is difficult to predict exactly what the exploitation process will look like. In Europe, BNK would utilize common drilling ‘pad’ sites to drill multiple wells from the same surface site. We estimate that the distance between these ‘pad’ sites would be 4 to 6 kilometers apart. BNK has and will continue to consider each step of the exploration and development processes with the same corporate philosophy of:

Open and transparent dialogue
Minimum impact on the environment
Minimum surface footprint
Community acceptance

See Development for further information








							
									What is the difference between thermogenic gas and biogenic gas? 								
									


Biogenic gas is natural gas produced by the decomposition of organic matter at shallow depths and at low temperatures (such as compost) while thermogenic natural gas (conventional and unconventional) is produced very deep in the earth at high temperatures and pressures. It is very easy to distinguish them apart using specific measuring tools.








							
									What is felt during seismic acquisition?								
									


BNK utilizes vibroseis equipment to acquire its seismic data. The only effect is some very minor and short groundvibrations when standing a few meters from the vehicles.
See more information on seismic.








							
									What depth are exploration wells drilled to?								
									


The depth depends entirely on the geology of each area and the shale formation. Shale formations in this area are expected to be at approximately 3,500 to 5,000 meters.








							
									What are the steps to drill a well?  								
									


See Drilling Steps








							
									Is the production of shale gas safe?								
									


Production of natural gas from shale rock formations is safe and is achieved using the same operating practices as conventional natural gas. BNK adheres to local, regional, national and European regulations concerning its extraction. In addition, BNK follows industry best standards and practices and has the experience, and knowledge to ensure safe operations and production
See our Environmental Protection Measures








							
									How much water is required during the drilling and hydraulic fracturing of an exploration unconventional natural gas well? 								
									


BNK expects to use approximately 2,000 m3 during the drilling phase and approximately 1,000 m3 per hydraulic stimulation stage. For a vertical well, we usually perform 1 hydraulic stimulation stage while a horizontal well may require between 5 and 10 stages. A well is only hydraulically stimulated once in its life and existing technologies allows up to 99% of the water recovered to be recycled and used in other wells. As a comparative example, an Olympic size pool has a volume of approximately 3.000 m3 .








							
									How much surface area is required for a wellsite?								
									


During the exploration phase, one wellsite is approximately between 100 m x 130 m (See one of BNK's wellsites). During the development stage, this area would accommodate 6 to 10 horizontal wells and thus minimizing the surface footprint.








							
									How many wellsites are required for the development process?								
									


It is difficult to fully answer this question until the exploration phase is completed and all data has been fully analyzed. However, in a viable shale development project, BNK expects to drill approximately 6-10 horizontal wells per wellsite with each small wellsite approximately 4-6 km apart.
See information on multiple well drilling.








							
									How long do drilling, hydraulic stimulation and production operations last in unconventional projects?								
									


The drilling process lasts between one and two months (see an actual drilling rig) while the preparation works for the hydraulic stimulation lasts only a few days. Each individual hydraulic stimulation usually lasts only a few hours and depends on the number of stages and shale rock characteristics. The production process depends on the amount of natural gas present and can last between 3-50 years (see an actual producing wellhead).








							
									How is a wellsite selected?								
									


The process to select and finalize a wellsite is very extensive and requires several months of preparation and study. In summary, the major phases are as follows:

First Step:

Extensive geological and seismic review of all available data leading to the identification of general areas to drill an exploration well
GIS (Geographic Information System) review to immediately exclude all sensitive zones and review access
Desktop review to identify water access, archeological sites, ecological sites, etc.
Initial visit to validate findings to date and prioritize wellsites


Second Step - Preliminary Environmental Review Assessment (PER):

Maximize distance from nearby residential areas, protected areas, areas of natural interest, archeological zones, etc.
Review of agricultural areas to ensure minimum inconvenience
Review of access and transport routes to minimize disruptions
Review of topography to ensure minimal earthworks for the lease construction



For more information, visit Wellsites








							
									Does unconventional natural gas extraction use technical processes still in development?								
									


Natural gas extraction from shale rock formations involves several proven technologies which have been used safely for decades. Drilling for gas in shale rock formations is exactly the same process used in drilling for natural gas from other type of rock formations for well over one century. Hydraulic stimulation is a proven technology used for over 60 years. As of 2012, it is estimated that well over two million hydraulic fracture treatments have been performed. The combination of both horizontal drilling and hydraulic stimulation has made it economically feasible to develop unconventional formations, like deep layers of shale rock, where we previously could not recover the oil and gas held within them.
See our Techncial Descriptions for further information.








							
									Does natural gas have an odor?								
									


The natural gas produced is odorless. The smell you may be familiar with when smelling natural gas is a chemical called mercaptan and is not related to the drilling or production process. It is added by the natural gas distribution company to identify leaks in its distribution system.








							
									Does conducting seismic acquisition guarantee the drilling of an exploration well?								
									


Conducting seismic does not necessarily guarantee the drilling of an exploration well. Drilling an exploration well depends on results from geological studies and seismic interpretations, overall wellsite selection process and acceptance from the community.
See more information on seismic.








							
									Are drilling operations and hydraulic stimulations conducted at night?								
									


The drilling and hydraulic stimulation operations continue during the night but are reduced. BNK endeavors to ensure that noise limits specified by law are observed during day and night operations.







							Hydraulic Stimulation							







							
									What would happen should the equipment fail during the hydraulic stimulation process?								
									


In our experience we have never had a failure of the system. The team conducting the hydraulic stimulation is highly experienced and has conducted similar operations on numerous occasions. Moreover, in addition to everything being pressure tested prior to the hydraulic stimulation process, we have several redundant safety precautions and safety mechanisms to prevent this from occurring. This ensures the protection of People, Nature and Infrastructure which is BNK’s key mandate.








							
									What is Hydraulic Stimulation?								
									


Hydraulic stimulation (or fracturing/fracking), is used as part of the process to complete a well and to stimulate production from rock formations by pumping a sand-water mixture at a controlled pressure high enough to crack the rock. Small fractures extend out from the well within the shale formation and creates pathways for the natural gas to flow into the well.
See more information on Hydraulic Stimulation.








							
									What happens with the water used during the hydraulic stimulation?								
									


The fracturing water (flowback) flows back out of the rock formation into the well and then into steel tanks at the surface. This fluid is either recycled/re-used or treated and disposed of according to stringent regulations in place. The small amount of water which is not immediately recovered returns slowly over time through the isolated wellbore or remains trapped thousands of meters below the surface in the shale formation via adsorption into clays.








							
									What additives will you be using during the hydraulic stimulation process?								
									


The final composition of the additives used is highly dependent on the rock characteristics of the shale formation which is unknown until wells are drilled. The core recovered (rock samples) during the drilling process provides this information following detailed rock mineralogy analysis. BNK’s mandate is to continue to utilize the most environmentally friendly additives available.








							
									Is the gas burning in the video showing the burning water tap caused by hydraulic stimulation?								
									


No. The gas which created the burning tap is from dissolved methane in water and was present years before any drilling occurred in the area. This is biogenic gas (which is naturally occurring) and not thermogenic gas (created from organic matter at high pressure and high temperatures and at great depths). This gas has been present in the local groundwater for many years prior to gas well drilling and hydraulic fracture began - this phenomenon occurs in many areas throughout the world. It is possible to identify each type of natural gas and this has been confirmed by the State of Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission.
In addition, for further information and a better understanding, watch this video - Truthland.








							
									Is it possible to use environmentally friendly additives during the hydraulic stimulation process?								
									


The three additives currently used by BNK are non-toxic and/or inert. BNK’s mandate is to continue to utilize the most environmentally friendly additives available.








							
									Is it possible for the fracturing water to enter the groundwater aquifers due to the high pressures involved during the hydraulic stimulation process? 								
									


In addition to proper well design, the three casing strings and specialized cement in place to prevent any of the fracturing water from entering the groundwater aquifers, we also have, monitoring controls in place to confirm this isolation.
See Casing Installation Steps.








							
									How often is an unconventional well fractured?								
									


Typically, each well is hydraulically fractured only once during its life.








							
									How do you ensure the formation and fracturing waters do not communicate with the ground water aquifers?								
									


There are several methods utilized during the well construction:


Three steel casing and cement barriers (click to view casing set up)
Use of fresh water non-toxic drilling muds when drilling through the water aquifers
Sophisticated logs and pressure tests to ensure integrity of casing and cement
Continued pressure monitoring at the well during and after all operations
Continual monitoring of surrounding water wells prior to and after all operations
Soil testing at, near and surrounding the wellsite during and after all operations.


In addition, the wellsite is constructed in such a manner to ensure several redundant layers of protection are present against potential surface spills. These steps have proven to be very effective.
See more information on Wellsite Construction and Environmental Protection








							
									Can the fracturing water or natural gas migrate upwards through the rock because of the drilling or hydraulic stimulation?								
									


The well design used by BNK prevents fracturing water/natural gas from migrating upwards to the groundwater aquifers. This has been proven over decades of experience. It is impossible for the small fractures created by the hydraulic fracture stimulation to reach the groundwater aquifers due to the lack of energy, the multiple layers of rock and great distance between the shale formation and the groundwater aquifers.








							
									Are the chemical additives used in fracturing water carcinogenic or harmful to health?								
									


The additives used by BNK are either non-toxic or inert. Even though chemical additives are carefully managed, highly diluted and separated from all aquifers, BNK’s mandate is to continue to utilize the most environmentally friendly additives available.








							
									Are the chemical additives used during the hydraulic stimulation process proprietary? 								
									


No, the additives used by BNK are published on our website. It is important to note that all the additives used by BNK during our recent hydraulic stimulations in Poland are non-toxic.
See our table of additives for more information.







							Environmental							







							
									Who will assess the state of roads and buildings after your activity?								
									


BNK works with each community where it has operations and conducts inspections before and after all its projects with local authorities when required.








							
									What is an Environmental Impact Assessment?								
									


An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a technical study which evaluates in detail the potential impact of the exploration projects on animals,plant and the overall surrounding environment (Natura 2000, parks, habitats, etc.) including below the surface. In addition, at a minimum, the EIA must also evaluate the potential impacts on surrounding structures, historical landmarks, archeological locations, local inhabitants, air and noise, transport and waste disposal. The EIA is then submitted to relevant agencies within the local, regional and/or national governments for review, discussion and approval.








							
									What impacts do your activities have on the environment?								
									


BNK's experience, adherence to best industry standards and regulations, helps ensure minimal to no consequences to the environment. In addition, to confirm everything proceeds correctly, BNK monitors air, soil and water samples before we drill our first well and continualy during and afterwards.
The environmental impact assessment performed prior to drilling any well ensures that all wildlife and plant life, amongst other things, are properly preserved and protected.
See Environmental Protection for further information








							
									What happens with the waste during the drilling?								
									


All waste, such as the drilling mud and the rock cuttings, are disposed of accordance to stringent regulations, procedures and best industry practices.
See Environmental Protection for further information








							
									What does the wellsite look like following full reclamation?								
									


Once the well is abandoned according to regulations in place and best industry practices, the wellsite is returned to its original state.








							
									Given some of the concessions have Natura 2000 sites, parks, habitats within their boudnaries,  how does BNK ensure their protection?								
									


Each area is thoroughly investigated during the PERA and the Environmental Impact Assessment to ensure BNK does not affect the environment where it works. There are strict legal provisions which limit the possibility of conducting exploration activities in these areas and BNK always complies with such provisions.








							
									Does unconventional natural gas extraction produce high quantities of greenhouse gases?								
									


Production of unconventional natural gas is identical with the production of conventional natural gas and 33% lower than coal.  In fact, natural gas is the cleanest of all hydrocarbon fuels.

FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

In the first quarter of 2017, the Company drilled and fracture stimulated the Chandler 8-6H well, the first well in its 2017 drilling program, in which it holds a 99.9% working interest.  
The Company also drilled the Hartgraves 1-6H well and the Brock 9-2H, in each of which it holds a 100% working interest.  The Company expects to begin fracture stimulation on the Hartgraves 1-6H well in the second quarter, with the Brock 9-2H well to be fracture stimulated after the Hartgraves 1-6H well is completed. 
Average production for the first quarter of 2017 was 753 BOEPD, a decrease of 44% compared to first quarter 2016 average production of 1,352 BOEPD due to three wells that were still shut-in during the first quarter, as a result of offset fracture stimulation operations on 19 wells by another operator in the Woodford formation beneath the Caney and also due to the normal production decline.  The shut-in wells decreased first quarter 2017 production by over 300 BOEPD.  Production improved throughout the quarter with the addition of the Chandler 8-6H well and March 2017 production was over 1,000 BOE per day even without the three wells returning to full production. 
In the quarter, the Company continued to reduce its costs.  G&A expenses decreased by another 15% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 due to continuing cost cutting efforts. 
Funds from continuing operations was approximately $0.9 million in the first quarter 2017 compared to $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2016.  The decrease in funds from continuing operations was mainly due to the shut-in wells as well as lower realized gains from commodity contracts in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 2016, partially offset by the pricing increase. 
Net income for the first quarter of 2017 was approximately $1.0 million compared to a net loss of $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2016 due to the unrealized gain of $1.5 million from hedged commodity contracts in the first quarter of 2017. 
Revenue, net of royalties was $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $2.1 million for first quarter of 2016, an increase of 5%, as average prices increased by 91% between the quarters, which offset the production decrease. 
Average netback per barrel for the first quarter of 2017 was $25.81, an increase of 110% from the prior year first quarter due to the higher prices in 2017.  Over 80% of first quarter 2017 oil production was hedged which resulted in substantially higher netbacks when the impact of commodity hedges are included.  If the commodity contract hedges are included in the computation, the average netback per barrel increases 27% to $32.92 in 2017 compared to $25.89 in the first quarter of 2016. 
Cash totaled $7.0 million and working capital totaled $1.1 million at March 31, 2017.

BNK's President and Chief Executive Officer, Wolf Regener commented:
"During the first quarter, we used the proceeds from our 2016 equity offering to begin our 2017 drilling program. We drilled and completed the Chandler 8-6H well (99.9% working interest) and drilled the Hartgraves 1-6H well (100% working interest) and the Brock 9-2H well (100% working interest).  We expect to perform the fracture stimulation of the Hartgraves 1-6H well in the second quarter, with the Brock 9-2H well to follow.  We are looking forward to the completion of these wells which we believe will outperform all of our previous wells due to both wells having full length laterals available for stimulation, improved placement of the laterals in the Caney based on previous learnings and both being located in areas where we have excellent calculated original oil in place numbers.
Our net revenue increased by 5% in the first quarter 2017 as average prices increased by 91% compared to the prior year quarter.  The price increase offset the impact of our decline in production due to the three shut-in wells during the first quarter, which reduced production by over 300 BOEPD during the quarter.  However, our production increased throughout the quarter as the Chandler 8-6H well started production in late February and the shut-in wells were brought back online.  Our March 2017 production was over 1,000 BOEPD.  All the shut-in wells are still pumping off the offset operator's frack water and, at the end of the quarter, were still about 230 BOEPD below expected production levels.  We don't expect any impact to the long-term production of the wells even though they are recovering slower than we originally expected them too.
The Company continues to succeed in its cost-cutting efforts.  In the first quarter of 2017, a reduction of general and administrative expense of 15% was achieved over the first quarter of 2016.  These continued cost savings coupled with a 91% increase in average prices compared to the prior year quarter contributed to the Company generating funds from operations of $0.9 million despite the loss of production from the shut-in wells.
The Company's hedging position has continued to allow us to realize higher prices than current market levels for a portion of our production.  During the first quarter 2017, the Company was able to realize an average price of $63.99/bbl on more than 80% of its oil production.  We expect a comparable level of hedging in the rest of 2017 as the Company has commodity contracts in place to recognize an average price of $61.55/bbl on 80% of existing 2017 production going forward, excluding the new production coming on-line from the 2017 drilling program.
Average netbacks for the first quarter of 2017 were $25.81, an increase of 110% compared to the prior year due to higher prices.  If we include the impact of the realized gains from the commodity contracts, our average netbacks for 2017 would be $32.92, which is an increase of 27% compared to the first quarter of 2016.
In the first quarter of 2017, the Company generated a net income of $1.0 million compared to a net loss of $1.3 million in the first quarter 2016."

First Quarter 2017 versus First Quarter 2016
Oil and gas gross revenues totaled $2,809,000 in the quarter versus $2,669,000 in the first quarter of 2016.  Oil revenues increased $354,000 or 17% as average oil prices increased $18.71 per barrel or 62% to $48.95 offset by a 27% decrease in oil production per day to 545 boepd.  Natural gas revenues decreased $142,000 or 47% to $157,000 as average natural gas prices increased $1.23/mcf or 64% to $3.16 which was partially offset by a 68% decrease in natural gas production of 1,702 cubic feet per day (mcf/d) to 552 mcf/d.  Natural gas liquids (NGLs) revenues decreased $72,000 or 22% as NGL production decreased 64% to 116 boepd while average NGL prices increased 119% to $24.05.  
Average first quarter 2017 production per day decreased 44% from the first quarter of 2016 due to the 3 shut-in wells as well as the normal production decline.
Production and operating expenses decreased to $427,000 and the per barrel production and operating costs increased by 40% to $6.30/barrel due to the Company's cost cutting efforts.  The per barrel operating expense increase of 40% is due to the decrease in production from the shut-in wells as well as additional water hauling costs once the shut-in wells were returned to production.  If these water hauling costs are excluded, the per barrel operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 would be reduced to $5.87 per BOE.
Depletion and depreciation expense decreased $714,000 or 43% due to a decrease in production in 2017.
General and administrative expenses decreased $161,000 or 15% due to cost cutting efforts which included reduced salary and benefits and legal and professional fees.
Stock based compensation increased slightly by $5,000 or 13% due to the timing of stock awards granted to employees.
Finance income increased $361,000 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to unrealized gains on commodity contracts in the first quarter of 2017 offset by lower realized gains compared to the prior year quarter.
Finance expense decreased $853,000 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to unrealized losses on commodity contracts in the first quarter of 2016 and reduced interest expense on the credit facility in 2017.
Capital expenditures of $10,544,000 were incurred in the first quarter of 2017 relating to the 2017 drilling program in the US.

The information outlined above is extracted from and should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and the related management's discussion and analysis thereof, copies of which are available under the Company's profile at www.sedar.com.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Netback per barrel and netbacks including commodity contracts, net operating income and funds from operations (collectively, the "Company's Non-GAAP Measures") are not measures recognized under Canadian generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by GAAP.  
The Company's Non-GAAP Measures are described and reconciled to the GAAP measures in the management's discussion and analysis which are available under the Company's profile at www.sedar.com. 
Cautionary Statements
In this news release and the Company's other public disclosure:




 (a) 
 The Company's natural gas production is reported in thousands of cubic feet ("Mcfs"). The Company also uses references to barrels ("Bbls") and barrels of oil equivalent ("Boes") to reflect natural gas liquids and oil production and sales. Boes may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A Boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf:1 Bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value. 






 (b) 
 Discounted and undiscounted net present value of future net revenues attributable to reserves do not represent fair market value. 






 (c) 
 Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. There is a 10% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves. 






 (d) 
 The Company discloses peak and 30-day initial production rates and other short-term production rates.  Readers are cautioned that such production rates are preliminary in nature and are not necessarily indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery. 




Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information
This release contains forward-looking information including information regarding the proposed timing and expected results of exploratory and development work including production from the Company's Tishomingo field, Oklahoma acreage, the future performance of wells following shut-in and restart, the expected effects of cost reduction efforts, availability of funds from the Company's reserves based loan facility, expected hedging levels and the Company's strategy and objectives. The use of any of the words "target", "plans", "anticipate", "continue", "estimate", "expect", "may", "will", "project", "should", "believe" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  
Such forward-looking information is based on management's expectations and assumptions, including that the Company's geologic and reservoir models and analysis will be validated, that indications of early results are reasonably accurate predictors of the prospectiveness of the shale intervals, that previous exploration results are indicative of future results and success, that expected production from future wells can be achieved as modeled, declines will match the modeling, future well production rates will be improved over existing wells, that rates of return as modeled can be achieved, that recoveries are consistent with management's expectations, that additional wells are actually drilled and completed, that design and performance improvements will reduce development time and expense and improve productivity, that discoveries will prove to be economic, that anticipated results and estimated costs will be consistent with managements' expectations, that all required permits and approvals and the necessary labor and equipment will be obtained, provided or available, as applicable, on terms that are acceptable to the Company, when required, that no unforeseen delays, unexpected geological or other effects, equipment failures, permitting delays or labor or contract disputes are encountered, that the development plans of the Company and its co-venturers will not change, that the demand for oil and gas will be sustained, that the Company will continue to be able to access sufficient capital through financings, credit facilities, farm-ins or other participation arrangements to maintain its projects, that the Company will continue in compliance with the covenants under its reserves-based loan facility and that the borrowing base will not be reduced, that funds will be available from the Company's reserves based loan facility when required to fund planned operations, that the Company will not be adversely affected by changing government policies and regulations, social instability or other political, economic or diplomatic developments in the countries in which it operates and that global economic conditions will not deteriorate in a manner that has an adverse impact on the Company's business and its ability to advance its business strategy. 
Forward looking information involves significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. These risks include, but are not limited to: any of the assumptions on which such forward looking information is based vary or prove to be invalid, including that the Company's geologic and reservoir models or analysis are not validated, anticipated results and estimated costs will not be consistent with managements' expectations, the risks associated with the oil and gas industry (e.g. operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration and development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of reserve and resource estimates and projections relating to production, costs and expenses, and health, safety and environmental risks including flooding and extended interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather), the risk of commodity price and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, risks and uncertainties associated with securing the necessary regulatory approvals and financing to proceed with continued development of the Tishomingo Field, the Company or its subsidiaries is not able for any reason to obtain and provide the information necessary to secure required approvals or that required regulatory approvals are otherwise not available when required, that unexpected geological results are encountered, that completion techniques require further optimization, that production rates do not match the Company's assumptions, that very low or no production rates are achieved, that the Company will cease to be in compliance with the covenants under its reserves-based loan facility and be required to repay outstanding amounts or that the borrowing base will be reduced pursuant to a borrowing base re-determination and the Company will be required to repay the resulting shortfall, that the Company is unable to access required capital, that funding is not available from the Company's reserves based loan facility at the times or in the amounts required for planned operations, that occurrences such as those that are assumed will not occur, do in fact occur, and those conditions that are assumed will continue or improve, do not continue or improve and the other risks identified in the Company's most recent Annual Information Form under the "Risk Factors" section, the Company's most recent management's discussion and analysis and the Company's other public disclosure, available under the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. 
With respect to estimated reserves, the evaluation of the Company's reserves is based on a limited number of wells with limited production history and includes a number of assumptions relating to factors such as availability of capital to fund required infrastructure, commodity prices, production performance of the wells drilled, successful drilling of infill wells, the assumed effects of regulation by government agencies and future capital and operating costs. All of these estimates will vary from actual results. Estimates of the recoverable oil and natural gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues expected therefrom, may vary. The Company's actual production, revenues, taxes, development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from such estimates, and such variances could be material.  In addition to the foregoing, other significant factors or uncertainties that may affect either the Company's reserves or the future net revenue associated with such reserves include material changes to existing taxation or royalty rates and/or regulations, and changes to environmental laws and regulations.  
Although the Company has attempted to take into account important factors that could cause actual costs or results to differ materially, there may be other factors that cause actual results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.

BNK Petroleum Inc. Announces New Senior Credit Facility









PR Newswire




Jun 14, 2017 7:05 PM EDT













 


















































  CAMARILLO, CA, June 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - BNK Petroleum Inc. (the " Company") (TSX: BKX) is pleased to announce that its indirect wholly owned subsidiary BNK Petroleum (US) Inc. ("BNK US") has obtained a new US$75,000,000 revolving line of credit ("new facility") from BOK Financial. ("BOKF"). The initial commitment amount of the new reserve-based facility is US$25,000,000. Initial proceeds from the new facility were used to fund the re-payment of BNK US' existing credit facility.  Going forward, proceeds of the new facility are intended to be used for the further development of the Company's Tishomingo field in Oklahoma.  The interest rate on the new facility is calculated based on usage under two separate tranches.  The first tranche will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to an elected LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 3% to 4%, depending on the borrowing base utilization amount, which will be US$20,000,000 of the initial commitment.  The second tranche will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the elected LIBOR rate plus 6%, which is US$5,000,000 of the initial commitment.  The facility provides for interest only payments until the June 2022 maturity date, with bi-annual scheduled reserve redeterminations.  Commenting on the new facility, Wolf Regener, President and CEO, said "We are very pleased to have BOKF join and support us in our Tishomingo project.  The improved credit facility supports our growth initiatives and, compared to our previous facility, provides us with a lower interest rate that saves us over US$650,000 a year assuming the initial commitment amount is fully drawn, and extends the maturity date by four years to June 2022.  We look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship with BOKF.  We are also looking forward to fracking our two previously drilled wells, to quickly increase our production and cash flow which we intend to utilize to accelerate the development of the field."   Oklahoma - Tishomingo Field The Company has prepared both the Hartgraves 1-6H and the Brock 9-2H well sites for fracture stimulations and is currently in discussion with service companies to begin the stimulations.
