The company is under 6 years old so there are some kinks being worked out but managements is focused on morale and work/life balance. There are many events to raise morale and increase work happiness. Managers are protective and always willing to help you out.ConsAdvancement is limited in Ohio.

They will hire when other companies are laying off because Nexeo cannot manage to keep anyone on staff for long enough, so there are always openings.Cons1. Different experiences based on the department you are in, but the compliance group's management is made of one person and a couple cronies who gossip nonstop about current and former employees. Think Mean Girls who didn't mature past high school.2. Various employees like to say that "not everyone can cut it at Nexeo." The truth is, it has nothing to do with intelligence and ability and ALL to do with how much someone sucks up to the Mean Girls. Get on one of their bad sides, and your days are numbered.3. Cronyism and lack of "get the job done and go home" attitude. I would always hear about how "crazy" the employee I replaced was, when in fact, the woman wasn't crazy at all. Her work performance was being sabotaged. There is NEVER a day without internal drama that has nothing to do with work performance at Nexeo.4. It is SO obvious that upper management and HR are incapable or unwilling to put an end to managerial misconduct. Turnover is so high, the company loses more people than it keeps. Let's think about what the common denominator is? Managers will have you believe that every single person they have hired to work under a particular person is incompetent. But how does that make any sense?Isn't it way more likely that the same one person is setting them up to fail.Go to HR and file complaints if needed, but don't expect anything to improve. In fact, expect retaliation from your manager for complaining in the first place.5. No vacation policy anymore. Not like there was anything special about the one we had before, but at least we could go when we wanted. Now, we have to get permission to take time off "whenever we want" but we have to "be available." That does not allow time to unwind from a job that is psychologically and emotionally depleting because you keep receiving snarky e-mails from your manager while you're out asking you to do work.6. There are one or two lunch events a quarter for the regular people. The ELT gets catering brought it regularly, but only share with their secretaries, so there is an obvious "we're better than you" attitude. They want you keeping their bottom line up, for sure, but they couldn't care less about your happiness at work.7. ELT thinks you can't work unless you're in the office, but your direct manager can and will write you up for not taking home your computer "because there could have been an emergency." Very employee-unfriendly.8. Don't get attached to anyone. If they last longer than one year, it is because they are probably twisted and awful. If they are good people, they will leave soon.9. Managers are sadistic and cruel in the way they treat their employees (vague directions so that you will definitely fail, rude remarks, scoffs, eye-rolling during meetings at their direct-reports, etc.). Seriously, some sick puppies. And don't expect them to forget you exist after you leave. They'll tell some random person after you about you and malign you. But you'll be gone, so you'll still be happy.Advice to ManagementAdapt yourself to the changing times.Your turnover rate shows that you are NOT a good place to work.Stop condoning workplace bullying. Keep your managers accountable for the feedback they receive during anonymous survey time.STOP being so cheap. Treat your employees like you treat yourselves.SERVE your employees. It is not enough just to pay them. That does not keep them around (if you couldn't already tell) because other companies will pay them too.For the love of God, look at the managers who cannot keep anyone on staff, and get rid of them. Your "coaching" does clearly not work.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Nexeo Solutions Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Nexeo Solutions 2017-07-03 19:13 PDT May 5, 2017 Helpful (11)"Customer Focused, Employees forgotten"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in The Woodlands, TXCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in The Woodlands, TXNo opinion of CEOI have been working at Nexeo Solutions full-time (More than 3 years)ProsNice HQ location.

It is not anymore. This is not a fledgling "still learning its way" as the occasional review here may suggest. They have learned to love some nasty habits, and are now addicted to the chaos and the selfishness of the ego-maniacal management and executive teams; most of them are arrogant and ignorant. Several are not qualified to do the job they are tasked with, so they focus on throwing others under the bus to hide their own incompetence. Work life balance does not exist here. This is not a company that cares if the employees are happy. Turn over is WAY high, so that should tell you something. Additionally Nexeo has removed what used to be considered "decent" benefits. Health care is now "company run", and you don't accrue any vacation benefits any more.If you are a seasoned professional, you may want to reconsider having this company name on your resume. I know that in the future, if I saw a previous "Nexeo XYZ Manager" apply for a job... I'd drop that resume in the shredder.Advice to ManagementAdvice to management... It wouldn't matter, it's not like any of them care.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (7) Nexeo Solutions Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Nexeo Solutions 2017-06-08 08:11 PDT Showing 213 of 220 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious12345NextReviews > Nexeo Solutions RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountReviews by Job TitleSales Account Manager (13) Account Manager (10) Supervisor (4) Material Handler (4) Customer Service Representative (4) Sales Representative (3) Manager (3) Driver Material Handler (3) Senior Manager (3) Product Line Manager (3) Warehouse Inventory Analyst (2) Corporate Account Manager (2) District Manager (2) Senior Analyst (2) Facility Supervisor (2) Show MoreShow LessCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to ExploreNexeo Solutions PhotosSee All PhotosSee AllView Allnum of numClose (Esc) Company BenefitsHealth InsuranceVacation & Paid Time Off401K PlanDental InsurancePaid HolidaysAdd BenefitsSee AllSee All Job Seekers Also ViewedUnivar ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 354 ReviewsOrica ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 116 ReviewsNexeo ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 11 ReviewsSysco ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 978 ReviewsHuntsman Corp ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 199 ReviewsChevron ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,980 ReviewsPharmavite LLC ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 112 ReviewsBrenntag ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 119 ReviewsEastman ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,363 ReviewsLyondellBasell ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 300 ReviewsWoodforest National Bank ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 586 ReviewsFMC Technologies ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 640 Reviews Related Job SearchAccount Manager jobsAccount Manager salaries ($52k)Customer Service Representative jobsCustomer Service Representative salaries ($25k)Sales Account Manager jobsSales Account Manager salaries ($61k)Driver jobsDriver salaries ($31k)Material Handler jobsMaterial Handler salaries ($27k)Laboratory Technician jobsLaboratory Technician salaries ($35k)Supervisor jobsSupervisor salaries ($43k)Engineer jobsEngineer salaries ($76k)District Manager jobsDistrict Manager salaries ($74k)Product Line Manager jobsProduct Line Manager salaries ($117k)Plant Supervisor jobsPlant Supervisor salaries ($69k)Senior Manager jobsSenior Manager salaries ($130k)Corporate Account Manager jobsCorporate Account Manager salaries ($57k)Outside Sales Representative jobsOutside Sales Representative salaries ($42k)Inventory Specialist jobsInventory Specialist salaries ($23k)Product Specialist jobsProduct Specialist salaries ($52k)Buyer jobsBuyer salaries ($56k)Logistics Coordinator jobsLogistics Coordinator salaries ($40k)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.
