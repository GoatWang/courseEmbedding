 Educational Background



 


University of Puget Sound

                  University of Puget Sound is an independent, predominantly residential, undergraduate liberal arts college with selected graduate programs building effectively on a liberal arts foundation. The university, as a community of learning, maintains a strong commitment to teaching excellence, scholarly engagement, and fruitful student-faculty interaction. The mission of the university is to develop in its students capacities for critical analysis, aesthetic appreciation, sound judgment, and apt expression that will sustain a lifetime of intellectual curiosity, active inquiry, and reasoned independence. A Puget Sound education, both academic and cocurricular, encourages a rich knowledge of self and others; an appreciation of commonality and difference; the full, open, and civil discussion of ideas; thoughtful moral discourse; and the integration of learning, preparing the university's graduates to meet the highest tests of democratic citizenship. Such an education seeks to liberate each person's fullest intellectual and human potential to assist in the unfolding of creative and useful lives.                





 Career History



Chief Executive Officer, President

                                    2002 - Current                


Latash Investments LLC


                  Latash Investments focuses on investments in the stocks of large-cap US companies in the finance sector. The firm manages funds according to a percent of market value. They commit to spend no more than a set percentage of the annual average market value of the endowment. This set percentage is based on a combination of IRS regulation and the expected difference between the total annual return and the rate of inflation.                




Chief Investment Officer

                                    Current                


Rasmuson Foundation


                  The Rasmuson Foundation invests both in individuals and well-managed 501(c)(3) organizations dedicated to improving the quality of life for Alaskans.

The Foundation seeks to support not-for-profit organizations that are focused and effective in the pursuit of their goals, with special consideration for those organizations that demonstrate strong leadership, clarity of purpose and cautious use of resources.

The Foundation trustees believe successful organizations can sustain their basic operations through other means of support and prefer to assist organizations with specific needs, focusing on requests which allow the organizations to become more efficient and effective. The trustees look favorably on organizations which demonstrate broad community support, superior fiscal management and matching project support.
