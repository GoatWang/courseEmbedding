Michael J. Lyons 








Professional Actor, Speaker





























Professional
Speaker, Actor, Author, Entrepreneur, Hospitality Industry Executive - Michael Lyons
has led a very interesting and diverse life.  Mike’s eclectic background
began as a child while living in Paris, France. During his time there, he
appeared in TV advertisements and worked on the film “Paris When It Sizzles,”
starring Hollywood legends Audrey Hepburn, William Holden and Tony Curtis.
Upon his return to the US, he performed in theatrical plays and musicals
throughout high school and college, and was employed on the stage crew of a
professional theatre in suburban Philadelphia, working side by side with famous
entertainers including Gordon MacRae, Carol Lawrence, and Chita Rivera. After graduating from the University
of Notre Dame, he went to work in the business world, bypassing the
opportunity to pursue a vocation in the entertainment industry. In 1990, while working in New York City, he resurrected his dormant acting
career, joined SAG (Screen Actors Guild), and began to book commercials for
products like Advil, Honey Bunches of Oats cereal, Aqua Fresh toothpaste, and
TV roles and other acting assignments on a regular basis. All the while, he
kept his "day job” as a well-respected expert in the travel/meetings
industry. 
Through the years Mike has amassed dozens of credits in major films, television
shows, commercials, corporate videos, print ads and more than 350 live
appearances on the home shopping network QVC as a Product Host. ​His roles have included speaking parts in popular shows and movies such as
 “House of Cards”, “The Sixth Sense,” “All My Children,” “Veep,” “What
Would You Do?” “Arrest and Trial,” and “Outsiders,” among others. He is also an
accomplished singer and performs a live Frank Sinatra tribute show titled “Mike
Sings Frank,” featuring classic Sinatra songs from his CD of the same name.  Mike spent more than 40
years in senior level management roles in the meetings/travel industry,
including stints with CIGNA, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, Global Events Partners
and EGR International. Before going out on his own, he was Exhibition Director
of IBTM America, a premier trade show organized by Reed Exhibitions - the
world's largest trade show management company, based in London. During his career, Mike has worked in Philadelphia, Stamford, CT, New York
City,  Columbus, OH, Minneapolis and Norwalk,
CT; and his travels have taken him to 33 foreign countries and most US states.                As a prolific and experienced professional
speaker, Mike delivers talks in the US and abroad on how to achieve your goals,
pursue your passion, and enhance your personal brand, among other topics. His
easy-going style and humorous anecdotes, coupled with fun exercises and
interactive group involvement, keeps audiences engaged throughout his
presentations.    A native and resident of
suburban Philadelphia, Mike has been married to his lovely wife Lorie
since 1974. They are the proud parents of Mike Jr. (Krista), Erin Oosthuizen
(Simon) and Aimee, and have seven beautiful grandchildren: Ella,
Caitlin, Jesse, Ansley, Joshua, Avery and Logan.

Michael's Story
Author, Professional Speaker, Actor, Entrepreneur, Hospitality Industry Executive - Michael Lyons has led a very interesting and diverse life. ​
 






It all began in Paris...









Paris - Class Picture, 1962 

 
Michael’s eclectic background began as a child while living in Paris, France. During his time there, he appeared in TV advertisements and worked on the film “Paris When It Sizzles,” starring Hollywood legends Audrey Hepburn, William Holden and Tony Curtis.Upon his return to the US, he performed in theatrical plays and musicals throughout high school and college, and was employed on the stage crew of a professional theatre in suburban Philadelphia, working side by side with famous entertainers including Gordon MacRae, Carol Lawrence, and Chita Rivera. ​
 






Actor









Speaker of the House in "House of Cards"





On the set of the ABC-TV Show "What Would You Do?" 

 
After graduating from the University of Notre Dame, he went to work in the business world, bypassing the opportunity to pursue a vocation in the entertainment industry. In 1990, while working in New York City, he resurrected his dormant acting career, joined SAG (Screen Actors Guild), and began to book commercials for products like Advil, Honey Bunches of Oats cereal, Aqua Fresh toothpaste, and others, as well as television roles and other acting assignments on a regular basis. All the while, he kept his "day job” as a well-respected expert in the travel/meetings industry.Through the years Michael has amassed dozens of credits in major films, television shows, commercials, corporate videos, print ads and more than 350 live appearances on the home shopping network QVC as a Product Host.​His roles have included speaking parts in popular shows and movies such as  “House of Cards”, “The Sixth Sense,” “All My Children,” “Veep,” “What Would You Do?” “Arrest and Trial,” and “Outsiders,” among others. He is also an accomplished singer and performs a live Frank Sinatra tribute show titled “Mike Sings Frank,” featuring classic Sinatra songs from his CD of the same name.​

Author











 
In 2017, Michael released his book "Set Yourself Free: Daydream it... Believe it... Achieve it!" to widespread acclaim. Set Yourself Free is a call to action to people everywhere who are not fulfilling their potential, feel stuck and aren't sure what to do about it.Drawing from his life experiences and stories of well-known people who have struggled on the road to success, the book outlines tangible and achievable steps that position the reader to pursue goals they might feel are outside their grasp. Seven time Emmy Award winner and ABC-TV correspondent John Quiñones wrote the Foreword. ​

Michael J. Lyons
Partner






Patent litigator Michael Lyons leads the Silicon Valley litigation practice and brings more than 20 years of experience to his intellectual property (IP) rights practice. In 2014, he obtained a substantial verdict in California for the Alfred E. Mann Foundation in a patent infringement action against Cochlear that resulted in an approximate $131.2 million damages award. Michael’s patent, copyright, trade secret, and other technology-focused litigation involves tools that range from video streaming and consumer electronics’ circuit architecture to medical devices.

Extended Profile

Michael’s experience includes litigating cases that involve semiconductor processing, software, and optoelectronic transceivers. Suits related to ink jet and laser printers, hard disk drives, hardware for graphics image production, and circuit architecture of chips also have come across his desk.
In Virginia, Michael obtained a notable jury verdict for ActiveVideo Networks in a suit that involved video-on-demand technology. The case resulted in a total recovery, including post-trial rulings, in excess of $250 million. He also represented a leading light-emitting diode manufacturer in connection with an US International Trade Commission investigation of patent infringement. The commission found infringement and issued an exclusion order that barred importation of all of the accused products.
In addition to litigation, Michael frequently handles adversarial Patent Office proceedings such as Inter Partes Reviews and Covered Business Method Reviews.  In 2015, Michael won a Federal Circuit affirmance of rarely achieved termination rulings in four Covered Business Method Review proceedings.  
Michael lectures on IP topics and has served as a guest speaker on IP enforcement at Boalt Hall School of Law.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1986 edition. Volume: no.371 Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Ogden, Utah : U.S.D.A. Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station 12 pages Volume: no.371.  Bookseller Inventory # 457920734
