Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

About Us
en español     en français

The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations Housing Investment Trust ("HIT" or the "Trust") is an open-end, commingled investment company, commonly called a mutual fund.  Its portfolio is internally managed and consists primarily of high credit quality fixed-income securities.  The HIT is also one of the earliest and most successful practitioners of socially responsible, economically targeted investing, with a record that demonstrates the added value derived from union-friendly investments. 


The HIT takes great pride in its history of investing union pension capital to achieve competitive risk-adjusted returns while also pursuing socially responsible objectives important to working men and women.  Those social benefits include expanding the supply of affordable housing, creating family-supporting union jobs, opening doors to homeownership for working families, and revitalizing communities where union members live and work. In pursuing these social benefits, the HIT is able to help stimulate employment and promote economic recovery as it is doing with its Construction Jobs Initiative.

The HIT was first registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1981 and, as the successor to the AFL-CIO Mortgage Investment Trust (MIT), builds on a history of nearly 50 years of socially responsible investing on behalf of union members and their pension plans.  The establishment of the MIT was approved  by the AFL-CIO General Board in 1964, and in a letter to affiliated unions, AFL-CIO President George Meany encouraged unions to invest in the MIT.

Competitive Risk-adjusted Returns

The HIT's primary investment objective is to generate competitive risk-adjusted returns for its participants.  It does this by investing in the fixed-income market, primarily in high credit quality multifamily mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-backed obligations.  The HIT's specialization in multifamily mortgage instruments has provided an income advantage that has enabled the HIT to perform competitively against its industry benchmark, the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. It also enables the HIT to achieve its secondary objectives of creating union construction jobs and affordable housing.

The HIT offers its investors a high degree of security, with the majority of its investments being insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government or government-sponsored enterprises.  The HIT's experienced staff actively manages the portfolio to meet the fund’s investment and performance goals.


Housing and Jobs

The HIT supports the values of the union movement through the housing it finances and the jobs it creates. Although financial performance is its first priority, participants in the HIT have the satisfaction of knowing that their capital also creates other positive, tangible benefits for working people and their communities. Through its multifamily investment staff, the HIT sources new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects that create housing units and preserve affordability.   

In response to the recession and its devastating effects on working people and their communities, the HIT is supporting the AFL-CIO's priority of job creation with its Construction Jobs Initiative.  Launched in 2009, this initiative achieved its initial goal of creating 10,000 union construction jobs by spring of 2011 in communities nationwide.  The HIT has twice expanded the initiative and is now working along with its subsidiary Building America toward a new goal of 25,000 jobs. To date, HIT investments of over $2 billion and financing provided by Building America have leveraged over $4.8 billion of development at more than 89 projects in 38 cities. Because construction serves as a catalyst for other economic activity, the Construction Jobs Initiative is also stimulating thousands of jobs in other sectors of the economy.



The HIT’s relationships across the housing finance market have enabled it to undertake targeted community investing initiatives that "bring Wall Street to Main Street" – helping cities and states leverage new capital to meet urgent housing and community development needs.  

All on-site construction work on HIT-financed projects is performed by responsible contractors using 100% union labor.  This means that the jobs generated by HIT investments pay family-supporting wages that benefit workers and strengthen communities.

Investors

The HIT is owned exclusively by its investors, through their purchase of units of participation.  Investors include major public employee pension plans, Taft-Hartley plans, and other funds with union member beneficiaries.  Currently the HIT has over 360 investors.

Internal Management Capacity

As an internally managed fund, the HIT has built a core competency in agency-insured multifamily mortgage-backed securities and has the ability to source investment opportunities directly.  Its experienced portfolio management team applies a rigorous analytical approach to its portfolio and trading activities.  The portfolio managers and a committed team of housing investment professionals work with developers and mortgage bankers to create favorable investment opportunities that meet the HIT's portfolio requirements.  This internal capacity permits the HIT to go beyond ordinary screen-based trading to achieve enhanced performance.


The HIT's in-house expertise in housing finance makes it an outstanding resource to developers for structuring the complex financial transactions typically required for affordable and special needs housing. HIT staff is knowledgeable about putting together financing packages involving multiple financing sources to meet the needs of seniors, people with disabilities, the formerly homeless, and other special populations.

The HIT is distinguished from other union-friendly fixed-income funds by its full-time labor relations staff.  The labor relations staff is skilled in assisting developers, general contractors, and unions with identifying qualified subcontractors that meet HIT's labor requirements, helping to assure that project construction proceeds on-time and on-budget. 

A Philosophy Reflecting Union Values

The HIT's investment philosophy reflects the values of working people.  The American labor movement established HIT's predecessor fund in 1965 with the goal – described by the founding President of the AFL-CIO George Meany – of providing unions a "higher interest return with maximum degree of safety" through investments to "meet America's tremendous unmet housing needs and to replace deteriorating housing units." The fund was to be a "non-profit venture" for which "no fees, commissions or charges will be paid by participants."  

Guided by these principles, the HIT devotes itself to achieving this union vision of socially responsible investing.  Its investment experience demonstrates that it is possible to achieve competitive fixed-income returns and a high degree of investment security for the pension plans of working people, while improving the nation’s housing stock, fostering community development, and creating good union jobs.

Goals
Progress$150 Million Goal Achieved 
  
  The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL‐CIO) and its affiliated labor unions are engaged in a major effort to find ways for skilled labor, Taft‐Hartley and public employee retirement funds to be appropriately engaged in energy‐saving building retrofits and infrastructure improvements across America. In addition to making investment managers aware of the many compelling investment opportunities in building retrofits and infrastructure, the AFL‐CIO will undertake an energy‐efficiency retrofit of its own headquarters to serve as a signature component of the Better Buildings Challenge. The AFL‐CIO will work with existing real estate‐focused investment funds to invest $150 million of capital in energy-efficient retrofits of commercial, multifamily, institutional and public buildings.
For more information about the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust, visit the website.
  

 












Markets Served:  All types of buildings could be addressed by one of the several investment funds, which the AFL-CIO is engaging. Recent investments have been particularly in the low‐income multi‐family residential sector.
Products and Services:  AFL‐CIO is demonstrating the way forward for institutional investors to capture the value of energy efficiency investments.

Programs











Our programs train and support working people in all stages of their career. We provide opportunities for union members, as well as future members to gain valuable skills to become leaders in their unions, advocate for workers’ rights and become forces of good for their communities.
¡Adelante! We Rise!
The AFL-CIO is opening the doors of our union halls to engage immigrant workers, whatever their status, and help them gain a voice on the job and advance toward full rights and equal protections.
Center for Strategic Research
The Center for Strategic Research, an arm of the AFL-CIO Organizing Department, provides strategic planning, corporate research, industry research and issue research to support AFL-CIO organizing and programs.
Common Sense Economics
Common Sense Economics is a training and education program, conducted by and for union members and progressive allies, to educate working people on how our economy works and how actions and policies impact our economy. For communities and working people across the country, it seems as if the economy is like the weather, something unpredictable that happens to us. But the economy isn’t like the weather—it doesn’t just happen. Politicians support policies that foster an economy that works for Wall Street and the privileged few instead of one that works for everyone. Together, we can change that.
Test your knowledge on the social justice issues that affect our economy.
Investment Trusts
The AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust (HIT) and the AFL-CIO Building Investment Trust (BIT) are investment vehicles for pension plans that create union construction jobs. The HIT invests in residential real estate loans, and the BIT invests in commercial real estate equity. Investment trusts are a win for everyone. Working people, through their pension funds, are investing in good-paying American jobs and infrastructure projects.

No-Action Letter: AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust (August 5, 2016)





















Home | Previous Page


























Investment Company Act of 1940 — Section 12(d)(3)
AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust
August 5, 2016
RESPONSE OF THE CHIEF COUNSEL’S OFFICE
DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
Our response to your letter, dated August 4, 2016, provides assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under section 12(d)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) against the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust (“HIT”), an open-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act, under the circumstances described below. Specifically, HIT proposes to organize and acquire the securities issued by a wholly owned and controlled subsidiary, organized as a Delaware limited liability company (the “Adviser Sub”) that will operate as an investment adviser, and will be registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”).[1]
BACKGROUND
You state the following:

HIT is a common law trust organized in the District of Columbia and an internally managed open-end investment company registered under the 1940 Act. HIT operates under and will continue to comply with the terms and conditions of certain regulatory relief.[2] 
For federal income tax purposes, HIT has made an election to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), and intends to continue to be so treated. As a RIC, HIT generally will not pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders as dividends. To maintain its RIC status, HIT must, among other things, meet specified source-of-income requirements. HIT will satisfy these source-of-income requirements if it derives, in each taxable year, at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in securities (“Good RIC Income”). 
HIT’s board of trustees (“Board”) and officers desire to expand the scope of their advisory activities beyond the management of HIT’s portfolio. Expanding the scope of advisory activities would allow HIT to use its existing resources (e.g., its investment professionals) to increase its gross revenue and income.  
HIT’s Board and officers have determined that providing advisory services through an investment adviser entity that is wholly owned and controlled by HIT would be most beneficial to HIT’s shareholders. This approach would allow HIT to shield itself from potential liabilities associated with such advisory activities to which HIT would be exposed were it to engage in those activities directly. Moreover, as the advisory business grows, creating a separate subsidiary to provide advisory services and receive investment management fee income would avoid concerns that HIT might fail to satisfy the source-of-income requirements necessary to maintain its RIC status under the Code.[3] You represent that the utilization of the Adviser Sub as a tax “blocker” entity in this manner is a lawful method of tax planning under the Code.  
HIT has obtained shareholder approval of its proposal to enter into the business of providing advisory services to U.S. and non-U.S. registered and unregistered investment companies, institutional investors, separate accounts, private clients and others through the Adviser Sub.

You further represent as follows:

HIT will wholly own and control the Adviser Sub. HIT will not have an investment adviser within the meaning of section 2(a)(20) of the 1940 Act. Only persons acting in their capacities as directors, officers or employees of HIT will provide advisory services to HIT.  
The determination to enter into the advisory business through the Adviser Sub has been made by a vote of at least a majority of HIT’s directors who are not “interested persons” of HIT as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. 
In addition to information communicated to shareholders in seeking shareholder approval of the proposed arrangement, in each of its annual reports to shareholders and its prospectus, HIT will discuss the existence of the Adviser Sub and the provision by the Adviser Sub of outside advisory services as well as include an assessment of whatever risks, if any, are associated with the existence of the Adviser Sub and its provision of such services. 
The Adviser Sub will not make any proprietary investment that HIT would be prohibited from making directly under HIT’s investment objectives, policies and restrictions or under any applicable law.  
In assessing compliance with the asset coverage requirements under section 18 of the 1940 Act, HIT will deem the assets, liabilities and indebtedness of the Adviser Sub as its own. 
The Board will review at least annually the investment advisory business of the Adviser Sub to determine whether such business should be continued and whether the benefits derived by HIT from the Adviser Sub’s business warrant the continued ownership of the Adviser Sub and, if appropriate, approve (by a vote of at least a majority of its directors who are not “interested persons” as defined in the 1940 Act) at least annually such continuation. In determining whether the investment advisory business of the Adviser Sub should be continued and whether the benefits derived by HIT from the Adviser Sub’s business warrant the continued ownership of the Adviser Sub, HIT’s Board will take into consideration, among other things, the following: (a) the compensation of the officers of HIT and of the Adviser Sub; (b) all investments by and investment opportunities considered for HIT that relate to any investments by or investment opportunities considered for a client of the Adviser Sub; and (c) the allocation of expenses associated with the provision of advisory services between HIT and the Adviser Sub.[4]

LEGAL ANALYSIS
Section 12(d)(3) of the 1940 Act generally provides that it is unlawful for any registered investment company to purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by any person who is, among other things, an investment adviser of an investment company or an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act.[5] The Commission has indicated that the prohibited acquisitions under section 12(d)(3) are not limited to the original acquisitions of stock, but may occur as a result of subsequent events.[6]
In support of your request, you argue that HIT’s ownership of the Adviser Sub raises none of the concerns underlying section 12(d)(3) of the 1940 Act.[7] You state that these concerns were two-fold. First, Congress wished “to prevent investment companies from exposing their assets to the entrepreneurial risks of securities-related businesses,” including those of an investment adviser.[8] Second, Congress wanted to prevent potential conflicts of interest and situations in which brokers, securities dealers and other financial intermediaries were in a position to dominate investment companies.[9]
You state that the first concern stems from the fact that, in 1940, when section 12(d)(3) was adopted, most securities-related businesses were organized as privately held general partnerships.[10] You argue that, because the Adviser Sub will be organized as a limited liability company, the proposed arrangement provides a level of insulation for the shareholders of HIT from the entrepreneurial risks of concern to Congress in enacting section 12(d)(3). You also argue the potential for conflicts of interest and overreaching is mitigated due to the fact that HIT: (i) will remain internally managed and will not have an investment adviser within the meaning of section 2(a)(20) of the 1940 Act; (ii) will wholly own and control the Adviser Sub; and (iii) will have HIT’s Board oversee the advisory business conducted by the Adviser Sub. You note that HIT could provide advisory services directly and would be conducting these activities through the Adviser Sub for bona fide tax planning reasons. Finally, you state that this concern in the context of section 12(d)(3) was raised by Congress primarily with respect to an investment company’s ownership of a brokerage or underwriting business.[11] 
CONCLUSION
Based on the facts and representations set forth in your letter, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under section 12(d)(3) of the 1940 Act against HIT if HIT organizes and acquires the securities issued by the Adviser Sub. This letter expresses our position on enforcement action only, and does not express any legal conclusion or interpretive conclusion on the issues presented. Because our position is based on the facts and representations in your letter, any different facts or representations may require a different conclusion.[12]

Senior Counsel



[1]        Initially, it is expected that Adviser Sub will provide investment advice to a private fund. It is intended that Adviser Sub will provide investment advice to additional clients over time and will register under the Advisers Act and thus trigger the prohibitions of section 12(d)(3) of the 1940 Act. 


[2] AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust, SEC Staff No-Action Letter (Aug. 27, 1990); AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust, SEC Staff No-Action Letter (Apr. 30, 1986); American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations Mortgage Investment Trust, et al., Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 14129 (Sept. 5, 1984) (notice) and 14179 (Oct. 1, 1984) (order); American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations Pooled Investment Trust, Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 12303 (Mar. 17, 1982) (notice) and 12387 (Apr. 21, 1982) (order). 


[3]        Investment management fee income received in connection with the provision of investment advisory services would not constitute Good RIC Income for HIT. Because the Adviser Sub would be a taxable entity under the Code, however, such fee income, if earned by the Adviser Sub and subsequently distributed to HIT, would constitute Good RIC Income for HIT. 


[4]        Such expenses may include: administration and operating expenses; investment research expenses; sales and marketing expenses; office space and general expenses; and direct expenses, including legal and audit fees, directors’ fees and taxes.


[5]        Rule 12d3-1 under the 1940 Act provides a conditional exemption from this prohibition under certain circumstances, which are inapplicable in the case of the Adviser Sub.


[6] See Acquisitions of Securities or Interests, Investment Company Act Rel. No. 3542 (Sept. 21, 1962).


[7]        We have granted relief to internally managed closed-end funds in similar situations. Adams Diversified Equity Fund Inc., SEC Staff No-Action Letter (Apr. 30, 2015). The relevant conditions do not materially differ when applied to HIT, an internally managed open-end fund. 


[8] See Exemption for Acquisition by Registered Investment Companies of Securities Issued by Persons Engaged Directly or Indirectly in Securities Related Businesses, Investment Company Act Rel, No. 13725 (Jan. 17, 1984), at nn. 6-7 and accompanying text.


[9] Id. at nn. 8-9 and accompanying text.


[10] See Exemption of Acquisitions of Securities Issued by Persons Engaged in Securities Related Businesses, Investment Company Act Rel. No. 19204 (Jan. 4, 1993), at n. 10 and accompanying text.


[11] Compare section 12(c)(2)(B) in H.R. 8935, 76th Cong. (3d Sess. 1940) at 30, S. 3580, 76th Cong. (3d Sess. 1940) at 30, and Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Hearings on S. 3580 before the Subcomm. on Securities and Exch. of the S. Comm. on Banking and Currency, 76th Cong. (3d Sess. 1940), pt. 1, at 10 (“Senate Hearings”) with section 12(d)(3)(B) of the 1940 Act. See also H.R. Rep. No. 76-2639, at 16 (1940); S. Rep. No. 76-1775, at 15-16 (1940); Senate Hearings, pt. 1, at 243. We note, however, that section 1(b)(2) of the 1940 Act stated that, when investment companies are operated, managed, or their portfolio securities are selected in the interest of investment advisers rather than in the interest of all classes of shareholders of such companies, the public interest and the interest of investors are adversely affected. 


[12]       The Division of Investment Management generally permits third parties to rely on no-action or interpretive letters to the extent that the third party’s facts and circumstances are substantially similar to those described in the underlying request for a no-action or interpretive letter. See Informal Guidance Program for Small Entities, Investment Company Act Rel. No. 22587 (Mar. 27, 1997), at n. 20. In light of the very fact-specific nature of HIT’s request, however, the position expressed in this letter applies only to HIT, and no other entity may rely on this position.

The AFL-CIO Building Investment Trust 


The mission of the AFL-CIO Building Investment Trust (BIT), a bank collective trust for which PNC Bank serves as trustee, is to provide competitive risk-adjusted returns for qualified union pension plans through investments in institutional quality commercial real estate. The BIT also provides collateral benefits such as union job creation and economic development. As of March 31, 2017, the BIT had a net asset value of $4.7 billion.

The BIT invests exclusively in US markets and has developed and implemented one of the most comprehensive written union labor policies in the industry.  In its 28 year history, the BIT has invested over $7 billion for the development and acquisition of more than 200 office, retail, multifamily, hotel, warehouse, and mixed use properties across the country. These investments have generated approximately 72 million hours in union construction work and created thousands of permanent union jobs in the service, maintenance and operations of facilities owned by the BIT.  

As a fund carrying the AFL-CIO name, the BIT strives to meet the highest expectations both as a prudent steward of pension capital and as a fund dedicated to creating American jobs and building American communities.

ST. LOUIS, June 9, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust (HIT) announced today that it is providing $46 million in financing for two multifamily developments in the greater St. Louis area. Cardinal Ritter Senior Services' St. John Neumann Apartments in Jennings, Missouri, and The Heights at Manhasset Apartments in Richmond Heights, Missouri, will provide 381 units of multifamily housing.
The HIT's investment of $5.1 million in the $8 million St. John Neumann project in St. Louis County, the most populous county in Missouri, will help Cardinal Ritter Senior Services to convert the building from a Section 202 project with a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contract, to a Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) development that will enhance the marketability and livability of the building.  Built in 1991, St. John Neumann Apartments has 100 units of affordable housing, with all units designated for persons 62 or older, earning at or below 50% of the area median income. The HIT is helping finance new construction of an additional 11 units, substantial rehabilitation of existing units, and refinance the existing Section 202 debt.  
In Richmond Heights, also in St. Louis County, construction is set to begin on the new $54 million Heights at Manhasset development. The HIT is investing $42 million of the project's financing. The new building will include 281 market-rate housing units and is located at the center of one of the most job rich areas in the region, with excellent access to the larger region via close proximity to two interstate highways. The project will be the first of four development phases.
"The HIT is excited to provide financing to these projects that will offer affordable housing options to a community that has had limited new construction since 2005," said HIT Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer Stephanie H. Wiggins. 
All on-site construction work at the two properties will be performed using 100% union labor in coordination with the local building and construction trades unions. 
Jeff Aboussie, Executive Secretary-Treasurer of the St. Louis Building and Construction Trades Council, said, "the union community welcomes the HIT's investments in St. Louis County. We know that with the HIT's involvement all the construction work will be done union. That means more family-supporting union jobs for our members and more high quality union-built development for the community."  
Under its Construction Jobs Initiative that began in early 2009, the HIT has invested $227 million to support eight projects in the St. Louis metro area, which represents more than 2,860 jobs for members of the local building and construction trades unions. Besides providing a major boost to the local economy, these projects also financed 1,648 new or rehabilitated housing units for local residents. In addition to St. John Neumann Apartments and The Heights at Manhasset, other St. Louis-area projects financed through this initiative are:

Holy Infant & St. Joseph Apartments, Cardinal Ritter Senior Services' properties in Shrewsbury, St. Louis County: A $13 million rehabilitation project offering 157 housing units affordable for low-income seniors. The HIT provided $6.6 million in financing. The project generated approximately 90 union construction jobs. 
Park Pacific Apartments, St. Louis:  A $98 million redevelopment offering 230 housing units.  The HIT provided $63 million in financing. The project created an estimated 755 union construction jobs. 
The Laurel, St. Louis: A $175 million redevelopment offering 205 housing units. The HIT provided $45 million in financing. The project generated approximately 1,340 union construction jobs. 
Villas at Crystal Lake, Swansea, IL:  A $26 million development offering 216 housing units. The HIT provided $24 million in financing. The project created an estimated 140 union construction jobs. 
The HIT has an active track record of financing projects in the St. Louis area. In its 30-year history, the HIT has invested approximately $549 million in 28 St. Louis area projects with total development costs of over $900 million. These projects represent 4,736 housing units and more than 6,380 union construction jobs. 
About the HIT
AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust (HIT) is a fixed-income investment company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It manages $5 billion in assets for more than 370 investors, which include union and public employee pension plans. The HIT invests primarily in government and agency insured and guaranteed multifamily mortgage-backed securities. The HIT is one of the earliest and most successful practitioners of socially responsible, economically targeted investing, with a track record of over 30 years that demonstrates the added value derived from union-friendly investments. The investment objective of the HIT is to provide competitive returns for its investors and to promote the collateral objectives of constructing affordable housing and generating employment for union members in the construction trades and related industries. Since its inception, the HIT has invested $8.5 billion (in 2014 dollars) to finance more than 99,000 units of housing nationwide, generating more than 74,000 union construction jobs.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust

Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
