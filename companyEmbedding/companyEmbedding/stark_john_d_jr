 RIVERHEAD, N.Y. -- Suffolk Bancorp (NASDAQ: SUBK) announced that
the Board of Directors, at its regular meeting today, elected John D.
Stark, Jr. as director of Suffolk Bancorp and its subsidiary, Suffolk
County National Bank.

 Chairman Thomas S. Kohlmann, remarked, "Mr. Stark brings us
more than 20 years experience in engineering, land development,
construction, and business management. He also brings a unique
understanding of our core communities and traditional markets on Long
Island, and how they have evolved in recent years. Further, as the
youngest member of our board, he is a representative of Suffolk
Bancorp's future, and the Company's commitment to long-term,
shareholder value. We welcome him aboard with great satisfaction, and
look forward to his guidance and participation for many years to
come."

 Since 1996, Mr. Stark has been a Vice President of the Foxwood
Corporation, a developer and operator of the private retirement
community, Foxwood Village, located in Riverhead, New York. Prior to
that, he served as Product Safety Engineer in the industrial machinery
division TUV Produce Service, Inc. of Danvers, Massachusetts; as Product
Development Engineer for Galileo Electro-Optics Corp of Sturbridge,
Massachusetts; and Product Manager and Senior Applications Engineer for
Dolan Jenner Industries of Woburn, Massachusetts. A native of Riverhead,
he is a graduate of Riverhead's own Mercy High School, and holds a
BSME from Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, as well as a
Certificate in Geometrical Optics from the University of Rochester. He
lives in Riverhead with his wife.

 Suffolk Bancorp is a one-bank holding company engaged in the
commercial banking business through the Suffolk County National Bank, a
full service commercial bank headquartered in Riverhead, New York.
"SCNB" is Suffolk Bancorp's wholly owned subsidiary.
Organized in 1890, the Suffolk County National Bank has 27 offices in
Suffolk County, New York.

 Safe Harbor Statement Pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995

 This press release may include statements which look to the future.
These can include remarks about Suffolk Bancorp, the banking industry,
and the economy in general. These remarks are based on current plans and
expectations. They are subject, however, to a variety of uncertainties
that could cause future results to vary materially from Suffolk's
historical performance, or from current expectations. Factors affecting
Suffolk Bancorp include particularly, but are not limited to: changes in
interest rates; increases or decreases in retail and commercial economic
activity in Suffolk's market area; variations in the ability and
propensity of consumers and businesses to borrow, repay, or deposit
money, or to use other banking and financial services; and changes in
government regulations.
