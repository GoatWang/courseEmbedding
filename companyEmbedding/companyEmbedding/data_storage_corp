            Read Case Study
        







































According to researcher, Martin Hilbert, in 1986 a mere 1% of the world's data was stored digitally. By 2000, that number had grown to 25%, and by 2007 it had reached 97%—a phenomenal increase. The tipping point—the point at which more information was stored on digital rather than analog devices—occurred in 2002, marking what Hilbert calls the beginning of the digital age. Since that time, we've become spoiled for choice; today's data storage options are increasingly abundant and sophisticated, ranging from the high-capacity hard drive to the ultraportable thumb drive to the versatile Blu-ray drive. 
Surprisingly, one of the newest data storage methods has a history stretching back more than 30 years. Invented by Dr. Fujio Masuoka in 1980, flash memory has found new life as a replacement for hard disks. Used in solid state drives, flash memory eliminates the mechanical issues of a hard disk drive and increases the effective average data transfer rate by 10 times or more. Samsung released the first flash-based PCs in 2006, and Apple converted its MacBook Air line to SSDs in 2010.
From fresh solutions like flash memory to complex offerings such as networked attached storage (NAS) and storage area networking (SAN), CDW provides a plethora of cutting-edge options for your data storage needs. We make sure that securing and storing your data has never been easier, whether you're looking for a simple SD card or a high-capacity external hard drive. And don't forget to check out our Deal of the Week for special discounts on data storage!
