 The Definitions of "Upstream" and "Downstream" in the Production Process | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  The Definitions of "Upstream" and "Downstream" in the Production Process  by Brian Bass        Commercial shipping or receiving of goods globally involves international logistics. Ryan McVay/Photodisc/Getty Images   Related Articles  1 Push vs. Pull Supply Chain Strategy 2 Upstream and Downstream Activities for a Marketing Director 3 What Are the Four Elements of Supply Chain Management? 4 Difference Between Tier 1 & Tier 2 Companies    "Upstream" and "downstream" are business terms applicable to the production processes that exist within several industries. Industries that commonly use this terminology include the metals industry, oil, gas, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Upstream, downstream and midstream make up the stages of the production process for these and other industries.        Definition of Upstream The upstream stage of the production process involves searching for and extracting raw materials. The upstream part of the production process does not do anything with the material itself, such as processing the material. This part of the process simply finds and extracts the raw material. Thus, any industry that relies on the extraction of raw materials commonly has an upstream stage in its production process. In a more general sense, "upstream" can also refer to any part of the production process relating to the extraction stages. Examples of Upstream Processes In the petroleum industry, locating underground or underwater oil reserves characterizes the upstream process. Additionally, the upstream process in this industry involves bringing oil and gas to the surface. Extraction wells represent an example of a structure operating in this stage in the process. The upstream stage in the production process may also manifest itself as a supplier providing raw materials to manufacturers or other businesses that ultimately process the materials. Definition of Downstream The downstream stage in the production process involves processing the materials collected during the upstream stage into a finished product. The downstream stage further includes the actual sale of that product to other businesses, governments or private individuals. The type of end user will vary depending on the finished product. Regardless of the industry involved, the downstream process has direct contact with customers through the finished product. Examples of Downstream Processes In the oil and gas industry, the downstream process consists of converting crude oil into other products and then selling those products to customers. Thus, oil refineries represent structures that operate within the downstream process. However, any kind of plant that processes raw materials may qualify as operating within the downstream stage of production. A company that combines both upstream and downstream processes is an integrated company.

Project Upstream Revealed
by Victor Lund on May 14, 2015


For a few years now, industry leaders have been working together to address data problems, producing almost two years ago a solution concept called “Upstream.” Not long after that, the WAV Group was asked to consult on the technical side of the development of the project. Our non-disclosure agreement has prevented us from saying much about it. However, now we are very pleased to be allowed finally to share some information about the concept. In an announcement this week, UpstreamRE, LLC, the standalone company that will direct the effort, announced that it is deep into serious negotiations with the National Association of REALTORS, exploring ways to leverage the significant assets and capabilities of NAR’sRealtor Property Resource unit to support key components of Upstream’s functionality. At the NAR Midyear meetings, the NAR Board of Directors approved $12 Million in funding to support Upstream and AMP development projects for Realtors Property Resource. UpstreamRE, LLC will now consider using some RPR services combined with other vendor services for the project.
Upstream is not an MLS!
Real estate firms across America have obstreperous data management problems. Three of those problems include the disorderly replication of add/edit; the replication and inconsistency of data formats; and the challenge of perfecting Copyright. These challenges that face firms are interrelated in many ways.
[ Definition: Obstreperous – noisy, difficult to control, unruly, unmanageable, disorderly, undisciplined, rowdy, disruptive. ]
The Solution for Duplicate Add-Edit
When a firm acquires a listing, there are many actions that often take place before that listing is placed in the MLS. For example, firms likely create a transaction in their back office system that allows expenses such as sign services, photography service, staging, or other expenditures to be ordered and tracked. Franchise firms are also required to enter the listing into the franchise system for accounting. Although some of the larger MLSs have created a new status for tracking this pre-listing data management need, most do not.
The duplication of add/edit in multiple databases is problematic. Nobody wants to experience the repetitive data entry for a variety of reasons. Chiefly, duplication of add-edit causes increased labor expenses and is prone to errors. Moreover, managing edits in multiple systems requires significant training and support.
The very best add-edit solution in the industry has been developed by MLSs. WAV Group supported project Upstream by creating a specification for an MLS quality add-edit solution. It includes usability solutions, like pre-populating the listing from tax record sources. It also includes listing integrity solutions to prevent errors in data entry. Most importantly, the construct supports the RESO Data Dictionary standard and field level business rules.
The specification for Upstream add-edit is the same specification used in MLSs across the nation: Data Dictionary compliant, public record auto population, and MLS rules compliant. Today, RPR does not offer add-edit functionality, however the new funding by NAR will allow them to add this to their roadmap. UpstreamRE will need to consider waiting vs. licensing an existing solution already in production.
The Solution for Replication and Inconsistent Data Formats
Overlapping market disorder has plagued real estate forever. It has caused firms to enter and maintain data in multiple MLSs. Firms are also operating a wide range of back office data management systems, including franchise data management solutions. Replicating data is the process of storing the same information in multiple databases. It’s expensive and wasteful. Different data base formats also create incremental costs whenever systems need to share data. It requires data mapping and aggregation. Again, it’s expensive and wasteful. Firms participating in Upstream will individually manage their data in a common format and in a common database.
Realtors Property Resource is the largest single data repository for listing content in the nation. It would make perfect sense for Upstream to leverage that Realtor member benefit to store and normalize listing records, agent records, office records, firm records, employee records, and customer records. And, who knows what other significant synergies might real estate practitioners benefit from in the future as a result of this logical collaboration.
“Upstream always has been about making practitioners much more efficient in the handling of their data, thus lowering the cost, time and effort they spend,” said Craig Cheatham, secretary of the UpstreamRE, LLC Board. “And, brokers will be able to regain much better control of that data, for which they ultimately are held responsible.”
RPR could provide project UpstreamRE with a head start that would allow participating brokers to get a head start on pulling their data together. RPR also has a lot of additionally useful data that was not contemplated by project UpstreamRE but could be a way to augment a firm’s data.
The Solution for Data Distribution
Project Upstream recognizes the incredible lack of efficiency in data distribution. Upstream will solve this problem by providing firms with a single data distribution dashboard to send their data wherever they want – an MLS system, a franchise system, a technology vendor, or even a publisher. The broker, and only the broker will be in control of where its data goes.
Today, RPR does not have a data dashboard solution that would meet the needs of project UpstreamRE. UpstreamRE will need to use one of the many commercial data distribution applications or work with RPR to evaluate their development capabilities in this area. The image below shows how UpstreamRE and RPR might be integrated.

About the Organizers
Project Upstream has the support of The Realty Alliance, Keller Williams, HomeServices of America, LeadingRE, RE/MAX, Realty Executives, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, Realogy, NRT and many others. All of these organizations have contributed and enormous amount of staff resources to insure that Upstream will serve the common, but independent, needs of all real estate brokers.
Upstream is not a broker data sharing solution. Each broker will only see and manage its own data. They have no access to any other broker’s data. Upstream would not make decisions about the real estate data it holds.
Upstream has completed their RFP process and is working directly with selected vendors for the technology components.
Upstream has developed governance that allows small, mid-sized, and large firms with representation on the Board of Managers. Participating firms will elect their representatives after the participants are divided into these three groups by the number of data sets they store in Upstream.
Upstream is not intended as a profit center, and will operate like a mutual benefit corporation.
Since NAR’s Board of Directors vote to support the cooperation proposal on May 16, Upstream and the National Association of REALTORS will work toward a final, detailed agreement that will specify the best roles for NAR and its resources within the project. Upstream’s founders have indicated to me they are extremely grateful that the national trade organization for real estate is poised to deliver this strong support for for all its members that will deliver enormous value.

Victor, two questions: 1. In a brief paragraph, what is the mission of Upstream?  2. Who or what entities are the intended beneficiaries of Upstream’s product?  Although I don’t have a grasp on this concept, it sounds expensive and like it will use up a lot of resources … and I am doubtful that a significant number of “individual agents” will derive much benefit at all  from the program since the business of nearly ALL Realtors is close to 100% local.  I deeply respect your insightfulness and ideas.  Please help me understand.

Although this seems like a great idea…Brokers are putting the an outside company in charge of all their data. The brokers will provide the data, the company will validate, store and distribute…. Isn’t that what the MLS does now locally…. and yet the data somehow is being syndicated to sites Like Zillow and Trulia who pay nothing to the agents or brokers to use their data, and instead profit from the same agents.   I see another pattern…. A better solution would be to charge companies like Zillow, Trulia and even Realtor.com for the right to use the data… and then pay royalties to the brokerages for the use of that data. I understand the need for consistency and conformity, but who really profits for this and how?

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
