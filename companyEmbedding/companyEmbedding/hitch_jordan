Trailer Hitch Information VideosHow To Tow a TrailerToday we are going to review the components needed to pull a trailer.  Basically, this video is designed for somebody who just decided they have a need for a trailer, so we will cover all the components in the most basic form, so you know exactly how to update your vehicle.  What we are going to do is start from the truck and work our way back to the trailer.  First off, we are going to show you the hitch itself.  All vehicles require a hitch to pull a trailer.  What this device does is makes an attaching point on the frame of the vehicle, or body components, and transmits the forces from the trailer to this one point here.  This point here is the receiver part.  Consequently this hitch is called a receiver hitch because this  hitch can receive a draw bar, or also called a ball mount.  It is held in place by this pin which we just ed, and this clip holds it in place.  There are more fancier pins, like locking pins, but that is the basic thing you need right there to get the job done.  1:12Cleaning Weld Nuts for Trailer Hitch InstallationOkay as you can see here on the drivers side, our weld nut has a lot of corrosion built up in there.  And when we try to install our 10 millimeter bolt is not wanting to start  at all, in fact it almost seems like the bolt is too big for the weld nut.  It is a common misconception, again when the weld nuts got a lot of build up in there.
Class III Trailer Hitch and Weight Capacities ReviewTraditionally a class III receiver hitch is good for trailers up to 5000 pounds and 500 pounds tongue weight. There are a few different variances from that, well show you that here in a second. Again were going to start with the stickers and show you the differences, as you can see here the max gross trailer weight is 5000 pounds as we discussed. The tongue weight looks to be 500 pounds, again about 10percent of your trailer weight. On the other side of the class III you will see a sticker for weight distribution. That is a specification when you use a device that goes in between the truck and the trailer that takes up the tongue weight. What it does is distributes the weight between the truck and the trailer and allows you to carry a heavier weight. As far as a class III hitch is concerned, that increases the rating the hitch can handle.
Lowering Exhaust Example for Trailer Hitch InstallationThe first step to do is to lower the exhaust and we will do that by taking off the rubber hangers on the front and back, and there is one hidden in the back. 
Class II Trailer Hitch and Weight Capacities ReviewNow well move on to a class II receiver hitch. Well cover the weights on the sticker and cover a couple of differences on the receiver tube itself. You see here it says weight carrying ballmount that means the ballmount going into the receiver and the ball, that is what that means. You see here where it says weight distribution that is a separate device that allows you to carry heavier weights, that does not really apply to class II receiver hitches. Again by itself on the hitch its rated for 3500 pounds, that is the total weight. The tongue weight is listed at 300 pounds. On the details of the Class II hitch, there is not too many details on it compared to a class one. Basically all class II hitches have this ring that goes around the end of the tube. This is so at a quick glance you are working with a class II.
Class I Trailer Hitch  and Weight Capacities ReviewWere going to start off with this example here which is a class I hitch. Class I means this hitch is good for trailers up to 2000 pounds. What were going to show you over here is the sticker which shows the different weights and capacities involved. Well show you what those mean. As you can see by the sticker here, were going to show you some notes on it, these stickers will apply to any class hitch that you come across. Once you figure out what this means, you are home free. Starting here at max gross trailer weight which shows 2000 pounds. So that means the total weight you can pull with your trailer, for example if your load on your trailer is 500 pounds, you have 1500 pounds of weight to put on it so it remains at a safe capacity for this hitch. Moving on to this next number which is max gross tongue weight, it shows 200 pounds there.
How To Clean Weld NutsA common problem that we run into with a lot of our vehicles that have existing weld nuts in the bottom of the frame is that when you go to try to put a bolt in them you have an excessive amount of road grime or rust built  up in there and when you go to put your bolt inside the weld nuts you find not only does it not want to thread but it also appears that the bolt is too big for the weld nut.  The first thing that typically comes to mind is that the bolts that I received are too big and 99.9 percent of the time this is not the case.  What we have actually got here is an excessive amount of  rust and debris built up in the weld nuts that are preventing the bolt from starting.  We are going to show you how to get those thoroughly cleaned out so that we can not only get our bolt started but to  get it threaded completely into the weld nut.  00:41How to Make a Thread TapToday we are going to show you a cheat.  In some cases you are going to have a hitch that uses threaded holes in the bottom of the frame.  Those holes are going to be probably corroded up within a few years of the vehicle being on the road with dirt, grime, salt corrosion, you name it is probably in there inside the fine thread.  What you want to do is clean out the threads probably with an existing hitch bolt if it is lightly corroded and you can probably work it in and out a few times and do that.  00:20Drilling a Spare Tire Pan for a Trailer Hitch InstallationWhat we will do next is tighten this down just enough to snug it to hold it in place, and then we will see where to drill or holes out using the hitch as a template. We will use the hitch as a template to drill or holes, so we will just use a drill and let the hitch do the work for us, we will punch right through this thin metal with a half-inch bit.

Lowering Exhaust HangersAlright we will get started by lowering the exhaust. These rubber hangers here will need lubricant sprayed on them to make it easier to get them off.  Before we lower the exhaust we are actually going to put a safety strap underneath here so we can control the exhaust as we lower it.  See how we can control it.Weld Nut Removal and Replacement ReviewSo you are in the middle of doing your hitch installation and you are in the process of taking out one of your existing factory bolts. In the process you find that the bolt is not coming out due to the fact that the weld nut inside the frame has broken. We are just going to go ahead and show you a couple of things you can do to not only get the bolt out of the way but to also go ahead and continue on to be able to put your hitch in position without the weld nut welded inside the frame. The first thing that we obviously need to do is go ahead and get the bolt out of here. There are a couple of different ways you can do this. You can take a chisel, is you have one large and strong enough to do so, and possible grind the head of the bolt off. Or you can actually take a torch and torch it off. And that is actually what we are going to do on this application here. I am going to try to get most or as much of the head of the bolt off as I can. And we will take and push the remaining section of the bolt-weld nut combination up inside the frame. 0:49Handle Nut DemonstrationToday we are going to show you the proper operation of a handle nut. Basically, a lot of hitch installs will use this type of device here. You can manipulate this handle any way you want to, to run this nut into an area that has a tight fit. You can bend this at will, basically. Just take it like this and bend it, and then put another hook into it, and make a handle like that. And you can thread it into the frame, where you can actually run your bolt through the bottom of it. All right, and now we will go ahead actually and install this handle nut on a typical application.Drilling to Enlarge a Frame Hole for Hitch InstallOn this hitch we have to enlarge this hole to a half-inch and there is one on the opposite side we have to do the same thing with.
FAQ Trailer Hitch Exhaust RattleToday on our 2010 Lincoln MKX were going to address the exhaust rattle issue.  There are a couple of reasons for occasional contact between hitch and exhaust.  One, the manufacturers have loose tolerances from mounting the hangers that suspend exhaust systems.  Final placement of the exhaust can vary slightly from vehicle to vehicle.  The flexibility of rubber isolator connecting exhaust hanger to the vehicle frame allows for more movement of the exhaust system relative to other vehicle components.  An isolator can also stretch over time.Hitch Class Receiver Sizes FAQToday were going to go ahead and review the various classes of hitches starting from the smallest working our way up to the largest.Some good terms to know about receiver hitches. Tongue weight. Thats the amount of weight of the trailer thats pushing down on the hitch ball. Trailer weight will be a larger number and that will include the weight of your trailer plus whatever is on top of it or in it.When you get to two-inch receivers, you can use whats called Weight Distribution. Which this is a separate device that goes between the trailer hitch and the trailer. It takes tongue weight, picks it up and what it does it distributes that weight over the axles of the truck and the trailer.Trailer Hitch VideosBest 2017 BMW X5 Hitch OptionsCurt Trailer Hitch Installation - 2017 Mazda CX-9Trailer Hitch Installation - 2015 Jeep Wrangler UnlimitedTrailer Hitch Installation - 2017 Toyota Sienna - EcoHitchTrailer Hitch Installation - 2017 Toyota Highlander - Draw-TiteTrailer Hitch Installation - 2017 Toyota Sienna - CurtToday on our 2017 Toyota Sienna, we're going to be taking a look at and showing you how to install the Curt Class III custom fit trailer hitch receiver, part number C13105.

We have two hitches here today. On the top we have the Draw-Tite, part number 24852. On the bottom we have the CURT, part number C11002.	Now one of the biggest differences we found between our two hitches here today is when it comes to appearance. We found that the CURT hitch here looks the best of our two hitches when it's installed on our vehicle. One of the reasons for this is that the frame of the hitch here, being a round tubular design, really contours well to the curve on a rear fascia.Articles about Trailer HitchTrailer Hitch Installation TipsWhat Do I Need To Tow A Trailer?How to Choose the Right Trailer Hitch Class Trailer Hitch Types ReviewSpecialty Trailer Hitch ReviewTrailer Hitch Receiver SizesTips on How To Tow a TrailerTypes of BumpersRust PreventionTowing a Trailer with a Jeep WranglerHow to Clean Weld Nuts for the Installation of a Trailer HitchHow to Correct Noise from Exhaust Rattling Against a Trailer HitchDetermining Trailer Tongue WeightTrailer Hitch Questions and AnswersHow to Determine Correct Ball Mount Rise or Drop for Towing a Trailer with a 17 Inch Coupler HeightNormally trailer coupler height is around 17 inches, from the ground to the bottom of the coupler, and most hitch manufacturers design their hitches to work with a ball mount that will end up very close to this measurement.

This is a Class I hitch though and will require your bike rack to be Class I compatible.view full answer...Trailer Hitch for a 2017 Volkswagen Golf AlltrackThere are trailer hitches that will fit the 2017 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen of which the Alltrack is one of the options for that vehicle. The hitches available are all Class I hitches though ( # C11422 and # 24949 ) and as such are limited to 2 bikes maximum. In order to use a swinging bike rack you would need to have a Class III hitch with a 2 inch receiver. Even a Class II has a 1-1/4 inch receiver but it can hold more than 2 bikes unlike the Class I.

You mentioned a Subaru Outback....view full answer...Recommended Hitch with Best Ground Clearance for 2013 Honda OdysseyAs you can see by the photo I have edited for you, the Draw-Tite and Curt hitches available for your Odyssey are all pretty similarly designed. When we installed both hitches on a 2013 Odyssey, we found that the Curt # C13068 had about a 1/2 inch greater ground clearance (12-1/2 inches) versus 12 inches for the Draw-Tite # 75270 models.

The receiver of the Draw-Tite hitches are recessed a bit more under the vehicle, but neither of the hitches will extend past the bumper, and therefore...view full answer...Is There a Minimum Hitch Receiver-to-Ground Height Clearance Requirement for Trailer HitchesI am not aware of any legally mandated minimum ground clearance requirement for trailer hitch receivers in any states and my online research did not reveal any such laws. However, I did find on an internet forum for Sienna owners posts related to your exact concern: too little hitch receiver-to-ground clearance. This vehicle simply sits quite low to the ground.

Typically the various hitch receivers offered by the major manufacturers will tend to be of fairly similar proportions, which...view full answer...What Does GTW and TW Mean and What is Weight Distribution, 2008 BMW X5I can certainly help you out. The TW is the tongue weight. This is the weight of the trailer at the coupler that attaches to the ball mount on the trailer hitch. It should be 10 to 15 percent of the GTW or gross trailer weight. The gross trailer weight is the total weight of the trailer.

Weight distribution is a system that installs on the trailer frame and the trailer couples to a special shank on the trailer hitch. The spring bars that come with a weight distribution system take some...view full answer...How to Extend Trailer Safety Chains that are Too Short to Reach Loops in Hitch ReceiverIf you want to just add on some sort of extension you can use Safety Chain Quick Link # 49135 which has a working load limit of 3300-lbs. This will give you about 3-inches additional length.

Ideally trailer safety chains will be one continuous chain, without additional connection points or extenders. The best solution is to replace your safety chains with new ones of the appropriate rating and length, such as TowReady # TR63035 (sold as a single piece) which is 72-inches long and that...view full answer...Trailer Hitch Recommendation for a 2016 Honda PilotYes, the Curt Hitch part # C13146 that you referenced has been confirmed as a fit for your 2016 Honda Pilot so it would work well for you. I attached an install video for you to check out as well.

If you wanted to do some towing you might be interested in etrailer ball mount kit # 989900. It comes with 2 ball mounts; one with a 3/4 inch rise or 2 inch drop and one with a 2-3/4 inch rise or 4 inch drop. It also includes a 1-7/8 inch ball, 2 inch ball, hitch pin with clip, and a storage...view full answer...Purpose of Curt Stabilizing Strap # 18050In order to satisfy Curt warranty requirements, any of their Class I or II receivers (like the C11226 you referenced) as well as a few of their Class III hitches must be used with a stabilizing strap like part # 18050. This applies to any non-trailer loads like a bike rack or cargo carrier. Curt has this warranty provision because of the lower tongue weight capacities of Class I and II hitches. The strap prevents any bouncing of the bike rack or other hitch mounted accessory from damaging...view full answer...Class II and Class III Trailer Hitches for 2016 Toyota RAV4 HybridWe can offer you either a 1-1/4-inch Class II hitch # C12108 or a 2-inch Class III hitch # C13149 for your 2016 Toyota Rav4 Hybrid. These models, engineered primarily for the gas models, do also fit the hybrids. They do not fit the full electric versions. I confirmed this with my technical contact at Curt.

I recommend you go for the larger Class III hitch unless you have a specific need for a smaller 1-1/4-inch. A 2-inch Class III hitch will offer broader compatibility with a wide range...view full answer...Should I Use 2-Wheel Drive or 4-Wheel Drive While Towing in the MountainsYou should not tow your trailer on dry pavement with the vehicle in 4-wheel drive. For normal towing you should always use 2-wheel drive. The exceptions to this are extreme conditions such as snow covered or muddy roads that would normally require 4 wheel drive. Just remember that if you would use 4-wheel drive without the trailer then you should use it with the trailer.

In the mountains, if you are descending on a 4-wheel drive trail then 4-wheel drive low would be recommended to save...view full answer...

Now the Draw-Tite hitch has this plate that's welded on the top of the frame of the hitch and the receiver itself. You can see how the plate sticks out well past the fascia and there's this large gap in between the hitch and the fascia itself and that takes away from the clean looks of the Cross Tour, I believe.	Now the Draw-Tite hitch, if you notice this gap, is fairly large and the hitch actually sticks out pretty far past the fascia.

The Draw-Tite has this tab here where you can mount your towing harness for like your four-pole flat or your seven-way round RV connector, whereas the Curt does not have that. The Draw-Tite also will stick out a little bit further than the Curt does, so if you need to have a little bit more clearance for your hitch mounted accessories such as your bike rack or your ball mount, or your cargo carrier this would be a better one to choose for that just because the fact that the hitch pinhole will actually stick out a little bit further.	If you're looking for something that has a more of a hidden appeal the Curt's tucked up more underneath and has less sticking out.

Trailer Hitch Information VideosHow To Tow a TrailerToday we are going to review the components needed to pull a trailer.  Basically, this video is designed for somebody who just decided they have a need for a trailer, so we will cover all the components in the most basic form, so you know exactly how to update your vehicle.  What we are going to do is start from the truck and work our way back to the trailer.  First off, we are going to show you the hitch itself.  All vehicles require a hitch to pull a trailer.  What this device does is makes an attaching point on the frame of the vehicle, or body components, and transmits the forces from the trailer to this one point here.  This point here is the receiver part.  Consequently this hitch is called a receiver hitch because this  hitch can receive a draw bar, or also called a ball mount.  It is held in place by this pin which we just ed, and this clip holds it in place.  There are more fancier pins, like locking pins, but that is the basic thing you need right there to get the job done.  1:12Cleaning Weld Nuts for Trailer Hitch InstallationOkay as you can see here on the drivers side, our weld nut has a lot of corrosion built up in there.  And when we try to install our 10 millimeter bolt is not wanting to start  at all, in fact it almost seems like the bolt is too big for the weld nut.  It is a common misconception, again when the weld nuts got a lot of build up in there.
Class III Trailer Hitch and Weight Capacities ReviewTraditionally a class III receiver hitch is good for trailers up to 5000 pounds and 500 pounds tongue weight. There are a few different variances from that, well show you that here in a second. Again were going to start with the stickers and show you the differences, as you can see here the max gross trailer weight is 5000 pounds as we discussed. The tongue weight looks to be 500 pounds, again about 10percent of your trailer weight. On the other side of the class III you will see a sticker for weight distribution. That is a specification when you use a device that goes in between the truck and the trailer that takes up the tongue weight. What it does is distributes the weight between the truck and the trailer and allows you to carry a heavier weight. As far as a class III hitch is concerned, that increases the rating the hitch can handle.
Lowering Exhaust Example for Trailer Hitch InstallationThe first step to do is to lower the exhaust and we will do that by taking off the rubber hangers on the front and back, and there is one hidden in the back. 
Class II Trailer Hitch and Weight Capacities ReviewNow well move on to a class II receiver hitch. Well cover the weights on the sticker and cover a couple of differences on the receiver tube itself. You see here it says weight carrying ballmount that means the ballmount going into the receiver and the ball, that is what that means. You see here where it says weight distribution that is a separate device that allows you to carry heavier weights, that does not really apply to class II receiver hitches. Again by itself on the hitch its rated for 3500 pounds, that is the total weight. The tongue weight is listed at 300 pounds. On the details of the Class II hitch, there is not too many details on it compared to a class one. Basically all class II hitches have this ring that goes around the end of the tube. This is so at a quick glance you are working with a class II.
Class I Trailer Hitch  and Weight Capacities ReviewWere going to start off with this example here which is a class I hitch. Class I means this hitch is good for trailers up to 2000 pounds. What were going to show you over here is the sticker which shows the different weights and capacities involved. Well show you what those mean. As you can see by the sticker here, were going to show you some notes on it, these stickers will apply to any class hitch that you come across. Once you figure out what this means, you are home free. Starting here at max gross trailer weight which shows 2000 pounds. So that means the total weight you can pull with your trailer, for example if your load on your trailer is 500 pounds, you have 1500 pounds of weight to put on it so it remains at a safe capacity for this hitch. Moving on to this next number which is max gross tongue weight, it shows 200 pounds there.
How To Clean Weld NutsA common problem that we run into with a lot of our vehicles that have existing weld nuts in the bottom of the frame is that when you go to try to put a bolt in them you have an excessive amount of road grime or rust built  up in there and when you go to put your bolt inside the weld nuts you find not only does it not want to thread but it also appears that the bolt is too big for the weld nut.  The first thing that typically comes to mind is that the bolts that I received are too big and 99.9 percent of the time this is not the case.  What we have actually got here is an excessive amount of  rust and debris built up in the weld nuts that are preventing the bolt from starting.  We are going to show you how to get those thoroughly cleaned out so that we can not only get our bolt started but to  get it threaded completely into the weld nut.  00:41How to Make a Thread TapToday we are going to show you a cheat.  In some cases you are going to have a hitch that uses threaded holes in the bottom of the frame.  Those holes are going to be probably corroded up within a few years of the vehicle being on the road with dirt, grime, salt corrosion, you name it is probably in there inside the fine thread.  What you want to do is clean out the threads probably with an existing hitch bolt if it is lightly corroded and you can probably work it in and out a few times and do that.  00:20Drilling a Spare Tire Pan for a Trailer Hitch InstallationWhat we will do next is tighten this down just enough to snug it to hold it in place, and then we will see where to drill or holes out using the hitch as a template. We will use the hitch as a template to drill or holes, so we will just use a drill and let the hitch do the work for us, we will punch right through this thin metal with a half-inch bit.

Lowering Exhaust HangersAlright we will get started by lowering the exhaust. These rubber hangers here will need lubricant sprayed on them to make it easier to get them off.  Before we lower the exhaust we are actually going to put a safety strap underneath here so we can control the exhaust as we lower it.  See how we can control it.Weld Nut Removal and Replacement ReviewSo you are in the middle of doing your hitch installation and you are in the process of taking out one of your existing factory bolts. In the process you find that the bolt is not coming out due to the fact that the weld nut inside the frame has broken. We are just going to go ahead and show you a couple of things you can do to not only get the bolt out of the way but to also go ahead and continue on to be able to put your hitch in position without the weld nut welded inside the frame. The first thing that we obviously need to do is go ahead and get the bolt out of here. There are a couple of different ways you can do this. You can take a chisel, is you have one large and strong enough to do so, and possible grind the head of the bolt off. Or you can actually take a torch and torch it off. And that is actually what we are going to do on this application here. I am going to try to get most or as much of the head of the bolt off as I can. And we will take and push the remaining section of the bolt-weld nut combination up inside the frame. 0:49Handle Nut DemonstrationToday we are going to show you the proper operation of a handle nut. Basically, a lot of hitch installs will use this type of device here. You can manipulate this handle any way you want to, to run this nut into an area that has a tight fit. You can bend this at will, basically. Just take it like this and bend it, and then put another hook into it, and make a handle like that. And you can thread it into the frame, where you can actually run your bolt through the bottom of it. All right, and now we will go ahead actually and install this handle nut on a typical application.Drilling to Enlarge a Frame Hole for Hitch InstallOn this hitch we have to enlarge this hole to a half-inch and there is one on the opposite side we have to do the same thing with.
FAQ Trailer Hitch Exhaust RattleToday on our 2010 Lincoln MKX were going to address the exhaust rattle issue.  There are a couple of reasons for occasional contact between hitch and exhaust.  One, the manufacturers have loose tolerances from mounting the hangers that suspend exhaust systems.  Final placement of the exhaust can vary slightly from vehicle to vehicle.  The flexibility of rubber isolator connecting exhaust hanger to the vehicle frame allows for more movement of the exhaust system relative to other vehicle components.  An isolator can also stretch over time.Hitch Class Receiver Sizes FAQToday were going to go ahead and review the various classes of hitches starting from the smallest working our way up to the largest.Some good terms to know about receiver hitches. Tongue weight. Thats the amount of weight of the trailer thats pushing down on the hitch ball. Trailer weight will be a larger number and that will include the weight of your trailer plus whatever is on top of it or in it.When you get to two-inch receivers, you can use whats called Weight Distribution. Which this is a separate device that goes between the trailer hitch and the trailer. It takes tongue weight, picks it up and what it does it distributes that weight over the axles of the truck and the trailer.Trailer Hitch VideosBest 2017 BMW X5 Hitch OptionsCurt Trailer Hitch Installation - 2017 Mazda CX-9Trailer Hitch Installation - 2015 Jeep Wrangler UnlimitedTrailer Hitch Installation - 2017 Toyota Sienna - EcoHitchTrailer Hitch Installation - 2017 Toyota Highlander - Draw-TiteTrailer Hitch Installation - 2017 Toyota Sienna - CurtToday on our 2017 Toyota Sienna, we're going to be taking a look at and showing you how to install the Curt Class III custom fit trailer hitch receiver, part number C13105.

We have two hitches here today. On the top we have the Draw-Tite, part number 24852. On the bottom we have the CURT, part number C11002.	Now one of the biggest differences we found between our two hitches here today is when it comes to appearance. We found that the CURT hitch here looks the best of our two hitches when it's installed on our vehicle. One of the reasons for this is that the frame of the hitch here, being a round tubular design, really contours well to the curve on a rear fascia.Articles about Trailer HitchTrailer Hitch Installation TipsWhat Do I Need To Tow A Trailer?How to Choose the Right Trailer Hitch Class Trailer Hitch Types ReviewSpecialty Trailer Hitch ReviewTrailer Hitch Receiver SizesTips on How To Tow a TrailerTypes of BumpersRust PreventionTowing a Trailer with a Jeep WranglerHow to Clean Weld Nuts for the Installation of a Trailer HitchHow to Correct Noise from Exhaust Rattling Against a Trailer HitchDetermining Trailer Tongue WeightTrailer Hitch Questions and AnswersHow to Determine Correct Ball Mount Rise or Drop for Towing a Trailer with a 17 Inch Coupler HeightNormally trailer coupler height is around 17 inches, from the ground to the bottom of the coupler, and most hitch manufacturers design their hitches to work with a ball mount that will end up very close to this measurement. I am including a link to an instruction page detailing how to measure for the correct ball mount and how to measure the ball mount.

The reason is that the adapter places the carrier farther away from the rear of the vehicle and hitch, creating additional torque that 1-1/4 inch hitches, especially Class I hitches, are not designed to handle.

For this reason all 1-1/4 to 2 inch hitch adapters decrease the hitch or vehicle tongue weight capacity, whichever is lowest, by 50 percent, making a class one hitch only...view full answer...Trailer Hitch and Wiring for a 2017 Honda Pilot without Factory Tow PackageYes, Draw-Tite trailer hitch # 75225 will fit your 2017 Honda Pilot.

If you subtract the gross vehicle weight rating of 7,200 pounds then the max you can tow will either be 6,200 pounds or 8,300 pounds.

The hitches available are all Class I hitches though ( # C11422 and # 24949 ) and as such are limited to 2 bikes maximum. In order to use a swinging bike rack you would need to have a Class III hitch with a 2 inch receiver. Even a Class II has a 1-1/4 inch receiver but it can hold more than 2 bikes unlike the Class I.

Ideally trailer safety chains will be one continuous chain, without additional connection points or extenders.

Now the Draw-Tite hitch has this plate that's welded on the top of the frame of the hitch and the receiver itself. You can see how the plate sticks out well past the fascia and there's this large gap in between the hitch and the fascia itself and that takes away from the clean looks of the Cross Tour, I believe.	Now the Draw-Tite hitch, if you notice this gap, is fairly large and the hitch actually sticks out pretty far past the fascia.

The Draw-Tite has this tab here where you can mount your towing harness for like your four-pole flat or your seven-way round RV connector, whereas the Curt does not have that. The Draw-Tite also will stick out a little bit further than the Curt does, so if you need to have a little bit more clearance for your hitch mounted accessories such as your bike rack or your ball mount, or your cargo carrier this would be a better one to choose for that just because the fact that the hitch pinhole will actually stick out a little bit further.	If you're looking for something that has a more of a hidden appeal the Curt's tucked up more underneath and has less sticking out.
