Insurance sounds boring and dreary to most people. Not for us at Martin, Bryan D, however. While it is a serious business, we do not see insurance as boring - it is after all the business of keeping people in their homes, from going out of business and getting back on the road – essentially helping people lead normal lives and recover from disaster. This is interesting stuff! We are partnered with the right insurance carrier/s, people we have been doing business with for years. This enables us to comparison shop and gets you (our client) the best deal available. And the best deal is not always about price – but, hey – price is a big factor and we will never stop fighting to get you the best price. We help our clients with all kinds of insurance, but here are the main insurance types our agency focuses on -

Auto insurance – do you know what coverage you have? Most of our clients gloss over when we start talking liability, collision, comprehensive insurance coverages. And why do the limits have to be different based on your specific needs? Rest assured, we understand what is needed to operate a vehicle in and around San Francisco, CA and will handle all the details for you.
Business Insurance – own or operate a business? Do you need insurance before you can execute on a job/contract? Not sure what type of insurance you need? Do you just need the minimum or are you thinking about future exposure to lawsuits and injury claims? Our commercial insurance agents are standing by to help you get the right policy to help your business succeed.
Homeowners insurance – who knows where the value lies in an insurance policy when it comes to something as local-specific as insurance for a structure, building, home in a specific location – your local insurance agent – that’s who! Let us showcase our knowledge of the area in and around San Francisco, CA. You will be confident that you found the best local partner for your insurance needs.

Current Research and Methods of Harnessing Wave and Tidal Power Cost Analysis Formation of Currents Diagrams Cited Sources Any Questions? Thermohaline Circulation http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LJpBnxzG30 Wave Energy Buoy The deep ocean currents are affected by the density of the ocean water.  The colder the water is the more dense it gets.  As the density increases, the water starts to sink and surface water is pulled in to replace the water that sank. The Ocean Sentinel is used to develop wave energy technology, measure and understand the waves as an energy resource, and study the energy outputThese will cost around $1.5 million US dollars The Oyster system uses a simple on-shore base and the system is capable of operating at small depths, making it more accurate than far out at sea systems. Each system is capable of providing energy for 3,000 homesThese systems are fairly new so there is not a set price as of right now Some current research and methods of harnessing wave and tidal power include using push plates, the Ocean Sentinel, and using the 'Oyster' system. How these push plates work are they are connected with a chain. The water flow pushes plate A and when Plate A reaches point X, plate B (that is also connected with the same chain) happens to reach point Y.  At point Y, the kinetic energy of the water flow works upon plate B to push it forward and with the placement of size and location appropriate gears, they can spin the shaft of a generator to produce clean energy.There was no set price because the company is still in a prototype stage.
