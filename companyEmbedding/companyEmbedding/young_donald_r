While at Wilson he worked on the design and construction of two projects on the Oracle Campus in Redwood Shores.  He also oversaw the development of Gap, Inc.’s corporate headquarters in San Francisco and their award winning 901 Cherry, a pioneering project in sustainable design located in San Bruno. Mr. Reagan was involved in the historic rehabilitation of a National Historic Landmark in San Francisco - The Ferry Building.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Young, Donald R, CPA15942 Conneaut Lake RdMeadville, PA 16335(814) 336-1512Accountants-Certified PublicBookkeepingWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Donald R Young Certified Public Accountant15942 Conneaut Lake RdMeadville, PA 16335(814) 336-1512Accountants-Certified PublicBusinesses in related categories to Accountants-Certified PublicAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Kreider And Company LLC1211 Park AveMeadville, PA 16335(814) 336-1193Accountants-Certified PublicWebsiteDirectionsServicesMore InfoMake an AppointmentFrom Business: We currently have eight CPAs, professionals and support staff employed in our Meadville office and currently serves clients not only in the estate of Pennsylvania…Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collectionPREFERRED4. McGill Power Bell & Associates LLP623 State StMeadville, PA 16335(814) 724-5890Accountants-Certified PublicWebsiteDirectionsServicesMore InfoFrom Business: McGill, Power Bell & Associates (MPB) is a regional certified public accounting firm with offices in Meadville and Erie, PA.
