TCI’s Powers Hires COO, Three Analysts For New Hedge Fund
Sep 21 2011  |  2:31am ET

The Children’s Investment Fund veteran Stuart Powers is building up his new firm’s team in advance of the launch of its maiden hedge fund.
Powers has hired four partners for his new London-based firm, Hengistbury Investment Partners. Jon Sharp, a former chief operating officer and CFO at hedge fund Urwick Capital, has joined as COO of the new operation from Barclays Capital, Financial News reports. At Barclays, Sharp worked in prime services origination.
Hengistbury also now boasts a team of three senior analysts: David Fairweather, Daragh Horgan and Angelo Putignano. Fairweather joins from Richmond Capital and Horgan from Powe Capital, while Putignano comes over from Lansdowne Partners. Fairweather and Horgan formerly worked with Powers at Cazenove Capital.
Hengistbury’s maiden fund is set to launch on Jan. 1. The vehicle will employ a global long/short equity strategy, with about 20 long positions and half as many shorts. Hengistbury will focus on undervalued franchise companies and will have an initial capacity of between US$600 million and US$700 million.
Powers left TCI in January. A partner at the famed activist hedge fund, he was a top analyst and is the latest former TCI partner to go it alone, following former TCI founding partner Patrick Degorce, who founded Thélème Partners, and former TCI Asia chief John Ho, who founded Janchor Partners.
