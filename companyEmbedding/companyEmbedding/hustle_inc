Why Licensing Products is the Ultimate Side Hustle

He is the co-founder of InventRight, a company that teaches people how to license their ideas, and the author of One Simple Idea: Turn Your Dreams Into a Licensing Goldmine While Letting Others Do the Work.

Looking back, when I started teaching people how to bring their ideas to market without starting a business, I had no idea where it would lead. I just saw a need I could meet. At the inventors groups I attended, I was surprised to discover that most people were failing. They had built expensive works-like looks-like prototypes and filed non-provisional patent applications, but their ideas weren't any closer to retail. At that point, I had been licensing my ideas for products and collecting royalties in return for many years. After reflecting on my success, I broke my strategy down into ten simple steps and created an educational program with my business partner Andrew Krauss.
If I could do this -- with absolutely no formal training and few skills to speak of -- so could anyone, we reasoned. And we were right.
Tim Ferriss, who would go on to write the bestselling 4-Hour Workweek and inspire an entire generation to conceive of their lives differently, was one of our first students.
At the time, I wasn't quite sure what to make of his intense interest. Now I get it.
Ferriss was fascinated by my methods because I had essentially hacked a system. I had broken the mold. I had found a way to bring my ideas to market without starting a business, building perfect prototypes, or filing costly patents.
How? By making simple improvements to existing products and showing those improvements to companies that manufactured similar goods. What did they think? I wanted to know, and quickly. That's what selling my ideas on the street at art fairs and festivals had taught me.
The truth about the companies you buy products from? They need our ideas. They want to hear from us. Open innovation is thriving globally across a swath of industries because it makes good business sense.
In fact nearly all of the companies I interviewed at Toy Fair in New York City and the International Home + Housewares show in Chicago this year agreed. The time and effort it takes to sort through outside submissions from everyday people and product developers who don't work for them is worth it, because that's where their next great idea might come from. Why not look?
Modern technologies have made licensing ideas easier than when I got started. Today, I think product licensing is the ultimate side hustle actually. Why? Because licensing is your ticket to playing the biggest game in the world! All without the financial risk of starting a business, but the same rush of adrenaline, excitement, and uncertainty that accompany launching any new product. Think about it.
Am I a little biased? Sure. Consumer products have always captivated me. The same goes for the concept of passive income. But how can you argue with the following facts?
1. You don't have to quit your day job to succeed at it -- at least not at first anyway. Are you satisfied working for someone else from 9 to 5? If you have dreams and aspirations that are not being met and love being creative, you should consider licensing as a business model. It enables you to leverage the power of large companies to get to market very quickly.
Essentially, you are getting large companies working for you. That may sound overblown, but it's true. If your licensee is using their marketing, administration, manufacturing and sales people to sell your product and pay you royalties, they are in essence working for you! How cool is that?
My students are able to license their ideas by working in the morning, at lunch, in the evening, and on the weekends.
2. It emphasizes speed to market. In this day and age, speed to market is more important than ever. It's really one of the only ways to head off copycats at the pass. If you partner with a large company that has a great distribution, retailers won't stock me-too products that compete with yours.
As a strategy, licensing is all about opening up a dialogue and getting the critical feedback you need to refine your concept into the most marketable product possible. If you innovate alone in a vacuum, you could find yourself wasting years on an idea that ultimately goes nowhere. It happens all the time, unfortunately.
3. It requires little to no financial risk. You can license a simple idea using a sell sheet and perceived ownership. In others words, you don't need to raise a lot of money to get started, let alone mortgage your home. Benefits are what motivate companies to license an idea. Not prototypes. Not patents.
4. You can work when you want to. Most of us want more flexibility out of our workweek. With licensing, that's possible. You can study a market, stimulate your creativity, communicate with freelancers from around the world, and contact companies over LinkedIn during any time of the day. How cool is that?
I asked David Fedewa, who recently received a hefty royalty check from one of his licensed products, why he's so passionate about the licensing lifestyle. (Full disclosure: Before he became inventRight's Advanced Negotiations coach, Fedewa was my student.) Royalties are typically paid quarterly, but per his agreement, Fedewa received an annual check for this product.
"When my side hustle started paying my mortgage, it changed my life!" he exclaimed. "Developing products and working hard is finally paying off in a way I could not have imagined."
With other side hustles, Fedewa said, typically the more time you spend at them, the more money you make. There's a direct relationship between time and money, in other words.
"As far as licensing is concerned, that's just not the case. If you're smart, have a decent idea, and can consistently execute, the ratio between the time you put in and what you get paid is not in balance. Granted, it takes to time to learn how to do this. But once you know how to get your product to the right people in the right way, it won't take you much time at all," Fedewa said. "The possibilities are endless!"
It's actually best to do this when you have a day job, and not as a full-time business, he emphasized.
Historically, the go-to-market model taught at the university level and elsewhere is to start a business. Thankfully, that's changing.
Not everyone has the money, skill, time, or even the desire to start a business. Which is fine! More than fine actually, because licensing is a fantastic alternative.
You can still marvel at the joy of seeing your dream come to life on store shelves. So, what are you waiting for? It's time to get your side hustle on.
For more on licensing as a side hustle, listen to my interview with Nick Loper on his excellent podcast Side Hustle Nation.

Coach’s Corner

About Coach Tony Ballard
Coach Tony Ballard is a guy who knew in high school that one day he would become a coach, a teacher, and motivator for kids playing the Quarterback position. He learned the true meaning of working hard from Henry “SHAKE” Washington and Clarence Higdon.  He also discovered a simple fact – Failure Is Not An Option!!
Coach Ballard attended Florida A&M University where he learned the Quarterback position by playing and studying the fundamental techniques that make a Quarterback GREAT! He truly believes you must be a student of the game first, so that you can be a master at it later.
Tony was the first head coach with the New Tampa Wildcats to win a National Championship. This is where he began to have an eye for recognizing Quarterback talent in the Tampa Bay area and when he began training young Quarterbacks. After years of experience working with Quarterbacks at all levels, he started “HUSTLE INC QUARTERBACKS CLINIC ACADEMY”.
Over the past 15 years, Coach Ballard has helped develop hundreds of Quarterbacks from refining their technique in the position to teaching them the value of being a leader on the field and in the classroom. Coach Ballard’s attention to detail, knowledge of the game, and the ability to translate complex techniques into an easily recognizable language separates him from the rest!
He participated at the 2013 Eastbay All American Game as Offensive Coordinator and Quarterback Coach on 4 state championship Teams. He also has coached 2 high school All American Quarterbacks.
Coach Ballard is an active member of the 2012 “FBU” FOOTBALL UNIVERSITY Quarterback coaching staff. In 2011, he was a member in FBU Top Gun Camp Quarterback coaching staff where the top players at their position from across the country showcased their talents.
Coach Ballard currently serves as the Lead Quarterback coach for Star Training Academy. In addition, he consults for several Georgia High School Football Teams and is Quarterback Coach at CES Performance in Duluth, GA, the place where Pro Athlete’s train in the off season and College Quarterbacks train for NFL combine and Pro Day!!
In all of his accomplishments, what Coach Ballard appreciates most is the development of his students off the field by becoming mature and responsible young men.

 Logan Byrd, Class of 2016 


Here’s a great new video about Logan Byrd:




 Kevin Johnson, JMU Recruit 







 


If Pace Academy quarterback Kevin Johnson is as good as those around him say, JMU could have struck gold with the small-framed signal caller. “James Madison needs to realize they’re getting a steal,” Johnson’s quarterback coach Tony Ballard said last week. “If he was a 6-2, 6-3 kid, he’d be in the top 10 in the country.” Johnson is a three-star recruit according to Rivals and ESPN and is looking to continue the college football tradition that his father started at South Carolina. JMU is very excited to have a potential All American playing for new Coach Everett Withers. Read more…




 Golden Arm Invitational 







 


Invitation Only! The Golden Arm Invitational is for high school quarterback underclassmen. This event is the complete quarterback experience. All participants and staff will collectively do a community service effort on April 4th. We are excited to have the opportunity.

Kilton Anderson
Player
“I met QB Coach Ballard at an FBU camp in tenth grade. It was my first camp and I had no idea if I had the talent to play QB at the high school level. Coach Ballard told me I had all the raw talent and all I had to do was to develop it. I was awarded the camp Offensive MVP. During the evaluation after the camp Coach Ballard told me I needed to relax and just go with it. ‘When your swimming and you get tired, you don’t panic or you drown,’ he said. ‘You just keep paddling. That’s what you do- just keep swimming.’ I have heard those words repeat through my head for four years. Especially when things were critical. Those words have kept me calm and helped me to reach the next level. Coach Ballard identified, early on, what I would hear over the years and more or less master. Wow Coach Ballard. You are a blessing in my life and you have so much integrity and intelligence. Thank you for all of your support. You are honestly one in a million. I am blessed to have had our paths cross – Thank you Coach Ballard.”

“I really like how Coach Tony will push me on and off the practice field to reach my potential. I have learned and grown so much in the physical and mental aspects of the QB position during the past 4 years under Coach Tony. He has been by my side during all my college recruiting ups and downs, listening and helping me make decisions. Coach Tony will keep it real with his “Man, It is what it is!” I am thankful we met at a camp 4 years ago. I’ve been able to pursue my dream of being a College QB at the D1 level with his help.”

Hillery & Cynthia Douglas
Parent of Current QB Student
“Tony Ballard and Hustle Inc. have been an integral part of our family since the summer of 2006. That’s when Tony became the QB coach to our son, J.P. While Tony did not have the “Big Name” that most people get caught up on, it only took watching 20 minutes of his workout with J.P. to realize what he did have was an intricate knowledge of the QB position and the ability to teach sound mechanics in a systematic way. Tony’s secret is very simple, he drills the basics. “
“Tony has the skills and talent to instruct at all levels of ability. As a result, Tony has successfully transitioned J.P. from an 8th grade middle school QB to now playing QB at the collegiate level. Tony’s instruction was invaluable in giving J.P. the powerful mechanics and competitive edge to garner a full scholarship to Southern University in Louisiana where he was starting QB as a true freshman. Tony’s expertise has helped our son develop QB skills and leadership skills that will be with him for life.”




Mike Byrd
Parent of Current QB Student (4 years )
“If your son has the drive and desire to be a QB in middle school, high school, and potentially playing at the collegiate level, do not hesitate in making the investment to have your son work with Coach Ballard. It will be time and money well spent” . . . read more


Mike Byrd
Parent of current QB student (4 years )
“If your son has the drive and desire to be a QB in middle school, high school, and potentially playing at the collegiate level, do not hesitate in making the investment to have your son work with Coach Ballard. It will be time and money well spent, and a friendship and trusted Mentor your son will have for life. After 4 years, Tony is family, and we as parents trust him, and we trust him with our son.
Tony has traveled with Logan to college campuses, to summer camps, visited with collegiate coaches, and has used his network of contacts in the football community to further our son’s opportunities. And at this point in our “Business relationship” this is the “fun” stuff to share and experience with our son and family. Tony is committed to the success of his Quarterbacks, supporting and seeking opportunities for all his students. He really cares about their development. Coach Tony (Ballard) will “keep it real” with his parents and QB’s about their development and potential. He will keep your son well grounded and focused on what will carry your son to the next level and set him apart from all the competition, “his talent/skill set on the field and his football I.Q. in the classroom.”

I would highly recommend Tony Ballard and believe him to be among the select elite quarterback coaches in the country.”
