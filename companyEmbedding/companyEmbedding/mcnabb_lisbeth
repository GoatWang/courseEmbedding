            Secrets from Dallas’ serial entrepreneurs        


Lisbeth McNabb loves the start-up phase.

Lisbeth McNabb admits it. She’s not the type to start a business and stick around for years waiting for the thing to sell or go public.
McNabb, 52, loves the start-up phase, the rush where an idea gets hatched, a team gets built and a fledgling business takes root.

“I don’t want to do the stabilizing work around years four through 10,” she says.
Instead, she’d rather walk away and move on to the next thing. “My value creation is in spurts of two years.”
That modus operandi is what McNabb was following in mid-February with the launch of DigiWorks, a supplier of software that helps companies keep track of all the various times customers talk to or about them online, along with helping predict what products or services those clients might need in the future based on what they’ve told the company thus far.
She left her last startup, w2wlink.com, in the first quarter of 2012, although she remains on the board. That concern provides an online forum where corporate women can go for advice from both from experts and their peers on everything from changing jobs to balancing work and home life.
Although McNabb serves on the boards of North Texas companies like Tandy Brands and Nexstar Broadcasting and has worked at big businesses like AT&T, JPMorgan Chase, American Airlines and Frito-Lay, she holds w2wlink up as her biggest achievement. Founded in the dark economic days of March 2007, when funding was scarce and fear was rampant, w2wlink has grown to more than 15,000 registered users, she says. “It continues to have powerful feedback from women, entrepreneurs and men who see the value proposition,” she said.
McNabb manages to balance her drive to succeed with a good personal manner, according to Marc Montoya, senior vice president, eMedia, at Nexstar Broadcasting.




 


Montoya was a business-development vice president at Match.com while McNabb was that dating website’s chief financial officer in the middle of the last decade. He says she plays by the Golden Rule.

“She is big into the karma thing. She always wants to help her people succeed,” Montoya said. “She’s the right person you want on your team. I would work for her, or with her, any time, any place. That’s how much I think of the woman.”
TIMELINE:
Age: 52
• 1982-1995: Worked in early-stage units of companies like AT&T and Frito-Lay.
• 1999: Sodexo Education, outsourcing of food service and related facilities: Still operating, McNabb was an operating and finance executive.
• 2005: Match.com, online dating site: Still operating, McNabb was finance and revenue chief.
• 2007: w2wlink, online community for professional women: Still operating, run by a team that McNabb assembled. McNabb is majority owner.
• 2013: DigiWorks, software and services to help large companies talk to their customers: Still operating with McNabb as CEO and majority owner. Launched from “stealth mode” this month.

Someone has purchased your product or service. A one-time sale is the first step, but repeat sales are a more meaningful revenue stream. So how can you drive repeat business for your products or services?
The answer is that you already have all the information you need to translate one sale into many. You just need to understand what to do with it. This is very much the theme surrounding Big Data this year: It's not enough to have it; but rather you need to know how to drive revenue from it. We are in the midst of a transition where Big Data is moving over to the marketing suite as chief marketing officers are looking to drive revenue generation from Big Data as quickly as possible.
So how can you look at your customer patterns to increase second-time sales?
Related: Marketing Must: Customer Data Points to Stop Ignoring -- Now
Here are the three critical ways to get started:
1. Know your customer. The basic information is in your transactional history. You have a name, address and specific intel on what this individual wants or needs to buy. Big data analytics blows out a simple transaction by showing not just how much customers have spent, but what they spent it on. That knowledge will likely inform their next purchase if you analyze the first one. Was the purchase an anomaly or part of a behavior pattern? Is this a first-time purchase or is there a history you were unaware of?
All your customers’ interactions with your business -- whether through your website or in person, on the phone or through social media --  provide you with data to learn more about each of them. What tools are they using to learn about your business? What is an individual customer’s preference for how he or she makes a purchase: mobile device or tablet, in the store or through the website?
Once you know everything there is to know about your customers, you’ll better know how to engage with them.
Related: Why Spending on Big Data Isn't a Waste (Infographic) 
2. Build loyalty by listening to your customer. Big Data lets you know how to most effectively engage with your customer and build a relationship over time as you learn what he or she likes and dislikes. Social media provides opportunities for web engagement through conversations in which an unlimited number of potential and actual customers can participate. Connecting with your customers via your Twitter feed or Facebook page allows them to tell you what they are thinking -- and allows you to use that information to tweak your product offering or even expand your target market. It’s a chief marketin officer's dream come true.
Each data point tells you something valuable about your customers’ purchasing habits. Leverage client engagement into a source for Big Data through social media interactions. Distributing a coupon or other offer through social media tells you far more than if your customers are clipping newspaper coupons.
3. Deliver the right offer to the right person at the right time. Customers are more likely to buy something that is targeted directly to them right before they need it. For example, before Mother’s Day let Big Data analysis tell you who sends what kinds of gifts to their mothers or mothers-in-law and present those individuals an incentive to buy.   
One of our clients, World Kitchen, deployed this strategy around the time of the Super Bowl. While the Super Bowl is a huge social event, it looks different to a man in his 20s having over some friends from work than to a 40-year-old woman with a family. After we helped World Kitchen capture individual consumer preferences, the company is now better able to drive second-time sales inside their ecommerce and email campaigns in the spring.
Where else can you capture the data you need to drive repeat sales? Sources include web server logs and internet clickstream data, third party data and even information captured by sensors when customers check out in brick-and-mortar stores.

Lisbeth McNabb’s enthusiasm for professional women’s development and online community networks led her to create w2wlink.com, an online community for career-focused women hoping to enhance their professional paths and work-life balance. 
Though she founded the business just a year ago, McNabb is no stranger to the online world. As CFO and strategist at Match.com, she not only conducted research on women online, but also helped the Dallas company increase its profit and market share. Other companies on her résumé include Frito-Lay and Sodexho Marriott, where she also formed women’s networking groups. 
As if running a company weren’t enough, McNabb stays busy additionally as a director of Nexstar Broadcasting. She travels the country speaking to women’s networking groups as well. And, if you haven’t been able to catch her speak in public, no worries; she also writes her own blog.
Age: 47
Title/Company: CEO/w2wlink.com 
   Tenure: 1 year
What was your first job? Cleaning up the dinner plates with my sister. I then progressed to clean the bathroom sinks while she dusted. As one of four kids, we all did our part. 
  What was your worst job? I made it one week at McDonald’s. The former military officer-turned-franchisee corrected my grammar. I said, ‘Can I help you?’ and he corrected me in front of my customers. I still remember thinking, ‘You cannot treat me this way.’  
If you couldn’t say “the people I work with,” what would you say is the best part of your job?  That I get to wear so many hats. Also, blending the vision-shaping with getting a short list of priorities done each day and week.
What’s the worst part? Having so many more opportunities and doors opening than we have the team and resources for. It’s the reality of a successful early-stage company, and the right problem to have.
On weekends, where would people find you?  In my backyard with my boys and dogs; we have a new rescue pug. Also, at baseball games rooting louder than either son likes. 
What book is currently on your nightstand? The Four Steps to the Epiphany by Steven Blank, and Lionel Shriver’s The Post-Birthday World. I like reading fiction and nonfiction.
What’s your favorite TV show? The View. I love the mix of personality styles and range of topics from business, media, and politics to parenting values. I wish I were spending more time discussing these issues in my living room.
What web sites do you visit most frequently? I look at w2wlink.com every day.  Stumbledupon.com shows me trends, The New York Times for daily news, and FrontBurner for local restaurants.
What is your greatest strength? My drive and passion for business and learning.  
What do you consider to be your biggest weakness? Clearly impatience, but also my fast pace and high energy. Although it does a lot of good, many times I run through situations and people, missing the fun and connections.
What’s the best advice anyone ever told you? Go sell first. A professor who focused on sales and sales management at the University of Nebraska encouraged me to go sell into a channel and work my way over to marketing. 
Why did you start this site? My vision of the market opportunity, my strengths in strategy and operational startup, and my passion to support women’s growth and find win-wins with business partners.

Big Data. Social media. Mobile.They're not just buzz words anymore. Digital strategies are an integral part of every corporation.In recognition of the importance of digital experience in board rooms, U.S. corporate governance publication Agenda released this week a list of 50 professionals who would make good board candidates because of their digital business backgrounds.On the list is Dallas entrepreneur Lisbeth McNabb, founder and CEO of startup DigiWorksCorp, a digital platform that helps companies engage with customers. The Dallas startup recently raised $500,000 in angel funding.McNabb isn't exactly a boardroom newbie, though. McNabb currently sits on the board of Irving-based Nexstar Broadcasting Group, where she oversees Web and mobile product launches. McNabb, former chief executive officer at Match.com, also sits on the board of Dallas-based Tandy Brands Accessories.McNabb is one of 20 female candidates on Agenda's digital board directory. She said she was honored to represent Dallas and female entrepreneurs in technology, who are generally underrepresented."I get asked on both coasts why I have not moved my companies there, and we looked hard at moving match.com to the west coast," McNabb said. "Being recognized as a top 50 global digital and board talent residing and launching a digital company here validates that Dallas and a digital technology company in the center of the U.S., can build talent, capital and clients, and succeed from Dallas.”Dallas was also well represented on the 50 digital list. McNabb was joined by two other Dallas entrepreneurs.Monte Ford is a retired executive chairman of Aptean Software in Atlanta. Prior to Aptean Software, Ford was the chief information officer at American Airlines for a decade. He is currently a board member of cloud platform company Akamai Technologies in Cambridge, Mass.Carl Sparks is CEO of Southlake-based online travel agency Travelocity. Previously, Sparks was president for online flash sale site Gilt.com. He currently sits on the boards of Vonage Holdings and Dunkin Brands Group.
