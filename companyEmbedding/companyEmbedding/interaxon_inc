 Muse is your personal 
meditation assistant









Sometimes your mind is calm,  
and sometimes it's active
Muse will guide you to a calm mind.









Put on your Muse headband and headphones…
...launch the app, close your eyes and immerse yourself within the sounds of a beach or rainforest.









While you meditate...
...the headband uses brain-sensing technology to measure 
whether your mind is calm or active, and translates those signals 
into guiding sounds.









When you're calm
you’ll hear peaceful weather sounds

When your mind wanders
the weather will intensify and gently guide you back to a calm state.









Savour the calm
when meditating with Muse
After your session, review your data, set goals,

Testimonials

 As a hypnotherapist, I help clients train their brain to change behaviour patterns through focused relaxation—a sort of therapeutic meditation. I guide my clients into a naturally induced state of self-optimization by which they can use the full power of their minds to enhance creativity, release fear, and tap into their greatest potential.  I routinely recommend meditating with Muse, the brain-sensing headband, because I’ve found it helps hard wire people’s ability to calm and comfort themselves.” Amy Budden C. Ht Certified Hypnotherapist Connected Mind
 Opti International is very excited to work with The Muse to evaluate and train athletes such as golfers, baseball pitchers and batters in their performance setting. The Muse has allowed us to collect quality brain signals through the phone. Debbie Crews, Ph.D. - CEO Opti International
 Muse has been such an awesome device to help clients manage their stress, learn how to focus and even improve their daily mood. Some even say that they sleep better. It is not like anything that I have ever used before.  Tarah K. Elhardan, MA, LLPC, NCC - Mental Wellness Counseling
 Muse really has revolutionized our treatment for anxiety at trinity wellness center. It’s great to be able to demonstrate a tool in the office that gives patients real-time data on their anxiety and a way to measure their progress in treating it.  I always encourage my patients with anxiety  to choose muse. R. Thomas Mathew MD - Board-certified psychiatrist and Medical Director
I use the Muse with several patients in readying them for neurofeedback.  It seems goals of neurofeedback can be more easily accomplished/learned when the brain is in a state of calm or calm focus.  I use the Muse to help clients learn to achieve that state before neurofeedback training.  We also work to incorporate the practice into their daily lives…with or without Muse. Lori Miller, MS, BCN - Better Brain Balance
I have introduced several patients in my Methadone Clinic to Muse and have seen a significant decrease in conflictive behaviour as well as a heightened ability for individuals to cope with stressful moments and personal issues. Thanks to Muse, my patients are excited to come to the clinic instead of dreading arriving for her medication. Delia Brereton, BScPhm, RPh - Choose Healthy Now
As someone who works with many professional baseball, basketball, hockey and football teams, I have found the Muse to be an essential tool for helping both players and patients learn to settle their minds and help improve their ability to fall asleep quickly.  It’s easy to use, fun, and very affordable, and above all: it works!W. Christopher Winter, MD - Sleep medicine specialist





 

Muse Makes Meditation Easy

Incorporating meditation into one’s daily routine can improve emotional well-being and enhance overall quality of life. As science and medicine demonstrate the significant and real benefits of meditation, more and more people are seeking to learn to meditate. Although the techniques of meditation are conceptually simple, many people find it hard to get started and can find it difficult to stay en­ gaged to develop a  lasting  habit.
We invite you to consider how you can engage your clients by introducing meditation in an entirely new way. With Muse, your mental state is monitored, enabling ongoing audio feedback during meditation to support and guide you toward an effective practice. This process accelerates comprehension and establishes the feeling that you are “doing it right,” which is essential for developing confidence and sustaining  motivation.

PADUA, Italy and TORONTO, Dec. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- SAFILO Group, the fully integrated Italian eyewear creator, manufacturer and worldwide distributor of quality and trust, and Interaxon Inc., the world leader in consumer brain sensing technology, today announced a strategic research and development partnership and licensing agreement.
This partnership enables SAFILO's entry into wearable technology, under the name of SAFILOX ™.








"SAFILOX is the perfect intersection of our renowned iconic eyewear design and authentic quality craftsmanship dating back to 1878, the leading brain sensing technology application, and today's most coveted consumer search to master mental focus and strength to achieve enhanced personal performance and well-being,"  said Luisa Delgado, CEO of SAFILO. "It is neither another example of technology mounted on frames, nor technology for its own sake. With SAFILOX our Group leverages its legendary Passion for Product and People for a wearable eyewear proposition of unparalleled fit and comfort, aspirational design and style, and compelling consumer relevance."
SAFILO has chosen to partner with Interaxon Inc., a Canadian company and a world leader in sparse EEG (electroencephalography) brain sensing technology. Today, Interaxon's Muse technology enables consumers, athletes, coaches, clinicians, and healthcare professionals to enhance their and their clients' personal wellness by helping them improve their mental focus. Interaxon's technology has been validated scientifically with more than a 100 brain researcher partnerships around the world, from institutes including the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest, MIT, McMaster University, NASA, and IBM. 
Scientific research partnerships involving SAFILOX are already underway, and involve leading  Canadian neuroscience researchers at institutes including the University of Toronto, the University of Victoria, and furthermore a study by Michela Balconi, Professor of Neuropsychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, Head of Research Unit in Affective and Social Neuroscience, at the Cattolica University of Milan.
"With SAFILOX, Interaxon becomes broadly accessible via a premier lifestyle brand and iconic design and stylish accessory. We are excited to spread the positive impact of our technology through Safilo's authentic quality and aspirational style," said Derek Luke, CEO of Interaxon. 
Interaxon and Safilo have been exploring their first eyewear developments in undisclosed work over the past 12 months. To develop this eyewear platform, the partner companies have established a team of experts devoted to the seamless integration of invisible brain sensing technology with stylish product design, development, and engineering, resulting in technology that is invisible to the user, but with a relevant functionality and aspirationally styled design.
SAFILOX will first be offered via the Group's SMITH performance eyewear brand. 
Interaxon Inc. will be presenting the partnership at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas January 5-8, 2017.

The process took a week. I interviewed at Interaxon (Toronto, ON) in February-2017.InterviewThree sessions: 1) HR screening, 2) skills-based interview split between PM, VP Engineering, and UX Designer (not full time with the company), 3) CEO and co-founder.The interviews were well-conducted. I did not receive duplicate questions. It was clear they wanted to build a good team. Unfortunately, the biggest turn-off, especially for a senior-level product manager, was hearing that the co-founding team was split on the company's core direction.The process was excellent. I heard back from the hiring manager almost immediately after each round and was made an offer a few days after completing the final interview.The offer itself was discouraging: pay cut, limited vacation, and reporting into another product manager.Interview Questions The most thorough and PM-related question was a hands-on activity in which you sticky-noted your process of building a features from ideation to release and beyond.   Answer Question Interaxon 2017-03-10 12:20 PST See All 4 Interviews Interaxon Awards & Accolades Let us know if we're missing any workplace or industry recognition – Add AwardsWork at Interaxon?
