	The following hypothetical example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. It assumes that you invest $10,000 in
	the Fund for the time periods indicated and then, except as indicated, redeem all your shares at the end of those periods. It assumes a 5% return on your investment each year, that the Fund's operating expenses remain
	the same (except that fee waivers or reimbursements, if any, are only reflected in the 1-Year figures) and that all dividends and distributions are reinvested. Your actual costs may be higher or lower.

	Portfolio Turnover.

	The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher
	transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund's performance.
	During the Fund's most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 56% of the average value of its portfolio.





	INVESTMENTS, RISKS AND
	PERFORMANCE


	Principal Investment Strategies.

	The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of high yield fixed income instruments that are rated below investment grade by a
	nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) or, if unrated, are considered by the investment subadviser to be of comparable quality. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80%
	of its investable assets in a diversified portfolio of high yield fixed income instruments that are below investment grade (commonly referred to as junk bonds) with varying maturities and other investments (including
	derivatives) with similar economic characteristics. The term “below investment grade” refers to instruments either rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), BB+ or lower by
	Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (S&P) or Fitch, Inc. (Fitch), or comparably rated by another NRSRO, or, if unrated, are considered by the investment subadviser to be of comparable quality. The term
	“investable assets” refers to the Fund’s net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes. The Fund’s investable assets will be less than its total assets to the extent that it has
	borrowed money for non-investment purposes, such as to meet anticipated redemptions. Although the Fund may invest in instruments of any duration or maturity, the Fund normally will seek to maintain a weighted average
	portfolio duration of three years or less and a weighted average maturity of five years or less. The Fund will provide 60 days’ prior written notice to shareholders of a change in the 80% policy stated above. As
	of August 31, 2015, the Fund’s weighted average portfolio duration was 2.08 years and the Fund’s weighted average maturity was 3.92 years.



	The types of fixed-income
	securities in which the Fund may invest include bonds, debentures, notes, commercial paper, floating rate or variable rate instruments and other similar types of debt instruments, as well as loan participations and
	assignments, money market instruments, payment-in-kind securities and derivatives related to or referencing these types of securities and instruments. The Fund may invest in fixed income instruments of companies or
	governments. The Fund may invest without limit in US currency-denominated and foreign currency denominated fixed income securities issued by foreign issuers, including issuers in emerging markets.


	In determining which securities to
	buy and sell, the investment subadviser will consider, among other things, the financial history and condition, earnings trends, analysts' recommendations, and the prospects and the management of an issuer. The
	investment subadviser generally will employ fundamental analysis in making such determinations. Fundamental analysis involves review of financial statements and other data to attempt to predict an issuer's prospects
	and to try to decide whether the price of the issuer's security is under-valued or overvalued.


	Principal Risks.

	All investments have risks to some degree. An investment in the Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objective; is not a deposit with a bank; is not insured, endorsed or
	guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency; and is subject to investment risks, including possible loss of your original investment.



	Bond Obligations Risk.

	As with credit risk, market risk and interest rate risk, the Fund's holdings, share price, yield and total return may fluctuate in response to bond market movements. The value of bonds may
	decline for issuer-related reasons, including management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer’s goods and services. Certain types of fixed income obligations also may be subject to
	“

	call and redemption risk

	,” which is the risk that the issuer may call a bond held by the Fund for redemption before it matures and the Fund may lose income.



	Junk Bonds Risk.

	High-yield, high-risk bonds have predominantly speculative characteristics, including particularly high credit risk. Junk bonds tend to be less liquid than higher-rated securities. The
	liquidity of particular issuers or industries within a particular investment category may shrink or disappear suddenly and without warning. The non-investment grade bond market can experience sudden and sharp price
	swings and become illiquid due to a variety of factors, including changes in economic forecasts, stock market activity, large sustained sales by major investors, a high profile default or a change in the market's
	psychology.



	Credit Risk.

	This is the risk that the issuer, the guarantor or the insurer of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a contract, may be unable or unwilling to make timely principal and
	interest payments or to otherwise honor its obligations. Additionally, the securities could lose value due to a loss of confidence in the ability of the issuer, guarantor, insurer or counterparty to pay back debt. The
	longer the maturity and the lower the credit quality of a bond, the more sensitive it is to credit risk.



	Derivatives Risk.

	Derivatives involve special risks and costs and may result in losses to the Fund. The successful use of derivatives requires sophisticated management, and, to the extent that derivatives
	are used, the Fund will depend on the subadviser’s ability to analyze and manage derivatives transactions. The prices of derivatives may move in unexpected ways, especially in abnormal market conditions. Some
	derivatives are “leveraged” and therefore may magnify or otherwise increase investment losses to the Fund. The Fund’s use of derivatives may also increase the amount of taxes











	payable by shareholders. Other risks arise from
	the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions. A liquid secondary market may not always exist for the Fund’s derivatives positions. In fact, many over-the-counter derivative instruments will
	not have liquidity beyond the counterparty to the instrument. Over-the-counter derivative instruments also involve the risk that the other party will not meet its obligations to the Fund.


	Market Risk.

	Securities markets may be volatile and the market prices of the Fund’s securities may decline. Securities fluctuate in price based on changes in an issuer’s financial condition
	and overall market and economic conditions. If the market prices of the securities owned by the Fund fall, the value of your investment in the Fund will decline.



	Foreign Securities Risk.

	Investments in securities of non-US issuers (including those denominated in US dollars) generally involve more risk than investing in securities of US issuers. Foreign political, economic
	and legal systems, especially those in developing and emerging market countries, may be less stable and more volatile than in the US. Foreign legal systems generally have fewer regulatory requirements than the US
	legal system. In general, less information is publicly available about non-US companies than about US companies. Non-US companies generally are not subject to the same accounting, auditing, and financial reporting
	standards as are US companies. Additionally, the changing value of foreign currencies and changes in exchange rates could also affect the value of the assets the Fund holds and the Fund's performance. Certain foreign
	countries may impose restrictions on the ability of issuers of foreign securities to make payment of principal and interest or dividends to investors located outside the country, due to blockage of foreign currency
	exchanges or otherwise. Investments in emerging markets are subject to greater volatility and price declines.



	In addition, the Fund's investments
	in non-US securities may be subject to the risks of nationalization or expropriation of assets, imposition of currency exchange controls or restrictions on the repatriation of non-US currency, confiscatory taxation
	and adverse diplomatic developments. Special US tax considerations may apply.


	Emerging Markets Risk.

	The risks of non-US investments are greater for investments in emerging markets. Emerging market countries typically have economic and political systems that are less fully developed, and
	can be expected to be less stable, than those of more developed countries. For example, the economies of such countries can be subject to rapid and unpredictable rates of inflation or deflation. Low trading volumes
	may result in a lack of liquidity and price volatility. Emerging market countries may have policies that restrict investment by non-US investors, or that prevent non-US investors from withdrawing their money at
	will.



	Interest Rate Risk.

	The value of your investment may go down when interest rates rise. A rise in rates tends to have a greater impact on the prices of longer term or duration securities. When interest rates
	fall, the issuers of debt obligations may prepay principal more quickly than expected, and the Fund may be required to reinvest the proceeds at a lower interest rate. This is referred to as “

	prepayment
	risk

	.” When interest rates rise, debt obligations may be repaid more slowly than expected, and the value of the Fund's holdings may fall sharply. This is referred to as
	“

	extension risk

	.” The Fund may be subject to a greater risk of rising interest rates due to the current period of historically low rates. The Fund may lose money if short-term or long-term interest
	rates rise sharply or in a manner not anticipated by the subadviser.



	Management Risk.

	The value of your investment may decrease if judgments by the subadviser about the attractiveness, value or market trends affecting a particular security, industry or sector or about market
	movements are incorrect.



	Liquidity Risk.

	The Fund may invest in instruments that trade in lower volumes and are less liquid than other investments. Liquidity risk exists when particular investments made by the Fund are difficult
	to purchase or sell. Liquidity risk also includes the risk that the Fund may make investments that may become less liquid in response to market developments or adverse investor perceptions. If the Fund is forced to
	sell these investments to pay redemption proceeds or for other reasons, the Fund may lose money. In addition, when there is no willing buyer and investments cannot be readily sold at the desired time or price, the
	Fund may have to accept a lower price or may not be able to sell the instrument at all. An inability to sell a portfolio position can adversely affect the Fund's value or prevent the Fund from being able to take
	advantage of other investment opportunities.



	Market Events.

	Events in the financial markets have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an unusually high degree of volatility, both in non-US and US markets. This market volatility, in addition
	to reduced liquidity in credit and fixed income markets, may adversely affect issuers worldwide. Furthermore, the impact of policy and legislative changes in the US and other countries may not be fully known for some
	time. This environment could make identifying investment risks and opportunities especially difficult for the subadviser.



	Risk of Increase in Expenses.

	Your actual cost of investing in the Fund may be higher than the expenses shown in the expense table for a variety of reasons. For example, expense ratios may be higher than those shown if
	average net assets decrease. Net assets are more likely to decrease and Fund expense ratios are more likely to increase when markets are volatile. Active and frequent trading of Fund securities can increase
	expenses.



	More information about the risks of
	investing in the Fund appears in the Prospectus.


	Performance.

	The following bar chart shows the Fund's performance for Class A shares for each full calendar year of operations or for the last 10 calendar years, whichever is shorter. The following
	table shows the average annual returns of each of the Fund’s share classes and also compares the Fund’s performance with the average annual total returns of an











	index or other benchmark and a group of similar
	mutual funds. The bar chart and table demonstrate the risk of investing in the Fund by showing how returns can change from year to year.


	Past performance (before and after
	taxes) does not mean that the Fund will achieve similar results in the future. Updated Fund performance information is available online at www.prudentialfunds.com.

Writing, Editorial, and Creative Services



 

Professional copyediting (down payment) 
 DETAILS

We will initially bill you a $240 non-refundable down payment to initiate your professional copyediting review. This amount will be applied toward your final editing cost and will cover the first 15,000 words of your manuscript. Your actual, final cost will depend upon the length of your manuscript over and above 15,000 words and will be billed at 1.6 cents per word. This final amount will be added to your shopping cart for secure payment before editing begins.  




 

Professional custom cover design 
 DETAILS

The simple fact is that people judge books by their covers. Make sure people are impressed with yours. Get two different, fully-customized cover designs to choose from for your book today, regardless of where you plan on publishing. Publishing with Outskirts Press? Login to your Publishing Center first. 




 

Private Label ISBN (Bowker approved) 
 DETAILS

Some self-publishing authors prefer to secure their own ISBNs for full control over how their books are identified, discovered, and sourced. Outskirts Press can help. As an R.R. Bowker designated agent, Outskirts Press can reserve an ISBN in your name, for 20% less than if you went to Bowker directly. Publishing with Outskirts Press? Login to your Publishing Center first. 




 

Writing Consultation 
 DETAILS

Stuck in a rut? The Writing Consultation service from Outskirts Press provides you with the tools you need to restart or fine-tune your writing and get your book back on track. This service gives you time with a professional, skilled writer to address any writing issues you are experiencing, along with valuable advice and a plan of action for moving forward. Scroll down to Product Details for more information. 






Custom Full Color Illustrations

Outskirts Press offers original full-color illustrations (that are also available in black/white) in a variety of amazing and unique styles. Best of all, unlike with other publishers, these illustrations are
royalty-free, which means you will not have to split your book royalties with the artist. In fact, you don't even need to publish your book with Outskirts Press; although we will give you a
15% discount if you do.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
