Vision 



Freedom of thought
We want to influence people all over the world and have a positive impact on the way they live, work, learn and communicate. Ultimately, we want to have an effect on how people think. We believe we can do this by liberating the space in interior environments. Freedom from restrictions, we believe, creates the conditions for freedom of thought.

History 




A long successful journey


HOWE Furniture was founded in 1928 in Trumbull, Connecticut, by Harold Howe. HOWE started out making card tables, snack tables, bedside tables, folding cribs, wooden hat racks, sewing tables and just about any furniture that folded. One early HOWE slogan was: "IF IT FOLDS, ASK HOWE”.
During the 20th century the HOWE brand became the leading brand of multi-usage and space-saving tables in North America. The slogan was TABLES = HOWE.
HOWE’s European organisation started in the late 1960’s on a license agreement. Later, in 1989, HOWE acquired the European licensee and its production facilities and operations in Middelfart, Denmark. HOWE Europe a/s became a reality. It manufactured chairs and tables.
During the 1990’s and early 2000’s HOWE in Europe and HOWE in the US developed into two independent brands, following different concepts and go-to-market strategies. The European organisation expanded due to its A&D focused strategy and strong product development. In 2011 we implemented ONE WORLD – ONE HOWE, meaning that the European HOWE overtook all the North American HOWE activities and began rolling out the European strategy and HOWE collection in North America.
Today all international HOWE activities are managed from Denmark, with strong international sales and an extensive supply network. HOWE a/s has subsidiaries in USA, UK, France and Poland. HOWE is owned by CF Group.

Harold Howe II, who as the chief federal educator in the Johnson administration led the growing federal involvement in public schools, died last Saturday at a retirement home in Hanover, N.H. He was 84 and most recently lived in Concord, Mass.Mr. Howe was in the forefront of efforts to combat social ills at the school level. Among his targets were poverty and racial segregation.As United States commissioner of education from 1966 to 1968, Mr. Howe was a driving force in the Great Society campaign to abolish segregation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Among segregationist Southern legislators, who fought to keep the matter local, his sobriquet was U.S. commissioner of integration.He took the assignment in January 1966, succeeding Francis Keppel in one of the fastest-growing jobs in Washington. He reported to John W. Gardner, the secretary of health, education and welfare, and was responsible for a sprawl of federal programs.

A former administrator of both public and private schools, he monitored college scholarships, teaching practices and curriculums as well as segregation. Continue reading the main story

He started by setting minimum integration goals that school districts had to meet to qualify for some of the billions of federal dollars the law made available. He also set strict deadlines and verification procedures that Secretary Gardner amended in the face of Southern resistance.Mr. Howe used the leverage of federal aid beyond the South, including in major systems like Chicago's. He paid particular attention to the education and status of teachers and school administrators.His view of segregation reflected his upbringing. Harold Howe II was born in Hartford, a son of the Rev. Arthur Howe, a professor at Dartmouth College and president of the Hampton Institute in Virginia. His grandfather Samuel Chapman Armstrong was a Union general during the Civil War and founded Hampton as a trade school for freed slaves. Young Harold grew up at Hampton, developing an easy relationship with young blacks, along with a missionary streak and a lifelong concern for equal education opportunities.

He was a 1940 history graduate of Yale University, where he excelled in sports, and he started teaching history at a private school. In World War II, he skippered a Navy minesweeper.He then taught history and coached ice hockey at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and in 1947 received a master's degree in history at Columbia University. He also did postgraduate work in education at Harvard University and the University of Cincinnati.He was a high-school principal in Andover, Cincinnati and Newton, Mass., before moving to Scarsdale, N.Y., as superintendent of schools from 1960 to 1964.He then directed the Learning Institute of North Carolina for Gov. Terry Sanford, who founded it as an experiment for black and white children. At the time he also was an adjunct professor at Duke University.When Mr. Gardner, who had been active in the Scarsdale PTA, became the secretary of health, education and welfare, he prompted President Lyndon B. Johnson to name Mr. Howe to the education post.After leaving Washington, Mr. Howe worked for the Ford Foundation as an adviser in India and as vice president for education in New York until 1981. From then until his retirement in 1994, he was a senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
