The U.S. Private Placement was made concurrently with a public offering of units being made in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act ("Regulation S") in the Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland pursuant to a short form prospectus dated April 9, 2014.  As a result of the acquisition of Units by LMM under the U.S. Private Placement, LMM acquired 42,000,000 common shares of the Issuer representing approximately 15.67% of the current issued and outstanding common shares of the Issuer; and (ii) 42,000,000 Warrants representing approximately 21.55% of the issued and outstanding warrants of the Issuer.

The Units were acquired for investment purposes. LMM may take such further actions in respect of its holdings as it may deem appropriate in light of the circumstances then existing, including acquiring ownership or control over additional Common Shares or other securities of the Issuer or the disposition of all or a portion of its holdings in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

VANCOUVER, April 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Red Eagle Mining Corporation (TSX-V: RD, OTCQX: RDEMF, SSE-V: RDCL) is pleased to announce a private placement for gross proceeds of $11,281,476, consisting of 29,688,095 common shares (the "Shares") at a price of $0.38 per Share (the "Financing").  Liberty Metals & Mining Holdings, LLC ("LMM"), a subsidiary of Boston based Liberty Mutual Insurance, elected to exercise its participation right and will purchase 9,500,000 Shares which will result in LMM's ownership interest in Red Eagle Mining increasing from 18.0% to 19.9%.








Proceeds will be used for exploration drilling of the Santa Rosa Gold Project and to fund CB Gold Inc.'s 2016 work programme at the Vetas Gold Project.  The Financing was priced at market on the date the Financing was agreed.  The Shares are subject to a four month hold period from the date of issuance.
About Red Eagle Mining
Red Eagle Mining is a well-financed gold exploration and development corporation with an experienced mine development team.  Management is focused on building shareholder value through discovering and developing gold projects with low costs and low technical risks in Colombia, a jurisdiction with prolific historic production but until recently limited modern exploration.  Red Eagle Mining owns 68% of the Vetas Gold Project and 100% of the Santa Rosa Gold Project, where construction is underway at the fully permitted and fully financed San Ramon Gold Mine with production expected to commence in the second half of 2016.
