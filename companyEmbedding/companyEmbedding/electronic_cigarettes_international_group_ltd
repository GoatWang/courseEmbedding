FDA cracks down on online e-cigarette sales

A month after assuming regulatory oversight over e-cigarettes, the FDA has cracked down on online sales by the industry, issuing 24 letters to websites for illegal sales to minors.The agency hasn't moved to ban online purchases, as many in the industry expected, but the letters show it's closely monitoring those outlets.Websites and stores will have 15 days to reply and explain how they plan to prevent future underage sales.Related tickers: MO, BTI, LO, PM, OTCQB:ECIG, OTCQB:VAPE, OTCPK:HPNN, OTCQB:MCIG, OTCQB:NTRR, OTCPK:VAPR, VPCO, RAI, OTC:AHII

Huge cigarette tax vote coming up in California

 Big Tobacco is pouring money into California in an effort to defeat a proposal to increase the state tax on cigarettes to $2.87 per pack. Opponents of the tax increase have raised over $35M to double the $17M generated by supporters of the tax. Analysts believe the vote in California is crucial with other states likely to watch the outcome very closely and some global implications in play as well. Proposition 56 language: "Increases cigarette tax by $2.00 per pack, with equivalent increase on other tobacco products and electronic cigarettes containing nicotine."Related tobacco industry stocks: PM, MO, VGR, RAI, OTCQX:ITYBF, BTI, OTCQB:ECIG, OTCQB:VAPE, OTCPK:HPNN, OTCQB:MCIG, OTCQB:NTRR, OTCPK:VAPR, OTC:AHII.

New tobacco-buying age limit in California goes into effect

 A new law in California requiring purchasers of tobacco products to be 21 years of age went into effect today. California is the second state after Hawaii to set the higher age limit. Some forecasts suggest the number of smokers will drop in the state by over 10%, even factoring in for illegal purchasing. The new tobacco rules in California also reclassify e-cigarette and vapor products as "traditional" tobacco products.

California lawmakers approve raising smoking age to 21

California lawmakers have voted to make the nation's most populous state the second to raise the smoking age from 18 to 21 as part of a sweeping package of measures cracking down on tobacco products and electronic cigarettes."With California having such a huge population, it's going to be very impactful nationwide," said Cathy Callaway, associate director of state and local campaigns for the American Cancer Society.Hawaii became the first state to lift the smoking age limit to 21 in January.Related stocks: LO, PM, MO, VGR, RAI, OTCQX:ITYBY, OTCPK:JAPAY, BTI, OTCQB:ECIG, OTCQB:VAPE, OTCPK:HPNN, OTCQB:MCIG, OTCQB:NTRR, OTCPK:VAPR, VPCO, OTC:AHII

E-cigarette flavoring found to be dangerous

 A government sponsored study by scientists from Harvard University found a link between chemicals used to give candy flavoring to e-cigarettes and a dangerous health condition called "Popcorn Lung."

E-cigarette sales growth runs below expectations

 E-cigarette sales growth is down in recent months, while sales declines for traditional cigarettes have moderated to better-than-anticipated levels, according to industry data. Wells Fargo analysts Bonnie Herzog thinks some consumers have become "disenchanted" with e-cigs and returned to cigarettes. Cigalikes sales have also slumped over the last month. A backlog of e-cigarette inventory could pressure pricing.

E-cigs and the Atlantic divide

 There's a different approach to electronic cigarettes developing in the U.S. and U.K.Health advocates in the U.S. continue to raise concerns on the impact on teenagers, including a damaging article in JAMA Pediatrics, and politicians are eyeing taxing the product. No great surprise, but Chicago and New York are out in front of the e-cig tax movement.U.S. sales have been held back a bit by efforts to demonize the product, according to some company officials.The reception in the U.K. to the burgeoning e-cig industry has been warmer. A government health body determined last month that e-cigarettes could be prescribed by doctors in the nation as an effective way to help smokers break their addiction.A study by the same group estimated e-cigs are 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes and found no evidence the product acts as a gateway to smoking for children or non-smokers. That last part was also backed up in a concise breakdown by FiveThirtyEight.com.Related stocks: MO, BTI, LO, PM, OTCPK:ECIG, OTCQB:VAPE, OTCPK:HPNN, OTCQB:MCIG, OTCQB:NTRR, OTCPK:VAPR, RAI, OTC:AHII, OTCQX:ITYBY, OTCPK:VTCQ, VPCO, BTI, OTCQX:ITYBY, OTCPK:JAPAY.

Victory ECIGs pursues multiple Acquisitions with convertible debt, Uplist to NASDAQ to raise funds to pay off acquisition                                            2.

Improve working capital   New CEO Mission: "To deliver profitable growth to enhance shareholder value" Differentiating approach: To target sales channels, not specific countries   Key quotes from Q2 2015 conference call:  1. "I have realized several of you are very disappointed I have not spoken sooner or flooded the market with all sorts of press releases. Very simply I was not ready and the company was not ready. I wanted to have visited and spoken personally to all our constituents, whether it be our suppliers, the management teams of each company, our customers and from these conversations and work sessions pull together in overall strategy that would successful guide the company to become the most profitable independent electronic cigarette company in the world, delivering profitable growth to enhance shareholder value." - Dan O'Neill, CEO  2. "In closing, I would like to advise everyone that conference calls and press releases will focus and be directed toward the six key strategic drivers. In some quarters, there will be advances in one area, while in the next quarter the focus may switch to another driver; but the goal will never alter to deliver profitable growth to enhance shareholder value...I think the key focus from here on in, apart from the (quarterly) calls, will be strategic announcements. And if you see an announcement, just refer to those six pillars, the drivers and you will see how we are focused in that area." - Dan O'Neill, CEO        Share Structure   Outstanding Shares (OS): 75,311,764 (as of May 11, 2016) Authorized Shares   (AS): 300,000,000  AS OF 6/30/2015 Warrants: 285,953,833 Stock Options for Employees: 30,796,317 Fixed price Convertible Debt Shares: 37,682,111 "As of June 30, 2015, the Company has 300,000,000 common shares authorized of which 70,482,486 were issued and outstanding. The Company would need approximately 330,000,000 common shares to accommodate the exercise and conversion of all of the common stock options, warrants, convertible debt, and unvested restricted stock presently outstanding, and would not be able to accommodate all such exercise and conversion requests through the remaining unissued common shares. Accordingly, the Company could be required to settle a portion of its warrants and derivative liabilities in cash which requires that they continue to be classified as liabilities rather than equity instruments."

The category is only a few years old, but already exceeds $1 Billion dollars in sales with the largest market for electronic cigarettes being the United States.  99% of all e-cig consumers are cigarette smokers in search of a healthier alternative, or looking to be able to smoke in places where traditional cigarettes are not allowed. This is particularly attractive for the electronic cigarette segment as the tobacco market is $720 Billion in size, which provides a tremendous source of growth for electronic cigarettes.  The e-cig segment is still in the very formative stages, both in terms of product and market structure. The category is less than five years old and has been essentially doubling every year since inception. Importantly, less than 10% of all smokers have ever tried an e-cig, so over 90% of the opportunity is still in front of the industry. As a result, leading industry analysts predict that e-cigs will achieve from 15% to over 50% share of the broader tobacco market in the next decade.  Given the size of the tobacco Industry, this equates to a size of segment of e-cigs of between $110 Billion and $360 Billion over the next ten years.  Bonnie Herzog, from Wells Fargo Securities and one of the leading industry analysts predicts sales topping $10 billion by 2017. “The long-term growth trajectory of the category will be robust.  Use of electronic cigarettes could overtake consumption of traditional cigarettes within 10 years.” While difficult to predict, we think it is possible that consumption of e-cigarettes could outpace traditional cigarettes over the next decade, especially given the rapid pace of innovation and consumers' demand for reduced harm products," Herzog said.   Goldman Sachs’ Judy Hong describes e-cigarettes as basically all the good stuff about regular cigarettes but none of the bad, and Goldman has listed e-cigarettes as their number one extraordinary technology forcing businesses to adapt or die. "Imagine a product that is possibly >99% less harmful than cigarettes, delivers a similar user experience and offers a better economic bargain—this is the proposition of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs)."

(the "Company" or "ECIG"), a leading global marketer and distributor of electronic cigarettes and vapor products, today announced that Must Have Limited, a limited liability company incorporated in England and Wales ("MHL") and wholly-owned subsidiary of Electronic Cigarettes International Group, Ltd., a Nevada corporation (the "Company,"), was placed under the "administration" process (the "Administration") in the United Kingdom ("UK") by order of the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, Companies in England and Wales. Geoff Rowley and Anthony Collier, both partners at FRP Advisory LLP, were appointed as joint administrators with respect to MHL.The Administration process results from an unsatisfied tax obligation of MHL in the amount of approximately $3 million which remains owed to HM Revenue & Customs ("HMRC").  Despite multiple attempts to satisfy the tax obligation and other expected near term obligations, the Company is unable to continue to fund the operations or any obligations of MHL. "Based on the administration process in the United Kingdom we will be evaluating the strategic alternatives available for the future of the company," stated Dan O'Neill, ECIG's CEO.  "Legacy financial commitments and MHL's underperformance in the UK prevented the subsidiary from meeting its financial obligations."  In the UK, administration is the process by which administrators are appointed over the assets and undertaking of an entity in circumstances in which it is believed that entity is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts as they fall due and there is a real prospect that administration is likely to achieve one or more of the following:a)   rescuing the company as a going concern; b)  realizing a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up;  or c)  realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. Purposes b) and c) apply to the administration order of MHL granted on March 7, 2017.Cross-Default of Company DebtThe winding up petition presented by HMRC in respect of the unsatisfied tax obligation of MHL described above and the Administration of MHL has caused the Company to default under all of its outstanding secured debt obligations (the "Cross-Defaults"), including under that certain Credit Agreement, dated April 27, 2015, between the Company and an institutional investor, previously disclosed in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on May 1, 2015.  The Cross-Defaults have resulted in the acceleration of approximately $104 million of outstanding debt owed by the Company, which amounts have become immediately due and payable (the "Accelerated Debt"). The Board of Directors and executive management of ECIG are considering a variety of strategic alternatives to address the Administration, Cross-Defaults and the Accelerated Debt.Electronic Cigarettes International GroupElectronic Cigarettes International Group (ECIG), a leading global marketer and distributor of electronic cigarettes and vapor products, is dedicated to providing a compelling alternative to traditional cigarettes for more than 1 billion current smokers around the world.  The Company offers consumers a full product portfolio whose brands include VIP, FIN, Vapestick, and others, incorporating superior product quality and the latest technology.  The Company owns multiple subsidiary companies and has operations in North America and Western Europe.  ECIG offers consumers a full product portfolio that incorporates product quality and the latest technology.  To learn more, visit www.ecig.co.  Safe Harbor DisclosureThis press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
