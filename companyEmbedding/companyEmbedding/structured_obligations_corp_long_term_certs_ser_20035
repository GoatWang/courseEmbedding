	Please forward this request for instructions to all beneficial holders.





	 




	U.S. Bank National Association serves as trustee (the Select Trustee ) for the above-referenced Trust (the Trust) formed pursuant to the terms of the Base Trust Agreement dated as of April 2, 2002 as supplemented by the Select Notes Trust Supplement LT 2003-5 (collectively, the Trust Agreement) by and between Structured Obligations Corporation as Depositor (the Depositor) and the Select Trustee. The assets held by the Trust include the following securities issued by EOP Operating Limited Partnership (EOP), which are held through The Depository Trust Company (DTC).




	 





	$3,000,000 principal amount 7.875% Notes due 2031 (CUSIP No. 268766BV3)*






	issued by EOP (the EOP Notes)





	 




	Further to our notices of January 3 and January 5, 2007, EOP amended the its original offer to purchase Certain of its outstanding Notes under its Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation dated December 26, 2006 (the Original Offer to Purchase). The amendments are set forth in EOPs Press Release dated January 11, 2007 a copy of which is sent herewith (together with a copy of the Original Offer to Purchase (collectively referred to herein as the Amended Purchase Offer). Holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Amended Purchase Offer will be deemed to consent with respect to certain proposed amendments (the Proposed Amendments) described therein. PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL DEADLINES WITH RESPECT TO INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SELECT TRUSTEE ARE UP TO 2 BUSINESS DAYS PRIOR TO THOSE IN THE PURCHASE OFFER TO ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME FOR THE SELECT TRUSTEE TO RESPOND TO DTC
	AND FOR DTC IN TURN TO RESPOND TO EOP. EOP has set a separate early deadline for consenting to the purchase offer for such investors who wish to receive the $50 consent fee per $1000 of EOP Notes tendered as well as the Tender Offer Consideration described therein.




	 




	The Trust Agreement provides, that in the event that the Select Trustee receives a request from the Depository or an Underlying Securities Issuer for its consent to any amendment, modification or waiver of the Underlying Securities, or any other document thereunder or relating thereto, or receives any other solicitation for any action with respect to any Underlying Securities, the Select Trustee shall mail a notice of such proposed amendment, modification, waiver or solicitation to each Certificateholder of record as of such date. The Select Trustee shall request instructions from the Certificateholders as to whether or not to consent to or vote to accept such amendment, modification, waiver or solicitation and shall be protected in taking no action if no direction is timely received. The Trust Agreement also provides that the Select Trustee shall at no time vote or consent to any matter
	which would alter the timing or amount of any then scheduled payment on the Underlying Securities, including without limitation any demand to accelerate the Underlying Securities, whether or not pursuant to a plan for the refunding or refinancing of such Underlying Securities, except with the consent of Certificateholders representing 100% of the aggregate Voting Rights of the Certificates. Acceptance of the Amended Purchase Offer would entail a change in the timing and amount of payments on such EOP Notes or an exchange of such EOP Notes for a onetime cash payment. The Select Trustee must also receive an opinion of counsel that the acceptance of the Purchase Offer would not alter the status of the Trust as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes or result in the imposition of tax upon the Certificateholders.




	 





	Certificateholders will be eligible receive $4.147083 per thousand dollar Certificate (their pro-rata share of the $50 consent fee) ONLY if 100% of Certificateholders instruct the Select Trustee to accept the Amended Purchase Offer and consent to the Proposed Amendments prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 16, 2007 (the Consent Payment Deadline), unless the Consent Payment Deadline in the Amended Purchase Offer is extended by EOP. Receipt of such payment is also contingent on fulfillment of certain conditions more fully described in the Amended Purchase Offer.





	 




	5




	 









	 




	 





	Certificateholders can direct the Select Trustee to accept the Amended Purchase Offer and consent to the Proposed Amendments against payment of the Tender Offer Consideration described in the Amended Purchase Offer until the earliest of a) the date on which the Trustee receives affirmative directions from 100% of Certificateholders to accept the Amended Purchase Offer, b) the date on which the Trustee receives a direction from any Certificateholder to reject the Amended Purchase Offer and c) 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on Tuesday, February 6, 2007 (the Offer Expiration ), unless the Amended Purchase Offer is extended or earlier terminated by EOP. However, the Select Trustee can act on such instructions ONLY if 100% of Certificateholders direct the Select Trustee accept the Amended Purchase Offer and consent to the Proposed Amendments. If the Select Trustee receives a direction from any
	Certificateholder to reject the Amended Purchase Offer, it must reject the Amended Purchase Offer with respect to the Trusts entire holdings of EOP Notes and will cease to seek directions from the remaining Certificateholders.





	 




	Accordingly, the Select Trustee is providing this request for instructions along with the enclosed form of Written Direction concerning the Amended Purchase Offer. The Select Trustee hereby requests the holders of the Certificates to provide instructions to accept or reject the Amended Purchase Offer by executing the enclosed form of Written Direction and returning it to the Select Trustee on or before the Consent Payment Deadline or the Offer Expiration. If the Select Trustee does not receive an affirmative response on an executed Written Direction from a Certificateholder, it will treat such lack of response as a direction to reject the Purchase Offer. The Select Trustee will promptly advise Certificateholders of the receipt of any direction to reject the Amended Purchase Offer. Please note that the Select Trustee is treating this a new corporate action. Certificateholders must submit new Written
	Directions to the Select Notes Trustee as any written directions previously provided in respect of the Original Offer to Purchase will not be counted due to the change in its terms.

	The Select Notes Trustee has received directions from some Certificateholders to reject the Amended Purchase Offer. It will therefore be obligated to reject the Amended Purchase Offer with respect to the Trusts entire

			Structured products offer investors the potential to earn returns tied to the performance of an index or basket of securities. Rates of return vary and are generally paid at maturity, along with the face amount of the investment, subject to the credit risk of the issuer.

 Structured products from Fidelity 
Fidelity currently offers "new issue" structured products that are either:

Market-linked (e.g., equity or currency indexes) certificates of deposit, which carry FDIC insurance protection on the invested principal, subject to FDIC coverage limits ($250,000 per account owner per institution); or
Senior unsecured obligations of the issuer, which are not FDIC-insured.

Types









How They Work













As with any new issue offering, prospective investors should read the prospectus which provides greater detail on the offering and its structure. Customers may then submit indications of interest during an order period. At issuance, customers typically receive an allocation amount equal to the indication of interest that was submitted. However, submitting an indication of interest does not guarantee an allocation. If the offering is oversubscribed (more securities were requested than available for purchase), and you did not withdraw your order, you may receive only a portion of the securities you requested, or none at all. Further, if the offering is undersubscribed, the offering can be pulled.
Investments in structured products that are FDIC-insured involve the issuance of an underlying certificate of deposit, which is the sole obligation of the issuing bank. This underlying CD provides the FDIC protection on this investment. Non-FDIC-insured structured products have no CD issuance. With these investments, which are unsecured debt, customers are unsecured creditors of the issuer.
 Components of Fidelity’s structured products 
The structured products offered through Fidelity.com include the following components:
Payout profile
Fidelity currently offers only a point-to-point payout profile. A payout profile represents how a customer's cumulative return is measured. The return of the structured products available on Fidelity.com is measured based on two points: point A (initial or starting index level, which is typically the closing value of the index on the pricing date) and point B (final index level, which is typically the closing value of the index on a date specified in the offering document). The product will provide its investment return based on the following formula:
(final index level – starting index level)

starting index level
Certain structured products impose limits on return potential in the form of a "cap" or may limit your participation in the upside performance of the linked index or customized basket (see below).
Participation rate
The potential return to the investor depends in part on what is known as the participation rate. If the participation rate of the structured product is less than 100%, the investor will realize a return that is less than the return of the linked index or customized basket. For example, if the participation rate is 80%, the investor will receive only 80% of any positive return on the index or basket, assuming no other limits on return potential. The participation rate will vary by product, and factors such as index type, maturity, and caps affect the rate.
Cap
A cap represents a ceiling above which the investor does not participate in further upside gains of the linked index or basket. In other words, if the linked index or benchmark generates a return greater than the stated cap, investors will not receive any returns in excess of the capped return. For example, if a structured product allows for 100% participation in an index subject to a 50% cap, the investor cannot earn more than 50% on the investment even if the investment appreciates above that.
Costs and fees
Placement fees, structuring, development, and other costs will vary and may impact secondary market prices for structured products. Investors should consider these and any other costs and fees covered in the offering document prior to investing.
Taxes
Structured products may be considered contingent payment debt instruments for federal income tax purposes. This means you'll usually have to pay income taxes each year on imputed annual income even though you may not receive a cash payment until maturity. In addition, any gain realized upon the sale of these products may be treated as ordinary income. Please refer to the offering document for the specific tax treatment of a structured product and consult your tax advisor for more details.













Features & Benefits













 Market participation 
Investors participate only in the upside performance of the underlying index. Principal is not at risk from negative performance of the index, but is subject to issuer credit and default risk.
 Access to alternative asset classes 
Investors gain exposure to asset classes such as currencies and commodities that might otherwise be difficult to access.













Risks













 Credit and default risk 
Structured products are subject to the risk of default by the issuer. Therefore, the financial condition and creditworthiness of the issuer are important considerations when assessing the ability of the issuer to meet its obligations according to the terms of the structured product. In summary, if the issuer defaults or declares bankruptcy, the investor may lose all or some of the investment. In the case of FDIC-insured market-linked CDs, deposit amounts exceeding applicable FDIC coverage limits are subject to the credit risk of the issuing bank. Other limitations on FDIC coverage may apply. Structured products which are senior unsecured notes are not FDIC-insured. In the event of issuer default on a non-FDIC-insured product, repayment of principal would be subject to the issuer's restructuring and liquidation process and is in no way guaranteed.
 Limited FDIC protection 
For FDIC-insured market-linked CDs, FDIC coverage generally applies to the amount of invested principal only. Any appreciation relating to the linked index or benchmark is not FDIC-insured. If you hold more than the FDIC-insured limitations in deposits with the issuing bank, you will not receive the benefit of FDIC insurance for any balance in excess of FDIC limits. In this instance, amounts in excess of FDIC-insured limits are subject to the credit risk of the issuing bank.
 Liquidity risk 
Structured products are intended to be held until maturity. Due to a limited secondary market, it may not be possible to sell a structured product prior to maturity. Additionally, should a secondary market exist, investors who need to sell a structured product prior to maturity may be subject to a significant loss.
 Market or opportunity risk 
The potential return on structured products is subject to market volatility and the risks associated with the linked index or basket. The return of a structured product may be zero or less than what could have been earned on a traditional fixed income security.
 Derivatives risk 
The issuers of structured products may choose to hedge their obligations by entering into derivatives and/or trading in one or more instruments, such as options, swaps, or futures. The costs associated with such hedging activity could affect the market value of a structured product or the price at which the issuer may be willing to purchase a structured product in the secondary market.
 Commodity price risk 
If the investment benchmark is linked to one or more commodities, you may be subject to market volatility and risks relating to commodities. Trading in commodity futures contracts associated with an underlying commodity index is speculative and can be extremely volatile. The performance of the commodity index or basket of commodities may deviate significantly from the performance of the referenced commodity or commodities.
 Currency and exchange rate risk 
If the investment benchmark is linked to a foreign currency or currency basket, you may be subject to foreign currency risks. The value of foreign currencies can be highly volatile and may change based on various factors, which may include changes in national debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign inflation rates, domestic and foreign interest rates, and global or regional political, regulatory, economic or financial events. Performance may deviate significantly from the performance of the referenced currencies or exchange rates.













Examples













The scenarios presented below are hypothetical. Actual investment performance may differ. In all cases, return of original investment principal is subject to the credit risk of the issuer or guarantor.
 Scenario 1: The index rises 
Assume return is tied to the performance of the S&P 500® Index. In this scenario, the index rose 50% over the life of the structured product; in other words, it was up 50% between purchase date and maturity. Further, assume an original investment of $1,000 and an 80% participation rate. Given these conditions, the return to the investor would be $400 ($1,000 × 50% × 80%). So at maturity, the customer would receive the amount of his or her original investment principal, plus the $400 index return amount, for a total of $1,400.



 Scenario 2: The index falls 
In this scenario, assume return is again tied to the performance of the S&P 500® Index, but in this case, the index falls 50% over the life of the structured product. The customer would not receive any additional returns under the participation rate; instead he or she would be paid according to the principal return at maturity percentage offered by the structured product. Assuming it was 100%, then regardless of how far the index fell, the customer would receive a full return (i.e., 100%) of his or her initial invested principal at the end of the term. In this example, the customer invested $1,000 and would receive it back at maturity.



 Scenario 3: A capped return 
In this final scenario, again assume return is tied to the performance of the S&P 500® Index. Assume again that the index rose 50% over the life of the structured product. Further, assume an original investment of $1,000 and an 80% participation rate. Finally, assume a cap of 35%. Given these conditions, the return to the investor would be the lesser of the participation amount of $400 ($1,000 × 50% × 80%) OR the cap amount of $350 ($1,000 × 35%). So in this scenario, the customer would receive the amount of his or her original investment principal, plus the $350 cap index return amount, for a total of $1,350.



These examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to predict or project the performance of any investment or security. Taxes, inflation, fees and/or expenses were not taken into account. If they had been deducted, performance would have been lower. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Your performance will vary, and you may have a gain or loss if you sell prior to maturity. Before you start, you should review all of the assumptions for these hypothetical examples.

1. Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.


2. Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study bond pricing, available online, for self-directed retail investors from five brokers that offer corporate and municipal bonds. The study compared online bond prices for over 20,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches between September 2nd and October 6th, 2015. It compared municipal and corporate inventories offered online in quantities of at least $10,000 face or par value. The study found on average that three competitors that bundled their markups or fees into their online bond prices were asking an average of $13.97 more per bond. Corporate Insight determined the average cost differential by calculating the difference between the costs of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity vs. these markup-based firms in the study, then averaging the differences across all of the competitor firms. Hypothetical cost savings of $286 is based on an average size order of $22,000 face or par value bonds and average cost differential of $13 per bond.


          3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the accountholder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
    

          4. Fixed annuities available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. These products are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC . Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.


Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although deferred fixed annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the deferred fixed annuity.
	
    

          5. A contract's financial guarantees are solely the responsibility of and are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Before investing, always read a money market fund’s prospectus for policies specific to that fund.


          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

          Fidelity makes certain new issue products available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity may receive compensation from issuers for participating in the offering as a selling group member and/or underwriter. For representative assisted treasury auction orders, a $19.95 transaction fee applies.
	
    

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

What is 'Structured Finance'
Structured finance is a highly involved financial instrument offered to large financial institutions or companies that have complex financing needs that don't match with conventional financial products.Since the mid-1980s, structured finance has become a substantial space in the financial industry. Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), synthetic financial instruments, collateralized bond obligations (CBOs) and syndicated loans are all examples of structured finance instruments.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Structured Finance'
      Structured finance is typically indicated for borrowers – mostly extensive corporations – that have unique or highly specified needs. A simple loan or other type of conventional financial instrument, will not suffice to resolve such need. In most cases, structured finance involves one or several discretionary transactions to be completed and thus evolved and often risky instruments must be implemented.Examples of Structured Finance Products/InstrumentsWhen a standard loan is not enough to cover unique transactions dictated by a corporation's operational needs, for example, a number of different structured finance products may be implemented. Along with CDOs and CBOs, instruments such as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), credit default swaps (CDSs), and hybrid securities combining elements of debt and equity securities are often utilized.Significance and BenefitsStructured financial products are typically not offered by traditional lenders. Generally, because structured finance is required for major capital injection into a business or organization, investors are required to provide such financing. Structured financial products are almost always non-transferrable, meaning that they cannot be transferred between various types of debt in the same way that a standard loan is.More and more, structured financing (and securitization) are used by corporations, governments and financial intermediaries in advancing, evolving and complex emerging markets to manage risk, develop financial markets, expand business reach and design new funding instruments. For these entities, using structured financing transforms cash flows and reshapes the liquidity of financial portfolios.SecuritizationSecuritization is the process through which a financial instrument is created by combining financial assets. Various tiers of these repackaged instruments are then sold off to investors. Securitization, much like structured finance, promotes liquidity and is also used to develop the structured financial products used by uniquely qualified businesses and other customers.A mortgage-backed security (MBS) is a model example of securitization. Mortgages may be grouped into one large pool, leaving the issuer the opportunity to divide the pool into pieces that are based on the risk of default inherent to each mortgage. The smaller pieces may then be sold to investors.
