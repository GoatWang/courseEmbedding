We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock.

The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form.

Operation Quick Money System














Brought to you
      by KYLE WICKER








 









Before you
      continue and read the rest of this webpage, please allow me to explain why
      I'm doing this for free now.
My name
      is Patric Chan and I've taught tens of thousands of students worldwide. As
      much as I want to help you today, I hope you can understand that I'm doing
      this for the benefit of myself too.
After
      more than a decade of being in this business, I've realized that the REAL
      reason why someone achieves success or fail is not strictly based on the
      methods that they have learned - it's based on that person's mindset for
      success, their drive if you like. So I've wrote the book, WakeUp
      Millionaire to teach this, and I'm blessed knowing that it has achieved #1
      best-selling book in Amazon.com's "self help" category for Kindle in the
      past.
After
      I've trained you for free, I hope you'll buy a copy of it as well because
      I think it can help you to completely "re-wire" your mindset. But of
      course, if you feel that you've already conditioned your mindset for real
      success, then it's totally up to you if you don't want to read it. I would
      still be happy to help you start an internet business...

Introducing The Operation
      Quick Money Online Training 





The
      Operation Quick Money is a system that I've developed to help you to make
      money online. Simply how it sounds, the system is about how you can get
      started quickly to make your very first $100. 

IMPORTANT: This is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme. It
      takes time and work to achieve - but when you follow the right steps, the
      work you put in can finally create the success that you've been looking
      for.
 

       





Click Here To Access The Software












 
Inside
      Operation Quick Money Training Area:
 








Step #1: Use our Offer
      Finder App to find products
The
      easiest way to get started and make some money online is to promote other
      company's products and make a commission from therein. The reason is, the
      company has already developed the unique product to sell - your simple
      task is to send traffic back to their website. 
With The Offer Finder App, the software
      will help you to research hundreds of products that you can promote, and
      you'll earn commission as high as 70%.





Step #2:
      Creating your website
Once this is done, you'll
      need to create a website to promote these products online. Inside our
      training area, I'll teach you how to put up a website up both quickly and
      easily. If you're willing to learn and follow the steps carefully, I think
      you can complete this as quickly as one or two days.





Step #3: Promoting the Offer to
      make money online

During this step, I'll share with you how to promote the offer that you've
      selected on your website. When a website visitor comes to your webpage and
      buys the offer you've recommended, you'll automatically be credited with
      some commission. And to make money online, it's really as simple as that.
      





Step #4: Driving Free Traffic To
      Your WebsiteFinally, all you now need is to get traffic to your
      website. So during this final step, I'm going to share with you how to get
      traffic to your website for absolutely free!






 









 
How To
      Get Started:

The
      Offer Finder App and the entire training course is web-based. This means,
      all of the training is provided online, 100% of it. 

This
      way, we'll also be able to update the training courses conveniently for
      you. To get started, simply register a membership account.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level. To learn more about forming an LLC, click the link below.Learn more about forming an LLC  C CorporationForm a C Corporation (C Corp)The C Corporation (C Corp) is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation". Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

Before you
      continue and read the rest of this webpage, please allow me to explain why
      I'm doing this for free now.
My name
      is Patric Chan and I've taught tens of thousands of students worldwide. As
      much as I want to help you today, I hope you can understand that I'm doing
      this for the benefit of myself too.
After
      more than a decade of being in this business, I've realized that the REAL
      reason why someone achieves success or fail is not strictly based on the
      methods that they have learned - it's based on that person's mindset for
      success, their drive if you like. So I've wrote the book, WakeUp
      Millionaire to teach this, and I'm blessed knowing that it has achieved #1
      best-selling book in Amazon.com's "self help" category for Kindle in the
      past.
After
      I've trained you for free, I hope you'll buy a copy of it as well because
      I think it can help you to completely "re-wire" your mindset. But of
      course, if you feel that you've already conditioned your mindset for real
      success, then it's totally up to you if you don't want to read it. I would
      still be happy to help you start an internet business...

      Operation Quick Money is a system that I've developed to help you to make
      money online. Simply how it sounds, the system is about how you can get
      started quickly to make your very first $100. 

IMPORTANT: This is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme. It
      takes time and work to achieve - but when you follow the right steps, the
      work you put in can finally create the success that you've been looking
      for.

Inside
      Operation Quick Money Training Area:
 








Step #1: Use our Offer
      Finder App to find products
The
      easiest way to get started and make some money online is to promote other
      company's products and make a commission from therein. The reason is, the
      company has already developed the unique product to sell - your simple
      task is to send traffic back to their website. 
With The Offer Finder App, the software
      will help you to research hundreds of products that you can promote, and
      you'll earn commission as high as 70%.





Step #2:
      Creating your website
Once this is done, you'll
      need to create a website to promote these products online. Inside our
      training area, I'll teach you how to put up a website up both quickly and
      easily. If you're willing to learn and follow the steps carefully, I think
      you can complete this as quickly as one or two days.





Step #3: Promoting the Offer to
      make money online

During this step, I'll share with you how to promote the offer that you've
      selected on your website. When a website visitor comes to your webpage and
      buys the offer you've recommended, you'll automatically be credited with
      some commission. And to make money online, it's really as simple as that.
      





Step #4: Driving Free Traffic To
      Your WebsiteFinally, all you now need is to get traffic to your
      website. So during this final step, I'm going to share with you how to get
      traffic to your website for absolutely free!

If you are searching for the best high speed internet deals in the industry, there are a few common terms that you must know so you can select the best deal. When selecting a high-speed internet service provider, your primary concerns are internet speed, data limits, and network congestion. Cost is also important; with so many providers offering high speed wifi, no one should ever have to pay too much for Internet. In this article, we'll review the most important considerations when choosing the best high-speed wifi package for your needs. We'll also go over what we've found to be some of the best high speed Internet deals:

If you consider any of these great deals, we encourage you to visit these sites on your own to make sure they're available in your area. When visiting AT&T's Website, we discovered that their high speed data plans include 150 GB of data monthly, with a $10 overage charge for each 50 GB of data used over the limit. Depending on how fast you want your speed to be, prices range for $14.95 per month to $49.95 per month, depending on how many Mbps that you select in your plan.  For a stand-alone internet plan, you can select from 3.0 to 24 Mbps per second.  In addition, AT&T offers larger data plans if you bundle your service with Directv or subscribed to AT&T U-Verse.  You may be able to get up to 250 GB of data monthly if you bundle your service. 
Another provider to consider if available in your area is Cox Cable. Cox boasts the fastest in-home Wi-Fi connection on their site, are currently offering a 19.99 per month promotion for a 12 month period with a 2 year contract.  Other plans are available that arrange from 34.99 to 54.99, but it is not clear as to how many gigabytes are included monthly, but they indicate that their download speeds can be anywhere from 18-20 Mbps per second. Lastly, Century Link is offering stand-alone plans starting at $34.95 while boasting 10 Mbps for its connection speed.  You can get a price as low as $19.95 per month, if you choose to bundle your service.  Auto-pay enrollment may also be required in order to get the special pricing. 
Obviously, if you are searching for the best high-speed Internet deal, speed is a concern. The speed of service is measured in (Mbps) megabytes per second for most providers. A higher Mbps indicates a faster internet speed. Generally, there are two types of internet speeds.  You have a download speed that indicates how fast information arrives to your computer, and an upload speed that indicates how fast your internet connection delivers information from your computer. Thus, when looking for the best high-speed internet connection, you want to know what the Mbps, upload, and download speeds to compare services adequately. If you currently have an internet service and you are not sure of the speed of your connection, there are several sites that will allow you to test your internet connection for free. The sites speedtest.net and testMY.net allow you to test your connections. 
Almost all Internet service providers represent their internet storage with a common computing term that relate to the amount of data transmitted over the provider's network. The most common term that you will most frequently see on an internet provider's website, is (GB) or gigabyte.  Most high-speed internet plans are tiered plans that designate a certain amount of gigabytes that can be used during the billing cycle. A gigabyte measures the amount of data that is transferred over the internet connection, and this includes both the uploading and downloading of data. 
In addition, you may come across a term called a (TB) or terabyte, which has the same function, but is a much larger allowance of data.  Basically, anything that you surf or do on the internet is considered transmitted data. When you simply type in your favorite web browser and the page loads, you have downloaded transmitted data. If you are logged in via Wi-Fi on your cellphone and are simply sending emails from your Gmail account, you are uploading transmitted data. Thus, it is important to know how much data your household actually uses before selecting a plan. 
On most internet service providers websites, you can find a tool that is generally called a data calculator, that will allow you to select varying options that describe your internet usage.  The tool then computes your usage, to give you the potential numerical range of data that you are actually using in your home. We recommend that you use this number range in order to help select the proper data plan. Some, but not all internet service providers, charge overages once you have exceeded your data limits, and this can result in a costly monthly bill. Others may opt to slow down your ability to transmit data once you have exceeded your limit, instead of charging overages. Make sure to ask about the consequences of going over your data limits. 
Last, but certainly not least of your concerns, is potential network congestion.  When you sign up for service, you will often be provided with a piece of equipment called a router.  The router is a box that controls your internet connections.  Its purpose is to allow multiple devices to use the high-speed internet connection in your home at the same time. Whether it's a cell phone or a personal computer, an internet connection can be made through a Wi-Fi access point with the simple entering of the username and password of your home network. Normally, the username (SSID) and password can be found on the router.  However, there must be enough space on your network to allow the connection of multiple devices. 
In addition, your home internet connection is also competing with other home internet connections in the area. The amount of space available, is represented by a term called, bandwidth. The Bandwidth that a service provider offers is also an important factor, because it is an indicator of the potential amount of successful connections that can be made over your home network, and how much data you may actually able to download and upload. Ask about it. 
In conclusion, there are far more options available to consumers, besides the providers mentioned above.  Take your time and visit each provider's website, and look closely at the details.  Write a list of questions that are not immediately clear from the website and then call your potential new provider for further clarification before choosing a new service.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
