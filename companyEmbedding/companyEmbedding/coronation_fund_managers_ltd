History[edit]
Coronation Fund Managers commenced operations in Cape Town in 1993, with 15 staff and no assets under management.[3]
In 1996 Coronation's unit trust business, Coronation Management Company,[4] was launched. It also launched South Africa’s first international fund of hedge funds: Coronation Global Equity Fund.
In 1997, Coronation launched the country’s first retail international fund of hedge funds, the Coronation International Active Fund of Funds, and was instrumental in the formation of Namibia Asset Management and Namibia Unit Trust Managers.[citation needed]
In 1998 Coronation Fund Managers established in Dublin, Ireland and in 1999 opened an office in London. This was also the year in which Coronation pioneered the launch of absolute return products to the[3] South African market.
In June 2003, Coronation Fund Managers was listed separately on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) after it was unbundled from Coronation Holdings with a total staff complement of 133.[3] It became the first[citation needed] asset manager in South Africa to gain Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPSTM) compliance.[clarification needed]
Since its formation, Coronation has developed a number of black-controlled enterprises in the asset management industry. This includes Namibia Asset Management and Namibia Unit Trust Managers in Namibia and African Harvest in 1997, Kagiso Asset Management in 2002, and in 2005 launched Coronation Fund Managers[5] Botswana.
In 2007, Coronation became a signatory to the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investments[6] and began formulating their global emerging markets (GEM) product offering. Coronation’s Africa unit was launched in 2008.[7]
Business activities[edit]
Coronation is an investment-led, owner-managed business specialising in emerging market. It is an active manager with a long-term valuation-driven investment approach.
Product range: Emerging Market Equity; Global Equity, Fixed Interest and Multi-Asset; South African Equity, Fixed Interest and Multi-Asset; African Equity; Retirement Products and Hedge Funds.
Regulators[edit]
Coronation engages with the following regulatory bodies in the various jurisdictions in which they operate on an ongoing basis:

Financial Services Board (South Africa)
Financial Conduct Authority (UK)
Central Bank of Ireland (Ireland)
Securities and Exchange Commission (USA)

Stewardship[edit]
Coronation was an early signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investing in 2007. The business was also an early adopter of the Code for Responsible Investing in South Africa (2012) and the UK Stewardship Code (2010) [10]. The business incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment decision-making process in a way that is fully consistent with their long-term investment horizon.
Coronation believes companies cannot achieve sustainable economic success while neglecting their social and environmental responsibilities. Social responsibility has the potential to increase the quality of a company’s earnings stream and consequently its long-term investment potential. For Coronation, ESG issues form an intrinsic part of the mosaic for any investment case. Poor ESG performance may not necessarily exclude investing in a company, but it does force them to carefully consider the issues and engage management on these factors.
Coronation furthermore recognises the importance of focusing its attention and time on those ESG issues where it has expertise, and that can have the most meaningful impact on a company’s long-term prospects. To this end, Coronation spends large amounts of time studying the corporate governance of the companies they invest in. Coronation engages extensively with management and the board where needed.
Transformation[edit]
As a South African company, Coronation is committed to Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE). Coronation’s approach to transformation is based on the ideal that people are their greatest asset. This is reflected in their choice of a B-BBEE partner, the Imvula Trust, of which the beneficiaries comprise all black staff. Imvula was created in April 2005[8] and on 28 February 2013 acquired a direct ownership of 10% in the listed Coronation business.[9]
In terms of their procurement processes, Coronation applies strict consideration rules in order to create the opportunity for enhanced economic activity.[10]

In 1997, Coronation launched the country’s first retail international fund of hedge funds, the Coronation International Active Fund of Funds, and was instrumental in the formation of Namibia Asset Management and Namibia Unit Trust Managers.[citation needed]
In 1998 Coronation Fund Managers established in Dublin, Ireland and in 1999 opened an office in London. This was also the year in which Coronation pioneered the launch of absolute return products to the[3] South African market.
In June 2003, Coronation Fund Managers was listed separately on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) after it was unbundled from Coronation Holdings with a total staff complement of 133.[3] It became the first[citation needed] asset manager in South Africa to gain Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPSTM) compliance.[clarification needed]
Since its formation, Coronation has developed a number of black-controlled enterprises in the asset management industry. This includes Namibia Asset Management and Namibia Unit Trust Managers in Namibia and African Harvest in 1997, Kagiso Asset Management in 2002, and in 2005 launched Coronation Fund Managers[5] Botswana.
In 2007, Coronation became a signatory to the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investments[6] and began formulating their global emerging markets (GEM) product offering. Coronation’s Africa unit was launched in 2008.[7]
Business activities[edit]
Coronation is an investment-led, owner-managed business specialising in emerging market. It is an active manager with a long-term valuation-driven investment approach.
Product range: Emerging Market Equity; Global Equity, Fixed Interest and Multi-Asset; South African Equity, Fixed Interest and Multi-Asset; African Equity; Retirement Products and Hedge Funds.
Regulators[edit]
Coronation engages with the following regulatory bodies in the various jurisdictions in which they operate on an ongoing basis:

Financial Services Board (South Africa)
Financial Conduct Authority (UK)
Central Bank of Ireland (Ireland)
Securities and Exchange Commission (USA)

Stewardship[edit]
Coronation was an early signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investing in 2007. The business was also an early adopter of the Code for Responsible Investing in South Africa (2012) and the UK Stewardship Code (2010) [10]. The business incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment decision-making process in a way that is fully consistent with their long-term investment horizon.
Coronation believes companies cannot achieve sustainable economic success while neglecting their social and environmental responsibilities. Social responsibility has the potential to increase the quality of a company’s earnings stream and consequently its long-term investment potential. For Coronation, ESG issues form an intrinsic part of the mosaic for any investment case. Poor ESG performance may not necessarily exclude investing in a company, but it does force them to carefully consider the issues and engage management on these factors.
Coronation furthermore recognises the importance of focusing its attention and time on those ESG issues where it has expertise, and that can have the most meaningful impact on a company’s long-term prospects. To this end, Coronation spends large amounts of time studying the corporate governance of the companies they invest in. Coronation engages extensively with management and the board where needed.
Transformation[edit]
As a South African company, Coronation is committed to Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE). Coronation’s approach to transformation is based on the ideal that people are their greatest asset. This is reflected in their choice of a B-BBEE partner, the Imvula Trust, of which the beneficiaries comprise all black staff. Imvula was created in April 2005[8] and on 28 February 2013 acquired a direct ownership of 10% in the listed Coronation business.[9]
In terms of their procurement processes, Coronation applies strict consideration rules in order to create the opportunity for enhanced economic activity.[10]

History[edit]
Coronation Fund Managers commenced operations in Cape Town in 1993, with 15 staff and no assets under management.[3]
In 1996 Coronation's unit trust business, Coronation Management Company,[4] was launched. It also launched South Africa’s first international fund of hedge funds: Coronation Global Equity Fund.
In 1997, Coronation launched the country’s first retail international fund of hedge funds, the Coronation International Active Fund of Funds, and was instrumental in the formation of Namibia Asset Management and Namibia Unit Trust Managers.[citation needed]
In 1998 Coronation Fund Managers established in Dublin, Ireland and in 1999 opened an office in London. This was also the year in which Coronation pioneered the launch of absolute return products to the[3] South African market.
In June 2003, Coronation Fund Managers was listed separately on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) after it was unbundled from Coronation Holdings with a total staff complement of 133.[3] It became the first[citation needed] asset manager in South Africa to gain Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPSTM) compliance.[clarification needed]
Since its formation, Coronation has developed a number of black-controlled enterprises in the asset management industry. This includes Namibia Asset Management and Namibia Unit Trust Managers in Namibia and African Harvest in 1997, Kagiso Asset Management in 2002, and in 2005 launched Coronation Fund Managers[5] Botswana.
In 2007, Coronation became a signatory to the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investments[6] and began formulating their global emerging markets (GEM) product offering. Coronation’s Africa unit was launched in 2008.[7]
Business activities[edit]
Coronation is an investment-led, owner-managed business specialising in emerging market. It is an active manager with a long-term valuation-driven investment approach.
Product range: Emerging Market Equity; Global Equity, Fixed Interest and Multi-Asset; South African Equity, Fixed Interest and Multi-Asset; African Equity; Retirement Products and Hedge Funds.
Regulators[edit]
Coronation engages with the following regulatory bodies in the various jurisdictions in which they operate on an ongoing basis:

Financial Services Board (South Africa)
Financial Conduct Authority (UK)
Central Bank of Ireland (Ireland)
Securities and Exchange Commission (USA)

Stewardship[edit]
Coronation was an early signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investing in 2007. The business was also an early adopter of the Code for Responsible Investing in South Africa (2012) and the UK Stewardship Code (2010) [10]. The business incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment decision-making process in a way that is fully consistent with their long-term investment horizon.
Coronation believes companies cannot achieve sustainable economic success while neglecting their social and environmental responsibilities. Social responsibility has the potential to increase the quality of a company’s earnings stream and consequently its long-term investment potential. For Coronation, ESG issues form an intrinsic part of the mosaic for any investment case. Poor ESG performance may not necessarily exclude investing in a company, but it does force them to carefully consider the issues and engage management on these factors.
Coronation furthermore recognises the importance of focusing its attention and time on those ESG issues where it has expertise, and that can have the most meaningful impact on a company’s long-term prospects. To this end, Coronation spends large amounts of time studying the corporate governance of the companies they invest in. Coronation engages extensively with management and the board where needed.
Transformation[edit]
As a South African company, Coronation is committed to Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE). Coronation’s approach to transformation is based on the ideal that people are their greatest asset. This is reflected in their choice of a B-BBEE partner, the Imvula Trust, of which the beneficiaries comprise all black staff. Imvula was created in April 2005[8] and on 28 February 2013 acquired a direct ownership of 10% in the listed Coronation business.[9]
In terms of their procurement processes, Coronation applies strict consideration rules in order to create the opportunity for enhanced economic activity.[10]

History[edit]
Coronation Fund Managers commenced operations in Cape Town in 1993, with 15 staff and no assets under management.[3]
In 1996 Coronation's unit trust business, Coronation Management Company,[4] was launched. It also launched South Africa’s first international fund of hedge funds: Coronation Global Equity Fund.
In 1997, Coronation launched the country’s first retail international fund of hedge funds, the Coronation International Active Fund of Funds, and was instrumental in the formation of Namibia Asset Management and Namibia Unit Trust Managers.[citation needed]
In 1998 Coronation Fund Managers established in Dublin, Ireland and in 1999 opened an office in London. This was also the year in which Coronation pioneered the launch of absolute return products to the[3] South African market.
In June 2003, Coronation Fund Managers was listed separately on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) after it was unbundled from Coronation Holdings with a total staff complement of 133.[3] It became the first[citation needed] asset manager in South Africa to gain Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPSTM) compliance.[clarification needed]
Since its formation, Coronation has developed a number of black-controlled enterprises in the asset management industry. This includes Namibia Asset Management and Namibia Unit Trust Managers in Namibia and African Harvest in 1997, Kagiso Asset Management in 2002, and in 2005 launched Coronation Fund Managers[5] Botswana.
In 2007, Coronation became a signatory to the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investments[6] and began formulating their global emerging markets (GEM) product offering. Coronation’s Africa unit was launched in 2008.[7]
Business activities[edit]
Coronation is an investment-led, owner-managed business specialising in emerging market. It is an active manager with a long-term valuation-driven investment approach.
Product range: Emerging Market Equity; Global Equity, Fixed Interest and Multi-Asset; South African Equity, Fixed Interest and Multi-Asset; African Equity; Retirement Products and Hedge Funds.
Regulators[edit]
Coronation engages with the following regulatory bodies in the various jurisdictions in which they operate on an ongoing basis:

Financial Services Board (South Africa)
Financial Conduct Authority (UK)
Central Bank of Ireland (Ireland)
Securities and Exchange Commission (USA)

Stewardship[edit]
Coronation was an early signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investing in 2007. The business was also an early adopter of the Code for Responsible Investing in South Africa (2012) and the UK Stewardship Code (2010) [10]. The business incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment decision-making process in a way that is fully consistent with their long-term investment horizon.
Coronation believes companies cannot achieve sustainable economic success while neglecting their social and environmental responsibilities. Social responsibility has the potential to increase the quality of a company’s earnings stream and consequently its long-term investment potential. For Coronation, ESG issues form an intrinsic part of the mosaic for any investment case. Poor ESG performance may not necessarily exclude investing in a company, but it does force them to carefully consider the issues and engage management on these factors.
Coronation furthermore recognises the importance of focusing its attention and time on those ESG issues where it has expertise, and that can have the most meaningful impact on a company’s long-term prospects. To this end, Coronation spends large amounts of time studying the corporate governance of the companies they invest in. Coronation engages extensively with management and the board where needed.
Transformation[edit]
As a South African company, Coronation is committed to Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE). Coronation’s approach to transformation is based on the ideal that people are their greatest asset. This is reflected in their choice of a B-BBEE partner, the Imvula Trust, of which the beneficiaries comprise all black staff. Imvula was created in April 2005[8] and on 28 February 2013 acquired a direct ownership of 10% in the listed Coronation business.[9]
In terms of their procurement processes, Coronation applies strict consideration rules in order to create the opportunity for enhanced economic activity.[10]

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices

              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
