Statement by Pamela G. Bailey, president & CEO of GMA, in Response to Michael Moss’s Book on Obesity

GMA Press Contact

Brian Kennedy
office: 202-639-5994 

bkennedy@gmaonline.org 

(Washington, D.C.) - “Obesity is a serious problem in the United States and globally, and Michael Moss’s work misrepresents the strong commitment America’s food and beverage companies have to providing consumers with the products, tools and information they need to achieve and maintain a healthy diet and active lifestyle.
“The food industry’s track record on health & wellbeing speaks for itself:

Since 2002, we have introduced more than 20,000 new product choices with fewer calories, reduced fat, sodium and sugar, and more whole grains.
Through the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation, we have pledged to remove 1.5 trillion calories from the food supply by 2015.
Working through the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI), we have voluntarily adopted strict advertising criteria so that 100 percent of CFBAI members’ ads seen on children’s programming now promote healthier diet choices and better-for-you products.
We launched Facts Up Front, a landmark voluntary front-of-pack nutrition labeling system designed to help busy consumers – especially parents – make informed decisions when they shop.
Food and beverage companies contribute more than $130 million per year in grants to nutrition and health-related programs in hundreds of communities across the United States. 
GMA’s member companies are also committed to providing children with healthier meals in schools, supporting U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) recently revised nutrition standards for the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs.  
Full-calorie soft drinks have been removed from schools and total calories available from beverages in schools have been cut by 90%.


“The root causes of obesity are well known.  Too many calories consumed from any source, combined with a sedentary lifestyle are the main risk factors for obesity.  As such, public policy proposals to ban, tax or restrict consumer access to certain foods or beverages will not solve the obesity problem.
“To achieve and maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle, consumers must learn to balance calories consumed through food and beverages with the appropriate amount of physical activity as recommended by the federal government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including eating a variety of foods in moderation, combined with at least 60 minutes of daily physical activity (www.choosemyplate.gov).
“GMA and its member companies strongly support First Lady Michelle Obama’s goal of solving childhood obesity within a generation.  If we are going to meet that goal, everyone – industry, government, parents, schools, communities and healthcare providers – must do their part.
“The food and beverage industry is proud of its successful track record and the role we play in helping to combat obesity both in the United States and around the world, and we look forward to continuing our ongoing commitment to help consumers live healthy and active lifestyles.”

Addressing Hunger from Global to Local: Challenges and Solutions: Overview




























Addressing Hunger from Global to Local: Challenges and Solutions







 









ADDRESSING HUNGER FROM GLOBAL TO LOCAL:  CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS
SEF FOOD INTEGRITY SUMMER LECTURE SERIES: PART 2
August 1, 2017 at 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM EDT
Location: 1350 I Street, N.W.
Fourth Floor Conference Room
Washington, DC 20005
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that one in nine people in this world suffer from chronic undernourishment, most of whom live in developing countries.  In 2016, an estimated 11 million people from developed countries are undernourished.  Join us at GMA to learn more about the state of hunger in the world today, what one GMA member company is doing to alleviate hunger worldwide, and how you can help feed hungry people right here in the D.C. area.  
John Ellenberger
Since its inception in 1981, Land O'Lakes International Development has led nearly 300 programs in 80 countries, which have helped millions of men and women in their journey out of poverty and food insecurity.  John Ellenberger will provide an overview on one program in particular that provided vulnerable groups with local food made by local food processors, and provided proof that new paradigms for food aid can be even more efficient and sustainable.
Asma Lateef
The world has made dramatic progress in reducing hunger and poverty but in 2016, 792 million people were still suffering from hunger. Asma Lateef will provide an overview of issues related to global hunger and malnutrition. She will touch on progress made since 1990, U.S. leadership on hunger issues, challenges to future progress, particularly to achieving the goal of ending hunger by 2030, and what needs to be done to address those challenges.
 
Nancy Roman
In the Washington metro area – capital of one of the wealthiest nations on earth – 700,000 people aren’t always sure where their next meal will come from. And alarming numbers of those same people, recent data reveals, are also coping with diet-related disease, a result of poor access to foods that contribute to health. Solving hunger in the 21st century requires new thinking about old problems, and a move away from the conventional wisdom that has so often guided hunger work. Nancy Roman will provide an overview of hunger in our area, and the Capital Area Food Bank’s approach to addressing it, which emphasizes innovative partnerships, policies, and programming.
 
We will be hosting a food drive as part of the event benefiting the Capital Area Food Bank.  We encourage all attendees to bring something to contribute to the food drive!  
 
Cost: One Canned Good or One Package of Food
