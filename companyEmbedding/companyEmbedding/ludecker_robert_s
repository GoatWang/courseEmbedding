This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Dear
Richard:

 

I refer to
the letter agreement, dated November 14, 2011 (the “Original
Letter Agreement”), by and between you and MISONIX, INC.
("Misonix"). In recognition of your past service to Misonix and as
consideration for your future service to Misonix as Senior Vice
President, Finance, the Board of Directors of Misonix (the
“Board”) has authorized a modification to the Original
Letter Agreement to provide that you will be entitled to a payment
in the event your employment is terminated other than for Cause (as
defined below) in addition to the change-in-control payment
provided for by the Original Letter Agreement. Accordingly, we
hereby agree with you as follows:

 




 



1.



The
Original Letter Agreement is hereby restated in its
entirety.




 




 



2.



In the
event your employment with Misonix is terminated by Misonix on or
before September 15, 2018 for any reason other than for Cause,
Misonix will pay you a one-time additional compensation in an
amount equal to twelve (12) months annual base salary. Such
additional compensation will be paid to you less all required
withholding deductions, payable in accordance with Misonix’s
regular payroll schedule (the “Termination Payment”).
For purposes of this letter agreement, “Cause” shall
mean failure, in the determination of the Board, to perform your
responsibilities in any material respect as assigned to you after
the date hereof by Misonix’s Chief Executive Officer which
failure has not been corrected by you, in the determination of the
Board, within ten (10) days after written notice from or on behalf
of the Board of such failure.




 




 



3.



Payment of
the Termination Payment is contingent upon your (i) executing a
standard waiver and release in favor of Misonix and (ii) agreeing
to a standard covenant not to sue Misonix and its officers,
directors and related parties, each at the time of the termination
for Cause.




 




 



4.



During the
period in which the Termination Payment is being made, you shall,
upon reasonable notice, reasonably cooperate with Misonix, without
requirement of compensation to you, with respect to any claim,
dispute, litigation, inquiry, investigation or proceeding
concerning any matter with which you were involved while working
for Misonix; provided, however, that you may be advised in
connection with such cooperation, at your expense, with respect to
any matter in which you and Misonix have conflicting interests, as
determined by your counsel.




 

 


 

 

Mr.
Richard A. Zaremba

September
15, 2016

5.



(a)
        During the period
in which payment of the Termination Payment is being made, you
covenant and agree that you shall keep strictly confidential all
non-public proprietary information which you obtained during the
course of your employment with respect to the business practices,
finances, developments, marketing, sales, customers, affairs, trade
secrets and other confidential information of Misonix which shall
remain Misonix's exclusive property and you shall not disclose the
same, except to the extent that the same is then: (i) publicly
available without any act of you through a party not violating its
obligations to Misonix; or (ii) required to be disclosed under the
laws of the United States or any state in any judicial or
administrative proceeding. You further agree that immediately upon
the termination of your employment, you will surrender and deliver
to Misonix all (1) lists, books, records, memoranda and data,
computer discs, computer access codes, magnetic media, software, of
every kind relating to or in connection with Misonix's Business (as
defined below) and customers and suppliers of Misonix, and
(2) all of Misonix's personal and physical
property.




 

(b)        During
the period in which payment of the Termination Payment is being
made, you covenant and agree that you shall not compete, directly
or indirectly, with Misonix in (i) Misonix's Business or (ii) such
other business as in the reasonable opinion of the Board is a
competitor of Misonix.

 

(c)        During
the period in which payment of the Termination Payment is being
made, you covenant and agree that you shall not, alone or with
others, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit for your benefit or the
benefit of any person or organization other than Misonix, the
employment or other services of any executive or consultant of
Misonix; or (ii) solicit for your benefit or the benefit of any
person or organization other than Misonix, the employment of any
executive of any customer of Misonix, to compete in an area of (x)
Misonix’s Business or (y) such other business as in the
reasonable opinion of the Board is a competitor of
Misonix.

 

(d)        For
purposes of this letter agreement, “Misonix’s
Business” shall mean the business of developing,
manufacturing and/or marketing therapeutic ultrasonic instruments
for spine surgery, neurosurgery and other surgical
specialties.

 




 



6.



In the
event of a termination of your employment, you agree that you will
not disparage or encourage or induce others to disparage Misonix
(which, for purposes of this paragraph 6, is defined to include
Misonix and any affiliated company, parent company or subsidiary,
and each of their respective predecessors, affiliates, assigns,
shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and
attorneys, whether past, present or future). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the obligations pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
not apply with respect to any person or entity that disparages, or
encourages or induces others to disparage you. Misonix agrees that
neither it nor any affiliated company, parent company or
