Business Identifier: Treatments for diabetes 
Public Profile: Biodel Inc., a specialty biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the development and commercialization of treatments for diabetes. The firm's lead product candidate is a glucagon emergency management (GEM) device that is intended to treat diabetes patients experiencing severe hypoglycemia, or very low concentrations of blood glucose. Biodel's products are created by utilizing the company's proprietary VIAdelTM technology, which enables rapid delivery of drugs into the blood through various routes of administration. Faster onset of action and non-invasive routes of delivery improve the efficacy, safety, compliance and convenience for patients. The company is involved in developing proprietary formulations of injectable recombinant human insulin for the treatment of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It also develops liquid glucagon formulations for use as a rescue treatment for diabetes patients experiencing severe hypoglycemia, or very low concentrations of blood glucose. The Company develops its product candidates by applying its formulation technologies to existing drugs. Its advanced program involves developing formulations of injectable recombinant human insulin (RHI). In addition to its ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulations, the Company has developed prototype formulations of a liquid glucagon, a basal insulin and a glucose responsive insulin, in each case for use by patients with diabetes. RHI-based formulation known as Linjeta was the subject of a New Drug Application (NDA). Biodel's proprietary drug-delivery technology is applicable to a wide range of peptides, proteins and other macromolecules. It allows us to alter the pharmacokinetic profile, route of administration and stability of drugs that otherwise would be impractical to use as therapeutics because they break down too rapidly. Biodel is developing novel forms of insulin and other peptide hormones for use in treating diabetes and its complications, including hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, cardiovascular complications and weight control. The company is currently (2015) conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of BIOD-961, the reconstituted glucagon formulation intended for use in the GEM device. It also develops ultra-rapid-acting proprietary insulin formulations, such as BIOD-123, which has been evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial combining recombinant human insulin with its proprietary combination of excipients; and BIOD-531, a concentrated ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulation.

Biodel Outlines Plan To Regain Compliance With Nasdaq Listing Requirements
Sep 26 16
Biodel Inc. announced that its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders has been set for October 24, 2016. At that meeting, stockholders will vote on, among other things, matters necessary to complete Biodel's planned transaction with Albireo Limited pursuant to a previously announced share exchange agreement, including the issuance of shares of Biodel's common stock in the transaction and a proposed reverse stock split of Biodel's common stock at a ratio of 1-for-30 shares. As expected and as previously announced in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 22, 2016, on September 20, 2016, Biodel received a determination letter from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or the Staff, notifying Biodel that it had not regained compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) by the previously announced deadline. Because the date set for Biodel's 2016 annual meeting of stockholders is after the end of its fiscal year, Biodel also anticipates the receipt of a second deficiency notice from the Staff in early October of this year. In connection with the planned share exchange transaction with Albireo, an initial listing application has been submitted to Nasdaq relating to the listing of the common stock of the combined organization following completion of the share exchange. In the event Biodel has received stockholder approval of the proposals at its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders including the proposal for the issuance of Biodel's common stock in the transaction and for the proposed reverse stock split and completed the share exchange, Biodel anticipates that it will be able to demonstrate compliance with all applicable Nasdaq listing requirements. Nasdaq's September 22, 2016 determination letter noted that, unless Biodel timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, or the Panel, trading of Biodel's common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market will be suspended at the opening of business on September 29, 2016. Accordingly, Biodel intends to timely request a hearing before the Panel. Biodel's hearing request will automatically stay any action by the Staff with respect to the suspension of Biodel's listing on Nasdaq, pending the Panel's decision. It is expected that the hearing will be scheduled to occur in November 2016, after the anticipated completion of Biodel's planned share exchange transaction with Albireo. Biodel's plan for addressing the deficiency relating to the timing of its annual meeting will also be scheduled for consideration at the hearing that it will request. In the event Biodel has demonstrated compliance with all applicable listing requirements prior to the hearing date, Biodel will request that its hearing before the Panel be canceled. In the event Biodel has not demonstrated compliance with all applicable listing requirements in advance of the hearing date, Biodel intends to present its plan for achieving compliance to the Panel and request a brief extension within which to do so. However, there can be no assurance that Biodel will be successful and that a request to the Panel to cancel the hearing or for an extension of time would be granted. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market would have a material adverse effect on Biodel's business and on the trading of its common stock.
