Fox Business News dedicates day to broadcasting on "The Business of Vice."
Here are the highlights:

Video: Portfolio of Sin, Profitable?
Betting on Vice over Virtue in ETFs
Beware: Shun Sin Stocks At Your Own Risk

Vice Fund portfolio manager Gerry Sullivan was quoted:
There are plenty of people who would rather (give) away their money by putting it into wind mills... We offer a specific type of investment that has done extraordinarily well... We've taken a methodology and stuck to it through very difficult periods... There seems to definitely be a discount in these types of stocks. It may come because they're not as broadly held.
It’s no surprise the Vice Fund was featured in this special segment. At the time of the segment (May 2013), the Vice Fund was in the top 1% among 807 Large Blend Funds for the 10-year period (based on total returns), received from Morningstar a 5-star overall Morningstar rating (among 1451 Large Blend Funds as of 04/30/2013). The Overall Morningstar Rating is based on risk-adjusted returns, derived from a weighted average of the three-, five-, and ten-year Morningstar metrics. Morningstar percentile ranking is based on total returns.
By investing in these defensive growth industries that have historically performed well regardless of economic conditions, the Vice Fund offers investors a portfolio of stocks that we believe are especially attractive in today's volatile markets. The Vice Fund should be viewed as a core holding in an investor's portfolio.

The USA MUTUALS Funds are offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of any USA MUTUALS Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please refer to the prospectus for important information about the investment company including objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Read and consider it carefully before investing. You may also obtain a hardcopy of the prospectus by calling 866.264.8783.
Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. The Vice Fund will concentrate its net assets in industries that have significant barriers to entry including the alcoholic beverages, tobacco, gaming and defense/aerospace industries. The Fund may be subject to risks affecting those industries, including the risk that the securities of companies within those industries will underperform due to adverse economic conditions, regulatory or legislative changes or increased competition affecting those industries, more than would a fund that invests in a wide variety of industries. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility.
The USA Mutuals Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.
The Barrier Fund name was changed to the Vice Fund on October 1, 2016.

The Barrier Fund will concentrate its net assets in industries that have significant barriers to entry including the alcoholic beverages, tobacco, gaming and defense/aerospace industries. The Fund may be subject to risks affecting those industries, including the risk that the securities of companies within those industries will underperform due to adverse economic conditions, regulatory or legislative changes or increased competition affecting those industries, more than would a fund that invests in a wide variety of industries. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility.
The Generation Wave Growth Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Because the Generation Wave Growth Fund may invest in third-party investment companies, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), open-end mutual funds and other investment companies, your cost of investing in the Fund will generally be higher than the cost of investing directly in shares of mutual funds in which it invests. By investing in the Fund, you will indirectly bear your share of any fees and expenses charged by the underlying funds, in addition to indirectly bearing the principal risks of those funds. Please refer to the prospectuses for more information about the Fund, including risks, fees and expenses. Because the Fund invests in ETFs, it is subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of an ETFs shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value (“NAV”), an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact the Fund’s ability to sells it shares. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could result in losing more than the amount invested.
Takeover Targets Fund Risks: Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Investments in companies that the Advisor expects will be involved in a takeover event carry the risk that the expected event or transaction may not be completed or may be completed on less favorable terms than originally expected, which may lower the Fund's performance. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for emerging markets. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Convertible securities are subject to many of the same risks as regular fixed-income securities, including the risk that when market interest rates rise, the value of the convertible security falls, and in the event of a liquidation of the issuing company, holders of convertible securities generally would be paid after the company's creditors but before the company's common shareholders. Fixed income securities held by the Fund are subject to interest rate risk, call risk, prepayment and extension risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
Hedged Emerging Markets Fund Risks: Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. Emerging markets can have relatively unstable governments, social and legal systems that do not protect shareholders, economies based on only a few industries and securities markets that trade a small number of issues. The Fund invests in small & mid-cap companies, which involve additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Investing in derivatives, specifically call and put options, for hedging purposes to reduce Fund volatility as well as direct investment, may subject the Fund to losses if the derivatives do not perform as expected. The Fund may seek to profit from the occurrence of specific corporate or other events and a delay in the timing of these events, or the failure of these events to occur at all, may have a significant negative effect on the Fund's performance.
The USA Mutuals Barrier Fund, Takeover Targets Fund, Generation Wave Growth Fund and Hedged Emerging Markets Fund are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.
The Vice Fund name was changed to the Barrier Fund on July 29, 2014.
S&P 500 Index is considered to be generally representative of the U.S. large capitalization stock market as a whole. You cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect fees, expenses or sales charges.

Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. The Vice Fund will concentrate its net assets in industries that have significant barriers to entry including the alcoholic beverages, tobacco, gaming and defense/aerospace industries. The Fund may be subject to risks affecting those industries, including the risk that the securities of companies within those industries will underperform due to adverse economic conditions, regulatory or legislative changes or increased competition affecting those industries, more than would a fund that invests in a wide variety of industries. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility.
The Carbon Beach Deep Value Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Event driven investments carry the risk that expected events or transactions may not occur as anticipated or unexpected events could adversely impact an investment. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Funds may make short sales of securities, which involves the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested. The fund may invest in derivatives which can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risks, and, depending upon the characteristics of a particular derivative, suddenly can become illiquid. Options may be more volatile than investments directly in the underlying securities, involve additional costs and may involve a small initial investment relative to the risk assumed. The fund may invest in ETFs which will fluctuate based on changes in the net asset value as well as changes in the supply and demand of its shares in the secondary market. It is also possible that an active secondary market of an ETF's shares may not develop and market trading in the shares of the ETF may be halted under certain circumstances. The fund will bear its share of expenses and the underlying risks of investments in ETFs and other investment companies. Value investing involves the risk that an investment's intrinsic value may not be recognized by the market.
The USA Mutuals Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.

The USA MUTUALS Funds are offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of any USA MUTUALS Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please refer to the prospectus for important information about the investment company including objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Read and consider it carefully before investing. You may also obtain a hardcopy of the prospectus by calling 866.264.8783.
Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. The Barrier Fund will concentrate its net assets in industries that have significant barriers to entry including the alcoholic beverages, tobacco, gaming and defense/aerospace industries. The Fund may be subject to risks affecting those industries, including the risk that the securities of companies within those industries will underperform due to adverse economic conditions, regulatory or legislative changes or increased competition affecting those industries, more than would a fund that invests in a wide variety of industries. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility.
The Generation Wave Growth Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Because the Generation Wave Growth Fund may invest in third-party investment companies, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), open-end mutual funds and other investment companies, your cost of investing in the Fund will generally be higher than the cost of investing directly in shares of mutual funds in which it invests. By investing in the Fund, you will indirectly bear your share of any fees and expenses charged by the underlying funds, in addition to indirectly bearing the principal risks of those funds. Please refer to the prospectuses for more information about the Fund, including risks, fees and expenses. Because the Fund invests in ETFs, it is subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of an ETFs shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value (“NAV”), an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact the Fund’s ability to sells it shares. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could result in losing more than the amount invested.
Takeover Targets Fund Risks: Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Investments in companies that the Advisor expects will be involved in a takeover event carry the risk that the expected event or transaction may not be completed or may be completed on less favorable terms than originally expected, which may lower the Fund's performance. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for emerging markets. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Convertible securities are subject to many of the same risks as regular fixed-income securities, including the risk that when market interest rates rise, the value of the convertible security falls, and in the event of a liquidation of the issuing company, holders of convertible securities generally would be paid after the company's creditors but before the company's common shareholders. Fixed income securities held by the Fund are subject to interest rate risk, call risk, prepayment and extension risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
Hedged Emerging Markets Fund Risks: Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. Emerging markets can have relatively unstable governments, social and legal systems that do not protect shareholders, economies based on only a few industries and securities markets that trade a small number of issues. The Fund invests in small & mid-cap companies, which involve additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Investing in derivatives, specifically call and put options, for hedging purposes to reduce Fund volatility as well as direct investment, may subject the Fund to losses if the derivatives do not perform as expected. The Fund may seek to profit from the occurrence of specific corporate or other events and a delay in the timing of these events, or the failure of these events to occur at all, may have a significant negative effect on the Fund's performance.
The USA Mutuals Barrier Fund, Takeover Targets Fund, Generation Wave Growth Fund and Hedged Emerging Markets Fund are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.
The Vice Fund name was changed to the Barrier Fund on July 29, 2014.

Please consider carefully a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and other important information, obtain a fund prospectus by clicking here or by calling 1-800-US-FUNDS (1-800-873-8637). Read it carefully before investing. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, Distributor. U.S. Global Investors is the investment adviser. 
Read additional important information.

 Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local income taxes, and if applicable, may subject certain investors to the Alternative Minimum Tax as well. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. The tax free funds may be exposed to risks related to a concentration of investments in a particular state or geographic area. These investments present risks resulting from changes in economic conditions of the region or issuer.
Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure, as well as economic and political risk. By investing in a specific geographic region, a regional fund’s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio.
The Emerging Europe Fund invests more than 25% of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil & gas or banking industries. The risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund’s performance more volatile.
Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in a specific industry, the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries.
 Stock markets can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector-related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus.
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating? based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)
Each of the mutual funds or services referred to in the U.S. Global Investors, Inc. website may be offered only to persons in the United States. This website should not be considered a solicitation or offering of any investment product or service to investors residing outside the United States.

Investing in Mutual funds







What are mutual funds?

Mutual funds are a type of pooled investment  vehicle.  Shareholders of a mutual fund  invest their money by purchasing shares of the fund.  The money that they pay for the shares is  pooled together and invested in a portfolio of securities, such as stocks,  bonds, or money market instruments. Mutual funds are professionally managed and operated by money managers, who maintain the portfolio in accordance with the fund's investments objectives as stated in the prospectus. 
Mutual funds, money market funds, and Exchange Traded Funds are sold by prospectus. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other information, can be obtained by calling your HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Financial Professional or call 866.586.4722. Read it carefully before you invest.
An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund.
Popular investment disciplines which can involve mutual funds include:

Asset allocation1: a disciplined approach to long-term investing, designed to seek consistent exposure to markets. This  approach does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. It also cannot  eliminate the risk of fluctuating prices and uncertain returns. However, it may  be used in an effort to manage risk and enhance returns.
Dollar cost averaging2: a strategy  in which securities, typically mutual funds, are purchased in fixed dollar amounts at regular intervals, regardless of what direction the market is moving. While this method doesn't guarantee against losses, over time, this can help to reduce the average cost of acquired shares.  
Target date ("life cycle") investing3: investors choose a fund with a specified target date near a personal need or goal (such as retirement) for which they will need to access their invested funds. Though target date investing does not protect against loss of principal, the fund's risk exposure is gradually reduced as a target date draws nearer to prepare for the approaching liquidity needs. 

HSBC Global Asset Management fund options
Our World Selection Funds4offer asset allocation solutions–designed to help reduce the roller-coaster ride that volatile market conditions can generate. The five different fund strategies are aligned to the full spectrum of risk profiles:

Income Strategy Fund, 

Conservative Strategy Fund,

Moderate Strategy Fund,

Balanced Strategy Fund and 
 
Aggressive Strategy Fund. 


Explore our other exclusive asset allocation solutions.



In addition, the suite of HSBC Funds5 includes domestic money market funds and domestic and international equity and debt funds6. The 

HSBC Emerging Markets Debt Fund, 
HSBC Emerging Markets Local Debt Fund, HSBC Frontier Markets Fund and the HSBC Total Return Fund
 all provide access to some of the world's fastest growing markets through the lens of HSBC's deep global knowledge and experience. 

Additional funds from leading managers
A financial professional7 from HSBC Securities can also help you choose from a broad selection of third-party mutual funds. Each of these funds is thoroughly screened and regularly reviewed by the HSBC Global Funds Approvals & Research team8 - a global team of research analysts dedicated to helping enhance our clients' portfolios by identifying third party money managers that show sustainable competitive advantages within their asset class.
Take advantage of our mutual fund experience
Mutual funds offer a convenient avenue for entering financial markets and can also become integral parts of a broader investment strategy. To fully understand your personal investment objectives and help determine which funds may be suited for your needs, an HSBC Securities financial professional8 will take the time to conduct a thorough financial review. To schedule your review, or to receive information on funds offered through HSBC Securities, please call 866.586.4722 or schedule a consultation online.

1 Asset allocation is a method of diversification that positions assets among major investment categories. This tool may be used in an effort to manage risk and enhance returns. However, it does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. It also cannot eliminate the risk of fluctuating prices and uncertain returns.
2 Dollar Cost Averaging is a plan of investing which allows you to take advantage of market fluctuations, but it does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in declining markets.
3 Target date funds invest in other funds, so performance can vary significantly based on the investment restrictions of the target date fund. A target date fund may have losses and does not guarantee that sufficient assets will be available for retirement or any specific return.
4 HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. is the investment adviser for the HSBC World Selection Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), serves as the distributor of the Funds' shares.
5 HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. serves as the investment adviser to the HSBC Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., member FINRA, is the distributor of the HSBC Funds and is not affiliated with the Advisor. HSBC Global Asset Management (UK) Limited serves as investment subadviser to the HSBC Frontier Markets Fund. HSBC Global Asset Management (Hong Kong) Limited serves as subadviser to the HSBC RMB Fixed Income Fund.  HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE, FINRA, SIPC is a sub-distributor of the HSBC Funds. Affiliates of HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. receive fees for providing various services to the funds.
6 International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility that is heightened when investing in emerging or frontier markets. Foreign securities can be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy. The risks of investing in emerging-market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Frontier market countries generally have smaller economies and even less developed capital markets or legal and political systems than traditional emerging market countries. As a result, the risks of investing in emerging market countries are magnified in frontier market countries. Fixed income investments are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall.
7 Financial professional refers to Premier Wealth Advisors (PWA), Premier Relationship Advisors (PRA) and Financial Advisors (FA).  PWA/PRAs primarily focus on a full suite of Premier products and services while FAs primarily focus on a full suite of Advance products and services.  Both offer bank products through HSBC Bank (USA) N.A., investments and certain insurance products, including annuities, through HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and traditional insurance products through HSBC Insurance Agency (USA) Inc.
8 HSBC Global Funds Approvals & Research  team is a research and asset management capability utilized by certain HSBC companies in various regions around the world. In the U.S. the company offering these capabilities is HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc.
United States persons (including U.S. citizens and residents) are subject to U.S. taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their U.S. and non–U.S. accounts – including, for example, Form TD F 90–22.1 (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts ("FBAR")). U.S. persons should consult a tax adviser for more information.

TD Ameritrade


In the process of searching for a well-rounded broker, finding the right mix is no easy task. Trade costs, trade platforms, tools, research, and customer service all are important to investors.
After using a TD Ameritrade account, you cannot help but love the overall experience. The broker charges $6.95 per trade, almost twice that of some of the cheaper discount brokers. However, the value and quality delivered is so superior it easily justifies the higher price tag.
Commissions & Fees

While having access to 24/7 customer support, advanced trade platforms, ample research, real-time streaming quotes site wide and more is great; unfortunately, it is expensive. TD Ameritrade charges a flat rate of $6.95 per trade, with options costing $6.95, plus $.75 per contract.
Compared to other full-service brokers, TD Ameritrade is on par with ETRADE, but is more expensive than the rest, including Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Scottrade. In fact, considering margin costs, TD Ameritrade is the most expensive broker out of the 16 included in our 2017 Review.
TD AmeritradeE*TRADECharles SchwabFidelity Stock Trade Fee (flat)$6.95$6.95$4.95$4.95Options Base Fee$6.95$6.95$4.95$4.95Options Per Contract Fee$0.75$0.75$0.65$0.65Mutual Fund Trade Fee$49.99$19.99$76.00$49.95Broker Assisted Trades Fee$44.99$25.00$25.00$32.95Commission Free ETFs10113322991Commissions & Fees 2.5 Stars  2.5 Stars  3.5 Stars  3 Stars 
One bright spot is that TD Ameritrade offers 101 commission-free ETFs (Charles Schwab offers the most, with 229). The only caveat is that, with TD Ameritrade, any commission-free ETF that is sold within 30 days of purchase is subject to a short-term trading fee of $19.99.
UPDATE 03/06/17 – TD Ameritrade reduced its equity commissions. Equity trades, including stocks and ETFs, have been lowered to $6.95 per trade (previously $9.99). Since these new rates were announced after the 2017 Review was published, they are not incorporated into TD Ameritrade's star rating for this category. 
Customer Service

If having access to 24/7 customer support by phone and email is important to you, then TD Ameritrade has you covered. The broker posted fantastic results for phone and email during testing for our 2017 Review, finishing No. 1 and No. 3, respectively.
When it comes to support, the bottom line is that for a full-service broker, great customer service is expected, and TD Ameritrade delivers, regardless of the communication avenue.
During our phone tests, our average wait time was less than two minutes. The reps were very well trained. Every test call we made to TD Ameritrade, regardless of the day or time, was answered by a customer service agent who identified him/herself, provided a pleasant introduction, and always left us with a warm closing note (e.g., “Have a great day”). All our questions were always answered, so it was not surprising to see TD Ameritrade end up No. 1 for phone customer service out of 16 brokers.
Email testing was also a great experience. All our emails were returned within 12 hours, on average. In fact, in one test, TD Ameritrade responded to our multi-question support inquiry in a blazingly fast 11 minutes.  Customer service agents were clearly well trained, as email templates were consistent and thorough. Of all our eight email tests, two resulted in a “good” overall score, with the rest being “great.” TD Ameritrade finished third for email.
Live chat support is also offered, but only for clients seeking platform support while using thinkorswim, or for potential clients who navigate around the site long enough to trigger a live chat popup. Knowing how the web is evolving and how millennials prefer to communicate, I would like to see TD Ameritrade offer live chat support for all clients and potential clients. TD Ameritrade finished third for live chat.
When it comes to support, the bottom line is that for a full-service broker, great customer service is expected, and TD Ameritrade delivers, regardless of the communication avenue. TD Ameritrade finished first overall for Customer Service in our 2017 Review.
Research

Like its biggest competitors, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and ETRADE, TD Ameritrade has a substantial research offering. 
TD AmeritradeFidelity E*TRADEMerrill EdgeCharles SchwabEquity Research - Social Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes Equity Research - Metric Comparisons Yes  Yes  No  Yes  Yes Equity Research - Reports712438ETF Research - Reports Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes Mutual Fund Research - Reports Yes  No  Yes  Yes  Yes 
When I pulled up a quote for Apple (AAPL), I found a clean spread of relevant data, including seven different third-party research reports to choose from and read, which is the third highest number in the industry (Fidelity offers 12). The featured research report provider is ResearchTeam, which combines five research providers into one.

Providing clients quality research is an extremely competitive challenge. Of all the functionality provided on the website, I found TD Ameritrade had two outstanding functions: the Social Signals tab and the Peer Comparison tab. Powered by LikeFolio, Social Signals displays both a real-time streaming feed of algorithmically filtered brand-relevant tweets – which I found much better than seeing a list of recent StockTwits tweets – and a summary chart of the most-tweeted brands. Naturally, Social Signals is best used for consumer-focused brands such as Apple (AAPL) or Nike (NKE). In thinkorswim (covered further down) the data can be charted for deeper analysis.

On the Peer Comparison tab, investors find a clean customizable chart showing the stock’s performance against its closest competitors followed by a comparison table of relevant metrics. Included competitors can also be shown or hidden. Clean peer comparisons are not easy to do, which is where TD Ameritrade stands out. Metrics included in the table are relevant and pruned to the most important. Social Signals data is also tied in; however, I found this data did not appear each time I loaded the page, and data was missing for certain securities. Data was marked as “New” during my testing, so I imagine the data will be worked out in time.

Social Signals and peer comparisons aside, I also enjoyed the on-site charting functionality. With 34 different technical indicators (volume, MACD, RSI, etc.) and easy-to-read, big charts, the experience is as clean as you will find anywhere. I could even pop out the chart into its own window to expand it across my 24-inch monitor. The only downside to the experience is the lack of panning flexibility on the chart itself. Charting is driven by provider SunGard, and my recommendation to TD Ameritrade would be to check out ChartIQ instead.

For the price customers pay per trade, excellent research should be expected. When all 51 variables for Research are considered, TD Ameritrade lacks only two features: displaying the total number of holdings for ETFs, and a country allocation chart for Mutual Funds. Impressive, to say the least. TD Ameritrade finished third behind Fidelity and Charles Schwab for Research in 2017. 
Ease of Use

Making research a seamless experience is just one part of TD Ameritrade’s efforts to make its website easy to use. The site-wide quote bar streams real-time quotes – functionality that Charles Schwab, ETRADE, and Fidelity do not offer – and includes SnapTicket, a quick trade extension that allows stock and option orders to be placed from any page on the site.

TD Ameritrade also offers a fully customizable sidebar, My Dock, which allows clients to display up to 13 different modules. Modules can be resorted or placed into separate columns, allowing clients with wide-screen monitors to maximize their workflow. While clean and easy to use, I found myself leaving the sidebar collapsed and hidden away. Despite having a 24-inch monitor capable of maximizing the experience, I found it to be a distraction.

I had to dig deep to find flaws in TD Ameritrade’s client experience.
I had to dig deep to find flaws in TD Ameritrade’s client experience. After many hours of testing and comparing, I found two disappointing items that stood out: The My Account Overview experience and adding additional accounts. The default My Account page is data rich but poorly laid out and I found it to be a poor launching pad into my usual workflow. Enabling My Dock in the sidebar did little to patch the user experience. Charles Schwab Trade Source and Fidelity’s new fully responsive Accounts experience are both superior; I know TD Ameritrade can do better.

For managing multiple accounts, I found that each new account I created required a completely new username and password. Once established and logged in, I could then link the new account to my primary user ID. This is a subtle difference from other brokers where you can simply create and add a new brokerage account to your same ID with no trouble. Minor? Yes. However, for clients with multiple accounts, it can be a confusing experience first time through.
Pickiness aside, TD Ameritrade’s platforms (discussed next) have both casual and active traders covered and the same two-pronged approach is applied to mobile, where two separate apps are offered. No doubt, TD Ameritrade shines in the category Ease of Use.
Platforms & Tools

While there are many attractive features in TD Ameritrade, the broker's two platforms are its bread and butter. The flagship platform, thinkorswim, used to be a standalone broker until TD Ameritrade acquired it in 2009.
TD AmeritradeFidelity E*TRADEMerrill EdgeCharles SchwabDesktop Platform (Windows) Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes Charting - Indicators / Studies3701661187340Charting - Drawing Tools2222242215Option Chains - Total Columns3326396234Watch Lists - Total Fields4018013021694
Thinkorswim is designed for advanced traders who want complete flexibility and depth. Furthermore, it can be used by any client with no minimums or specific trade criteria required for access. This is an important advantage over both Fidelity Active Trader Pro and ETRADE Pro, which both require minimums for access.

Run as a desktop application, thinkorswim is so advanced it is rivaled only by TradeStation. A few clicks of the mouse will have dozens of charts streaming real-time data, and even the pickiest trader will be satisfied with the 300+ technical studies available for each chart (highest in the industry), not to mention that each study can be customized thereafter.

Using thinkScript, thinkorswim’s proprietary coding language, traders can even create their own indicators. This is most like TradeStation’s EasyLanguage, which is the only other broker to offer such functionality.
It’s a dazzling array of choices that will set your mind spinning – in a good way.
TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim is also home to a slew of advanced tools. Whether it be company profiling, advanced earnings analysis, plotting FRED data, charting social sentiment, backtesting and replaying historical markets tick by tick, viewing economic and corporate calendars, creating and conducting real-time stock scans, sharing charts and workspace layouts, or performing advanced options analysis, the rabbit hole goes as far as any trader's imagination will take them. It’s a dazzling array of choices that will set your mind spinning – in a good way.

Focusing on the two most recent innovations, adding Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and the new earnings analysis tool, investors can begin to appreciate the endless brain hub stationed at thinkorswim’s Chicago office. Starting with FRED, a publicly accessible US Government database of over 400,000 economic data points; think GDP, CPI, treasury rates, median household income, etc. FRED data is used by institutional investors, hedge funds, and other sophisticated trading operations. In its never-ending quest to level the playing field, the thinkorswim team decided to download all the data, process it, build a custom interface to graph it, and brought it to all TD Ameritrade clients free.

Make no mistake, what thinkorswim has accomplished is truly mind blowing. The only other way to view this data as seamlessly as thinkorswim is to pay up for a Bloomberg terminal.
Make no mistake, what thinkorswim has accomplished is truly mind blowing. The only other way to view this data as seamlessly as thinkorswim is to pay up for a Bloomberg terminal. Once a data set is loaded, it can be tweaked and customized, whichever way the user desires. For sophisticated investors, FRED data is extremely useful in assessing the overall health of the market or specific sectors, which is why institutions pay up to access it via Bloomberg. Thanks to thinkorswim, now any TD Ameritrade client can conduct the same analysis.
Alongside FRED analysis, thinkorswim also launched its new tool for conducting earnings analysis. In my personal trading career, I have analyzed thousands of earnings releases. Heading into an earnings event, the toughest and most time-consuming part is researching historical price action and volatility surrounding previous events, understanding how the earnings were estimated in the eyes of Wall Street, then gauging the significance of any beat or miss. Earnings analysis with thinkorswim does all of this in one clean interface.

Starting with the top row, five days of price action are plotted before and after each earnings release. Next, volatility is plotted over the same time span followed by an At The Money (ATM) straddle (extremely insightful data for options traders seeking patterns and outliers in options market behavior). Finally, using data from Wall Street analysts and crowd-sourced ratings from Estimize, EPS estimate ranges alongside actual results are clearly plotted, providing an efficient way of assessing the company’s results. The whole experience together brings clarity with much less noise. It’s magic.
Both FRED data and the new earnings analysis experience launched in 2016 are two examples of many where TD Ameritrade continues to innovate and push the envelope of what is available for traders.
Both FRED data and the new earnings analysis experience launched in 2016 are two examples of many where TD Ameritrade continues to innovate and push the envelope of what is available for traders. For casual and active traders, earnings analysis with thinkorswim is truly a work of art and the best new trader tool of 2017 in my books.
One of my gripes with thinkorswim back in 2013 and 2014 was the platform’s reliability during volatile markets. On highly volatile and active trading days when there would be a large influx of clients using the system, thinkorswim would lag noticeably – sometimes for lengthy periods. Growing pains are no fun, and while it took longer than clients had hoped for, thinkorswim addressed them all. Today, thanks to the thinkorswim reskin in 2015, alongside a slew of infrastructure updates in both 2015 and 2016, thinkorswim hums along with no trouble at all. In 2017, active traders should be confident relying on thinkorswim to provide a seamless experience, regardless of the market environment.
Platform thinkorswim aside, TD Ameritrade also has a web-based platform, Trade Architect, which is designed with more casual investors in mind. The tools and functionality are purposely kept simple, and the design is clean with visual flare. Everything ran smoothly in my Chrome browser, bug-free, and I quickly became a fan of the platform-wide streaming real-time quotes.

From testing every broker, the streaming watch list functionality Trade Architect offers is my favorite. It isn't just the superb layout, but also the flexibility, ease of use, and depth of data available. The layout is completely customizable, and it’s great having access to visual data such as quote trends, trade trends, 52-week range, and a strength meter.

The bottom line is simple: when it comes to Platforms & Tools in 2017, for the sixth year in a row, TD Ameritrade is on top.
Mobile Trading

With mobile trading, TD Ameritrade took a different approach by offering not one, but two smartphone apps: TD Ameritrade Mobile and TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader. TD Ameritrade Mobile is designed for new and casual investors, while TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader is designed for the feature-hungry active trader.
Having two separate apps has its noticeable pros and cons.
Having two separate apps has its noticeable pros and cons. On the pros side, the apps can hone in on their individual target users and provide a specific experience. On the cons side, it is easy to confuse the two apps initially and not know which one is right for you. Also, some of the functionality that is built for one could really be beneficial on the other, for example basic price alerts, so it can be tricky at times to find the right home as a client.

Looking at specific functionality, TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader is “where the magic happens,” so to speak. Advanced charting, with a staggering 328 different technical studies, is available alongside a full array of order options. An extremely smooth interface for advanced equities trades as well as a seamless experience for complex options trades are compelling features. In my view, this combination is the best in the industry.

In 2015, TD Ameritrade released in-app chat support and mobile desktop linking, both for the Mobile Trader app. In-app chat support allows users to use their mobile devices and chat with a customer service agent for live help, which includes screen sharing. Linking enables users to link the thinkorswim desktop platform to the Mobile Trader app. Click on the quotes tab, select a color next to the search bar that matches a chart or similar in thinkorswim, then pull up any quote, and thinkorswim will follow suite.
In 2016, the updates were across the board. With TD Ameritrade Mobile, highlights included Touch ID login alongside customized positions and watch list views, and the addition of Social Signals analysis. A Windows 10 app was also launched. For Mobile Trader, access to saved orders was added with deeper linking to thinkorswim desktop.

It would be great to see screening and advanced alerts added to TD Ameritrade’s Mobile Trader in 2017. In TD Ameritrade Mobile, it would also be nice to be able to chart portfolio performance against the overall market and be able to set basic price alerts.
When all 52 variables are factored in for the Mobile Trading category, TD Ameritrade came away with 95% of possible points in our 2017 Review, edging out long-time industry leader E*TRADE, and taking first place overall.

Other Notes
Regarding TD Ameritrade’s educational offering, the company was again the only broker to ace the category in our 2017 Review and receive a perfect five-star rating. Over 200 videos are available, including endless education webinars and articles through thinkMoney magazine and The Ticker Tape. Content is organized into courses with quizzes and the chance to earn points alongside badges to encourage further learning.

TD Ameritrade also extends education into colleges across the United States with its annual thinkorswim Challenge. October 2016 was the third challenge, in which 726 teams across 49 states competed.
Finally yet importantly, TD Ameritrade entered the robo advisor space in 2016 with the launch of TD Ameritrade Essential Portfolios. Read our full review of TD Ameritrade Essential Portfolios.
Final Thoughts
TD Ameritrade is one of those companies that just gets it. They understand their clients and the value of a high-quality user experience, and they know what it takes to stay ahead of the competition.
Any investor, new or seasoned, will find TD Ameritrade a great fit for their needs. The main gripe with the broker is cost, but what you pay for is what you get, and the quality delivered by TD Ameritrade is, undoubtedly worth the extra few dollars per trade.
For online investing and trading in 2017, TD Ameritrade ranks #1 Overall.
Methodology
For our 2017 Stock Broker Review we assessed, rated, and ranked sixteen different online brokers over a period of six months. In total, we conducted 349 customer service tests, collected 5,277 data points, and produced over 40,000 words of research. How we test.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Composite Score:





                        Liberty Mutual Group has received 3.76 out of 5 stars based on 245 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
