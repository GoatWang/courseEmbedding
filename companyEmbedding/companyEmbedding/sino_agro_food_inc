Tri-way Industries Ltd. Raises Consumer Awareness
Media Extol APRAS Indoor Aquaculture; Highlight Product Quality
PR Newswire
GUANGZHOU, China, July 25, 2017

GUANGZHOU, China, July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
Sino Agro Food, Inc. (OTCQX: SIAF | OSE: SIAF-ME), a specialized investment company focused on protein food including seafood and cattle, announces recognition of its APRAS aquaculture technology and products of its former subsidiary, Tri-way Industries ("TW"), in which Sino Agro Food, Inc. holds a 36.6% ownership interest.
Earlier, the Company announced two very significant milestones in the ongoing development and build-out of TW; namely, a 5A-1 rating from Dun & Bradstreet (July 10, 2017 press release), and signing a Bank Enterprise Comprehensive Cooperation Agreement containing a credit facility of RMB 100 million with Agricultural Bank of China (July 17, 2017 press release). The press releases are found on our website:

http://sinoagrofood.investorroom.com/Tri-way_5A1, and

http://sinoagrofood.investorroom.com/TW-ABC_BECSCA
Now, Tri-way is proud to announce that its operations are gaining media recognition throughout the Guangdong province, a province whose Gross Domestic Product exceeds USD 1.2 trillion; the largest provincial GDP in mainland China.
Aquafarm 4 Prominently Featured in Two Television Broadcasts
A Zhongshan station recently aired the first in a series of news segments at TW's Aquaculture Farm 4, highlighting it as one of a select few facilities that meet the highest government standards for food safety and sanitation in the production of live seafood. The APRAS technology produces chemical-free seafood, allowing for premium pricing of this coveted product line, both domestically and internationally.
Guangdong's NanFang, a regional Chinese broadcast station covering an area of approximately 100 million people, aired a full edutainment program highlighting the APRAS technology, and including an interview with SIAF's Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Anthony Ostrowski. The show features several celebrity chefs examining the indoor tanks and later sampling silver cod, jade perch, mandarin fish, tilapia, sleepy cod, and salt water prawns.
These broadcasts as well as supporting material will be available shortly in the Tri-way section of Sino Agro Food's web site: http://www.sinoagrofood.com/content/AF4_2017
CEO and CSO Commentary
Mr. Solomon Lee, interim Chairman of TW as well as Chairman and CEO of Sino Agro Food, Inc., expressed his sincere appreciation for the recent media coverage, adding, "our mission remains threefold; to produce great product, to market great product, and to distribute great product. TV stations such as ZSTV and NanFang TV allow us to reach their extensive viewing areas helping to broaden brand awareness and publicize the benefits of indoor farmed seafood. We believe on-going press coverage will further several aims:

Facilitate sell-through to consumers directly, through e-commerce, and from our wholesale customers,

Consolidate and extend premium pricing, and

Potentially broaden the footprint of Capital Award's APRAS technology within China, and possibly into other Asian countries."
SIAF Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Anthony Ostrowski offered additional perspective, "The ocean supply of seafood has remained stagnant since the mid-1980s while the demand worldwide, and especially in China is increasing rapidly. In addition, as more and more Chinese enter the middle class, specific demand for safe and sustainably produced seafood is rising quickly. Aquafarm 4 is a large-scale model for technologically advanced indoor and environmentally friendly aquaculture production of safe, high-quality, and healthy seafood. The farm already enjoys a competitive advantage for freshness, owing to its valuable location adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, bordering Shenzhen and Guangzhou to the north, within 100 miles of tens of millions of people.
"Longer term plans call for the Zhongshan facility to produce well over 100,000 metric tons of prawns and fish annually. Likewise, Tri-way is working toward an integrated set of facilities and processes to become vertically integrated with respect to life cycle — from its own selectively-bred broodstock and in-house hatchery seed supplies through grow-out and sale — of genetically and environmentally controlled, biosecure and, ultimately, internationally certified sustainable seafood."

Sino Agro Food, Inc. “Green And Natural” Dairy Products Land On Major Retail Shelves, Exports Set For Distribution To Malaysia And Singapore






Business Wire




Apr 29, 2010 8:30 AM EDT













 


















































  Sino Agro Food, Inc. (PINK SHEETS: SIAF), an emerging integrated, diversified agriculture technology and organic food company with subsidiaries operating in China, is pleased to announce its organic dairy product label, “Green and Natural” is appearing and selling on major retailer shelves in Beijing, China, while preparations are underway for its export to Malaysia and Singapore.  Currently the full line of “Green and Natural” certified organic dairy products are being sold through select Wal-Mart® and Hualian Supermarket locations in Beijing, China. The “Green and Natural” products are also selling through smaller independent retailers.  The Company is currently processing Country of Origin, Health Department and Quality Analysis Certifications with the proper authorities to begin exporting select lines of “Green and Natural” products to Malaysia and Singapore. The Company is also working to establish franchised buyer groups, marketing and distribution networks within Singapore for further distribution to the Middle East, Indonesia and Thailand.  Initial plans are to export up to 2,000 Metric Tons in 2010 with exports increasing to approximately 5,000 Metric Tons in 2011. This represents approximately 7% of total dairy production and 70% of total retail dairy sales for 2010.  Mr. Lee Solomon, Sino Agro Food, Inc. CEO, stated, “We are establishing exports in our name brand dairy products for two reasons. First, we anticipate an increase in name brand recognition for our “Green and Natural” product line globally. Second, by exporting our branded products globally, we expect broader acceptance of our products domestically in China where the dairy industry has experienced many setbacks. Combined, we anticipate these actions to increase overall sales and awareness of our branded lines of dairy products.”  The Company also would like to update shareholders on progress related to the filing of its Form 10 and previously announced dividend. The Company’s PCAOB auditor, Madsen and Associates, CPA has requested information pertaining to subsequent events, financial forecasts through 2013 and comments on both the HU and Dairy operations. Due to accelerated growth in both the Dairy and HU Plantation operations, delays have unfortunately been a part of the process. The Company is working diligently with its auditor to respond to questions as quickly as possible.

Sino Agro Food Inc. (OTCQX: SIAF | OSE: SIAF-ME), a United States corporation, is a vertically integrated and diversified protein food company with subsidiaries operating in the People's Republic of China. Focused on developing, producing and distributing high margin, high quality agricultural products, the Company intends to meet the increasing demands of China's growing middle class for gourmet and high quality food items, principally sustainable seafood and organic beef.
The Company's largest and most scalable businesses produce protein food, via technologically advanced aquaculture that delivers a variety of seafood (prawns, eel, sleepy cod), and state of the art livestock production of over 60 cuts of beef and lamb. Both businesses fit the Company's "farm to plate" concept with protein foods being nurtured from birth with proprietary feeds and technology to end sale of live and packaged products. In aquaculture operations, the Company uses our exclusive 11th-generation A Power Recirculating Aquaculture System ("APRAS") that features indoor tanks with continuously clean recirculating water, and include controlled feed, temperature, salinity, and growth environments. APRAS eliminates the need for hormones, antibiotics, other drugs, or chemicals, to produce sustainable seafood of premium quality. In the case of beef and lamb protein products, live cattle is grazed on specified grasses grown with our proprietary fertilizers and methods; raised and fattened using proprietary livestock feed; deboned and packaged at the Company's abattoir, and sold through wholesale and retail outlets. To supplement our production of protein food, the Company imports and distributes premium Angus beef from Australia, and quality seafood from Madagascar.

Key Points
Summary Financials 
Results reflect the carve-out of aquaculture operations announced March 2. Income from Sino Agro's 36.6% interest in the carved-out company, Tri-Way Industries Ltd. is reported as "income from unconsolidated equity investee." Net income from the sale of goods for 2016 from the former aquaculture business segment is reported as "net income from discontinued operations."

Quarterly revenue from continuing operations increased by 27% year over year to USD 70.6M (55.8). Revenue from the sale of goods increased by USD 14.8M, or 35%, to USD 57.4M (42.6), while revenue from project development of USD 13.2M remained steady when compared to Q1 2016 (13.1).


Gross profit from the sale of goods for Q1, 2017 declined 12% to USD 10.0M (11.4), while the gross profit from project development increased 22% to USD 4.4M (3.6).


Net income attributable to SIAF stockholders increased by 1% to USD 8.7 (8.6, with fully diluted earnings per share of USD .36.


As of March 31 2017, the Company had net working capital of USD 302.2M.


Stockholders' equity increased by USD 9.7M to USD 614.4M or USD 24.78 per share, based on the weighted average number of fully diluted outstanding shares in the quarter.

Core Businesses and Outlook 
SIAF believes that its Carve-out spinoff ("COSO") strategy to restructure its businesses into standalone companies while retaining significant equity stakes in each one will:

Create well capitalized endeavors receiving peer group valuations on suitable exchanges, and


Result in higher long-term returns on investments from having spent resources today to open opportunities provided by the protein food arenas in China, tomorrow.

The carve-out of aquaculture operations into Tri-Way Industries Inc. Ltd. provides the blueprint for bringing operations with a proven track record and credible projections onto the Hong Kong exchange or a main China exchange, with markers imputing increasing value along the way. For instance, having substantially completed renovations and modernization at AquaFarm 1 ("AF1"), AF2, and AF3 before the transaction closing was designed to tailor assets for easy handover and to jumpstart performance toward an IPO. In addition, the 36.6% equity stake retained by SIAF is confidently expected to be solidly accretive to earnings in 2017 when compared to the previous year. Current estimates show an improvement in realized gross profits upwards of 65% resulting from the new structure versus the carve-out having not been exercised.
Executing on this strategy comprises the Company's foremost and most beneficial corporate initiatives throughout 2017 on behalf of its shareholders. Preparing assets for optimal appreciation, the COSO process will guide the Company's strategy throughout 2017.
Integrated Cattle (SJAP)
SJAP has three revenue drivers: sale of livestock feed and fertilizer at SJAP; sale of live cattle; and value added processing at the abattoir of SJAP's wholly owned subsidiary, Qinghai Zhong He Meat Products ("QZH").
Overall Q1 2017 revenue from the sector decreased year over year by 17% to USD 21.8M (26.3M) contributing to a 50% decrease in gross profits to USD 4.2M (8.3M). The value added component accounted for 88% of the gross profit decline. All three components were affected to various degrees by unstable market conditions, with the biggest factors being margin pressure on imported beef due to increased competition from more exports entering the China market.
These external factors are volatile, with pricing and demand fluctuating quarter to quarter. Into these headwinds in Q1 2017, SJAP did manage a positive blended gross profit margin of 19% (31.5%).
The Company had initiated plans to increase overall profitability, primarily upgrading its line of cattle directing toward the high-end market and adding to its range of value added products, including canned beef products. These operational enhancements were part of the efforts to prepare SJAP for maximum valuation while the company concurrently used the aquaculture COSO strategy as a blueprint for SJAP – including sourcing capital needs through third parties and targeting a listing on the NEEQ ("Third Board") of the Shanghai stock exchange some time in 2018. Now, because of additional more sweeping plans resulting from an understanding with the Xining government, SIAF intends to list SJAP on the main board in either Shanghai or Shenzhen.
During Q1 the Xining government engaged SJAP in discussions aimed to help the cattle and beef industry and promote economic development in the district, which boasts annual production of over four million head of cattle. SJAP was selected as the lead company to coordinate and carry out regional plans over time. While adhering to its original company specific plan, the main features of this overarching coordinated plan include:

Through a Joint-Use Agreement with the District Government, concentrating and centralizing all slaughterhouse operations in the Xining District to SJAP's facility by funneling existing abattoir companies to one location.


Creating a main cattle and meat center for wholesaling, cold storage, down-stream distribution, processing of value-added products, and other logistics, trade, and support activities. SJAP has been chosen to become one of the leading companies operating such a business.


The government intends to provide SJAP with additional commercially and industrially zoned land adjacent to its existing site. This will increase SJAP's valuable "land bank" by 170%.


The government will also provide SJAP additional land at a second location to move its existing operations, apart from value added processing.


SJAP will expand the co-operative farming model to mold local growers and farmers into a united team with the aim of helping all farmers out of poverty by the end of 2018.


The government has agreed to support SJAP in an effort to procure a listing on the main stock exchange board either in Shanghai or Shenzhen. SJAP believes the government's support will facilitate a successful listing effort and that the main board offers many advantages, likely including a higher valuation. If listed, the company shares will be designated as "domestically listed foreign investment shares," enabling foreign investors to trade shares globally.

SIAF and SJAP are honored by the government's recognition and excited by the prospects it bestows. SIAF has invited a main board listed company to join the SJAP team to help promote these goals, including procuring project financing.
Project Development -- Capital Award (CA)
Capital Award remains a wholly owned subsidiary after the carve-out transaction. It will no longer earn revenue derived from the sale of goods. It will be the turnkey provider of development services for Tri-Way in China, although not necessarily limited to Tri-Way or China. CA will also derive revenue in the future from license fees for its A-Power Recirculating Aquaculture System technology.
Q1 revenue increased slightly year over year by USD 63,000 to USD 13.2M (13.1M). Cost of goods decreased by USD 728,000, driving a 22% increase in Y-O-Y gross profit to USD 4.4M (3.6M). Margins vary quarter to quarter, depending on the type of work performed.
        Discontinued Operations (Aquaculture sale of goods)
In early March, the Company announced the successful carve-out of its interests in aquaculture assets:

The carve-out now holds SIAF's previously held assets, namely AF1; and acquired assets from their respective owners/investors, including SIAF, namely AF 2, 3, 4, and 5; as well as rights to technology licensed from Capital Award a wholly owned subsidiary of SIAF


SIAF holds an equity interest of 36.6% in the carved-out, separate Hong Kong domiciled corporation, Tri-Way Industries, Ltd.


The certified fair value of SIAF's equity interest is $124.7M (36.6% of $340.5M). SIAF booked a revised, audited deemed gain on sale of $56.9M in relation to the transaction.

In the future Tri-Way will provide periodic updates on its progress and development. SIAF, as a major stakeholder in Tri-way, will also provide periodic updates of milestones and markers related to both production and strategic progress, either as web updates or standalone press releases. Quarterly results will provide a breakdown of production volumes and prospects for each AquaFarm operation, as they materialize.
Seafood and Meat Trading
Quarterly revenue increased by 261% Y-O-Y to USD $23.1M (6.4M). The increase was primarily due to scaling the business toward capacity and sourcing seafood from multiple countries instead of solely from Madagascar, as in the past.
Gross profit grew 173% to USD 2.6M (.9M) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, generating a blended gross margin of 11%. While accounting for 32% of total revenue, both the revenue and gross profit for seafood each grew 399% Y-O-Y.
Increased competition in beef imports caused the cost of goods rate to increase slightly more than the rate of revenue.
The import Trading business continues to be a reliable and growing operation.
Carve-out Exercises 
The Company firmly believes that the sum of its parts is worth considerably more than the market's value of the whole. Accordingly, it has undertaken efforts to carve out its major businesses, establishing each as a standalone corporate entity. These carve-out enterprises will seek to establish value within the same financial measures afforded peer group companies, establishing step-wise increasing valuations in part through private placement prior to applying to higher valued market exchanges for IPO.
Major milestones reached in the process will reflect progress, imputed value, and liquidity; completing the aquaculture carve-out was the first.
Upcoming steps are as follows:

Tri-Way has begun work with its appointed Hong Kong based Corporate Service Company ("HKCS") to issue and allocate Tri-Way shares in bookkeeping form to respective owners including SIAF's 36.6% interest and the remaining 63,4% among approximately 50 original investors/partners. As of April 27,2017 HKSC records reflected 36.6M shares of Tri-Way having been allocated to the Company, the issuance of which is anticipated to completed at the end of May.


Upon completion, HKCS will file corresponding documents to the Hong Kong Company Register noting paid up capital estimated at USD 340M and total outstanding shares of 100M at a par value of HKD 1 each. This submission of corresponding documents will occur 10 days after share issuance.


Concurrently, SIAF is working with U.S. attorneys preparing required documentation for submission to the SEC in preparation for the distribution of a dividend in the form of Tri-Way shares, totaling 18.3% of Tri-Ways equity shares. Broadridge Solutions, the Company's transfer agent in the U.S. will distribute the dividend in book entry form pending SEC and FINRA approvals, targeting completion by the end of July.


Tri-Way and its investment banker are preparing presentation with attendant legal and accounting materials to initiate a Private Placement Program including road shows, PR/IR programs, and readiness for due diligence processes by interested investors. Completion is targeted to commence mid-July.


At the same time, apart from equity financing, Tri-Way is working with several other reputable investment banks to secure alternative or complementary debt financing. One bank completed its due diligence last month presenting the possibility of securing a loan facility in May; others have started the process in May.


With respect to the facility offer of USD 36.3M granted by a local bank to JFD China, this facility is purposed for working capital to be utilized after new facilities have been developed, and their respective operational costs warrant a drawdown on the LOC

These steps and others to follow provide the blueprint for later COSO candidates, with SJAP on deck.
Share Count 
The total issued and outstanding share count ("TIO") as of December 31, 2016 was 22,726,859. As of May 13, 2017, TIO share count is 23,994,199. The additional shares were utilized to secure/underwrite a loan on behalf of Tri-Way from a third party lender. 
The figure includes shares issued as collateral for credit loan facilities and other debt. At any given time, there are a variable number of such shares within the total issued and outstanding. It important to note that subject to some customary provisions, these shares must be returned to SIAF upon debt repayment. A commonality would be these shares likened to a lien on property in the sense that neither dilutes equity. These shares do not carry voting rights, nor are they eligible for dividend disbursements. For example, these shares would not be eligible for Tri-Way shares once a dividend is declared.  
The Company is rather confident that Tri-Way will be successful in its fundraising program to self-finance its CapEx requirements. As well, SJAP has been making progress toward self-funding. As such, both Tri-Way and SJAP soon will no longer be as dependent on SIAF to provide bridge financing. Thus, the Company should be positioned to repurchase both collateral shares from its lenders as well as from the market to help improve overall share value in the near future. 
CEO Commentary 
Sino Agro Food's Chairman and CEO Solomon Lee addressed the quarter and 2017 corporate strategies:
"We entered 2017 with strong momentum, having undertaken a series of initiatives in 2016 to position our operations to continue growth trajectories while making significant progress on our strategic plan to restructure the business and maximize value for shareholders. During the quarter, we announced the successful completion of the carve-out of our aquaculture operations into Tri-Way Industries Ltd., a Hong Kong domiciled corporation. An independent valuation determined that the certified fair value of the transacted assets to be USD 340.6M. Sino Agro Food, "the parent," holds a 36.6% equity interest equating to USD 124.7M, or USD 5.03 per share SIAF share, based on the weighted average number of fully diluted outstanding shares in the quarter.
"The Company has long believed that its embedded businesses are undervalued in the current structure and as traded on the current exchanges. The carve-out was a major step in our Carve-out/Spinoff ("COSO") strategy designed to accomplish several significant, related objectives:

Foremost, the COSO strategy aims to demonstrate increasing valuations backed by third party assessment, third party investment, and new exchange trading, where the assets are expected to be valued commensurate with "pure play" peers. The carve-out valuation already resulted in a deemed gain on sale of $56.9M. Further stepped up valuations are targeted through pre-IPO investment(s) and ultimately an IPO.


The new organization for the aquaculture business will support accelerated growth due to its streamlined business structure. Furthermore, it is now better suited for infusions of working and development capital. The transferred assets have recently undergone renovations and modernizations to improve their interoperability and to prime them to increase production growth rate targets.


Retain a substantial interest in the self-sufficient spun off companies which are expected to generate sufficient cash to self-fund capital expenditures after the initial debt and/or equity financing(s), while also distributing dividend shares to SIAF shareholders.


After maturing businesses and demonstrating scalability, and COSO steps are realized, SIAF, "the parent," is expected to become a more streamlined and flexible company. As development capital expenditures become the responsibility of the "children" companies, SIAF expects to increase free cash flow with the intent to distribute it in the form of cash dividends and/or a share buyback program.

"Our primary objectives for 2017 are to increase returns from our aquaculture investment at a larger scale; likewise, for other business segments as the right opportunities surface. We are now in a strong position to capitalize on the new capacity developed in 2015 and 2016, and look forward to moving toward actualizing properly appreciated IPO valuations.
"Although the COSO strategy is an inherently long and complex process, we are proud of our accomplishments to date in the aquaculture business, and are encouraged by the current timeline for progress as outlined in the "Carve-out" section above. Discussions with our advisors and investment banker support this milestone path; likewise, they reinforce our firm belief that the sum of our business parts is worth considerably more than the market's value of the whole. I am very confident that the strategy will succeed in unlocking substantial value for our shareholders, as steps along the way are designed to evidence.
"Buoyed by encouragement to date, your management team remains committed to fulfilling the COSO strategy, starting with the aquaculture business. At the same time, the team is further encouraged to manage and grow all businesses efficiently. The beef business (SJAP) is facing unstable markets as noted earlier in this release. In a very real sense, these challenges have presented an opportunity to collaborate with the provincial government to develop a plan that from our perspective will better position SJAP as a major player in the China beef market, culminating with a listing on the main board in China, either in Shanghai or Shenzhen.
"This was a strong start to the year and we will continue to execute against our strategic plan to reach the milestones outlined above during this pivotal time in the Company's evolution."

Momentum Builds on Microcap Sino Agro Food Inc (OTCMKTS:SIAF)

By Jermaine Farmer -  July 27, 2017 


SHARE

Facebook
Twitter






Sino Agro Food Inc (OTCMKTS:SIAF) is a microcap name that has started to engage some focus among traders and investors as prices get a little traction in bounce mode. The key catalyst driving SIAF’s recent action was the company’s strong recognition of its APRAS aquaculture technology and products of its former subsidiary, Tri-way Industries, in which Sino Agro Food, Inc. holds a 36.6% ownership interest. In other words, the company is proud of its baby, which appears to be off to a great start – a trend of results that could come back to reflect financially on the parent company, SIAF, over time.
According to the release, earlier, the Company announced two very significant milestones in the ongoing development and build-out of TW; namely, a 5A-1 rating from Dun & Bradstreet (July 10, 2017 press release), and signing a Bank Enterprise Comprehensive Cooperation Agreement containing a credit facility of RMB 100 million with Agricultural Bank of China (July 17, 2017 press release).
Sino Agro Food Inc (OTCMKTS:SIAF) bills itself as an agriculture technology and natural food holding company with principal operations in the People’s Republic of China.
SIAF acquires and maintains equity stakes in a cohesive portfolio of joint venture businesses that they form according to its core mission to produce, distribute, market and sell natural, sustainable protein food and produce, primarily seafood and beef, to the rapidly growing middle class in China.
Sino provides financial oversight and strategic direction for each company, and for the interoperation between companies. The Company owns or licenses patents, proprietary methods, and other intellectual properties in fertilizer, livestock feed, indoor recirculating aquaculture systems, and other arenas of agricultural technology.
Additionally, the company provides consulting and services to joint venture partners to construct and operate food businesses, primarily producing wholesale protein foods. Additional joint ventures market and distribute the wholesale products as part of a vertically integrated “farm to table” concept and business strategy.
SIAF employs 595 employees primarily in three provinces: Guangdong (Guangzhou), Quinghai (Xining), and Hunan (Linli), with some distribution and retail operations in Shanghai and Beijing.

As noted above, SIAF wishes to point out the success and recognition being piled onto the shoulders of its former subsidiary, and current large holding, Tri-Way.
Management is obviously highly stoked about these events. Mr. Solomon Lee, interim Chairman of TW as well as Chairman and CEO of Sino Agro Food, Inc., expressed his sincere appreciation for the recent media coverage, adding, “our mission remains threefold; to produce great product, to market great product, and to distribute great product. TV stations such as ZSTV and NanFang TV allow us to reach their extensive viewing areas helping to broaden brand awareness and publicize the benefits of indoor farmed seafood. We believe on-going press coverage will further several aims:
We’ve witnessed 13% added to share values of the listing over the past month of action, but that move comes in the context of a larger bearish trend. The situation may be worth watching. SIAF has a history of dramatic rallies. Furthermore, the stock has seen interest climb, with an increase in recent trading volume of above 220% over the long run average.
It pays to take note of this fact with a float in play that’s limited — around 14.4M shares. Traders should not overlook this combination, as a mechanically driven price squeeze can result from this type of mix of small float and ramping attention from traders.
At this time, carrying a capital value in the market of $64.3M, SIAF has a significant war chest ($20.7M) of reported cash on the books, which compares with about $4.1M in total current liabilities. SIAF is pulling in trailing 12-month revenues of $390.9M. However, the company is seeing declines on the top line on a quarterly y/y basis, with revenues falling at -28%. This is an exciting story, and we look forward to a follow-up chapter as events transpire.

Research & Development and Product Certification Division | Sino Agro Food, Inc - integrated and diversified organic food for China

Value Orientation
Sino Agro Food, Inc. operates as a value-oriented company opting to invest in long-term growth and value maximization to ensure the sustainability of the company and investor value. Its corporate mission and governance are to supply protein that is produced in a biologically, environmentally, socially, and economical way. This is consistent with the central Chinese government’s recent 12th Five-Year Plan to promote modern agriculture practices in China and to focus on the social needs and well-being of its workers.
Following successful implementation of its first five year plan using APRAS technology and its business model, SIAF is now poised to take on the next, and new phase of large growth and expansion of operations and to enhance its credibility as supplier of safe, and holistically produced products. The Company already has strong operations combining eleventh-generation APRAS systems and existing species in its own and JV operations, implementing good production practices, and researching improvements to current production schemes. An expanded, more sophisticated, and integrated R&D program is needed as operations, intensify and pressures for efficiencies and rapid response increase in response to a more competitive posture in the marketplace.
Expanding Value via the RDC Division
The goal of the Research, Development, and Certification (RDC) division of SIAF is to provide a sound scientific basis for continued improvement and creation of new SIAF technologies, products and services that are consistent with the sustainability mission of the company and further enhance the reliability and competitive advantage of its technologies and credibility of its products in the marketplace.

In 2014, the World Resources Institute noted that aquaculture production can grow sustainably through investment in technological innovation and transfers, specifically breeding and hatchery technology, disease control, feeds and nutrition and development of low-impact systems. Integration of these areas is targeted to meet future challenges. In addition, this research would lead to new technologies, products, and services that can themselves compete in the marketplace and become key drivers of the division’s business plan.
Further, in response to growing consumer demands, the worldwide seafood industry is rapidly adopting food safety and traceability programs that certify the process of production as biologically, environmentally, and socially responsible.  The ability to trace the product from its initial growing to final distribution is an essential component of that process certification and core to the company’s “Farm-to Plate” model.  While quantitative benefits do occur through protection of public health, improved trade, strengthened sustainability practices, reduced recall scope, increase consumer trust, and quality assurance and supply chain efficiencies, SIAF also views Product Certification as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plan. The plans also help to ensure animal health, survival and growth through implementation of best management practices (BMPs), and operational efficiencies in tracking stocks. SIAF will seek both domestic and international recognition of its products through verifiable third-party programs.
Key RDC Areas
1. Selective Breeding
Most major production advances in animal agriculture have come through selective breeding. SIAF targets pedigreed, Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) breeding programs for targeted species.
      
2. Nutrition and Feeds
Feed comprises the primary production cost of any aquaculture operation. SIAF targets species nutritional requirements, alternative ingredients, and improved feed processing methods.
      
3. Disease Prevention and Control
Disease prevention and control is paramount to risk management, continued operations, and healthy products. SIAF targets Best Management Practices and research on non-excludable pathogens.
      
4. Production System Management
New species development and continued system improvements will keep APRAS system competitive. SIAF will target applied research on the newest technologies.
      
5. Product Certification (and Traceability)
Certification ensures consumers that products are traceable throughout the entire production process, and that the process by which they are raised is biologically, environmentally, and socially responsible. SIAF will target third party process certification programs for both the domestic and export market.

Jiangmen City Heng Sheng Tai Agriculture Development Co. Ltd. (JHST) is a Sino-Foreign Joint Venture (SFJV) company that is a 75% owned subsidiary of Sino Agro Food, Inc. JHST operates the Company's plantation, situated at Enping City, Guangdong Province. Revenue for three months ended 30 September 2015 was USD 7.4 million, or 6 percent of the Group's total revenue of USD 124.7 million in the same period.
JHST's primary crop is Hylocereus Undatus (HU), the most cultivated species of cactus in the world. HU produces a fruit crop, Red Pitaya, widely known as Dragon Fruit. Before 2003, the main supply of HU flowers was from 50,000 acres of plantations in Guangdong Province. Since then, industrialization has reduced the plantation acreage to fewer than 4,000 acres. Fresh and dried flowers of HU Plants are traditionally marketed in China as well as in other Asian countries as a form of health food customarily consumed by the Chinese population for many centuries. HU is very important in traditional Chinese medicine.
Dried HU flowers in packaging
The Company plants a special selenium rich Chinese herb called “XueYingZi” among the HU Plants. It is called “Snowsakurako” in Japan, and commonly referred to as “Immortal Vegetable” in China.
JHST cultivates 187 acres of HU flowers in Guangdong Province. The HU plants flower for a very short period, sometimes only one night, and must be picked before they turn from green to white 20 to 25 cm long flowers, so they are by definition a delicate crop. The harvesting season is from July through October.
Recent Developments
Revenue in Q3 2105 was $7.4M, an increase of 28% over Q2 2014
Gross profits in Q3 2015 were $4.9M, an increase of 20% over Q2 2015
Persistent improvements in past years at the HU plantation have succeeded in providing a more reliable, healthy harvest, even in seasons of heavy rain.

Benefits of Hylocereus Undatus
Loaded with antioxidants, vitamin C, phosphorus, calcium, proteins, and beneficial fiber, unpicked HU flowers develop into a most nutritious exotic fruit. HU's fresh and dried flowers, though, have very valuable uses in traditional Chinese medicine, including:
detoxify the body; protect the stomach lining
slow aging process, invigorate brain cells, prevent dementia
skin care
weight loss
normalize blood pressure
prevent colorectal cancer

Tri-way Industries Ltd. Raises Consumer Awareness

Tri-way Industries Ltd. Raises Consumer Awareness
Tue, Jul 25, 2017 09:31 EST
Media Extol APRAS Indoor Aquaculture; Highlight Product Quality

GUANGZHOU, China-- Sino Agro Food, Inc. (OTCQX: SIAF | OSE: SIAF-ME), a specialized investment company focused on protein food including seafood and cattle, announces recognition of its APRAS aquaculture technology and products of its former subsidiary, Tri-way Industries (“TW”), in which Sino Agro Food, Inc. holds a 36.6% ownership interest.

Earlier, the Company announced two very significant milestones in the ongoing development and build-out of TW; namely, a 5A-1 rating from Dun & Bradstreet (July 10, 2017 press release), and signing a Bank Enterprise Comprehensive Cooperation Agreement containing a credit facility of RMB 100 million with Agricultural Bank of China (July 17, 2017 press release). The press releases are found on our website:


http://sinoagrofood.investorroom.com/Tri-way_5A1
, and

http://sinoagrofood.investorroom.com/TW-ABC_BECSCA


Now, Tri-way is proud to announce that its operations are gaining media recognition throughout the Guangdong province, a province whose Gross Domestic Product exceeds USD 1.2 trillion; the largest provincial GDP in mainland China.

Aquafarm 4 Prominently Featured in Two Television Broadcasts

A Zhongshan station recently aired the first in a series of news segments at TW’s Aquaculture Farm 4, highlighting it as one of a select few facilities that meet the highest government standards for food safety and sanitation in the production of live seafood. The APRAS technology produces chemical-free seafood, allowing for premium pricing of this coveted product line, both domestically and internationally.

Guangdong’s NanFang, a regional Chinese broadcast station covering an area of approximately 100 million people, aired a full edutainment program highlighting the APRAS technology, and including an interview with SIAF’s Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Anthony Ostrowski. The show features several celebrity chefs examining the indoor tanks and later sampling silver cod, jade perch, mandarin fish, tilapia, sleepy cod, and salt water prawns.

These broadcasts as well as supporting material will be available shortly in the Tri-way section of Sino Agro Food’s web site: 
http://www.sinoagrofood.com/content/AF4_2017

CEO and CSO Commentary

Mr. Solomon Lee, interim Chairman of TW as well as Chairman and CEO of Sino Agro Food, Inc., expressed his sincere appreciation for the recent media coverage, adding, “our mission remains threefold; to produce great product, to market great product, and to distribute great product. TV stations such as ZSTV and NanFang TV allow us to reach their extensive viewing areas helping to broaden brand awareness and publicize the benefits of indoor farmed seafood. We believe on-going press coverage will further several aims:


Facilitate sell-through to consumers directly, through e-commerce, and from our wholesale customers,

Consolidate and extend premium pricing, and

Potentially broaden the footprint of Capital Award’s APRAS technology within China, and possibly into other Asian countries.”


SIAF Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Anthony Ostrowski offered additional perspective, “The ocean supply of seafood has remained stagnant since the mid-1980s while the demand worldwide, and especially in China is increasing rapidly. In addition, as more and more Chinese enter the middle class, specific demand for safe and sustainably produced seafood is rising quickly. Aquafarm 4 is a large-scale model for technologically advanced indoor and environmentally friendly aquaculture production of safe, high-quality, and healthy seafood. The farm already enjoys a competitive advantage for freshness, owing to its valuable location adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, bordering Shenzhen and Guangzhou to the north, within 100 miles of tens of millions of people.

“Longer term plans call for the Zhongshan facility to produce well over 100,000 metric tons of prawns and fish annually. Likewise, Tri-way is working toward an integrated set of facilities and processes to become vertically integrated with respect to life cycle — from its own selectively-bred broodstock and in-house hatchery seed supplies through grow-out and sale — of genetically and environmentally controlled, biosecure and, ultimately, internationally certified sustainable seafood.”

SIAF's Organic Fertilizer business segment contains the operations of SIAF's subsidiary Hunan Shenghua A Power Agriculture Co., Ltd. (HSA) in Linli District, Hunan Province. Revenue for three months ended 30 September 2015 was USD 4.9 million, or 4 percent of the Group's total revenue of USD 124.7 million in the same period. Gross profit for the Organic Fertilizer division for the three months ended 30 September 2015 was USD 1.9 million, or 6 percent of the Group's total gross profit of USD 32.3 million in the same period.
The operation in Linli District, Hunan Province, is run by HSA, a 76% owned Chinese subsidiary. HSA conducts the following business activities, both of which are in the development stage:
manufacturing and sales of organic and mixed fertilizer,
cultivation of pastures and crops in preparation for the establishment of beef cattle farms, and
rearing of beef cattle
Organic Fertilizer operations at SIAF's HSA are modeled after those developed at Qinghai Sanjiang A Power Agriculture Co., Ltd. (SJAP). Relevant operations include the manufacturing of fertilizer (consisting of organic fertilizer, 100% pure organic mixed fertilizer and lake fish farming organic fertilizer), and growing of pasture grasses that will be manufactured into livestock feed.

The Corporate business segment primarily carries out the Company's Import and Export and distribution businesses. In addition, it conducts all project development activity that is not aquaculture related. Aquaculture related project development is accounted for in the Capital Award direct subsidiary and Aquaculture business segment.
SIAF conducts all centralized and common corporate functions, including strategic oversight guiding interoperation between project companies, as well as group level initiatives, such as financings, any potential merger and acquisition (M&A) activities, and/or new exchange listings, sometimes in cooperation with the Company's Swedish subsidiary, SIAFS.
Recent Developments
Revenue in Q3 2105 was $10.1M, 23% lower than the year earlier quarter, due to lower seafood sales caused by export restrictions imposed in Madagascar. Import of beef from Australia increased by $6.0M (440%), offsetting the seafood decrease.
As of the end of Q3 2015, the Company is importing seafood from other countries to bridge the shortfall from Madagascar, and is engaged in establishing new suppliers.
Late in 2015, the Company established a trading credit facility with a Shanghai and Hong Kong based Import and Export entity that will increase working capital for the import export division by up to $15M. The facility facilitated securing the exclusive agency for the supply of “CAAB” branded Grain Feed Angus cattle by Thomas Food, a leading supplier of CAAB GF Angus in Australia.
Shanghai Distribution Center
Opened in 2015, the Shanghai Distribution Center imports premium Angus Beef quarters from Australia for distribution at one of Shanghai's newer, modern Wholesale Markets. With over 3000 square meters of offices, warehouse, freezer rooms, seafood tanks, and employee housing, it is situated in an industrial complex not far from the PoTung District, where it acts as a central hub to service the Shanghai wholesale markets, regional distributors, as well as super market chains and restaurants in Shanghai with seafood and meats. The Shanghai Distribution Center targets selling up to 12,000 metric tons of meat and 5,000 metric tons of seafood per year within two years.
The SDC is the first facility in China to employ advanced defrosting technology from Taiwan. Using static electricity, beef quarters are transformed from frozen to perfectly chilled beef within 24 hours, without the usual effects of defrosting (e.g., soggy meat that drips liquid). The beef is also aged during this chilling process. The SDC also imports live seafood, which it distributes to retail establishments and restaurants in Shanghai.
Wholesale Centers 1 and 2 (WC1 and WC2)
SIAF's Wholesale and Distribution Facilities development project for Guangzhou City NaWei Trading Co., Ltd. (NWT), included design, construction, and project management of the business operation of a specialized, modern beef wholesale and distribution center (Wholesale Center 2 or WC2). The freezing room facility has the capacity to store up to 150 MT of frozen food at -25° Celsius. Facilities at WC1 and WC2 include a wholesale shop, packaging and processing facility, office, dry goods storage, and function rooms.
Leonie’s Restaurants and Commissaries
The Leonie's restaurant chain completed its Central Kitchen, and the Central Bakery has been in operation since May 2013. Five restaurants are complete. The Central Kitchen and related facilities development project is complete, including design, construction, project management of development, and management of business operation for Guangzhou City Wangxiangcheng (WXC), an unrelated Chinese company. This project (Central Facility 1) includes a Central Kitchen, a Central Bakery, a fast food restaurant, and three mobile food stores situated adjacent to WC2. SIAF continues to manage the Leonie’s restaurant development project, including design, construction, project management, and management of business operations for WXC.
Work is in progress on the expansion of the Restaurant (4) at Zhongshan City. Renovation and alteration of Leonie's Restaurant 1 turned it into a Steak House that successfully caters to an average over 500 customers per day. Each weekend, there are long lines of waiting diners.
We have established five restaurants, and at this time three of them are profitable. We aim to improve the financial performance of the other two, now that we have established three viable concepts that are well received by the middle class.
The small meat and seafood shop (semi-wholesale and mainly retail) began operation in Q3 2014, we expect it to be self-sustaining in its early days of operation, and target that it will be profitable within 3 months of operation.
Import Export Trading
In Madagascar, the Company affiliates with local businessmen that supply processed seafood (i.e., cooked and peeled frozen crayfish and crab meats, frozen groupers and snappers etc.). We target completing all arrangements, including export permits during the fourth quarter of 2014 to start shipments early in 2015.

The Integrated Cattle Farm business segment of Sino Agro Food is active in beef cattle rearing and value added processing of domestic and imported beef meat. Qinghai Sanjiang A Power Agriculture Co. Ltd. (“SJAP”), in HaungYuan, near Xining in Qinghai province, began as the Company's first major demonstration cattle farm. Now, SJAP is not only the model farm for other SIAF stand-alone cattle farms, but it is SIAF’s flagship beef operation, integrating the on-site production of its proprietary fertilizers and livestock feed with an innovative cooperative farmer model. SJAP provides local farmers with fertilizer and feed, and buys their cattle after initial growth. SJAP continues the fattening process at its own facilities until the cattle are fully mature and ready to be sold. In addition SJAP is the 100% owner of Qinghai Zhong He Meat Products (“QZH”), which operates its abattoir for deboning, slaughter, and packaging on premises, to prepare sale of quarter cut deboned beef and/or packaged products.
Revenue for three months ended 30 September 2015 was USD 35.5 million, or 28 percent of the Group's total revenue of USD 124.7 million in the same period. Gross profit for SJAP in the three months ended 30 September 2015 was USD 6.7 million, or 21% percent of the Group's total gross profit of USD 32.3 million in the same period.
SJAP was awarded prestigious Dragon Head Enterprise status by the Chinese government in October 2013. The SJAP model promotes significantly improved income for the local farmers, and allows the company to effectively market to government officials and investors from surrounding districts to build additional farms.
Sino Agro Food, Inc. operates cattle farms in Qinghai, Guangdong, and Hunan provinces, and a cattle station in Beijing. The Company holds patents for a modern livestock feed manufacturing process and produces its own blends of enzymes for both fertilizer and feedstock production for various climates within China. These technologies combined with farm services make up the core of the Company's livestock operations, run through its joint partner business model, featuring project development from the outset, and for expansion.
      
Using the Company's modern farming methods and feedstock have yielded above average results, reducing fattening time and producing the highest quality aromatic beef. The Company intends to become one of the highest quality producers of organic beef to meet the demands for quality, healthful food by China's growing middle class.
Recent Developments
In early 2015, in response to the Chinese government relaxing import restrictions and tariffs on imported beef SJAP devised a strategy to transition its herd to premium quality Wagyu and Angus cattle, grain fed day for 550 days. The strategy foresaw a decline in standard beef prices, which has occurred in 2015. The Company believes that the premium cuts of beef will provide higher gross profit margins. In addition to transitioning its herd, and to offset the declines in local beef prices, the Company has increased import of Australian quarter cut beef for deboning.
Revenue at SJAP grew in both the 3 month and 9 month year over year comparisons to September 30, 2015 from $27.9M to $35.5M (27%) and from $79.7M to $108.2M (36% ), with deboning activity accounting for all the gains, as sale of live cattle remained flat to slightly down.
SJAP’s expansion to increase its deboning capacity to 12,500 MT/year and its freezer capacity to 10,000 MT is in progress. As of the November, 2015, part of the finished developments are operational, allowing the capacity to debone more quarter-cut beef imported from Australia.
On October 23, 2015, the Agriculture Development Bank of China increased SJAP’s bank facility by RMB 35M, comprised of a term loan of RMB 25M, short term loan of RMB 35M and a new project loan of RMB 35M. The project loan can be applied for purposes of new developments and mergers, acquisitions etc., which, subject to its final application, may be converted to long term debt.
