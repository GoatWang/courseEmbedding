                      James F. McCann
                    

                          Founder and Executive Chairman
                        



Jim  McCann is a successful entrepreneur, business leader, author, media personality  and philanthropist whose passion is helping people deliver smiles.  Jim’s belief  in the universal need for social connections and interaction led to his founding  of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, which he has grown into one of the world’s leading Floral  and Gourmet Foods gifting companies.
 McCann’s willingness to embrace new  technologies that help people connect and express themselves, such as 800 phone  numbers, the Internet, Mobile Commerce and Social Networking, often long before  others, has enabled him to stay at the forefront of consumer and social  trends.  McCann’s strategy for growth  includes an effective combination of birthing new businesses and making  acquisitions of businesses and brands that resonate with customers as great  sources for exceptional gifts.  McCann  has expanded his company’s gift offerings to become a leading player in the  Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets business, including such iconic brands as: Harry  & David®; Fannie May®; Cheryl’s®; The Popcorn Factory®; Wolferman’s®;  1-800-Baskets.com® and Stockyards®, among others. McCann has also steered the  Company into the emerging areas of content and media and his focus on customer  engagement has enabled the company to stake out an industry leading position in  the fast evolving areas of Social and Mobile commerce, earning numerous awards  for its initiatives in these exciting new business areas.
In  addition to serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors for  1-800-FLOWERS.COM, McCann is the non-executive chairman of the Board of  Directors of Willis Group Holdings Limited and serves as a director for Scotts  Miracle-Gro as well as for several non-profit organizations.

                          President and Chief Executive Officer, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.
                        



Chris McCann, President and Chief Executive Officer, of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM is responsible for the company’s operations across all of its brands and businesses. He oversees the company’s strategic, operational and organizational processes, including the development, implementation and execution of annual and longer-term strategic, operating and budget plans.
When Chris’ brother, Jim, bought his first flower shop, Chris, who was still attending school, would come in on weekends to learn about the business and help out in any way that he could.  Since joining 1-800-FLOWERS.COM in 1984, Chris has played a pivotal role in helping the company build a reputation as one of the leading ecommerce and omni-channel retailers in the country.  He has also become well-known for embracing new customer engagement opportunities in Social and Mobile commerce.  He believes strongly in his company’s corporate mantra that their “best product is our customer experience.”
In 2005, as part of Chris’ vision, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM again led change in the floral industry with the launch of its BloomNet Wire Service business, which is designed specifically to help professional florists grow their businesses profitably. Chris also spearheaded the launch of the company’s Local Artisans program as a way to showcase the creativity of these local florists to millions of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM customers online.
Chris currently serves as Vice Chairman of the Board of IGHL, a facility dedicated to the enrichment of the lives of developmentally disabled adults, a cause that is near to his heart.  Smile Farms is a non-profit he helped found with his brother, Jim, that seeks to help developmentally disabled adults find meaningful employment.  The five-acre Smile Farm in Moriches, NY currently employs more than 30 developmentally disabled adults (including one of Chris’ older brothers) who grow flowers, plants and food products to be used in their local communities.
Chris also serves on the Advisory Board for Dreamit and the Board of Advisors for IBM Websphere.  Previously, he held director positions at Gizmoz.com, BLUEFLY.com and Neoware Technologies.
 
Chris earned his Bachelor of Arts in political science from Marist College, where he currently serves on its Board of Trustees.
