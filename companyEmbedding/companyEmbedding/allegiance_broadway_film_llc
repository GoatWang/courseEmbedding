One Family, Indivisible








The Allegiance Story 
The Music 
The True History 









Inspired by the true life experience of its star George Takei (Star Trek, Heroes), Allegiance follows one family’s extraordinary journey in this untold American story.

Their loyalty was questioned, their freedom taken away, but their spirit could never be broken. Rejoice in one family’s triumphant story of hope, love, and forgiveness in the new Broadway musical: Allegiance.
Inspired by true events, Allegiance is the story of the Kimura family, whose lives are upended when they and 120,000 other Japanese-Americans are forced to leave their homes following the events of Pearl Harbor. Sam Kimura seeks to prove his patriotism by fighting for his country in the war, but his sister, Kei, fiercely protests the government’s treatment of her people. An uplifting testament to the power of the human spirit, Allegiance follows the Kimuras as they fight between duty and defiance, custom and change, family bonds and forbidden loves. Legendary performer George Takei — (Star Trek, “Heroes”), who was himself an internee as a child, stars alongside Tony® winner Lea Salonga – (Miss Saigon, Mulan) in this enthralling and epic new musical.
But as long-lost memories are unlocked, Sam finds that it is never too late to forgive and to recognize the redemptive power of love.













Listen to Higher performed by Lea Salonga


Tony Award®-winner Lea Salonga makes her highly anticipated return to Broadway. In “Higher,” Lea’s character, Kei, recalls her own childhood in comparison to that of her brother, Sam. As the world around them pushes the two siblings in opposite directions, she questions how Sam could be so sure of his destiny while her own remains unclear. Her life has changed at a dangerous pace, but as a dutiful daughter playing mother has she also been playing it safe?









Making History on Broadway


In 1942, George Takei and his family were evicted from their home on Garnet Street in Los Angeles at gunpoint by the U.S. government. He was five years old. Relocated temporarily to a horse stable at Santa Anita racetrack, the Takeis were eventually incarcerated at Rohwer War Relocation Center in Arkansas. At Rohwer, George’s parents took a principled stand against an infamous questionnaire devised to determine the internees loyalties – a matter central to the story of Allegiance.
Because of their answer the Takeis and other internees deemed “disloyal” were relocated to a high-security camp in California, the Tule Lake Segregation Center. When they were at last permitted to return home George’s family lived on skid row, forced to rebuild their lives from nothing. Despite the injustices he and his family suffered, George harbors no resentment or anger. Each performance of Allegiance is a tribute to the fortitude of his family and to the 120,000 others like them who endured with inspirational grace and dignity.

“Allegiance,” the Broadway musical that starred George Takei in a four-month run last season, will come to movie theaters around the country in a one-night-only December screening presented by Fathom Events, the distributor of alternative cinema content.
Related Fathom Events Sets Widest Rollout Ever for ‘Batman: The Killing Joke’
“Allegiance” tackles the serious historical subject of the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, in a story loosely inspired by Takei’s childhood. Also starring Lea Salonga (“Miss Saigon”) and Telly Leung, the musical has songs by Jay Kuo with a book by Marc Acito, Kuo and Lorenzo Thione. Stafford Arima directed the production.
The dissemination of Broadway content on screens big and small is a market that theater producers have begun to explore with increasing frequency. For instance, “Of Mice and Men,” the 2014 revival starring James Franco, got a bigscreen showcase as part of the National Theater’s NT Live series of screenings, and before that, the “Legally Blonde” musical aimed to drum up awareness with a 2007 broadcast on MTV.







“George Takei’s Allegiance: The Broadway Musical on the Big Screen” will play theaters around the country Dec. 13. In addition to the full musical, the screening will also incorporate behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the show’s creators and cast members.

      moving story of one family, much like Takei’s, whose life is upended by 
      the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII. “George 
      Takei’s Allegiance: The Broadway Musical On The Big Screen” 
      comes to movie theaters nationwide for one night on Tuesday, 
      December 13 at 7:30 p.m. local time. The event will begin with an 
      exclusive introduction from Takei and immediately move into the 
      musical’s presentation. Audiences will also be treated to special 
      behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the cast and creators.
    


      Tickets for “George Takei’s Allegiance: The Broadway Musical On 
      The Big Screen” can be purchased beginning Friday, 
      November 11 online by visiting www.FathomEvents.com 
      or at participating theater box offices. Fans throughout the U.S. will 
      be able to enjoy the event in select movie theaters through Fathom’s Digital 
      Broadcast Network. For a complete list of theater locations visit 
      the Fathom Events website
(theaters and participants are subject to change).


      “Allegiance has been a passion project from the beginning,” said 
      star Takei. “This deeply-moving story based on my family’s experiences 
      could not be more timely, or poignant, considering the current political 
      climate. So many people around the globe have never heard about this 
      dark part of our nation’s history, and it is an honor and privilege for 
      me to help tell this story, so that we can avoid repeating the mistakes 
      of the past. I am deeply grateful that almost 120,000 people experienced 
      the Broadway production during its run, an eerie reflection of the 
      number of Japanese Americans who were directly impacted by the events 
      depicted in Allegiance. This event – with Allegiance 
      coming to cinema screens all around the country – will give to so many 
      more the opportunity to experience and see this musical, which I 
      consider my legacy.”
    

Allegiance illuminates one of American history’s lesser 
      known chapters as it tells the story of Sam Kimura (Takei), transported 
      back nearly six decades to when his younger self (Telly Leung, Godspell, 
      “Glee”) and his sister Kei (Tony Award-winner Lea Salonga, Miss 
      Saigon, Mulan) fought to stay connected to their heritage, 
      their family and themselves after Japanese Americans were wrongfully 
      imprisoned during World War II. An important story told with great 
      resonance and intimacy, Allegiance explores the ties that 
      bind us, the struggle to persevere and the overwhelming power of 
      forgiveness and, most especially, love.
    

      “We are excited to bring this wonderful Broadway show to a national 
      audience and to extend its relevant message beyond the stage to the big 
      screen,” Fathom Events Vice President of Programming Kymberli Frueh 
      said. “And to be able to showcase Lea Salonga’s incredible talent again 
      following the Miss Saigon 25th Anniversary event.”
    

      “We are beyond thrilled that we were able to preserve the original 
      Broadway production of Allegiance, featuring its entire original 
      cast, in this beautiful and fully-immersive version created for the big 
      screen,” said Allegiance producer Lorenzo Thione. “Beyond that, 
      we are truly excited that the story, music and message of Allegiance will 
      now reach many more people, in many more cities than ever before, 
      continuing to move, educate and inspire, and truly fulfilling George’s 
      legacy.”

Broadway Production Of 'Allegiance,' Starring George Takei, Comes To Cinemas Nationwide December 13 Only






Business Wire




Sep 22, 2016 9:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Straight from Broadway, and inspired by the true-life experiences of George Takei ("Star Trek," "Heroes"),  Allegiance  tells the moving story of one family, much like Takei's, whose life is upended by the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII. " George Takei's Allegiance: The Broadway Musical On The Big Screen  "  comes to movie theaters nationwide for one night on Tuesday, December 13 at 7:30 p.m. local time. The event will begin with an exclusive introduction from Takei and immediately move into the musical's presentation. Audiences will also be treated to special behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the cast and creators.  Tickets for " George Takei's Allegiance: The Broadway Musical On The Big Screen"    can be purchased beginning Friday, November 11 online by visiting www.FathomEvents.com or at participating theater box offices. Fans throughout the U.S. will be able to enjoy the event in select movie theaters through Fathom's Digital Broadcast Network. For a complete list of theater locations visit the Fathom Events  website (theaters and participants are subject to change).  " Allegiance has been a passion project from the beginning," said star Takei. "This deeply-moving story based on my family's experiences could not be more timely, or poignant, considering the current political climate. So many people around the globe have never heard about this dark part of our nation's history, and it is an honor and privilege for me to help tell this story, so that we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. I am deeply grateful that almost 120,000 people experienced the Broadway production during its run, an eerie reflection of the number of Japanese Americans who were directly impacted by the events depicted in Allegiance. This event - with Allegiance coming to cinema screens all around the country - will give to so many more the opportunity to experience and see this musical, which I consider my legacy."   Allegiance  illuminates one of American history's lesser known chapters as it tells the story of Sam Kimura (Takei), transported back nearly six decades to when his younger self ( Telly Leung, Godspell, "Glee") and his sister Kei (Tony Award-winner Lea Salonga, Miss Saigon, Mulan) fought to stay connected to their heritage, their family and themselves after Japanese Americans were wrongfully imprisoned during World War II. An important story told with great resonance and intimacy,  Allegiance  explores the ties that bind us, the struggle to persevere and the overwhelming power of forgiveness and, most especially, love.  "We are excited to bring this wonderful Broadway show to a national audience and to extend its relevant message beyond the stage to the big screen," Fathom Events Vice President of Programming Kymberli Frueh said. "And to be able to showcase Lea Salonga's incredible talent again following the Miss Saigon 25 th Anniversary event."  "We are beyond thrilled that we were able to preserve the original Broadway production of Allegiance, featuring its entire original cast, in this beautiful and fully-immersive version created for the big screen," said Allegiance producer Lorenzo Thione. "Beyond that, we are truly excited that the story, music and message of Allegiance will now reach many more people, in many more cities than ever before, continuing to move, educate and inspire, and truly fulfilling George's legacy."

Overview
Why incorporate.com?
FAQs



Simply put, it's the least complex business structure. Unlike an s corp or c corp, an LLC's structure is flexible. It also gives you the perk of pass-through taxes, limited liability (obviously), and legal protection for your personal assets. Plus the added benefit of looking more legit than the other guys.
Advantages of an LLC
There are several advantages to starting an LLC, but here are a few that stand out.

Pass-through taxes. There's no need to file a corporate tax return. Owners report their share of profit and loss on their individual tax returns, meaning you avoid double taxation.
No residency requirement. Owners need not be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.
Legal protection. Owners have limited liability for business debts and obligations.
Enhanced credibility. Partners, suppliers, and lenders may look more favorably on your business when you've formed an LLC.

Compare LLCs and corporations with our business comparison chart.
Disadvantages of an LLC
Creating an LLC is an attractive option, but there are a few hurdles.

Limited growth potential. You cannot issue shares of stock to attract investors.
Lack of uniformity. LLCs can be treated differently in different states.
Self-employment tax. Earnings can be subject to this kind of taxation.
Tax recognition on appreciated assets. This could happen if you convert an existing business to an LLC. One more way that extra taxation can occur.

Is Creating an LLC Right for Me?
That really depends on what your short-term and long-term business goals are. We recommend that you put some thought into where your business is now and how you want your business to grow before deciding whether the LLC structure is right for you.
How to Form an LLC (Limited Liability Company):

Choose a legal name and reserve it, if the Secretary of State in your state does that sort of thing (not all do).
Draft and file your Articles of Incorporation with your Secretary of State.
Decide who will run the business (managers or members)
Decide how many owners are in the business
Apply for a business license and other certificates specific to your industry.
File Form SS-4 or apply online at the Internal Revenue Service website to obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN).
Apply for any other ID numbers required by state and local government agencies. Requirements vary from one jurisdiction to another, but generally your business most likely will be required to pay unemployment, disability, and other payroll taxes – you will need tax ID numbers for those accounts in addition to your EIN.

Popular states to form an LLC in include Delaware, California, Florida, New York, Nevada, and Texas.
Benefit#1: Cost Savings
Forming an LLC with a lawyer has been the traditional route. However, with new technology and an abundance of state information available online, if you create your LLC online with incorporate.com, you can generally save significant money over hiring a lawyer. Using information that you provide to us, we complete the state-required forms, send them to you for review, and then submit them to the Secretary of State, all for less than what an attorney would usually charge.
Benefit #2: Time Savings
Traditionally, the process of completing the forms and filing with the state can take days or weeks. Today, by forming an online LLC with incorporate.com, you can achieve huge time savings. The filing of needed documents is normally done within 24-48 hours of your order. Of course, we can't control the state's turnaround time, but we promise that you won't be waiting on us. When the Secretary of State issues the evidence of filing, we'll provide it to you right away – no waiting for an appointment or paying for our time. If you need a hard copy, we'll send it to you via FedEx.
Benefit #3: Online Compliance Watch®
All of our formation packages include free access to Compliance Watch, a state-of-the-art online compliance management tool that will help you keep your business in compliance with all state requirements. We provide secure online document storage, a comprehensive to-do list that will make sure you don't miss any steps, a one-stop online business profile, and we make it easy to make payments and track your orders.
Benefit #4: $50,000 Corporate Veil Guarantee®
A 'corporate veil' is the shielding you get from forming an LLC or corporation. This shield protects thepersonal assets of shareholders or the LLC's members from personal liability for the debts or actions of the business. When you use incorporate.com to form your LLC online, we will process your paperwork for you. Then just follow our step-by-step checklist to keep your veil strong and qualify for the guarantee. If you followed our checklist and your LLC is sued and you are held personally liable because your corporate veil is pierced, we will reimburse legal defense fees up to $50,000.

How does forming an LLC help protect my personal assets?
Unlike sole proprietorships and partnerships, LLCs allow their owners to separate and protect their personal assets from business debts and liabilities. A sole proprietor or general partner remains personally liable for business obligations, leaving their home, car, and personal savings at risk.
In contrast, forming an LLC creates a business structure separate from its owners. In a properly formed and managed LLC, only business assets remain at risk in a judgment against the company. Owners can protect their personal savings and possessions from business debts.
Back to Top

How are LLC profits taxed?
Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC enjoys pass-through taxation. This means that owners (also known as "members") report their share of profits or losses in the company on their individual tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not assess taxes on the company itself. This avoids the "double taxation" that general, or "C," corporations experience. In a C corporation, the IRS taxes profits at the corporate level and dividends at the shareholder level.
When creating an LLC, owners need not distribute profits and losses in the LLC in proportion to ownership (pursuant to IRS guidelines). The owners of an LLC can agree to allocate the company's profits and losses among themselves however they see fit, not necessarily based on the percentage of the company each owner controls.
Back to Top

How does an LLC compare to a C Corporation?
For many small business owners, a Limited Liability Company (LLC) offers advantages over a "C" corporation (also known as a "general" corporation). Creating an LLC combines the tax advantages of a sole proprietorship or partnership with the liability protection of a corporation.
The IRS taxes the profits of a C corporation at corporate tax rates. Then, if the C corporation pays dividends to shareholders, the IRS taxes those dividends a second time at the personal income tax rates of the shareholders. The LLC business structure avoids this "double taxation." The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not consider an LLC itself a taxable entity. Instead, the company's earnings "pass through" to the owners, who report their share of profits or losses on their individual tax returns.
Small business owners who want the flexible structure of an LLC but the advantages of corporate taxation can elect corporate taxation for their LLC. To elect corporate taxation, owners file Form 8832, "Tax Classification Election," with the IRS. Electing this status may also make an LLC eligible for certain deductions available only to corporations. For specific guidance, small business owners should consult their accountant or tax advisor regarding this election.
Back to Top

How does an LLC compare to an S Corporation?
The Limited Liability Company (LLC) and the Subchapter S Corporation ("S Corp") share the benefit of pass-through taxation. This means that owners in the company report their share of profits and losses on each owner's individual tax return. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assesses no separate tax on the company itself. In contrast, "double taxation" occurs when the IRS taxes both a C Corporation's profit and dividends paid to shareholders.
Despite the similarity of pass-through taxation, an LLC formation can offer advantages over an S Corporation:

Not required to hold annual meetings or record meeting minutes (though we recommend it)
LLC owners need not worry about the formalities of issuing stock, since an LLC does not have stock
No limit to the number of owners
LLC owners need not be U.S. citizens or permanent residents

Back to Top

What is a Series LLC?
A Series LLC consists of a Limited Liability Company with more than one series of members, managers, or LLC interests. In some cases, a series LLC can have a separate business purpose or investment objective. For years, Delaware law has permitted an LLC to register separate series. Use of this structure remains uncommon due to uncertainty over federal income tax consequences. Advantages include:

The Series LLC permits separate liability-insulated divisions within a single entity.
A Series LLC could be used as a holding company owning intangible assets, or tangible assets such as real estate, or as an operating company conducting different lines of business.
The Series LLC reduces costs associated with forming and maintaining multiple LLCs.

Other states that have enacted statutes permitting the formation and registration of series LLCs include Illinois, Iowa, Nevada, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah. To form a series LLC, contact a Business Specialist at 800-818-6082 (toll-free) or 302-636-5440
Back to Top

What state should I form my LLC in?
Most businesses form LLCs in the state in which they primarily operate. Advantages of choosing your home state include:

Typically the least complicated option
Usually costs less than forming your LLC in a different state and registering with your home state
Avoids paying franchise taxes and filing annual reports in more than one state

Many companies conduct business throughout the U.S. and abroad. An LLC with business locations in multiple states may form an LLC in a single state and then register to do business in the additional states. This means that companies must formally register, file annual reports, and pay annual fees to conduct business in multiple states.
Back to Top

How do I form an LLC?
incorporate.com can walk you through the process of your LLC formation either online or by telephone. Customers usually find our LLC formation services less expensive than those of an attorney. We have multiple packages and options to choose from to meet your individual budget and needs.
Creating an LLC takes less than 10 minutes. You simply need to choose a business structure, state, and your company name. We take care of the rest. Our experts have formed more than 300,000 businesses nationwide.
Back to Top

What do I need to do to maintain my LLC?
Nearly all states require LLCs to file annual reports or pay franchise taxes to maintain the company's good standing. The Secretary of State may forward a renewal notice directly to your company or to your Registered Agent. Failure to file reports and pay franchise taxes by the state deadline can result in fines, notices, and the inability to conduct business.
State laws do not require LLCs to hold annual meetings or record meeting minutes. However, we recommend that LLCs update their records at least annually to reflect any changes in management or activities.
Almost all state, county, and local governments require LLCs to complete business license, permit, and tax registration applications before beginning to operate. Learn more about how our Business License Compliance Package can help your company.
Back to Top

Can I use incorporate.com as a Registered Agent?
Yes, you can! We are happy to receive your legal documents and forward them to the person you designate as your legal contact. By creating your LLC online and using incorporate.com as your registered agent, you are provided peace of mind. Simply choose incorporate.com as your Registered Agent during the checkout process.
Back to Top

If I buy a package but want to customize and add services, is that possible?
Absolutely! Our advanced services are available for an additional fee with any of the lower packages. The additional services and resources available include an LLC Operating Agreement, a Legal and Tax reference library, the filing of an Employer Identification Number (EIN) with the IRS, and more!
Back to Top

I need additional help – can you give me more guidance?
We'd be happy to serve you. Even though you are forming your LLC online, any of our packages has the option of adding a one-on-one business coaching arrangement. For a simple fee, you'll have someone who can help you keep your LLC in good standing, protect yourself, and run a successful business.

I had some legal questions come up. Can you assist?

So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company.

Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Allegiance is a musical with music and lyrics by Jay Kuo and a book by Marc Acito, Kuo and Lorenzo Thione. The story, set during the Japanese American internment of World War II (with a framing story set in the present day), was inspired by the personal experiences of George Takei, who stars in the musical. It follows the Kimura family in the years following the attack on Pearl Harbor, as they are forced to leave their farm in Salinas, California and are sent to the Heart Mountain internment camp in the rural plains of Wyoming.
The musical began development in 2008 and premiered in September 2012 in San Diego, California. It played on Broadway from October 2015 to February 2016.[1] Reviews on Broadway were mixed, although the cast was generally praised.[2]

Conception and historical perspective[edit]
In the fall of 2008, George Takei and his husband, Brad, were coincidentally seated next to Jay Kuo and Lorenzo Thione at an Off-Broadway show, where a brief conversation revealed a mutual love of theater. The next day, the four were once again seated together at a Broadway show, In the Heights. At intermission, Kuo and Thione approached Takei, curious as to why he had been so emotionally affected by the father's song ("Useless") in which he laments his inability to help his family. Over the course of that intermission, Takei recounted his personal experience as a child in a Japanese internment camp, during World War II, and his own father's sense of helplessness at his inability to protect his family that was mirrored in the song. Kuo and Thione felt that Takei's family's experience would make a great show.[3][4] Although previous major Broadway musicals have involved Asian and Asian-American topics or settings, including three of Rodgers and Hammerstein's shows, Pacific Overtures and Miss Saigon, Allegiance is "the first [Broadway] musical created by Asian Americans, directed by an Asian American ... with a predominantly Asian cast ... [and] an Asian-American viewpoint informing the work".[5]
The story of the musical takes some liberties with history. According to Frank Abe, the creator of the documentary film Conscience and the Constitution, the musical "conflate[s] Heart Mountain with the worst of the segregation center at Tule Lake and invent[s] military rule at Heart Mountain."[6] The processing of new arrivals is embellished for dramatic effect, as handcuffs and physical abuse by military police did not occur in the internment camps. Abe comments that the resistance by the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee was a studied act of civil disobedience, not a gang of "fists-raised revolutionaries". He notes: "No firearms were used inside the [camps'] perimeter. The resistance was open and above-board, its meetings open to the public. No one had to run or hide; leaders of the Fair Play Committee were quietly taken into custody at their family barracks. ... The resisters knew they risked five years in prison for bucking the draft, but violating the Selective Service Act was never a capital crime, never treason. No resistance leader at Heart Mountain was beaten bloody or hunted by guards", draft cards were not burned, and no newspaper articles affected the internment; notably Frankie would not have been taken to the infirmary by military police, which causes the key conflict in the show.[6] Abe objects to the portrayal of the activities and treatment of the resisters, and to the "relentless optimism" of the score, concluding that the show distorts the historical lesson, diminishes the real impact of "the anger and suppressed rage" that the internees carried from the internment camps, and "risks supplanting the truth of the resistance and the Japanese American experience in the popular mind [and] cheapens the fabric of basic reality to achieve [commercial] ends."[6]
Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
An aged World War II veteran, Sam Kimura, prepares for a Pearl Harbor anniversary ceremony. A woman arrives to inform him that his estranged sister Kei has died, and that she is Kei's executor. She gives Sam an envelope and tells him that the funeral is to be held later that afternoon. Angered by the opening of his old family wounds after nearly 60 years of estrangement, he berates his once-beloved sister for not leaving him in peace. Kei's ghost informs Sam that she couldn't rest in peace without making one last attempt to reconnect with him.
It is 1941, and Sammy is a newly elected class president who dreams of "Going Places", like college and high political office. His widower father Tatsuo, and grandfather Ojii-chan, own a farm in Salinas, California. Sammy adores his older sister Kei, who has postponed her own dreams to help raise him. Tatsuo is always pushing Sammy to be better and reach his potential. Sammy believes that Tatsuo blames Sammy for his wife's death in childbirth. After the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December, the US government fears that Japanese-Americans might be loyal to the Japanese. Nearly all of the Japanese-Americans in the Western US are incarcerated in internment camps. Sammy's family is forced to sell their beautiful farm for a small price and sent to the bleak Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming.
While in this camp, and against his father's wishes, Sammy joins with Mike Masaoka, head of the Japanese American Citizens League, which cooperates with the authorities to identify "disloyal" Japanese. When his grandfather, Ojii-chan, becomes sick, Sammy goes to see the white Quaker volunteer nurse at the camp, Hannah, for some cough syrup. She tells him it is only for the staff, but Sammy is persuasive, and she gives him the medication. The two begin a relationship that causes additional tensions, because interracial marriage with Hannah would be illegal. Tatsuo is not inclined to cooperate. He is sent to a brutal prison for refusing to swear his allegiance by answering "yes" on an unjustly-worded loyalty questionnaire. Sammy's sister Kei falls in love with a draft resistance leader, Frankie Suzuki, and she also joins the resisters advocating for the rights of her people.
Act II[edit]
Masaoka manages to obtain Washington's permission for the Japanese-Americans to enlist in US armed forces, but only if they take on the most dangerous assignments in the war in Italy. Eager to prove his loyalty, Sammy enlists in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a US Army unit consisting of American-born sons of Japanese immigrants, and he fights bravely in Europe. He leads fellow Nisei on a suicide mission, in which the majority of the soldiers are killed. While in prison, Tatsuo is given a copy of Life magazine that trumpets Sammy's bravery in combat, and is told that he was only let out of his cell because of his son's actions.
Meanwhile, Kei and Frankie, who are still in love, help lead the resistance. Eventually, Frankie's scuffles with a military policeman lead to Hannah's accidental and fatal shooting. Grandpa Ojii-chan, who has managed to grow a crop of vegetables in the mountain's rough terrain, dies peacefully while in his garden. After the war, Sammy learns that Frankie and Kei, now married, have a daughter named Hanako (after nurse Hannah). Aghast at this, he confronts Tatsuo, saying that Frankie was the son he always wanted. Already furious at Kei and Frankie, he learns of Hannah's death at Heart Mountain and blames Kei and Frankie. He then walks away from his family for a job in Washington that Masaoka had offered him after discharge. Kei argues with Sammy, calling him a coward for leaving his family. She tries to stop him, but only manages to tear the Purple Heart off of his uniform.
Back in the present day, Sam attends Kei's funeral, and Kei's executor thanks him for attending. Sam opens the envelope and finds a posthumous bequest from Kei: the Life magazine featuring Sammy's exploits that Tatsuo had kept since his release from prison. The executor then says that her mother wanted to give Sam something else, and she hands him his old Purple Heart medal. He then realizes that the executor is his niece Hanako. He breaks down, aware that he has a chance to forgive and to share in the love and compassion of his family.
Production[edit]
Allegiance had its first reading at the Japanese American National Museum on July 13, 2009 starring George Takei, Lea Salonga and others. It was followed by two more readings that were held in New York in 2010 with the same two, but this time with Telly Leung, among others.[7] In the summer of 2011, a workshop was held for Allegiance at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. To commemorate the Japanese-American Day of Remembrance, the memorial for Japanese American Internment, George Takei took to Facebook to initiate a crowd funding campaign through IndieGoGo to raise funds for the show. The initial target was $50,000; the eventual total raised exceeded $158,000.[8] The musical premiered in September 2012 at the Old Globe, directed by Stafford Arima and choreographed by Andrew Palermo, with designs by Donyale Werle (sets), Howell Binkley (lighting) and Alejo Vietti (costumes).[9] It became the Old Globe's biggest box-office success in history.[10] To help fund and publicize a Broadway run, the producers sold Allegiance "Priority Passes" in 2014 for five dollars. The pass allowed people to buy tickets before they were available to the general public.[11]
The musical began previews on October 6, 2015 at Broadway's Longacre Theatre and opened officially on November 8, 2015.[12] Critical reception for the production was mixed.[2][13] The production closed on February 14, 2016 after 37 previews and 111 regular performances.[1]
The Broadway cast album was released on January 29, 2016.[14] A filmed performance of the Broadway production was screened in several movie theatres in North America in December 2016[15] and February 2017.[16]

Reception[edit]
Critical reaction[edit]




David Henry Hwang and George Takei discussing Allegiance at Columbia University in late 2015


Critical reception for the Broadway production was mixed. While the cast was often praised, especially Takei's characterization and Salonga's singing, the reviews frequently criticized poor execution of a worthy subject, especially the lyrics.[2] "The majority of critics admired Allegiance's noble intentions to illuminate a dark corner of America’s past, but found the book melodramatic and the score derivative."[13] Alexis Soloski of The Guardian called the musical "unexceptional though often affecting" and gave it three stars out of five. He liked some of the 1940s style songs but said of the ballads that "none of the melodies linger once the curtain has fallen and the lyrics pile on platitude and cliché."[18]
Entertainment Weekly's review singled out Takei's performance as "providing much-needed islands of levity amidst a sea of sadness. ... Allegiance is an important show with a phenomenal cast, and it deserves to be seen."[19] Rex Reed, in The New York Observer praised the book, score and direction, writing: "The [finale] brought tears to my eyes. The audience is overwhelmed. The screams are voluminous. The songs carry you aloft on wings of triumph, and the greatest cast of under-used Asian talents since Flower Drum Song and Pacific Overtures brings a cheering crowd to its feet every night with a standing ovation that is well deserved.[20] Linda Winer in Newsday commented that the musical "carries its heavy baggage with a surprising lightness of spirit. ... The show has fully developed characters, a strong cast and a new story to tell in an old-fashioned way."[21] The San Diego Union-Tribune, having reviewed the original production at the Old Globe in 2012, was more positive, feeling that the new production, "retains both its powerful story core and a good deal of its lush and melodic score, along with nearly all the top cast members from the original version. ... At its best, “Allegiance” gracefully shapes dramatic and historical contours into an epic that – in the spirit of gaman – coaxes a fierce beauty from once-poisoned soil."[22] In a review that gave Allegiance 3 stars out of four, USA Today felt that even though the show, "is as corny as Kansas in August and as obvious as Lady Gaga on a red carpet ... [but] if you can make a critic who sneered in the first act leave the theater a little teary-eyed, you're probably doing something right."[23] Deadline magazine called Allegiance "another significant addition to a Broadway season that offers an alternative take on the American experience. ... Validation is hardly the worst crime a show can commit, and I think that’s one reason the audience was cheering at the very moving end of the show. It’s a triumph of a rare sort, shedding light in a dark corner of our history with uncommon generosity of spirit."[24]
In The New York Times, however, Charles Isherwood praised the performers but wrote: "The show wants to illuminate a dark passage in American history with complexity and honesty, but the first requirement of any Broadway musical is to entertain. While well-intentioned and polished, Allegiance struggles to balance both ambitions, and doesn’t always find an equilibrium."[25] Variety felt that, despite good performances and designs, the well-intentioned story would have been better suited as a play, and that "In their sincere efforts to 'humanize' their complex historical material, the creatives have oversimplified and reduced it to generic themes."[26] In a similar way, The Hollywood Reporter felt that as a musical, "the broad-strokes storytelling ... seems ill-suited to examining such complex issues, and the book's superficial character development doesn't help either."[27] Michael Dale of BroadwayWorld.com admired the cast, but thought that "Allegiance, while certainly not a bad theatre piece, is an underachieving one."[28] The large number of songs was seen as a problem by The Huffington Post, which noted: "Though Kuo has written a lot of it, the score just doesn't make the grade."[29] Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press complained of jarring writing, commenting: "There are long periods of unrelenting misery, with families ripped from their homes and subjected to brutality by vindictive white soldiers. Then there's a song about the joys of baseball. That gives way to scenes with dangerous, choking dust storms, a dead baby and jail beatings. Then there is a happy sock hop."[30] Critical of both the score and the script, Jesse Green of Vulture thought that outside of several moments, "too much of the show is devoted to far-fetched plot twists whose attempts to gin up excitement only look silly in the shadow of the larger forces at work."[31] Terry Teachout of The Wall Street Journal praised Takei, Salonga and Arima's direction, and felt the set was worthy of a Tony Award, but criticized Kuo's score, and deemed the show "of no artistic value whatsoever, save as an object lesson in how to write a really bad Broadway musical."[32]

Allegiance is a musical with music and lyrics by Jay Kuo and a book by Marc Acito, Kuo and Lorenzo Thione. The story, set during the Japanese American internment of World War II (with a framing story set in the present day), was inspired by the personal experiences of George Takei, who stars in the musical. It follows the Kimura family in the years following the attack on Pearl Harbor, as they are forced to leave their farm in Salinas, California and are sent to the Heart Mountain internment camp in the rural plains of Wyoming.
The musical began development in 2008 and premiered in September 2012 in San Diego, California. It played on Broadway from October 2015 to February 2016.[1] Reviews on Broadway were mixed, although the cast was generally praised.[2]

Conception and historical perspective[edit]
In the fall of 2008, George Takei and his husband, Brad, were coincidentally seated next to Jay Kuo and Lorenzo Thione at an Off-Broadway show, where a brief conversation revealed a mutual love of theater. The next day, the four were once again seated together at a Broadway show, In the Heights. At intermission, Kuo and Thione approached Takei, curious as to why he had been so emotionally affected by the father's song ("Useless") in which he laments his inability to help his family. Over the course of that intermission, Takei recounted his personal experience as a child in a Japanese internment camp, during World War II, and his own father's sense of helplessness at his inability to protect his family that was mirrored in the song. Kuo and Thione felt that Takei's family's experience would make a great show.[3][4] Although previous major Broadway musicals have involved Asian and Asian-American topics or settings, including three of Rodgers and Hammerstein's shows, Pacific Overtures and Miss Saigon, Allegiance is "the first [Broadway] musical created by Asian Americans, directed by an Asian American ... with a predominantly Asian cast ... [and] an Asian-American viewpoint informing the work".[5]
The story of the musical takes some liberties with history. According to Frank Abe, the creator of the documentary film Conscience and the Constitution, the musical "conflate[s] Heart Mountain with the worst of the segregation center at Tule Lake and invent[s] military rule at Heart Mountain."[6] The processing of new arrivals is embellished for dramatic effect, as handcuffs and physical abuse by military police did not occur in the internment camps. Abe comments that the resistance by the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee was a studied act of civil disobedience, not a gang of "fists-raised revolutionaries". He notes: "No firearms were used inside the [camps'] perimeter. The resistance was open and above-board, its meetings open to the public. No one had to run or hide; leaders of the Fair Play Committee were quietly taken into custody at their family barracks. ... The resisters knew they risked five years in prison for bucking the draft, but violating the Selective Service Act was never a capital crime, never treason. No resistance leader at Heart Mountain was beaten bloody or hunted by guards", draft cards were not burned, and no newspaper articles affected the internment; notably Frankie would not have been taken to the infirmary by military police, which causes the key conflict in the show.[6] Abe objects to the portrayal of the activities and treatment of the resisters, and to the "relentless optimism" of the score, concluding that the show distorts the historical lesson, diminishes the real impact of "the anger and suppressed rage" that the internees carried from the internment camps, and "risks supplanting the truth of the resistance and the Japanese American experience in the popular mind [and] cheapens the fabric of basic reality to achieve [commercial] ends."[6]
Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
An aged World War II veteran, Sam Kimura, prepares for a Pearl Harbor anniversary ceremony. A woman arrives to inform him that his estranged sister Kei has died, and that she is Kei's executor. She gives Sam an envelope and tells him that the funeral is to be held later that afternoon. Angered by the opening of his old family wounds after nearly 60 years of estrangement, he berates his once-beloved sister for not leaving him in peace. Kei's ghost informs Sam that she couldn't rest in peace without making one last attempt to reconnect with him.
It is 1941, and Sammy is a newly elected class president who dreams of "Going Places", like college and high political office. His widower father Tatsuo, and grandfather Ojii-chan, own a farm in Salinas, California. Sammy adores his older sister Kei, who has postponed her own dreams to help raise him. Tatsuo is always pushing Sammy to be better and reach his potential. Sammy believes that Tatsuo blames Sammy for his wife's death in childbirth. After the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December, the US government fears that Japanese-Americans might be loyal to the Japanese. Nearly all of the Japanese-Americans in the Western US are incarcerated in internment camps. Sammy's family is forced to sell their beautiful farm for a small price and sent to the bleak Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming.
While in this camp, and against his father's wishes, Sammy joins with Mike Masaoka, head of the Japanese American Citizens League, which cooperates with the authorities to identify "disloyal" Japanese. When his grandfather, Ojii-chan, becomes sick, Sammy goes to see the white Quaker volunteer nurse at the camp, Hannah, for some cough syrup. She tells him it is only for the staff, but Sammy is persuasive, and she gives him the medication. The two begin a relationship that causes additional tensions, because interracial marriage with Hannah would be illegal. Tatsuo is not inclined to cooperate. He is sent to a brutal prison for refusing to swear his allegiance by answering "yes" on an unjustly-worded loyalty questionnaire. Sammy's sister Kei falls in love with a draft resistance leader, Frankie Suzuki, and she also joins the resisters advocating for the rights of her people.
Act II[edit]
Masaoka manages to obtain Washington's permission for the Japanese-Americans to enlist in US armed forces, but only if they take on the most dangerous assignments in the war in Italy. Eager to prove his loyalty, Sammy enlists in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a US Army unit consisting of American-born sons of Japanese immigrants, and he fights bravely in Europe. He leads fellow Nisei on a suicide mission, in which the majority of the soldiers are killed. While in prison, Tatsuo is given a copy of Life magazine that trumpets Sammy's bravery in combat, and is told that he was only let out of his cell because of his son's actions.
Meanwhile, Kei and Frankie, who are still in love, help lead the resistance. Eventually, Frankie's scuffles with a military policeman lead to Hannah's accidental and fatal shooting. Grandpa Ojii-chan, who has managed to grow a crop of vegetables in the mountain's rough terrain, dies peacefully while in his garden. After the war, Sammy learns that Frankie and Kei, now married, have a daughter named Hanako (after nurse Hannah). Aghast at this, he confronts Tatsuo, saying that Frankie was the son he always wanted. Already furious at Kei and Frankie, he learns of Hannah's death at Heart Mountain and blames Kei and Frankie. He then walks away from his family for a job in Washington that Masaoka had offered him after discharge. Kei argues with Sammy, calling him a coward for leaving his family. She tries to stop him, but only manages to tear the Purple Heart off of his uniform.
Back in the present day, Sam attends Kei's funeral, and Kei's executor thanks him for attending. Sam opens the envelope and finds a posthumous bequest from Kei: the Life magazine featuring Sammy's exploits that Tatsuo had kept since his release from prison. The executor then says that her mother wanted to give Sam something else, and she hands him his old Purple Heart medal. He then realizes that the executor is his niece Hanako. He breaks down, aware that he has a chance to forgive and to share in the love and compassion of his family.
Production[edit]
Allegiance had its first reading at the Japanese American National Museum on July 13, 2009 starring George Takei, Lea Salonga and others. It was followed by two more readings that were held in New York in 2010 with the same two, but this time with Telly Leung, among others.[7] In the summer of 2011, a workshop was held for Allegiance at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. To commemorate the Japanese-American Day of Remembrance, the memorial for Japanese American Internment, George Takei took to Facebook to initiate a crowd funding campaign through IndieGoGo to raise funds for the show. The initial target was $50,000; the eventual total raised exceeded $158,000.[8] The musical premiered in September 2012 at the Old Globe, directed by Stafford Arima and choreographed by Andrew Palermo, with designs by Donyale Werle (sets), Howell Binkley (lighting) and Alejo Vietti (costumes).[9] It became the Old Globe's biggest box-office success in history.[10] To help fund and publicize a Broadway run, the producers sold Allegiance "Priority Passes" in 2014 for five dollars. The pass allowed people to buy tickets before they were available to the general public.[11]
The musical began previews on October 6, 2015 at Broadway's Longacre Theatre and opened officially on November 8, 2015.[12] Critical reception for the production was mixed.[2][13] The production closed on February 14, 2016 after 37 previews and 111 regular performances.[1]
The Broadway cast album was released on January 29, 2016.[14] A filmed performance of the Broadway production was screened in several movie theatres in North America in December 2016[15] and February 2017.[16]

Reception[edit]
Critical reaction[edit]




David Henry Hwang and George Takei discussing Allegiance at Columbia University in late 2015


Critical reception for the Broadway production was mixed. While the cast was often praised, especially Takei's characterization and Salonga's singing, the reviews frequently criticized poor execution of a worthy subject, especially the lyrics.[2] "The majority of critics admired Allegiance's noble intentions to illuminate a dark corner of America’s past, but found the book melodramatic and the score derivative."[13] Alexis Soloski of The Guardian called the musical "unexceptional though often affecting" and gave it three stars out of five. He liked some of the 1940s style songs but said of the ballads that "none of the melodies linger once the curtain has fallen and the lyrics pile on platitude and cliché."[18]
Entertainment Weekly's review singled out Takei's performance as "providing much-needed islands of levity amidst a sea of sadness. ... Allegiance is an important show with a phenomenal cast, and it deserves to be seen."[19] Rex Reed, in The New York Observer praised the book, score and direction, writing: "The [finale] brought tears to my eyes. The audience is overwhelmed. The screams are voluminous. The songs carry you aloft on wings of triumph, and the greatest cast of under-used Asian talents since Flower Drum Song and Pacific Overtures brings a cheering crowd to its feet every night with a standing ovation that is well deserved.[20] Linda Winer in Newsday commented that the musical "carries its heavy baggage with a surprising lightness of spirit. ... The show has fully developed characters, a strong cast and a new story to tell in an old-fashioned way."[21] The San Diego Union-Tribune, having reviewed the original production at the Old Globe in 2012, was more positive, feeling that the new production, "retains both its powerful story core and a good deal of its lush and melodic score, along with nearly all the top cast members from the original version. ... At its best, “Allegiance” gracefully shapes dramatic and historical contours into an epic that – in the spirit of gaman – coaxes a fierce beauty from once-poisoned soil."[22] In a review that gave Allegiance 3 stars out of four, USA Today felt that even though the show, "is as corny as Kansas in August and as obvious as Lady Gaga on a red carpet ... [but] if you can make a critic who sneered in the first act leave the theater a little teary-eyed, you're probably doing something right."[23] Deadline magazine called Allegiance "another significant addition to a Broadway season that offers an alternative take on the American experience. ... Validation is hardly the worst crime a show can commit, and I think that’s one reason the audience was cheering at the very moving end of the show. It’s a triumph of a rare sort, shedding light in a dark corner of our history with uncommon generosity of spirit."[24]
In The New York Times, however, Charles Isherwood praised the performers but wrote: "The show wants to illuminate a dark passage in American history with complexity and honesty, but the first requirement of any Broadway musical is to entertain. While well-intentioned and polished, Allegiance struggles to balance both ambitions, and doesn’t always find an equilibrium."[25] Variety felt that, despite good performances and designs, the well-intentioned story would have been better suited as a play, and that "In their sincere efforts to 'humanize' their complex historical material, the creatives have oversimplified and reduced it to generic themes."[26] In a similar way, The Hollywood Reporter felt that as a musical, "the broad-strokes storytelling ... seems ill-suited to examining such complex issues, and the book's superficial character development doesn't help either."[27] Michael Dale of BroadwayWorld.com admired the cast, but thought that "Allegiance, while certainly not a bad theatre piece, is an underachieving one."[28] The large number of songs was seen as a problem by The Huffington Post, which noted: "Though Kuo has written a lot of it, the score just doesn't make the grade."[29] Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press complained of jarring writing, commenting: "There are long periods of unrelenting misery, with families ripped from their homes and subjected to brutality by vindictive white soldiers. Then there's a song about the joys of baseball. That gives way to scenes with dangerous, choking dust storms, a dead baby and jail beatings. Then there is a happy sock hop."[30] Critical of both the score and the script, Jesse Green of Vulture thought that outside of several moments, "too much of the show is devoted to far-fetched plot twists whose attempts to gin up excitement only look silly in the shadow of the larger forces at work."[31] Terry Teachout of The Wall Street Journal praised Takei, Salonga and Arima's direction, and felt the set was worthy of a Tony Award, but criticized Kuo's score, and deemed the show "of no artistic value whatsoever, save as an object lesson in how to write a really bad Broadway musical."[32]

Allegiance is a musical with music and lyrics by Jay Kuo and a book by Marc Acito, Kuo and Lorenzo Thione. The story, set during the Japanese American internment of World War II (with a framing story set in the present day), was inspired by the personal experiences of George Takei, who stars in the musical. It follows the Kimura family in the years following the attack on Pearl Harbor, as they are forced to leave their farm in Salinas, California and are sent to the Heart Mountain internment camp in the rural plains of Wyoming.
The musical began development in 2008 and premiered in September 2012 in San Diego, California. It played on Broadway from October 2015 to February 2016.[1] Reviews on Broadway were mixed, although the cast was generally praised.[2]

Conception and historical perspective[edit]
In the fall of 2008, George Takei and his husband, Brad, were coincidentally seated next to Jay Kuo and Lorenzo Thione at an Off-Broadway show, where a brief conversation revealed a mutual love of theater. The next day, the four were once again seated together at a Broadway show, In the Heights. At intermission, Kuo and Thione approached Takei, curious as to why he had been so emotionally affected by the father's song ("Useless") in which he laments his inability to help his family. Over the course of that intermission, Takei recounted his personal experience as a child in a Japanese internment camp, during World War II, and his own father's sense of helplessness at his inability to protect his family that was mirrored in the song. Kuo and Thione felt that Takei's family's experience would make a great show.[3][4] Although previous major Broadway musicals have involved Asian and Asian-American topics or settings, including three of Rodgers and Hammerstein's shows, Pacific Overtures and Miss Saigon, Allegiance is "the first [Broadway] musical created by Asian Americans, directed by an Asian American ... with a predominantly Asian cast ... [and] an Asian-American viewpoint informing the work".[5]
The story of the musical takes some liberties with history. According to Frank Abe, the creator of the documentary film Conscience and the Constitution, the musical "conflate[s] Heart Mountain with the worst of the segregation center at Tule Lake and invent[s] military rule at Heart Mountain."[6] The processing of new arrivals is embellished for dramatic effect, as handcuffs and physical abuse by military police did not occur in the internment camps. Abe comments that the resistance by the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee was a studied act of civil disobedience, not a gang of "fists-raised revolutionaries". He notes: "No firearms were used inside the [camps'] perimeter. The resistance was open and above-board, its meetings open to the public. No one had to run or hide; leaders of the Fair Play Committee were quietly taken into custody at their family barracks. ... The resisters knew they risked five years in prison for bucking the draft, but violating the Selective Service Act was never a capital crime, never treason. No resistance leader at Heart Mountain was beaten bloody or hunted by guards", draft cards were not burned, and no newspaper articles affected the internment; notably Frankie would not have been taken to the infirmary by military police, which causes the key conflict in the show.[6] Abe objects to the portrayal of the activities and treatment of the resisters, and to the "relentless optimism" of the score, concluding that the show distorts the historical lesson, diminishes the real impact of "the anger and suppressed rage" that the internees carried from the internment camps, and "risks supplanting the truth of the resistance and the Japanese American experience in the popular mind [and] cheapens the fabric of basic reality to achieve [commercial] ends."[6]
Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
An aged World War II veteran, Sam Kimura, prepares for a Pearl Harbor anniversary ceremony. A woman arrives to inform him that his estranged sister Kei has died, and that she is Kei's executor. She gives Sam an envelope and tells him that the funeral is to be held later that afternoon. Angered by the opening of his old family wounds after nearly 60 years of estrangement, he berates his once-beloved sister for not leaving him in peace. Kei's ghost informs Sam that she couldn't rest in peace without making one last attempt to reconnect with him.
It is 1941, and Sammy is a newly elected class president who dreams of "Going Places", like college and high political office. His widower father Tatsuo, and grandfather Ojii-chan, own a farm in Salinas, California. Sammy adores his older sister Kei, who has postponed her own dreams to help raise him. Tatsuo is always pushing Sammy to be better and reach his potential. Sammy believes that Tatsuo blames Sammy for his wife's death in childbirth. After the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December, the US government fears that Japanese-Americans might be loyal to the Japanese. Nearly all of the Japanese-Americans in the Western US are incarcerated in internment camps. Sammy's family is forced to sell their beautiful farm for a small price and sent to the bleak Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming.
While in this camp, and against his father's wishes, Sammy joins with Mike Masaoka, head of the Japanese American Citizens League, which cooperates with the authorities to identify "disloyal" Japanese. When his grandfather, Ojii-chan, becomes sick, Sammy goes to see the white Quaker volunteer nurse at the camp, Hannah, for some cough syrup. She tells him it is only for the staff, but Sammy is persuasive, and she gives him the medication. The two begin a relationship that causes additional tensions, because interracial marriage with Hannah would be illegal. Tatsuo is not inclined to cooperate. He is sent to a brutal prison for refusing to swear his allegiance by answering "yes" on an unjustly-worded loyalty questionnaire. Sammy's sister Kei falls in love with a draft resistance leader, Frankie Suzuki, and she also joins the resisters advocating for the rights of her people.
Act II[edit]
Masaoka manages to obtain Washington's permission for the Japanese-Americans to enlist in US armed forces, but only if they take on the most dangerous assignments in the war in Italy. Eager to prove his loyalty, Sammy enlists in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a US Army unit consisting of American-born sons of Japanese immigrants, and he fights bravely in Europe. He leads fellow Nisei on a suicide mission, in which the majority of the soldiers are killed. While in prison, Tatsuo is given a copy of Life magazine that trumpets Sammy's bravery in combat, and is told that he was only let out of his cell because of his son's actions.
Meanwhile, Kei and Frankie, who are still in love, help lead the resistance. Eventually, Frankie's scuffles with a military policeman lead to Hannah's accidental and fatal shooting. Grandpa Ojii-chan, who has managed to grow a crop of vegetables in the mountain's rough terrain, dies peacefully while in his garden. After the war, Sammy learns that Frankie and Kei, now married, have a daughter named Hanako (after nurse Hannah). Aghast at this, he confronts Tatsuo, saying that Frankie was the son he always wanted. Already furious at Kei and Frankie, he learns of Hannah's death at Heart Mountain and blames Kei and Frankie. He then walks away from his family for a job in Washington that Masaoka had offered him after discharge. Kei argues with Sammy, calling him a coward for leaving his family. She tries to stop him, but only manages to tear the Purple Heart off of his uniform.
Back in the present day, Sam attends Kei's funeral, and Kei's executor thanks him for attending. Sam opens the envelope and finds a posthumous bequest from Kei: the Life magazine featuring Sammy's exploits that Tatsuo had kept since his release from prison. The executor then says that her mother wanted to give Sam something else, and she hands him his old Purple Heart medal. He then realizes that the executor is his niece Hanako. He breaks down, aware that he has a chance to forgive and to share in the love and compassion of his family.
Production[edit]
Allegiance had its first reading at the Japanese American National Museum on July 13, 2009 starring George Takei, Lea Salonga and others. It was followed by two more readings that were held in New York in 2010 with the same two, but this time with Telly Leung, among others.[7] In the summer of 2011, a workshop was held for Allegiance at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. To commemorate the Japanese-American Day of Remembrance, the memorial for Japanese American Internment, George Takei took to Facebook to initiate a crowd funding campaign through IndieGoGo to raise funds for the show. The initial target was $50,000; the eventual total raised exceeded $158,000.[8] The musical premiered in September 2012 at the Old Globe, directed by Stafford Arima and choreographed by Andrew Palermo, with designs by Donyale Werle (sets), Howell Binkley (lighting) and Alejo Vietti (costumes).[9] It became the Old Globe's biggest box-office success in history.[10] To help fund and publicize a Broadway run, the producers sold Allegiance "Priority Passes" in 2014 for five dollars. The pass allowed people to buy tickets before they were available to the general public.[11]
The musical began previews on October 6, 2015 at Broadway's Longacre Theatre and opened officially on November 8, 2015.[12] Critical reception for the production was mixed.[2][13] The production closed on February 14, 2016 after 37 previews and 111 regular performances.[1]
The Broadway cast album was released on January 29, 2016.[14] A filmed performance of the Broadway production was screened in several movie theatres in North America in December 2016[15] and February 2017.[16]

Reception[edit]
Critical reaction[edit]




David Henry Hwang and George Takei discussing Allegiance at Columbia University in late 2015


Critical reception for the Broadway production was mixed. While the cast was often praised, especially Takei's characterization and Salonga's singing, the reviews frequently criticized poor execution of a worthy subject, especially the lyrics.[2] "The majority of critics admired Allegiance's noble intentions to illuminate a dark corner of America’s past, but found the book melodramatic and the score derivative."[13] Alexis Soloski of The Guardian called the musical "unexceptional though often affecting" and gave it three stars out of five. He liked some of the 1940s style songs but said of the ballads that "none of the melodies linger once the curtain has fallen and the lyrics pile on platitude and cliché."[18]
Entertainment Weekly's review singled out Takei's performance as "providing much-needed islands of levity amidst a sea of sadness. ... Allegiance is an important show with a phenomenal cast, and it deserves to be seen."[19] Rex Reed, in The New York Observer praised the book, score and direction, writing: "The [finale] brought tears to my eyes. The audience is overwhelmed. The screams are voluminous. The songs carry you aloft on wings of triumph, and the greatest cast of under-used Asian talents since Flower Drum Song and Pacific Overtures brings a cheering crowd to its feet every night with a standing ovation that is well deserved.[20] Linda Winer in Newsday commented that the musical "carries its heavy baggage with a surprising lightness of spirit. ... The show has fully developed characters, a strong cast and a new story to tell in an old-fashioned way."[21] The San Diego Union-Tribune, having reviewed the original production at the Old Globe in 2012, was more positive, feeling that the new production, "retains both its powerful story core and a good deal of its lush and melodic score, along with nearly all the top cast members from the original version. ... At its best, “Allegiance” gracefully shapes dramatic and historical contours into an epic that – in the spirit of gaman – coaxes a fierce beauty from once-poisoned soil."[22] In a review that gave Allegiance 3 stars out of four, USA Today felt that even though the show, "is as corny as Kansas in August and as obvious as Lady Gaga on a red carpet ... [but] if you can make a critic who sneered in the first act leave the theater a little teary-eyed, you're probably doing something right."[23] Deadline magazine called Allegiance "another significant addition to a Broadway season that offers an alternative take on the American experience. ... Validation is hardly the worst crime a show can commit, and I think that’s one reason the audience was cheering at the very moving end of the show. It’s a triumph of a rare sort, shedding light in a dark corner of our history with uncommon generosity of spirit."[24]
In The New York Times, however, Charles Isherwood praised the performers but wrote: "The show wants to illuminate a dark passage in American history with complexity and honesty, but the first requirement of any Broadway musical is to entertain. While well-intentioned and polished, Allegiance struggles to balance both ambitions, and doesn’t always find an equilibrium."[25] Variety felt that, despite good performances and designs, the well-intentioned story would have been better suited as a play, and that "In their sincere efforts to 'humanize' their complex historical material, the creatives have oversimplified and reduced it to generic themes."[26] In a similar way, The Hollywood Reporter felt that as a musical, "the broad-strokes storytelling ... seems ill-suited to examining such complex issues, and the book's superficial character development doesn't help either."[27] Michael Dale of BroadwayWorld.com admired the cast, but thought that "Allegiance, while certainly not a bad theatre piece, is an underachieving one."[28] The large number of songs was seen as a problem by The Huffington Post, which noted: "Though Kuo has written a lot of it, the score just doesn't make the grade."[29] Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press complained of jarring writing, commenting: "There are long periods of unrelenting misery, with families ripped from their homes and subjected to brutality by vindictive white soldiers. Then there's a song about the joys of baseball. That gives way to scenes with dangerous, choking dust storms, a dead baby and jail beatings. Then there is a happy sock hop."[30] Critical of both the score and the script, Jesse Green of Vulture thought that outside of several moments, "too much of the show is devoted to far-fetched plot twists whose attempts to gin up excitement only look silly in the shadow of the larger forces at work."[31] Terry Teachout of The Wall Street Journal praised Takei, Salonga and Arima's direction, and felt the set was worthy of a Tony Award, but criticized Kuo's score, and deemed the show "of no artistic value whatsoever, save as an object lesson in how to write a really bad Broadway musical."[32]

One Family, Indivisible








The Allegiance Story 
The Music 
The True History 









Inspired by the true life experience of its star George Takei (Star Trek, Heroes), Allegiance follows one family’s extraordinary journey in this untold American story.

Their loyalty was questioned, their freedom taken away, but their spirit could never be broken. Rejoice in one family’s triumphant story of hope, love, and forgiveness in the new Broadway musical: Allegiance.
Inspired by true events, Allegiance is the story of the Kimura family, whose lives are upended when they and 120,000 other Japanese-Americans are forced to leave their homes following the events of Pearl Harbor. Sam Kimura seeks to prove his patriotism by fighting for his country in the war, but his sister, Kei, fiercely protests the government’s treatment of her people. An uplifting testament to the power of the human spirit, Allegiance follows the Kimuras as they fight between duty and defiance, custom and change, family bonds and forbidden loves. Legendary performer George Takei — (Star Trek, “Heroes”), who was himself an internee as a child, stars alongside Tony® winner Lea Salonga – (Miss Saigon, Mulan) in this enthralling and epic new musical.
But as long-lost memories are unlocked, Sam finds that it is never too late to forgive and to recognize the redemptive power of love.













Listen to Higher performed by Lea Salonga


Tony Award®-winner Lea Salonga makes her highly anticipated return to Broadway. In “Higher,” Lea’s character, Kei, recalls her own childhood in comparison to that of her brother, Sam. As the world around them pushes the two siblings in opposite directions, she questions how Sam could be so sure of his destiny while her own remains unclear. Her life has changed at a dangerous pace, but as a dutiful daughter playing mother has she also been playing it safe?









Making History on Broadway


In 1942, George Takei and his family were evicted from their home on Garnet Street in Los Angeles at gunpoint by the U.S. government. He was five years old. Relocated temporarily to a horse stable at Santa Anita racetrack, the Takeis were eventually incarcerated at Rohwer War Relocation Center in Arkansas. At Rohwer, George’s parents took a principled stand against an infamous questionnaire devised to determine the internees loyalties – a matter central to the story of Allegiance.
Because of their answer the Takeis and other internees deemed “disloyal” were relocated to a high-security camp in California, the Tule Lake Segregation Center. When they were at last permitted to return home George’s family lived on skid row, forced to rebuild their lives from nothing. Despite the injustices he and his family suffered, George harbors no resentment or anger. Each performance of Allegiance is a tribute to the fortitude of his family and to the 120,000 others like them who endured with inspirational grace and dignity.

Allegiance is a musical with music and lyrics by Jay Kuo and a book by Marc Acito, Kuo and Lorenzo Thione. The story, set during the Japanese American internment of World War II (with a framing story set in the present day), was inspired by the personal experiences of George Takei, who stars in the musical. It follows the Kimura family in the years following the attack on Pearl Harbor, as they are forced to leave their farm in Salinas, California and are sent to the Heart Mountain internment camp in the rural plains of Wyoming.
The musical began development in 2008 and premiered in September 2012 in San Diego, California. It played on Broadway from October 2015 to February 2016.[1] Reviews on Broadway were mixed, although the cast was generally praised.[2]

Conception and historical perspective[edit]
In the fall of 2008, George Takei and his husband, Brad, were coincidentally seated next to Jay Kuo and Lorenzo Thione at an Off-Broadway show, where a brief conversation revealed a mutual love of theater. The next day, the four were once again seated together at a Broadway show, In the Heights. At intermission, Kuo and Thione approached Takei, curious as to why he had been so emotionally affected by the father's song ("Useless") in which he laments his inability to help his family. Over the course of that intermission, Takei recounted his personal experience as a child in a Japanese internment camp, during World War II, and his own father's sense of helplessness at his inability to protect his family that was mirrored in the song. Kuo and Thione felt that Takei's family's experience would make a great show.[3][4] Although previous major Broadway musicals have involved Asian and Asian-American topics or settings, including three of Rodgers and Hammerstein's shows, Pacific Overtures and Miss Saigon, Allegiance is "the first [Broadway] musical created by Asian Americans, directed by an Asian American ... with a predominantly Asian cast ... [and] an Asian-American viewpoint informing the work".[5]
The story of the musical takes some liberties with history. According to Frank Abe, the creator of the documentary film Conscience and the Constitution, the musical "conflate[s] Heart Mountain with the worst of the segregation center at Tule Lake and invent[s] military rule at Heart Mountain."[6] The processing of new arrivals is embellished for dramatic effect, as handcuffs and physical abuse by military police did not occur in the internment camps. Abe comments that the resistance by the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee was a studied act of civil disobedience, not a gang of "fists-raised revolutionaries". He notes: "No firearms were used inside the [camps'] perimeter. The resistance was open and above-board, its meetings open to the public. No one had to run or hide; leaders of the Fair Play Committee were quietly taken into custody at their family barracks. ... The resisters knew they risked five years in prison for bucking the draft, but violating the Selective Service Act was never a capital crime, never treason. No resistance leader at Heart Mountain was beaten bloody or hunted by guards", draft cards were not burned, and no newspaper articles affected the internment; notably Frankie would not have been taken to the infirmary by military police, which causes the key conflict in the show.[6] Abe objects to the portrayal of the activities and treatment of the resisters, and to the "relentless optimism" of the score, concluding that the show distorts the historical lesson, diminishes the real impact of "the anger and suppressed rage" that the internees carried from the internment camps, and "risks supplanting the truth of the resistance and the Japanese American experience in the popular mind [and] cheapens the fabric of basic reality to achieve [commercial] ends."[6]
Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
An aged World War II veteran, Sam Kimura, prepares for a Pearl Harbor anniversary ceremony. A woman arrives to inform him that his estranged sister Kei has died, and that she is Kei's executor. She gives Sam an envelope and tells him that the funeral is to be held later that afternoon. Angered by the opening of his old family wounds after nearly 60 years of estrangement, he berates his once-beloved sister for not leaving him in peace. Kei's ghost informs Sam that she couldn't rest in peace without making one last attempt to reconnect with him.
It is 1941, and Sammy is a newly elected class president who dreams of "Going Places", like college and high political office. His widower father Tatsuo, and grandfather Ojii-chan, own a farm in Salinas, California. Sammy adores his older sister Kei, who has postponed her own dreams to help raise him. Tatsuo is always pushing Sammy to be better and reach his potential. Sammy believes that Tatsuo blames Sammy for his wife's death in childbirth. After the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December, the US government fears that Japanese-Americans might be loyal to the Japanese. Nearly all of the Japanese-Americans in the Western US are incarcerated in internment camps. Sammy's family is forced to sell their beautiful farm for a small price and sent to the bleak Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming.
While in this camp, and against his father's wishes, Sammy joins with Mike Masaoka, head of the Japanese American Citizens League, which cooperates with the authorities to identify "disloyal" Japanese. When his grandfather, Ojii-chan, becomes sick, Sammy goes to see the white Quaker volunteer nurse at the camp, Hannah, for some cough syrup. She tells him it is only for the staff, but Sammy is persuasive, and she gives him the medication. The two begin a relationship that causes additional tensions, because interracial marriage with Hannah would be illegal. Tatsuo is not inclined to cooperate. He is sent to a brutal prison for refusing to swear his allegiance by answering "yes" on an unjustly-worded loyalty questionnaire. Sammy's sister Kei falls in love with a draft resistance leader, Frankie Suzuki, and she also joins the resisters advocating for the rights of her people.
Act II[edit]
Masaoka manages to obtain Washington's permission for the Japanese-Americans to enlist in US armed forces, but only if they take on the most dangerous assignments in the war in Italy. Eager to prove his loyalty, Sammy enlists in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a US Army unit consisting of American-born sons of Japanese immigrants, and he fights bravely in Europe. He leads fellow Nisei on a suicide mission, in which the majority of the soldiers are killed. While in prison, Tatsuo is given a copy of Life magazine that trumpets Sammy's bravery in combat, and is told that he was only let out of his cell because of his son's actions.
Meanwhile, Kei and Frankie, who are still in love, help lead the resistance. Eventually, Frankie's scuffles with a military policeman lead to Hannah's accidental and fatal shooting. Grandpa Ojii-chan, who has managed to grow a crop of vegetables in the mountain's rough terrain, dies peacefully while in his garden. After the war, Sammy learns that Frankie and Kei, now married, have a daughter named Hanako (after nurse Hannah). Aghast at this, he confronts Tatsuo, saying that Frankie was the son he always wanted. Already furious at Kei and Frankie, he learns of Hannah's death at Heart Mountain and blames Kei and Frankie. He then walks away from his family for a job in Washington that Masaoka had offered him after discharge. Kei argues with Sammy, calling him a coward for leaving his family. She tries to stop him, but only manages to tear the Purple Heart off of his uniform.
Back in the present day, Sam attends Kei's funeral, and Kei's executor thanks him for attending. Sam opens the envelope and finds a posthumous bequest from Kei: the Life magazine featuring Sammy's exploits that Tatsuo had kept since his release from prison. The executor then says that her mother wanted to give Sam something else, and she hands him his old Purple Heart medal. He then realizes that the executor is his niece Hanako. He breaks down, aware that he has a chance to forgive and to share in the love and compassion of his family.
Production[edit]
Allegiance had its first reading at the Japanese American National Museum on July 13, 2009 starring George Takei, Lea Salonga and others. It was followed by two more readings that were held in New York in 2010 with the same two, but this time with Telly Leung, among others.[7] In the summer of 2011, a workshop was held for Allegiance at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. To commemorate the Japanese-American Day of Remembrance, the memorial for Japanese American Internment, George Takei took to Facebook to initiate a crowd funding campaign through IndieGoGo to raise funds for the show. The initial target was $50,000; the eventual total raised exceeded $158,000.[8] The musical premiered in September 2012 at the Old Globe, directed by Stafford Arima and choreographed by Andrew Palermo, with designs by Donyale Werle (sets), Howell Binkley (lighting) and Alejo Vietti (costumes).[9] It became the Old Globe's biggest box-office success in history.[10] To help fund and publicize a Broadway run, the producers sold Allegiance "Priority Passes" in 2014 for five dollars. The pass allowed people to buy tickets before they were available to the general public.[11]
The musical began previews on October 6, 2015 at Broadway's Longacre Theatre and opened officially on November 8, 2015.[12] Critical reception for the production was mixed.[2][13] The production closed on February 14, 2016 after 37 previews and 111 regular performances.[1]
The Broadway cast album was released on January 29, 2016.[14] A filmed performance of the Broadway production was screened in several movie theatres in North America in December 2016[15] and February 2017.[16]

Reception[edit]
Critical reaction[edit]




David Henry Hwang and George Takei discussing Allegiance at Columbia University in late 2015


Critical reception for the Broadway production was mixed. While the cast was often praised, especially Takei's characterization and Salonga's singing, the reviews frequently criticized poor execution of a worthy subject, especially the lyrics.[2] "The majority of critics admired Allegiance's noble intentions to illuminate a dark corner of America’s past, but found the book melodramatic and the score derivative."[13] Alexis Soloski of The Guardian called the musical "unexceptional though often affecting" and gave it three stars out of five. He liked some of the 1940s style songs but said of the ballads that "none of the melodies linger once the curtain has fallen and the lyrics pile on platitude and cliché."[18]
Entertainment Weekly's review singled out Takei's performance as "providing much-needed islands of levity amidst a sea of sadness. ... Allegiance is an important show with a phenomenal cast, and it deserves to be seen."[19] Rex Reed, in The New York Observer praised the book, score and direction, writing: "The [finale] brought tears to my eyes. The audience is overwhelmed. The screams are voluminous. The songs carry you aloft on wings of triumph, and the greatest cast of under-used Asian talents since Flower Drum Song and Pacific Overtures brings a cheering crowd to its feet every night with a standing ovation that is well deserved.[20] Linda Winer in Newsday commented that the musical "carries its heavy baggage with a surprising lightness of spirit. ... The show has fully developed characters, a strong cast and a new story to tell in an old-fashioned way."[21] The San Diego Union-Tribune, having reviewed the original production at the Old Globe in 2012, was more positive, feeling that the new production, "retains both its powerful story core and a good deal of its lush and melodic score, along with nearly all the top cast members from the original version. ... At its best, “Allegiance” gracefully shapes dramatic and historical contours into an epic that – in the spirit of gaman – coaxes a fierce beauty from once-poisoned soil."[22] In a review that gave Allegiance 3 stars out of four, USA Today felt that even though the show, "is as corny as Kansas in August and as obvious as Lady Gaga on a red carpet ... [but] if you can make a critic who sneered in the first act leave the theater a little teary-eyed, you're probably doing something right."[23] Deadline magazine called Allegiance "another significant addition to a Broadway season that offers an alternative take on the American experience. ... Validation is hardly the worst crime a show can commit, and I think that’s one reason the audience was cheering at the very moving end of the show. It’s a triumph of a rare sort, shedding light in a dark corner of our history with uncommon generosity of spirit."[24]
In The New York Times, however, Charles Isherwood praised the performers but wrote: "The show wants to illuminate a dark passage in American history with complexity and honesty, but the first requirement of any Broadway musical is to entertain. While well-intentioned and polished, Allegiance struggles to balance both ambitions, and doesn’t always find an equilibrium."[25] Variety felt that, despite good performances and designs, the well-intentioned story would have been better suited as a play, and that "In their sincere efforts to 'humanize' their complex historical material, the creatives have oversimplified and reduced it to generic themes."[26] In a similar way, The Hollywood Reporter felt that as a musical, "the broad-strokes storytelling ... seems ill-suited to examining such complex issues, and the book's superficial character development doesn't help either."[27] Michael Dale of BroadwayWorld.com admired the cast, but thought that "Allegiance, while certainly not a bad theatre piece, is an underachieving one."[28] The large number of songs was seen as a problem by The Huffington Post, which noted: "Though Kuo has written a lot of it, the score just doesn't make the grade."[29] Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press complained of jarring writing, commenting: "There are long periods of unrelenting misery, with families ripped from their homes and subjected to brutality by vindictive white soldiers. Then there's a song about the joys of baseball. That gives way to scenes with dangerous, choking dust storms, a dead baby and jail beatings. Then there is a happy sock hop."[30] Critical of both the score and the script, Jesse Green of Vulture thought that outside of several moments, "too much of the show is devoted to far-fetched plot twists whose attempts to gin up excitement only look silly in the shadow of the larger forces at work."[31] Terry Teachout of The Wall Street Journal praised Takei, Salonga and Arima's direction, and felt the set was worthy of a Tony Award, but criticized Kuo's score, and deemed the show "of no artistic value whatsoever, save as an object lesson in how to write a really bad Broadway musical."[32]

Allegiance op Broadway Tickets - NewYork.nl                Zoeken  1.6m AAA Vragen? ericvragen@newyork.nl AAAHomeBroadway musicals -gestoptAllegiance op Broadway Tickets Allegiance op Broadway Tickets Allegiance op Broadway tickets kunnen gemakkelijk en veilig online gekocht worden. Ik raad aan uw musicaltickets te kopen voordat u naar New York gaat, om tijd en geld te besparen. Allegiance is een musical die draait om de internering van Japanse Amerikanen tijdens en na de Tweede Wereldoorlog. De musical is gebaseerd op het persoonlijke verhaal van George Takei (van Star Trek) die ook in het musical speelt. Na de aanval op Pearl Harbour wordt het leven van de Kimura familie flink omgegooid als ze gedwongen worden om hun boerderij in Californië te verlaten. Deze musical gaat over heldenmoed, discriminatie, familie en loyaliteit en is zeker aan te raden als u interesse heeft in deze uitdagende thema’s. U kunt Allegiance zien in het Longacre Theatre.Deze show is helaas afgelopenBekijk hier een aantal andere musicalsHoe koop ik Allegiance op Broadway tickets?Het kopen van tickets is eenvoudig.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
