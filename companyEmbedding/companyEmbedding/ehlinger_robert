Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in South Carolina:













Does Robert Ehlinger carry a valid contracting license?



Contractors in South Carolina do not have to be licensed to do residential construction. Any commercial project with a cost of $5000 and up requires a licensed commercial contractor. 
Robert Ehlinger currently holds license 32973 , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in South Carolina?



Commercial contractors must be able to document 2 years of experience in the last 5 years within the specialty trade prior to taking a licensure exam.











Your liability risk when hiring Robert Ehlinger



Licensed commercial contractors in South Carolina must carry workers' compensation insurance, general liabiltiy insurance is not required. It is a good idea to always hire a contractor who has both general liability and workers' compensation insurance. Request current insurance certificates before any work begins.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in South Carolina, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
