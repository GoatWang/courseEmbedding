There are risks associated with investing in securities of foreign countries, such as erratic market conditions, economic and political instability and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These risks may be more pronounced with respect to investments in emerging markets.


The principal risk of investing in value stocks is that the price of the security may not approach its anticipated value or may decline in value.


Investment in gold and gold related investments present certain risks, and returns on gold related investments have traditionally been more volatile than investments in broader equity or debt markets.


All investments involve the risk of loss of principal.

For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

There are risks associated with investing in securities of foreign countries, such as erratic market conditions, economic and political instability and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These risks may be more pronounced with respect to investments in emerging markets.


The principal risk of investing in value stocks is that the price of the security may not approach its anticipated value or may decline in value.


Investment in gold and gold related investments present certain risks, and returns on gold related investments have traditionally been more volatile than investments in broader equity or debt markets.


All investments involve the risk of loss of principal.


Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the distance a quantity is likely to be from its average value.  It is applied to the annual rate of return to measure volatility.


Beta is a measure of the fund's volatility (risk) relative to the overall market.  The higher the fund's Beta, the more the fund price is expected to change in response to a given change in the value of the market.


The Fund invests in gold and precious metals through investment in a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the “Subsidiary”). Gold Bullion and commodities include the Fund’s investment in the Subsidiary.

 
















Investment Philosophy

The Global Fund’s philosophy reflects the teachings of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett: We believe there is a persistent market failure to recognize a company's intrinsic value. The Fund attempts to exploit this failure on behalf of our investors through a bottom-up, fundamental investment approach.

Investment Process

The fundamental research process has remained constant since the inception of the Fund. The Fund looks for opportunities in companies that have temporarily disappointed investors; industries in turmoil or out of favor; and countries in economic downturns or overlooked by the market.
The investment process involves the following steps:

1

Analyze, Understand Business Models
Thoroughly understand a company and the market in which it operates. Among other critical factors, the team's document-driven analysis examines:

A company's market share
The nature of its products and its business contingencies



2

Recast Financial Statements
Financial statements are recast because:

Conservative accounting practices can mask the true earnings power of a company
In our view, accounting practices are sometimes too liberal

Our goal is to uncover a company's true economic earnings using only demonstrated results.


3

Calculate Intrinsic Value
The team places great emphasis on:

Balance sheet valuation (such as Enterprise Value to Asset Replacement Value)
Cash flow valuation (such as EV/EBIT)

Investments are made based on significant discounts to what is believed to be a company's intrinsic value.


4

Typically Invest for the Long Term
The team typically seeks a discount to what they believe is a company's intrinsic value

They seek further protection by determining a margin of safety in each holding
This margin of safety is viewed as a form of protection against uncertainty in a fundamentally unknowable future.




The Global Fund may also invest in non-equity securities in an attempt to help preserve purchasing power. These include:

Gold bullion
Corporate bonds (senior or subordinated bonds, convertible bonds)
Cash and cash equivalents (commercial paper)
 






There are risks associated with investing in securities of foreign countries, such as erratic market conditions, economic and political instability and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These risks may be more pronounced with respect to investments in emerging markets.


The principal risk of investing in value stocks is that the price of the security may not approach its anticipated value or may decline in value.


Investment in gold and gold related investments present certain risks, and returns on gold related investments have traditionally been more volatile than investments in broader equity or debt markets.


All investments involve the risk of loss of principal.

 

















The following information describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Global Fund.
Please read prospectus carefully for more complete information including details on fees, expenses and risks before investing.
 













 






* A contingent deferred sales charge of 1.00% may be imposed on certain redemptions of Class A shares made within 18 months following a purchase of $1,000,000 or more without an initial sales charge.


**"Other Expenses" shown reflect actual expenses for the Fund for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 and estimated expenses in the case of newly organized share classes.


Class I Shares require $1mm minimum investment, and are offered without sales charge.


There are several ways to lower the sales charge on Class A shares: Aggregation, Rights of Accumulation and Letter of Intention. For details please refer to our prospectus.
In order to claim a breakpoint or other means of reducing the sales charge, an investor should notify his or her dealer, the Distributor, or the Transfer Agent (DST) at the time of purchase.

 

























 






Ordinary income distributions are distributed at the class level and will vary by class.


Collectibles gains, such as gains from gold bullion, held for greater than one year currently are subject to a 28% tax rate. Collectibles gains held for less than one year are taxable to U.S. shareholders as short-term gains.


"Reinvested at" is the share price used to calculate the number of shares added to an account if a shareholder reinvests dividends or capital gains.

 First Eagle Global Value Team - Quarterly Commentary 
        Mar 31, 2017  
        Judging from the strong market trends of the first quarter, investors were generally enthusiastic about the outlook for global economies and markets. Our own view is more guarded. At a global level, debt remains high, and there has been no major deleveraging relative to GDP. We have been repeatedly reminded that debt is easier to create than to destroy.

First Eagle Investment Management, LLC Key Developments

First Eagle Investment Management Launches Retirement Suite
Mar 3 17
First Eagle Investment Management has launched a suite of retirement share classes for its mutual fund line-up. The new R3, R4, R5 and R6 shares, available for purchase on March 1, 2017, represent a transparent and complementary menu of pricing options from which retirement plan fiduciaries can choose the share class most suited to the needs of their plan. The new retirement share classes are available without investment minimums or front-end sales charges and offer varying levels of intermediary compensation, including 12b-1 and sub-TA fees. The R6 shares do not include any form of intermediary compensation and represent the lowest-cost offering among the newly launched shares. First Eagle created a dedicated retirement effort in November 2016 with the goal of helping American retirement savers reach their investment goals. The Retirement Investment Solutions group closely partners with financial advisors, investment consultants and retirement plan recordkeepers to provide investment solutions to plan sponsors, plan participants and individual retirement savers.


First Eagle Investment Management Names Michael Rosenberg as Head of Retirement Investment Solutions Group
Nov 10 16
First Eagle Investment Management announced that it has formed the Retirement Investment Solutions group and hired Michael Rosenberg as its head. Working closely with First Eagle’s retail and institutional distribution teams, the new group will partner with financial advisors, investment consultants and retirement plan recordkeepers to deliver investment solutions to plan sponsors, plan participants and individual retirement savers. Rosenberg reports to Robert Bruno, head of retail distribution for First Eagle Investment Management and president of FEF Distributors. Rosenberg joins First Eagle from Prudential Investments, a unit of Prudential Financial and Prudential Investment Management Services Co., where he was executive VP and director of IODC (investment-only defined contribution). In that role, Rosenberg was in charge of Prudential Investment’s distribution strategy and sales to plan sponsors, consultants, intermediaries and retirement platforms. Prior to joining Prudential in 2007, Rosenberg spent nine years with Goldman Sachs Asset Management, where he was director of retirement services. He also spent 11 years marketing retirement plan services at ABN AMRO.


SEC Charges First Eagle Investment Management and FEF Distributors with Improperly Using Mutual Fund Assets to Pay for Marketing and Distribution of Fund Shares
Sep 21 15
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New York-based investment adviser and its affiliated distributor with improperly using mutual fund assets to pay for the marketing and distribution of fund shares. First Eagle Investment Management and FEF Distributors agreed to pay nearly $40 million to settle the SEC's charges, the first brought under a recent SEC initiative to protect mutual fund shareholders. The money will be returned to the accounts of affected shareholders. An SEC investigation found that First Eagle and FEF unlawfully caused the First Eagle Funds to pay nearly $25 million for distribution-related services, rather than making the payments out of the firms' own assets (known as revenue sharing). Such payments can only come from fund assets pursuant to a written Rule 12b-1 plan that is approved by a fund's board. The case is the first arising out of a recent SEC initiative to protect mutual fund shareholders from bearing the costs when firms improperly use fund assets to pay for distribution-related services. Known as the Distribution-in-Guise Initiative, the SEC is seeking to determine whether some mutual fund advisers are improperly using fund assets to pay for distribution by masking the payments as sub-transfer agency (sub-TA) payments. According to the SEC's order instituting a settled administrative proceeding: Financial intermediaries often provide both distribution and shareholder services to mutual funds. It is unlawful to use fund assets to pay for distribution and marketing, unless such payments are made pursuant to the fund's 12b-1 plan; FEF entered into agreements with two financial intermediaries for their distribution and marketing services. However, First Eagle and FEF treated the agreements as though they were for sub-TA services and improperly used the funds' assets to pay the intermediaries for distribution and marketing; the distribution services payments were in addition to payments made to these intermediaries pursuant to the funds' written 12b-1 plan; First Eagle inaccurately reported to the funds' boards that the distribution and marketing fees paid to the intermediaries were sub-TA fees; the funds' prospectus disclosures also inaccurately stated that FEF or its affiliates were bearing distribution expenses not covered by the funds' Rule 12b-1 plan; the settlement relates to improper payments and disclosure failures that occurred from January 2008 to March 2014. The SEC's order finds that First Eagle willfully violated Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. First Eagle and FEF also caused the Funds to violate Section 12(b) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 12b-1. Without admitting or denying the findings, First Eagle agreed to pay disgorgement of $24,907,354 plus prejudgment interest of $2,340,525 and a penalty of $12.5 million. First Eagle and FEF agreed to cease and desist from further violations and FEF must retain an independent compliance consultant.
