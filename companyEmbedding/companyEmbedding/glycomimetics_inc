 Every year, more than 70,000 people with sickle cell disease are admitted to hospitals.  Rivipansel
(GMI-1070) is currently being studied as a potential treatment for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), the primary trigger for hospitalizations related to sickle cell disease.



 At GlycoMimetics, we actively conduct promising research
and seek to establish unique collaborations in our pursuit of new treatments for people with serious diseases.



 Patients with blood cancers have an urgent need for new medical treatment options. We recently began a clinical study of
GMI-1271.


Who We Are and What We Do
At GlycoMimetics, we are committed to helping to make a difference in the lives of people living with sickle cell, cancer, and other serious diseases. Our mission is to continue to advance our research and clinical candidates, providing hope for patients as we strive for tomorrow’s breakthrough treatments.
GlycoMimetics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. We use novel and proprietary glycobiology technology to develop treatments for diseases, particularly where there is high unmet need. Based on that technology, we have developed a robust, diversified product pipeline.
We are a public company, traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol GLYC. We are located in Rockville, Maryland in the BioHealth Capital Region.

GlycoMimetics is focused on discovering and developing novel medicines based on an understanding of the role carbohydrates play in important biological processes.
Almost all human proteins that are expressed within the cell are modified by the post-translational addition of complex carbohydrates to the protein surface. Many of these carbohydrate structures affect the functions of these proteins and their interactions with other molecules.
One key to understanding many complex biological interactions, therefore, is to understand the functional role that specific carbohydrates play. This field of study is known as glycobiology.
The structures of carbohydrates account for much of the complexity and functionality of proteins and protein activity. As the structures and roles played by specific carbohydrates are defined, GlycoMimetics is designing specific molecules that can act on these biological processes.
The term “glycomimetics” refers to molecules that mimic the structure and activity of carbohydrates. GlycoMimetics is discovering and developing compounds that are mimetics of naturally occurring carbohydrates (glycomimetics), and not natural carbohydrates themselves. Our product candidates are rationally designed to function more like traditional therapeutics (e.g., exhibiting good bioavailability and pharmacokinetics) and to enhance the key biological activity over the native carbohydrate structures.
By delivering on highly differentiated product profiles, GlycoMimetics drug candidates have potential to address significant unmet medical needs. In addition to our drug candidates in the clinic, which target vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease and AML, drugs in research include therapies for other cancers.

About GMI-1271
GlycoMimetics is developing GMI-1271, a small molecule E-Selectin antagonist, as an adjunct treatment to standard of care chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies, initially targeting AML. GlycoMimetics is also studying GMI-1271 in patients with multiple myeloma. By blocking E-selectin, GMI-1271 also may protect normal blood-producing cells, and reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapy such as low white blood cell counts that make some patients more prone to infections.
GMI-1271 has been tested in healthy volunteers and is now being tested in individuals with AML via a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Results of preclinical studies were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) and at the American Association for Cancer Researchers (AACR) Annual Meeting. GMI-1271 has not been approved for use by any worldwide health authority.
In June 2016, GlycoMimetics announced that it received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for GMI-1271 for treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML and elderly patients aged 60 years or older with AML.
Interim data reports on the on-going Phase 1/2 trial have been presented at EHA in June 2016 and at ASH in December 2016, showing high remission rates and a good safety profile in the study so far.
About the Current Trial in AML
The study is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1/2 trial using GMI-1271 in combination with standard chemotherapy in individuals with AML. The investigational agent will be given throughout the chemotherapy treatment period. Some additional bone marrow and blood samples will be obtained during routine bone marrow assessments, to further inform study doctors about drug activity.

About the Current Trial in Multiple Myeloma
The newly initiated multi-center, open-label dose escalation trial, which has begun in Ireland, will measure the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of GMI-1271 in combination with chemotherapy among patients who have been diagnosed with multiple myeloma and have not responded well to standard chemotherapy. The company anticipates enrolling 24 participants in the trial.

GlycoMimetics, Inc. Key Developments

Glycomimetics, Inc. Appoints Patricia S. Andrews to its Board of Directors
Jun 12 17
GlycoMimetics, Inc. announced the appointment of Patricia S. Andrews, chief executive officer and director of Boston Biomedical, Inc., to its Board of Directors. Ms. Andrews was named CEO of Boston Biomedical in April 2017. She joined the company in 2013 and was most recently its Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, where she prepared for launching the company’s first product, and guided the company’s pipeline development.


GlycoMimetics, Inc. Announces New and Updated Data from the Phase 2 Portion of its Ongoing Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial
Jun 5 17
GlycoMimetics, Inc. announced new and updated data from the Phase 2 portion of its ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial that showed high remission and low mortality rates of its drug candidate GMI-1271, an E-selectin antagonist being developed as a treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Clinical investigators are presenting the data from 79 patients in the trial through posters and discussion at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago. In this trial, patients treated with GMI-1271 together with standard chemotherapy continue to achieve higher than expected remission rates based on historical controls, as well as lower than expected induction-related mortality rates. Treatment also continues to be well tolerated in this patient population. Among the 54 relapsed/refractory AML patients participating in the trial for whom data is available: The overall response rate (complete remission/complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery, or CR/CRi) was 41%, which is higher than historical controls, and the 60-day induction related mortality rate was 7%, which is lower than historical controls. Oral mucositis, or inflammation with mouth ulcers that is a sign of adverse effects of chemotherapy, was seen at low rates and severity with only one Grade 3/4 event observed. The median overall survival time for Phase 1 trial patients was 7.6 months. Remissions were durable enough to allow 9 patients to receive stem cell transplants. For patients in the Phase 1 portion of the trial who responded with a remission, more than half survived for at least a year after treatment. Among the 25 newly diagnosed elderly patients (age 60 and older) participating in the trial for whom data is available: The overall response (CR/CRi) rate was 68%, with 73% in patients with de novo AML and 64% in patients with secondary AML. The 60-day mortality rate was 8%. There were no cases of grade 3 or 4 mucositis. For the 9 evaluable patients achieving CR/CRi, disease-free survival was 100% at 6 months after treatment. Data from the Phase 1/2 trial were submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In May 2017, the FDA granted GMI-1271 Breakthrough Therapy designation for treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML. In addition, GMI-1271 has been granted Orphan Drug designation and Fast Track status by the FDA and Orphan Drug designation by the European Commission.


GlycoMimetics, Inc Completes Enrollment of Relapsed/Refractory AML Patient Cohort in Phase 2 Portion of Clinical Trial of GMI-1271
May 31 17
GlycoMimetics, Inc. announced that the second of two patient cohorts in the Phase 2 portion of its ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of GMI-1271 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has completed enrollment. This second cohort is comprised of 66 participants with relapsed/refractory AML. The study is designed to evaluate the potential of GMI-1271, an E-selectin antagonist drug candidate, in combination with chemotherapy, as a treatment for individuals with either newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory AML. Enrollment in the study’s first arm in newly diagnosed elderly AML patients was completed in the first quarter of this year. The company expects to submit interim study data for presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2017. Interim clinical data from the ongoing trial of GMI-1271 will be presented at the 2017 meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Hematology Association (EHA). To date, GMI-1271 has been consistently well tolerated, with no obvious incremental toxicity when added to chemotherapy. In addition, patients with AML treated with GMI-1271 have experienced higher than expected remission rates and lower than expected 30- and 60-day mortality rates.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

 Every year, more than 70,000 people with sickle cell disease are admitted to hospitals.  Rivipansel
(GMI-1070) is currently being studied as a potential treatment for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), the primary trigger for hospitalizations related to sickle cell disease.



 At GlycoMimetics, we actively conduct promising research
and seek to establish unique collaborations in our pursuit of new treatments for people with serious diseases.



 Patients with blood cancers have an urgent need for new medical treatment options. We recently began a clinical study of
GMI-1271.


Who We Are and What We Do
At GlycoMimetics, we are committed to helping to make a difference in the lives of people living with sickle cell, cancer, and other serious diseases. Our mission is to continue to advance our research and clinical candidates, providing hope for patients as we strive for tomorrow’s breakthrough treatments.
GlycoMimetics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. We use novel and proprietary glycobiology technology to develop treatments for diseases, particularly where there is high unmet need. Based on that technology, we have developed a robust, diversified product pipeline.
We are a public company, traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol GLYC. We are located in Rockville, Maryland in the BioHealth Capital Region.
