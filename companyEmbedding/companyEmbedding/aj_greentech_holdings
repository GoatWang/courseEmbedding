NEW YORK, March 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- AJ Greentech Holdings Ltd. (OTCPK: AJGH) a leading developer, manufacturer and distributor of green energy, recently announced the signing of a MOU with Taiwan Taxi to obtain 1500 taxi models for the purpose of research and development of its renewable energy solutions for the transportation industry. Focusing green energy development in a polluted area like China can have significant upside potential given the company executes its business strategy correctly and effectively. 
The company has also signed a contract in the past week with Taiwan BYD to manufacture electric taxi models. The e6 electric taxi models will revolutionize the sustainable energy movement with its statistics. With a maximum speed of 140 km/hr. and acceleration comparable to normal everyday cars, the e6 will make an impact on the electric taxi market. A fully charged e6 taxi can travel for 300 km without a charge and can charge up to 80% within 40 minutes. These two news releases combine for a compelling story building up for AJ Greentech Holdings.

	AJ Greentech
	Holdings, Ltd.






	March 31, 2017
	and 2016






	Notes to the
	Consolidated Financial Statements






	(Unaudited)





	 







	Note 1 –
	Organization and Basis of presentation






	 






	Organization





	AJ Greentech Holdings
	Ltd. is a Nevada corporation incorporated on August 30, 2006, under the name Gateway Certifications, Inc. On November 16, 2009,
	our corporate name was changed to American Jianye Greentech Holdings, Ltd. and on February 13, 2014, our corporate name was changed
	to AJ Greentech Holdings, Ltd.




	 




	From November
	2009 until October 2013, through our China subsidiaries, we were engaged in design, marketing and distributing of alcohol base
	clean fuel that are designed to use less fossil fuel and have less pollution than traditional fuel.




	 




	On October 31,
	2013, pursuant to agreements with one of our former directors, we transferred the stock in our China subsidiaries to the former
	director in exchange for cancellation of debt totaling $240,000. As a result of the transfer of the subsidiaries, we were no longer
	engaged in the China cleanfuel business. We transferred the stock of the China subsidiaries because we felt that, it not our best
	interest to continue China cleanfuel business as a result of our decreasing revenue, continued losses and inability to raise capital
	for our business.




	 




	On October 31,
	2013, Chu Li An acquired, for nominal consideration, 8,000,000 shares of common stock from the director who acquired the subsidiaries
	and 12,778,399 shares of common stock from The Chairman, who was also a director. On November 1, 2013, Chu Li An and the Company
	entered into a loan agreement pursuant to which the Chu Li An agreed to lend us $100,000 initially with future loan amount up
	to $1,000,000, for which we will issue our 6% demand promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000. As of March 31, 2017,
	the note has not been issued.




	 




	On November 18,
	2013, we entered into agreement pursuant to which we issued to Chu Li An and her BVI company, our sole director and chief executive
	officer, 180,000,000 shares of common stock, in consideration of the cancellation of debt due to Chu Li An in the amount of $180,000.




	 




	On November 30,
	2013, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding stock of Jin Chih International, Ltd.,
	a Taiwan corporation, from its sole owner Chu Li An for five million shares of the Company’s common stock. As of March 31,
	2017, the stock has not been issued.




	 




	As a result of
	the above transactions, we carry out the electronic products and general cargo trading and related consulting service business
	through our subsidiary named Jin Chih International, Ltd in Taiwan. We still plan to focus on providing greentech products outside
	of China in future. Even though the company has disposed China branches, the company's new management will continue to expand
	the current green energy and technology business in the United States and globally, at the same time to explore many other green
	and renewable energy such as solar, wind power, sea power by signing licensing agreement or joint venture with other research
	institutes .




	 





	Basis of presentation





	The accompanying
	consolidated financial statements of AJ Greentech Holdings Ltd. (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”).

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 






	Use of Estimates





	The preparation
	of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
	of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses
	during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates
	are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those results.




	 





	Segment Information





	ASC 280 requires
	companies to report information about operating segment in interim and annual financial statements. It also requires segment disclosures
	about products and services geographic and major customers. The Company has determined that it does not have any separately reportable
	operating segments.





	 






	Accounts Receivable
	and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts





	Accounts receivable
	are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company follows paragraph 310-10-50-9 of the
	FASB Accounting Standards Codification to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations
	of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness, as determined
	by the review of their current credit information; and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical write-off
	experience, customer specific facts and economic conditions.




	 




	Outstanding account
	balances are reviewed individually for collectability. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate
	of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company’s existing accounts receivable. Bad debt expense is included in general
	and administrative expenses, if any. Pursuant to paragraph 310-10-50-2 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification account balances
	are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered
	remote. The Company has adopted paragraph 310-10-50-6 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and determine when receivables
	are past due or delinquent based on how recently payments have been received.

	Inventories







	The Company values
	inventories, consisting of raw materials, packaging material and finished goods, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
	on the first-in and first-out (“FIFO”) method for raw materials and packaging materials and the weighted average cost
	method for finished goods. Cost of finished goods comprises direct labor, direct materials, direct production cost and an allocated
	portion of production overhead. The Company reduces inventories for the diminution of value, resulting from product obsolescence,
	damage or other issues affecting marketability, equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market
	value. Factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include (i) current sales data and historical return rates,
	(ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv)new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates,
	and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.




	 




	The Company evaluates
	its current level of inventories considering historical sales and other factors and, based on this evaluation, classify inventory
	markdowns in the income statement as a component of cost of goods sold pursuant to Paragraph 420-10-S99 of the FASB Accounting
	Standards Codification to adjust inventories to net realizable value. These markdowns are estimates, which could vary significantly
	from actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer demand or competition differ from expectations. Other significant
	estimates include the allocation of variable and fixed production overheads. While variable production overheads are allocated
	to each unit of production on the basis of actual use of production facilities, the allocation of fixed production overhead to
	the costs of conversion is based on the normal capacity of the Company’s production facilities, and recognizes abnormal
	idle facility expenses as current period charges. Certain costs, including categories of indirect materials, indirect labor and
	other indirect manufacturing costs which are included in the overhead pools are estimated. The management of the Company determines
	its normal capacity based upon the amount of operating hours of the manufacturing machinery and equipment in a reporting period.




	 




	As of March 31,
	2017, the inventory value was $697,108.




	 





	Revenue Recognition





	The Company’s
	revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC 605 (Originally issued as Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104). Revenue
	is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery
	is completed, no other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received
	before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue. Discounts provided
	to customers by the Company at the time of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold. Sales taxes are
	not recorded as a component of sales.




	 




	The Company derives
	its revenues from sales contracts with customers with revenues being generated upon the shipment of merchandise. Persuasive evidence
	of an arrangement is demonstrated via sales invoice or contract; product delivery is evidenced by warehouse shipping log as well
	as a signed acknowledgement of receipt from the customers or a signed bill of lading from the third party trucking company and
	title transfers upon shipment, based on free on board (“FOB”) warehouse terms; the sales price to the customer is
	fixed upon acceptance of the signed purchase order or contract and there is no separate sales rebate, discount, or volume incentive.
	When the Company recognizes revenue, no provisions are made for returns because, historically, there have been very few sales
	returns and adjustments that have impacted the ultimate collection of revenues.




	 




	The Company markets
	and distributes electronic products and general cargo for automobile use and follows Section 605-45-45 (formerly EITF 99-19) (“ASC
	Section 605-45-45”) of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition to report revenue gross as a principal
	for its sales since the Company (1) acts as principal in the transaction, (2) takes title to the products, (3) has risks and rewards
	of ownership, such as the risk of loss for collection, delivery, or returns, and (4) does not act as an agent or broker (including
	performing services, in substance, as an agent or broker) with compensation on a commission or fee basis on its sales. The management
	of the Company determined that the Company should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer when considering
	each of the following eight (8) indicators of gross revenue reporting listed in ASC Paragraph 605-45-45-4 through 605-45-45-14
	as specified (1) The entity is the primary obligor in the arrangement — The Company signs a product sales agreement with
	its customer and represents in writing that the Company is responsible for fulfillment, including the acceptability of the product(s)
	or service(s) ordered or purchased by the customer; (2) The entity has general inventory risk (before customer order is placed
	or upon customer return); (3) The entity has latitude in establishing price — The Company has reasonable latitude, within
	economic constraints, to establish the exchange price with a customer for the product or service; (4) The entity changes the product
	or performs part of the service— The Company developed a method for blending the raw materials in its manufacturing process,
	through its proprietary technology, catalysts can be mixed with fuel and alcohols to become a finished product to be sold after
	pumping and piping; (5) The entity has discretion in supplier selection — The Company has multiple suppliers for the products
	ordered by a customer and discretion to select the supplier that will provide the product(s) or service(s) ordered by a customer;
	(6) The entity is involved in the determination of product or service specifications — The Company determines the nature,
	type, characteristics, or specifications of the product(s) or service(s) ordered by the customer; (7) The entity has physical
	loss inventory risk of purchased inventories after customer order; and (8) The entity has credit risk — The Company is responsible
	for collecting the sales price from its customer but must pay the amount owed to its supplier after the supplier performs, regardless
	of whether the sales price is fully collected. Net sales of products represent the invoiced value of goods, net of value added
	taxes (“VAT”). The Company is subject to VAT which is levied on all of the Company’s products at the rate of
	5% on the invoiced value of sales. Sales or Output VAT is borne by customers in addition to the invoiced value of sales and Purchase
	or Input VAT is borne by the Company in addition to the invoiced value of purchases to the extent not refunded for export sales.

	Fair Value
	of Financial Instruments





	The fair values
	of the Company’s accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the relatively
	short maturities of these instruments. The carrying value of the Company’s short and long term debt approximates fair value
	based on management’s best estimate of the interest rates that would be available for similar debt obligations having similar
	terms at the balance sheet date.




	 





	Impairment
	of Long-Lived Assets





	The Company accounts
	for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. The Company
	periodically evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
	value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) from
	the use of an asset were less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated
	fair value.




	 




	The assumptions
	used by management in determining the future cash flows are critical. In the event these expected cash flows are not realized,
	future impairment losses may be recorded.




	 





	Income Taxes





	The Company accounts
	for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities
	and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities,
	using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense)
	results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when, in the
	opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized.




	 




	The Company adopted
	ASC 740-10-25, Income Taxes- Overall-Recognition, on January 1, 2007, which provides criteria for the recognition, measurement,
	presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax position. The Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
	only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on
	the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured
	based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company did
	not recognize any additional liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10-25.




	 





	Net Income
	(Loss) per Share





	The Company calculates
	its basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income
	by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting
	the weighted average outstanding shares to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive warrants and options and convertible
	securities.




	 





	Translation
	Adjustment





	The Company’s
	financial statements are presented in the U.S. dollar ($), which is the Company’s reporting and functional currency. The
	functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries is TWD. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the
	functional currency rate prevailing at the date of transaction. Any differences between the initially recorded amount and the
	settlement amount are recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency transaction in the consolidated statements of operations.
	Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the functional currency rate of exchange prevailing
	at the balance sheet date. Any differences are taken to profit or loss as a gain or loss on foreign currency translation in the
	statements of operations.




	 




	In accordance
	with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, the Company translates the assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars using the rate of
	exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at an average rate
	during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation from TWD into U.S. dollar are recorded in stockholders’
	equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income. The exchange rates used for the financial statements in accordance with
	ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, are as follows:

	Recently Issued
	Accounting Pronouncements





	In August 2014,
	the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15

	“Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern
	(Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (“ASU 2014-15”).





	 




	In connection
	with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity’s management should evaluate
	whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability
	to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the

	financial statements are issued

	(or within one year
	after the date that the

	financial statements are available to be issued

	when applicable).




	 




	Management’s
	evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the

	financial
	statements are issued

	(or at the date that the

	financial statements are available to be issued

	when applicable). Substantial
	doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in
	the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one
	year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The term

	probable

	is used consistently
	with its use in Topic 450, Contingencies.




	 




	When management
	identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, management
	should consider whether its plans that are intended to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial
	doubt. The mitigating effect of management’s plans should be considered only to the extent that (1) it is probable that
	the plans will be effectively implemented and, if so, (2) it is probable that the plans will mitigate the conditions or events
	that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.




	 




	If conditions
	or events raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial doubt is
	alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans, the entity should disclose information that enables users
	of the financial statements to understand all of the following (or refer to similar information disclosed elsewhere in the footnotes):








	a.




	Principal
	conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to
	continue as a going concern (before consideration of management’s plans).










	b.




	Management’s
	evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity’s
	ability to meet its obligations.










	c.




	Management’s
	plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue
	as a going concern.






	 




	If conditions
	or events raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, and substantial doubt is not
	alleviated after consideration of management’s plans, an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating that
	there is

	substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going


	concern

	within one year after
	the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). Additionally, the entity should disclose information
	that enables users of the financial statements to understand all of the following:








	a.




	Principal
	conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to
	continue as a going concern.










	b.




	Management’s
	evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity’s
	ability to meet its obligations.










	c.




	Management’s
	plans that are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt
	about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.






	 




	The amendments
	in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods
	thereafter. Early application is permitted.




	 




	Management does
	not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material effect
	on the accompanying financial statements.




	 





	Note 3 –
	Going Concern






	 





	There are no assurances
	that the Company will be able to either (1) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations;
	or (2) obtain additional financing through either private placement, public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support
	the Company’s working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from any private placements, public offering
	and/or bank financing are insufficient to support the Company’s working capital requirements, the Company will have to raise
	additional working capital from additional financing. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or
	if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not available, the Company may not be
	able continue its operations.




	 




	These conditions
	raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include
	any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of
	liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	Overview





	 




	From November
	2009 until October, 2013, through our China subsidiary, we were engaged in design, marketing and distributing of alcohol base
	clean fuel which are designed to use less fossil fuel and have less pollution than traditional fuel.




	 




	On October 31,
	2013, pursuant to agreements with one of our former directors, we transferred the stock in our China subsidiaries to the former
	director in exchange for cancellation of debt totaling $240,000. As a result of the transfer of the subsidiaries, we were no longer
	engaged in the China cleanfuel business. We transferred the stock of the China subsidiaries because we felt that, it's not our
	best interest to continue China cleanfuel business as a result of our decreasing revenue, continued losses and inability to raise
	capital for our business.




	 




	On November 30,
	2013, the company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding stock of Jin Chih International, Ltd.,
	a Taiwan corporation, from its sole owner Chu Li An for five million shares of the Company’s common stock. As of March 31,
	2017, the stock has not been issued.




	 




	As a result of
	the above transactions, we carry out the electronic products and general cargo trading and related consulting service business
	through our subsidiary named Jin Chih International, Ltd in Taiwan. We still plan to focus on providing greentech products outside
	of China in future. Even though the company has disposed China branches, the company's new management will continue to expand
	the current green energy and technology business in the United States and globally, at the same time to explore many other green
	and renewable energy such as solar, wind power, sea power by signing licensing agreement or joint venture with other research
	institutes .




	 





	Results of
	Operations





	 




	For the three
	months ended March 31, 2017, we derived our revenues of $3,822,265 compared to $612,004 for the three months ended March 31, 2016,
	representing an increase of $3,210,261. Our sales came from the electronic products and general cargo trading and related consulting
	service to our customers operated by the Taiwan subsidiary.




	 




	Selling, general
	and administrative expenses consist of provision for doubtful debts, primarily of payroll, local taxes, investor relation expenses
	and professional fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $94,933, comparing
	to $36,747 for the last period.




	 




	Our business operates
	primarily in Taiwanese Dollars (“TWD”), but we report our results in our SEC filings in U.S. Dollars. The conversion
	of our accounts from TWD to Dollars results in translation adjustments. While our net income is added to the retained earnings
	on our balance sheets; the translation adjustments are added to a line item on our balance sheets labeled “accumulated other
	comprehensive income,” since it is more reflective of changes in the relative values of U.S. and Taiwanese currencies than
	of the success of our business. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the effect of converting our financial results to
	U.S. Dollars was to decrease $384 to our accumulated other comprehensive income.




	 





	Liquidity and
	Capital Resources





	 




	Our operations
	to date have been funded primarily by operations, due from related parties and capital contributions.




	At March 31, 2017
	and December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $153,221 and $254,432, respectively. Our cash at March 31, 2017 was
	decreased by $101,211 from December 31, 2016.




	 




	Our current assets
	at March 31, 2017 were $5,213,543, compared to $2,071,547 at December 31, 2016. This increase mainly reflects increase in accounts
	receivable and inventory and partially offset by decreases in cash, short-term investments.




	 




	Our current liabilities
	at March 31, 2017 were $1,549,589, compared to $ 1,424,331 at December 31, 2016. This increase mainly reflects a significant increase
	of account payable and long term debt and partially offset by decrease in borrowing and tax payable.

	Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing
	Activities







	 





	In the first three months of 2017,

	cash used in financing activities of $58,897 consisted of the repayment of borrowing $168,199 and the new increased long term
	debt of $109,302.




	 





	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements





	 




	We do not have any off-balance sheet
	arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations.




	 





	Critical Accounting Policies and
	Estimates




	 



	This discussion
	and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements that have been prepared
	under accounting principle generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
	of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.




	 




	Actual results could differ from those
	estimates.



	 



	A summary of significant
	accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Of these policies,
	we believe that the following items are the most critical in preparing our financial statements.




	 





	Accounts Receivable and Allowance
	for Doubtful Accounts





	Accounts receivable
	are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company follows paragraph 310-10-50-9 of the
	FASB Accounting Standards Codification to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations
	of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness, as determined
	by the review of their current credit information; and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical write-off
	experience, customer specific facts and economic conditions.




	 




	Outstanding account
	balances are reviewed individually for collectability. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate
	of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company’s existing accounts receivable. Bad debt expense is included in general
	and administrative expenses, if any. Pursuant to paragraph 310-10-50-2 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification account balances
	are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered
	remote. The Company has adopted paragraph 310-10-50-6 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and determine when receivables
	are past due or delinquent based on how recently payments have been received.




	 





	Inventories









	The Company values
	inventories, consisting of raw materials, packaging material and finished goods, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
	on the first-in and first-out (“FIFO”) method for raw materials and packaging materials and the weighted average cost
	method for finished goods. Cost of finished goods comprises direct labor, direct materials, direct production cost and an allocated
	portion of production overhead. The Company reduces inventories for the diminution of value, resulting from product obsolescence,
	damage or other issues affecting marketability, equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market
	value. Factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include (i) current sales data and historical return rates,
	(ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates,
	and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.




	 




	The Company evaluates
	its current level of inventories considering historical sales and other factors and, based on this evaluation, classify inventory
	markdowns in the income statement as a component of cost of goods sold pursuant to Paragraph 420-10-S99 of the FASB Accounting
	Standards Codification to adjust inventories to net realizable value. These markdowns are estimates, which could vary significantly
	from actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer demand or competition differ from expectations. Other significant
	estimates include the allocation of variable and fixed production overheads. While variable production overheads are allocated
	to each unit of production on the basis of actual use of production facilities, the allocation of fixed production overhead to
	the costs of conversion is based on the normal capacity of the Company’s production facilities, and recognizes abnormal
	idle facility expenses as current period charges. Certain costs, including categories of indirect materials, indirect labor and
	other indirect manufacturing costs which are included in the overhead pools are estimated. The management of the Company determines
	its normal capacity based upon the amount of operating hours of the manufacturing machinery and equipment in a reporting period.




	 





	Revenue Recognition





	The Company applies
	paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when
	it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following
	criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been
	rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.




	 




	The Company derives
	its revenues from sales contracts with customers with revenues being generated upon the shipment of merchandise. Persuasive evidence
	of an arrangement is demonstrated via sales invoice or contract; product delivery is evidenced by warehouse shipping log as well
	as a signed acknowledgement of receipt from the customers or a signed bill of lading from the third party trucking company and
	title transfers upon shipment, based on free on board (“FOB”) warehouse terms; the sales price to the customer is
	fixed upon acceptance of the signed purchase order or contract and there is no separate sales rebate, discount, or volume incentive.
	When the Company recognizes revenue, no provisions are made for returns because, historically, there have been very few sales
	returns and adjustments that have impacted the ultimate collection of revenues.




	 




	The Company
	markets and distributes electronic products and general cargo for automobile use and follows Section 605-45-45 (formerly EITF
	99-19) (“ASC Section 605-45-45”) of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition to report
	revenue gross as a principal for its sales since the Company (1) acts as principal in the transaction, (2) takes title to the
	products, (3) has risks and rewards of ownership, such as the risk of loss for collection, delivery, or returns, and (4) does
	not act as an agent or broker (including performing services, in substance, as an agent or broker) with compensation on a
	commission or fee as is on its sales. The management of the Company determined that the Company should report revenue based
	on the gross amount billed to a customer when considering each of the following eight (8) indicators of gross revenue
	reporting listed in ASC Paragraph 605-45-45-4 through 605-45-45-14 as specified (1) The entity is the primary obligor in the
	arrangement — The Company signs a product sales agreement with its customer and represents in writing that the Company
	is responsible for fulfillment, including the acceptability of the product(s) or service(s) ordered or purchased by the
	customer; (2) The entity has general inventory risk (before customer order is placed or upon customer return); (3) The entity
	has latitude in establishing price — The Company has reasonable latitude, within economic constraints, to establish the
	exchange price with a customer for the product or service; (4) The entity changes the product or performs part of the
	service— The Company developed a method for blending the raw materials in its manufacturing process, through its
	proprietary technology, catalysts can be mixed with

	fuel and alcohols to become a finished product to be sold after
	pumping and piping; (5) The entity has discretion in supplier selection — The Company has multiple suppliers for
	the products ordered by a customer and discretion to select the supplier that will provide the product(s) or service(s)
	ordered by a customer; (6) The entity is involved in the determination of product or service specifications — The
	Company determines the nature, type, characteristics, or specifications of the product(s) or service(s) ordered by the
	customer; (7) The entity has physical loss inventory risk of purchased inventories after customer order; and (8) The entity
	has credit risk — The Company is responsible for collecting the sales price from its customer but must pay the amount
	owed to its supplier after the supplier performs, regardless of whether the sales price is fully collected.



	 




	Net sales of products
	represent the invoiced value of goods, net of value added taxes (“VAT”). The Company is subject to VAT which is levied
	on all of the Company’s products at the rate of 5% on the invoiced value of sales. Sales or Output VAT is borne by customers
	in addition to the invoiced value of sales and Purchase or Input VAT is borne by the Company in addition to the invoiced value
	of purchases to the extent not refunded for export sales.




	 





	Foreign Currency
	Translation







	The Company follows
	Section 830-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 830-10-45”) for foreign currency translation
	to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiary from the functional currency, generally the local currency, into
	U.S. Dollars. Section 830-10-45 sets out the guidance relating to how a reporting entity determines the functional currency of
	a foreign entity (including of a foreign entity in a highly inflationary economy), remeasures the books of record (if necessary),
	and characterizes transaction gains and losses. the assets, liabilities, and operations of a foreign entity shall be measured
	using the functional currency of that entity. An entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment
	in which the entity operates; normally, that is the currency of the environment, or local currency, in which an entity primarily
	generates and expends cash.




	 




	The functional
	currency of each foreign subsidiary is determined based on management’s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant
	economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary. Generally, the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority
	of its transactions, including billings, financing, payroll and other expenditures, would be considered the functional currency,
	but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary’s operations must also be considered. If a subsidiary’s
	functional currency is deemed to be the local currency, then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary’s
	financial statements is included in accumulated other comprehensive income. However, if the functional currency is deemed to be
	the U.S. Dollar, then any gain or loss associated with the re-measurement of these financial statements from the local currency
	to the functional currency would be included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss). If the
	Company disposes of foreign subsidiaries, then any cumulative translation gains or losses would be recorded into the consolidated
	statements of income and comprehensive income (loss). If the Company determines that there has been a change in the functional
	currency of a subsidiary to the U.S. Dollar, any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included
	within the statement of income and comprehensive income (loss).




	 




	Based on an assessment
	of the factors discussed above, the management of the Company determined the relevant subsidiaries’ local currencies to
	be their respective functional currencies.




	 




	The financial
	records of the Company's Taiwan operating subsidiaries acquired on November 30, 2013 are maintained in their local currency, the
	“TWD”, which is also the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated from the local currency into the
	reporting currency, U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated
	at weighted average exchange rates for the period to approximate translation at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates those
	elements are recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency translation gain (loss) resulting from the
	process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in determining accumulated other
	comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity.

	Disclosure
	Controls and Procedures






	 




	Regulations under
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) require public companies to maintain “disclosure controls
	and procedures,” which are defined as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
	to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
	and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls
	and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
	by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management,
	including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
	allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	We conducted an
	evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure
	controls and procedures as of March 31, 2017. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
	have concluded that as of March 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance
	level due to the material weaknesses described below.




	 




	In light of the
	material weaknesses described below, we performed additional analysis to ensure our financial statements were prepared in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly
	present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.




	 




	A material weakness
	is a control deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard No. 2)
	or combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual
	or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has identified the following two material weaknesses
	which have caused management to conclude that, as of March 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
	at the reasonable assurance level:




	 








	1.




	We
	do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written
	documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section
	404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the quarter ending March
	31, 2017. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation
	of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls
	and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented
	a material weakness.






	 








	2.




	We
	do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a
	basic internal control. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties
	may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent
	possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of
	transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact
	of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls
	and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented
	a material weakness.






	 




	To address these
	material weaknesses, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included
	herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
	presented.




	 






	Management's
	Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.






	 




	Our management
	is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance
	with as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed
	to provide reasonable assurance regarding the (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (ii) reliability of financial reporting
	and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
	and (iii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth
	in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
	(COSO).




	 




	Due to inherent
	limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
	of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
	or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.




	 




	A material weakness
	in internal controls is a deficiency in internal control, or combination of control deficiencies, that adversely affects the Company’s
	ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement
	of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected.
	In the course of making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, we identified some
	material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.




	 




	We lack sufficient
	personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the application of accounting operations of our
	company. This weakness causes us to not fully identify and resolve accounting and disclosure issues that could lead to a failure
	to perform timely internal control and reviews.




	 




	Management is
	currently reviewing its staffing and systems in order to remedy the weaknesses identified in this assessment. However, because
	of the above condition, management’s assessment is that the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting were
	not effective as of March 31, 2017. Additionally, the Registrant’s management has concluded that the Registrant has a material
	weakness associated with its U.S. GAAP expertise.




	 




	This Annual Report
	does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
	financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting
	firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s
	report in this annual report.




	 






	Management's
	Remediation Initiatives






	 




	In an effort to
	remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan
	to initiate, the following series of measures:




	 




	We intend to our
	personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function. First, we intend to create a position to
	segregate duties consistent with control objectives of having separate individuals perform (i) the initiation of transactions,
	(ii) the recording of transactions and (iii) the custody of assets. Second, we intend to create a senior position to focus on
	financial reporting and standardizing and documenting our accounting procedures with the goal of increasing the effectiveness
	of the internal controls in preventing and detecting misstatements of accounting information. Third, we plan to appoint one or
	more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning
	audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures
	such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us. We anticipate the
	costs of implementing these remediation initiatives will be approximately $37,500 to $50,000 a year in increased salaries, legal
	and accounting expenses.




	 




	Management believes
	that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy
	the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which we indicate by words or phrases such as "anticipate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "will," "we believe," "management believes" and similar language. The forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the Company and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those set forth in the discussion under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this report. Actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. We base the forward-looking statements on information currently available to us, and we assume no obligation to update them.  Investors are also advised to refer to the information in our previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), especially on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, in which we discuss in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. As such, investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks and uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions.  Overview  AJ Greentech Holdings Ltd. through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Jih Chih International Ltd. a corporation organized under the laws of Taiwan, The Republic of China is engaged in the business of marketing, manufacturing and distributing of green energy.  From November 2009 until October, 2013, through our China subsidiaries, we were engaged in design, marketing and distributing of alcohol base clean fuel which are designed to use less fossil fuel and have less pollution than traditional fuel.  On October 31, 2013, pursuant to agreements with one of our former directors, we transferred the stock in our China subsidiaries to the former director in exchange for cancellation of debt totaling $240,000. As a result of the transfer of the subsidiaries, we were no longer engaged in the China cleanfuel business. We transferred the stock of the China subsidiaries because we felt that, it not our best interest to continue China cleanfuel business as a result of our decreasing revenue, continued losses and inability to raise capital for our business  On October 31, 2013, Chu Li An acquired, for nominal consideration, 8,000,000 shares of common stock from the director who acquired the subsidiaries and 12,778,399 shares of common stock from The Chairman, who was also a director. On November 1, 2013, Chu Li An and the Company entered into a loan agreement pursuant to which the Chu Li An agreed to lend us $100,000 initially with future loan amount up to $1,000,000, for which we issued our 6% demand promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000. The securities were issued in Chu Li An's name.  On November 18, 2013, we entered into agreement pursuant to which we issued to Chu Li An and her BVI company, our sole director and chief executive officer, 180,000,000 shares of common stock, in consideration of the cancellation of debt due to Chu Li An in the amount of $180,000.  On November 30, 2013, the company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding stock of Jin Chih International, Ltd., a Taiwan corporation, from its sole owner Chu Li An for five million shares of the Company's common stock. As of December 31, 2013, the stock has not been issued.  As a result of the above transactions, we plan to focus on providing greentech products outside of China. Even though the company has disposed China branches, the company's new management will continue to expand the current green energy and technology business in the United States and globally, at the same time to explore many other green and renewable energy such as solar, wind power, sea power by signing licensing agreement or joint venture with other research institutes.  Results of Operations  For the year ended December 31, 2013, we derived our revenues of $640,579 from the sales $480,725 of methanol-based and ethanol based fuels to our customers operated by Chinese subsidiary during the period ended October 31, 2013 and the sales $$159,854 of consulting service, sales of methanol-based and ethanol based fuels to our customers operated by the Taiwan subsidiary, comparing to $3,678,606 from methanol-based and ethanol based fuels sales for the year ended December 31, 2012.  Our gross profit margin during the year ended December 31, 2013 was 6.8%, comparing to 2.2% in last year. This figure represents our business in Chinese subsidiary before spinning off has decreased and the new business from acquisition of Taiwan subsidiary bring us marketing gross profit about 10%.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $523,058, comparing to $16,495,233 for the last fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of provision for doubtful debts, primarily of payroll, local taxes, investor relation expenses and professional fees. In the fiscal year of 2010, the company planned to expend RMB155,339,629 ($24,430,232) to construct an ethanol and methanol manufacturing facility. The part of construction was completed as of December 31,2011, The original cost of the construction was RMB 99,339,629 ($15,623,123). The original cost of land use right was 6,030,400($9,558,920).In the fiscal year of 2012, the construction plan was modified and narrow construction scale. The company decided to sale and reclassify the property and land use right to assets held for sale as of December 31,2012. The impairments of assets held for sale was RMB 157,448,594 ($24,957,771).The net value of assets held for sale was RMB 86,122,320($13,651,574).  Our new business operates primarily in Taiwanese Dollars ("TWD"), but we report our results in our SEC filings in U.S. Dollars. The conversion of our accounts from TWD to Dollars results in translation adjustments. While our net income is added to the retained earnings on our balance sheets; the translation adjustments are added to a line item on our balance sheets labeled "accumulated other comprehensive income," since it is more reflective of changes in the relative values of U.S. and Taiwanese currencies than of the success of our business. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the effect of converting our financial results to U.S. Dollars was to add $3,368 to our accumulated other comprehensive income.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our operations to date have been funded primarily by operations, advance from our majority stockholder, CEO and Chairman and capital contributions.  At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $138,738 and $26,760, respectively. Our cash at December 31, 2013 was increased by $111,978 from December 31, 2012.  Our current assets at December 31, 2013 were $2,177,352, compared to $851,688 at December 31, 2012. This increase mainly reflects increases in accounts receivable and partially offset by decreases in the inventory.  Our current liabilities at December 31, 2013 were $1,958,373, compared to $12,521,721 at December 31, 2012. This decrease mainly reflects a significant decrease of advance from stockholder and chairman and CEO because of the spinning off Chinese subsidiary and partially offset by increase in accounts payable, advance from customers and borrowing as we acquired a new Taiwan subsidiary.  Statements of Cash Flows  Our cash increased $111,978 during 2013, as compared to $8,494 during 2012. In 2013, we used cash the amounts of $7,371 in our operating activities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principle generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  A summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Of these policies, we believe that the following items are the most critical in preparing our financial statements.  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company follows paragraph 310-10-50-9 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current credit worthiness, as determined by the review of their current credit information; and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical write-off experience, customer specific facts and economic conditions.  Outstanding account balances are reviewed individually for collectability. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company's existing accounts receivable. Bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expenses, if any. Pursuant to paragraph 310-10-50-2 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company has adopted paragraph 310-10-50-6 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and determine when receivables are past due or delinquent based on how recently payments have been received.  Inventories  The Company values inventories, consisting of raw materials, packaging material and finished goods, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first-in and first-out ("FIFO") method for raw materials and packaging materials and the weighted average cost method for finished goods. Cost of finished goods comprises direct labor, direct materials, direct production cost and an allocated portion of production overhead. The Company reduces inventories for the diminution of value, resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability, equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value. Factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures,  The Company evaluates its current level of inventories considering historical sales and other factors and, based on this evaluation, classify inventory markdowns in the income statement as a component of cost of goods sold pursuant to Paragraph 420-10-S99 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to adjust inventories to net realizable value. These markdowns are estimates, which could vary significantly from actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer demand or competition differ from expectations. Other significant estimates include the allocation of variable and fixed production overheads. While variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of production on the basis of actual use of production facilities, the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion is based on the normal capacity of the Company's production facilities, and recognizes abnormal idle facility expenses as current period charges. Certain costs, including categories of indirect materials, indirect labor and other indirect manufacturing costs which are included in the overhead pools are estimated. The management of the Company determines its normal capacity based upon the amount of operating hours of the manufacturing machinery and equipment in a reporting period.  Revenue Recognition  The Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv)collectability is reasonably assured.  The Company derives its revenues from sales contracts with customers with revenues being generated upon the shipment of merchandise. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement is demonstrated via sales invoice or contract; product delivery is evidenced by warehouse shipping log as well as a signed acknowledgement of receipt from the customers or a signed bill of lading from the third party trucking company and title transfers upon shipment, based on free on board ("FOB") warehouse terms; the sales price to the customer is fixed upon acceptance of the signed purchase order or contract and there is no separate sales rebate, discount, or volume incentive. When the Company recognizes revenue, no provisions are made for returns because, historically, there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that have impacted the ultimate collection of revenues.  The Company markets and distributes ethanol and methanol based alternative fuel for automobile use and follows Section 605-45-45 (formerly EITF 99-19) ("ASC  Net sales of products represent the invoiced value of goods, net of value added taxes ("VAT"). The Company is subject to VAT which is levied on all of the Company's products at the rate of 17% on the invoiced value of sales. Sales or Output VAT is borne by customers in addition to the invoiced value of sales and Purchase or Input VAT is borne by the Company in addition to the invoiced value of purchases to the extent not refunded for export sales.  Foreign Currency Translation  The Company follows Section 830-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("Section 830-10-45") for foreign currency translation to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiary from the functional currency, generally the local currency, into U.S. Dollars. Section 830-10-45 sets out the guidance relating to how a reporting entity determines the functional currency of a foreign entity (including of a foreign entity in a highly inflationary economy), re-measures the books of record (if necessary), and characterizes transaction gains and losses. the assets, liabilities, and operations of a foreign entity shall be measured using the functional currency of that entity. An entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates; normally, that is the currency of the environment, or local currency, in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash.  The functional currency of each foreign subsidiary is determined based on management's judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary. Generally, the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions, including billings, financing, payroll and other expenditures, would be considered the functional currency, but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary's operations must also be considered. If a subsidiary's functional currency is deemed to be the local currency, then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary's financial statements is included in accumulated other comprehensive income. However, if the functional currency is deemed to be the U.S. Dollar, then any gain or loss associated with the re-measurement of these financial statements from the local currency to the functional currency would be included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss). If the Company disposes of foreign subsidiaries, then any cumulative translation gains or losses would be recorded into the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss). If the Company determines that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the U.S. Dollar, any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within the statement of income and comprehensive income (loss).  Based on an assessment of the factors discussed above, the management of the Company determined the relevant subsidiaries' local currencies to be their respective functional currencies.  The financial records of the Company's Chinese operating subsidiaries are maintained in their local currency, the Renminbi ("RMB"), which is the functional currency. The financial records of the Company's Taiwan operating subsidiaries acquired on November 30, 2013 are maintained in their local currency, the "TWD", which is also the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated from the local currency into the reporting currency, U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the period to approximate translation at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates those elements are recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency translation gain (loss) resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in determining accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity.  Equity Instruments Issued to Parties Other Than Employees for Acquiring Goods or Services  The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under guidance of Sub-topic 505-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("Sub-topic 505-50").  Pursuant to Section 505-50-30, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur.  The fair value of option or warrant award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model. The ranges of assumptions for inputs are as follows:  ? Expected term of share options and similar instruments: Pursuant to Paragraph 718-10-50-2 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the expected term of share options and similar instruments represents the period of time the options and similar instruments are expected to be outstanding taking into consideration of the contractual term of the instruments and holder's expected exercise behavior into the fair value (or calculated value) of the instruments. The Company uses historical data to estimate holder's expected exercise behavior. The contractual term of share options or similar instruments is used as expected term of share options or similar instruments for the Company if it is a newly formed corporation.  ? Expected volatility of the entity's shares and the method used to estimate it. An entity that uses a method that employs different volatilities during the contractual term shall disclose the range of expected volatilities used and the weighted-average expected volatility. A thinly-traded or nonpublic entity that uses the calculated value method shall disclose the reasons why it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the expected volatility of its share price, the appropriate industry sector index that it has selected, the reasons for selecting that particular index, and how it has calculated historical volatility using that index. The Company uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected contractual life of the share options or similar instruments as its expected volatility. If shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.  ? Expected annual rate of quarterly dividends. An entity that uses a method that employs different dividend rates during the contractual term shall disclose the range of expected dividends used and the weighted-average expected dividends. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company's current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the expected contractual life of the option and similar instruments.  ? Risk-free rate(s). An entity that uses a method that employs different risk-free rates shall disclose the range of risk-free rates used. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the contractual life of the option and similar instruments.  Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-25-7, if fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services (no specific performance is required by the grantee to retain those equity instruments), then, because of the elimination of any obligation on the part of the counterparty to earn the equity instruments, a measurement date has been reached. A grantor shall recognize the equity instruments when they are issued (in most cases, when the agreement is entered into). Whether the corresponding cost is an immediate expense or a prepaid asset (or whether the debit should be characterized as contra-equity under the requirements of paragraph 505-50-45-1) depends on the specific facts and circumstances. Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-45-1, a grantor may conclude that an asset (other than a note or a receivable) has been received in return for fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments that are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services (and no specific performance is required by the grantee in order to retain those equity instruments). Such an asset shall not be displayed as contra-equity by the grantor of the equity instruments. The transferability (or lack thereof) of the equity instruments shall not affect the balance sheet display of the asset. This guidance is limited to transactions in which equity instruments are transferred to other than employees in exchange for goods or services. Section 505-50-30 provides guidance on the determination of the measurement date for transactions that are within the scope of this Subtopic.  Pursuant to Paragraphs 505-50-25-8 and 505-50-25-9, an entity may grant fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments that are exercisable by the grantee only after a specified period of time if the terms of the agreement provide for earlier exercisability if the grantee achieves specified performance conditions. Any measured cost of the transaction shall be recognized in the same period(s) and in the same manner as if the entity had paid cash for the goods or services . . .
