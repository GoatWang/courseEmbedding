THRU AXLES FOR BIKE TRAINERS







We are the thru-axle solution experts.






Enter your bike information into our Fitment Selector here:






AttachmentBOB TrailerKid TrailerLightning Bolt-on FrontLightning Bolt-on RearThunder Bolt-onTrainerYoke MountTypeBrandHubModelSubmit







12mm Thru Axles for Trainers
Our 12mm Thru Axles for Trainers adapt your 12mm thru-axle equipped mountain, cross, gravel or road bike to modern bike trainers. No longer do you need a second bike for indoor training or warming up for a race. With our 12 mm Thru Axles for Trainers, you can now train and warm-up on your race bike.
The best part? When it’s time for your race or time to head outside, simply remove the drive side axle end from the Robert Axle. You’ll have a high performance, low profile axle for racing. When you are ready to sit on the trainer again, put the end back on and use your bike on the trainer.





Made to Fit YOUR Bike
The 12mm Thru Axles for Trainers are unique because they are specifically designed to fit on your specific bike using minimal washers and spacers. Unlike trainer thru axles common for fit studios, the Robert Axles are lower profile and can be used on or off the trainer.

Precision designed and machined to fit the specific bike as well or better than the stock axle.
Suitable for use with or without the trainer. Indoors or out.
No special tools required. Easy installation using a standard 5mm hex key found on your multi-tool.
Designed, built and quality tested in Bend, Oregon, USA.

FAQS






GENERAL QUESTIONSDo your axles have a warranty?


Yes. Every new Robert Axle comes with a limited warranty issued to the original owner. Please see our Warranty & Returns page for the full warranty information.


Can you ship to any country?


Yes, we can ship to any country. We also have a list of distributors around the world on our Dealers & Distributors page.


How much does shipping cost?


Shipping rates are shown in the Shopping Cart, once you add your first product. Our shipping rates are flat rate. You can combine your order with friends to save on shipping.


Can you expedite my shipping?


No, we do not offer expedited shipping at this time. If you really need your axle tomorrow, we recommend you call BikeTrailerShop.com at 800-717-2596.


Can I purchase your product locally?


Yes, we certainly want you to support your local bike shop. In the U.S., we work with bike distributor, Quality Bicycle Products (QBP) to get Robert Axles into bike shops. Check with your shop to see if they can order through QBP. In other countries, we work with distributors and dealers. Check our Dealers & Distributors page for more information.


THRU AXLE QUESTIONSHow do I know if my bike has a thru axle?


Pull out the ‘thingy’ that goes in your hub to hold the wheel on.

If it is 12mm in diameter and threads into the frame then it is called a thru-axle. If it 5mm in diameter and goes into a nut that is loose and not attached to the frame, then you have a skewer, quick release skewer or thru-bolt. We only produce solutions for thru-axles. We cannot help you with longer skewers or thru-bolts.
Some bikes have 10mm thru-axles. Sorry, we can’t help you on this one – we only sell 12mm thru-axles.

Need more explanation? Read this handy article about thru-axles on BikeRumor.


How do I know what axle I need?


Use our handy Fitment Selector to find out what axle you need for your brand/model of bike and the attachment that you’ll be using. This also the place to go if our Fitment Selector does not list your bike.


Do you make a solution for a 10mm thru-bolt?


No, we do not make any 10mm thru-bolts. We only produce 12mm thru-axles for the rear and front 15 mm thru axles for attaching Old Man Mountain Cargo Racks 


Do you make a longer quick release for my fat bike?


No, we only produce thru-axles.


Can I convert my bike into a thru axle?


With most bikes you cannot convert to a thru axle because the frame will not allow it. However, Trek’s “Closed Convert Dropouts” are one example of a manufacturer that has designed their frames to be convertible. Check with your bike manufacturer.


Can I buy a Robert Axle from my local bike shop?


Yes, we certainly want you to support your local bike shop. In the U.S., we work with bike distributor, Quality Bicycle Products (QBP) to get Robert Axles into bike shops. Check with your shop to see if they can order through QBP. In other countries, we work with distributors and dealers. Check our Dealer & Distributor page for more information.


Do thru-axles require maintenance?


Before installing the axle, lightly grease the axle and threads. Be sure to check your torque setting before every ride. We recommend that you not use your Robert Axle without a trailer or accessory as the axle does stick out a little more than you stock axle (except for the Bolt-On Axles)


TRAILER QUESTIONSHow much weight can I put in my trailer?


Please read the instructions and warranty of the trailer that you own to know how much weight you can carry.


What is the difference between the BOB Trailer Axle and the Yoke Mount Trailer Axle?


The BOB Trailer Axles are specifically designed for use with a BOB Trailer The BOB Trailer Axles require you to take the stock “bobbins” off of your BOB Trailer skewer or purchase bobbins from us. The Yoke Mount Trailer Axles have M10x1 metric threaded studs on each end to attach an Extrawheel, Surly Bill and Ted trailers or customer trailers.


Can you use a BOB Trailer on singletrack trails?


Yes! One of our favorite past times is rallying on singletrack trails with a BOB Trailer. The trailer tracks surprisingly well on singletrack. Give it a try.


Do you make an axle for my trailer?


We produce solutions for all the most common wheel-mounted trailers. Most commonly people are looking for a child/kid/cargo trailer solution, we call those Hitch-Mounted Trailers because they attach with a hitch provided by the trailer manufacturer.


How do I fit my BOB Trailer on to my wide mountain bike or fat bike?


Yes, you can fit your BOB Trailer on to a wider bike, such as a Boost 148 mountain bike, plus tire bike or a fat bike. Watch our YouTube video here for instructions on how to do this.

5 Uncommon Tips and Tricks for a Most Excellent Weekend Bike Tour

Posted on April 4, 2017 by Katy Bryce 


Planning a mini-bike tour is a little like planning dinner – you want it to be great, but you also don’t want to stress out and worry too much about it. Often times, like a good meal, you can pull something together in a fairly short amount of time, with little effort. And like anything, with practice comes perfection, or darn near close. We’re sharing a few things that we’ve learned from our own experiences as well as from others getting after it.
Go Light: But Not Too Light
In our opinion, going light is good. Going so light that you are cold and starving is not so good. Seriously, do you want to eat energy bars for three days—breakfast, lunch and dinner—because you don’t want to bring a camp stove? If that’s your bag, then go for it, but consider bringing real food, real camp gear and real clothes. My weakness – UGG Boots. They’re lightweight and ultra-warm and perfect for dry, cold high desert nights in the backcountry when I’m sitting around camp.
Speaking of Food
Appetizers! Buy some and take them with you so when you get to camp or wherever you are laying your head to rest for the night, you’ve got a quick snack as soon as you stop. It also gives you a little sense of closure on the day. Our favorite appies include Sabritas Sal y Limon peanuts for the salt-lover (found at Mexican markets), peanut butter filled pretzels for the sweet AND salt lover (a.k.a. crack-in-a-bag) or beef jerky for the protein junky.
Be Flexible
So you have the most kick-ass route planned, but maybe you get out there an realize that: a) this is harder than I thought b) the weather forecast said “chance of showers”, not “deluge” or c) I’m just feeling a little more lazy than I hoped to feel. Create your route so you have Plan A and Plan B. If you don’t make Plan A to that sweet camp spot next to the free hot springs and taco stand, then maybe settle for Plan B, that sweet camp spot next to the little creek that you’ve always wanted to check out.
Take Your Kid(s)
No, really. What better thing to do with your kids than take them on an easy, close to home, mini-adventure on bikes? It can be done, you’ll just need to plan a little more and probably pack a little (or a lot) more. Maybe you don’t camp, but you stay in a cabin, B&B or even stay at your brother’s house in the next town over. The point is, bike touring with your kids can create lasting memories and inspire more adventures.
Take Your Dog
Don’t have the human variety of kids, but instead have the fur baby? We’re dog lovers, so we think life is pretty awesome with a dog. And our dog wants NOTHING more than to run around in the woods looking for sticks or swimming in a lake. There are several good blogs about bike touring with your pup, but our favorite is Long Haul Trekkers. Check them out!
Do you have any amazing or quirky tips for bike touring? We’d love to hear about it. Leave a comment below to share!








 


Take Your Toddler on a Bike Tour

Posted on March 28, 2017 by Katy Bryce 


You’re a cyclist. You love your Wednesday evening rides with the buddies and you geek out on gear and maybe you’ve gone on a few bike tours in your lifetime. You’re also a Mom or a Dad, so you want to infect your kids with the joy of cycling that has made your life that much more wonderful.
The great thing is that it IS possible to take your toddler on a bike tour. It just takes a little planning and flexibility. Using a child specific trailer such as a Thule Chariot, Burley Bee or a Croozer allows you to bring your kiddo with you on the microadventure of your choice. We’ve pulled together 8 tips to successfully take your toddler with you on a bike touring adventure.

Start Small. If you are a seasoned bike tourist, but new to bike touring with a kid, cut yourself some slack and start off with an easy trip. You just aren’t going to get in a 50 mile day—think more like 15 miles. You can even start by taking your child in the trailer and having a friend or spouse drive to the camp spot with the gear. This allows you to have a fun ride while not having to worry as much about the gear. Check out Adventure Cycling’s Bike Overnights or Alastair Humphrey’s Microadventures website for inspiration.
Go light. This is a tricky one, especially when you think you might “need” everything. Just bring the basics—camping and cooking gear, safety items and only the clothing that you’ll need. For multi-day tours, plan your route to hit civilization as much as possible so you can do laundry and resupply whenever possible.
Choose quiet routes. Your lunchtime road biking hammerfest might not be the optimal route. Look for a route that includes bike paths or quiet country roads. And don’t forget that gravel and dirt roads provide some of the best scenery and solitude. Just watch for rough tread or heavily washboarded roads—remember you have a passenger behind you!
It’s the journey, not the destination. What we mean is—take breaks! Time off the bike is just as important as time on the bike. Kids can’t sit for hours on end, so try to take a break every 15 minutes, half hour or every hour, depending on how long your day will be. Go so far as to set your phone or watch on a timer so you make sure you stick to the plan.
Transform the trailer into a home. If you rode in a little cocoon, wouldn’t you want to personalize it and make it into a cozy spot? For little ones, be sure to include their favorite stuffed animal or an extra pillow they can cozy up to. For older kids, add some coloring books and crayons. One cyclist I talked to used a mini-speaker and iPod to provide fun music for the ride.
Stop and smell the roses—and the cows. Does your kid get excited to see a roadside cow or a red tailed hawk soaring high in the sky? Then pull those brakes, pull over and stop to check it out. Take this opportunity to bond with your kid, give an impromptu science lesson or just enjoy the wonders of the natural world.
Snacks, snacks and snacks. Grab the gummies, juices and other favorite foods for your kiddo and be sure to stop often to snack. You’ll teach your mini-me about how to keep fueled while on a bike ride. And it’s a good excuse to stop and take a break and avoid any low blood sugar meltdowns. They happen to the best of us.
Remember why YOU ride a bike. There’s a good chance it’s because it is FUN. So make sure that your mini-adventure is fun for you and your traveling companion. The more fun it is for your kids, the more they will want to go and continue cycling as they get older.

Bring Your Kids Biking with a Robert Axle Thru Axle

Posted on March 28, 2017March 28, 2017 by Katy Bryce 


The Kid Trailer Axles are easy to install and use, so you can bring your kids biking with you. Child carriers, such as Burley, Thule, Chariot, provide a great way to share your adventures with those you love. With our 12mm Thru Axles for Kid Trailers, you can attach “hitch style” trailer to any bike with a rear 12mm thru axle—mountain, road, fat, cross, e-bike and everything in between.
Our Kid Trailer Axles are designed for maximum strength and ease of use in attaching your trailer. The Robert Axle has a stainless steel 10x1mm threaded stud to attach the hitch supplied by your trailer manufacturer.










 


Breaking Axles Is Fun! (Also known as: Why “made in USA” matters to us)

Posted on March 18, 2017March 28, 2017 by Katy Bryce 


Sure, there’s lots of talk (babble?) about “Made in USA”. It’s a complicated thing, we know. Affordability, quality, customer service, and practicality all come into play. Making our thru axles here, instead of China or Taiwan, is important to us because we can employ local skilled people and support our local economy.
We also like to be hands on—we prefer to oversee production on an almost daily basis, which we think is the real value in creating quality bike parts. From raw material, to finished and packaged goods, we handle all processes.
It’s a job we take seriously. Stuff needs to not break, and stuff on your bike needs to REALLY not break, especially when you are using it. Breaking parts on a bike ride, whether you’re out shredding singletrack, or taking your kids to the park, is not what we would call a good time.
We machine and assemble all our thru axles in Bend, Oregon. And with access to testing facilities, we are able to test our axles for different types of strength and loads. We test all of our thru axles in two ways:
Torque strength. Over the years, we have been keeping tabs on how our customers are installing their Robert Axles. Installation requires the user to torque the axle to a specific spec, so we test all axles for torque strength to make sure they are strong enough during installation.
Shear strength. This is the stuff that goes BOOM, the fun part. By testing shear strength, we test for catastrophic failure, and we ask: How much force would it take to suddenly shear this axle? Our goal, which we consistently reach, is to far exceed the shear strength of stock axles that come with bikes.
Watch the video below of how we break axles!










 


2017 CABDA Expo Recap

Posted on February 8, 2017March 3, 2017 by Katy Bryce 


Thru axles, hot dogs and a friendly trade show atmosphere.
Last week, we spent a few days in St. Charles, Illinois (about 30 miles west of Chicago) at the 2017 CABDA Expo. We’ll be honest here. Trade shows are a mixed bag. They can be fun and interesting, but also tiring and frustrating. But the CABDA Expo was surprisingly different.
Let the record show – the 2017 CABDA Expo was a breath of fresh air and we can’t wait to go back next year.
Now, we don’t say this about every trade show, trust me. But the CABDA Expo really was one of the better shows that we have attended. And by the way, CABDA stands for the Chicagoland Area Bicycle Dealers Association. We like that – “Chicagoland” – like its an amusement park.
Unlike most of the other prominent bicycle industry trade shows, such as Sea Otter, Interbike and Eurobike, CABDA occurs at a time of year when suppliers and dealers can actually get away from their business or shop to attend the show. It’s pretty tough to get away in April, August and September. But in the case of CABDA, dealers from all over the Midwest can actually close their shop doors for two days to attend the show. And as a small supplier, it is definitely easier for us to step away from business for a handful of days in February rather than in the middle of summer.
The dealers that we talked to at our booth were very engaged and very interested in learning about this year’s products. That might have had to do with our display, which involved hot dogs. You see, we needed a clever way to display thru-axles and it turns out that a mini-mart style hot dog roller was just the ticket. We could display our axles and give away free, Chicago Style Hot Dogs to attendees. While we take our products very seriously, we try to not take ourselves too seriously.
In all seriousness, it was wonderful to talk one-on-one with Midwest dealers about all of our products, from our standard Kid Trailer Thru-Axles that allow attachment of trailers to our new Lightning Bolt-On replacement axles. We also garnered a ton of interest in our Trainer Axles. It’s a long cold winter in the Midwest and indoor trainers are one way to keep cyclists from going totally insane!
We’re back at it here at the shop, making axles and fulfilling orders, and some of us are craving a slice of Chicago style deep-dish pizza, but we’ll need to wait until next year when we return. A huge shout out to the CABDA folks, the attendees and the exhibitors for making it a wonderful two-day event!
Katy, Chris and Hunter show off some axles and hot dogs.
Chris talks to a crowd of enthusiastic bike shop owners.
Thank you CABDA and we’ll see you next year!

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1917 edition. Volume: 74 Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book.

This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book.

Robert points out the usefulness of the IPad video feature in analyzing Axel jump form in this 3 min and 33 second video lesson. We begin by watching a recording of a demonstrator performing a double axel. 
Robert points out the nice, straight, upright body line of the demonstrator prior to takeoff. He asks us to take notice of the nice steady “V” shape the arms make when the wrists touch at the side just prior to take-off. The hands release only when the back (free) foot leaves the ice. His left shoulder is nicely in front and his body weight is directly over the skating leg.
The free leg is bent nicely so that his foot is tucked up behind, almost touching his buttock. Robert points out that when the demonstrator begins to bring his free leg forward and through, he has a tendency to straighten it slightly more than is desirable, likely a result of years of soccer playing. However, as the free leg lifts up and off the ice the demonstrator manages to regain the proper bend. He lifts up onto the toe of the skating leg and demonstrates a wonderful leg stretch. 
As the demonstrator begins the rotation, the free leg tracks back down the skating leg into the proper air position
Robert then shows an exercise that will help skaters learn the correct take-off techniques when attempting a double Axel. He asks skaters to proceed slowly and to make the entry is simple as possible. He suggests his skaters begin on two feet before bringing the arms and head through, and before picking up the foot and forming the letter “V” with the arms. The step should resemble a Bauer and should be practiced until the entry step is stable and solid.

Axel Robert of Ubisoft talks about the importance of automating prepress
Published on August 6, 2012
Axel Robert with Ubisoft talks about the company and the need to automate their prepress operation.  Ubisoft, a maker of many video game titles such as the popular Assassin's Creed, has a distributed manufacturing and printing operation and the need for automation and consistency is critical.










Cary Sherburne: Hi, I’m Cary Sherburne, Senior Editor at WhatTheyThink. And I’m here with Axel Robert, who is in Prepress with Ubisoft in France.
Axel Robert: In France, yes.
Cary Sherburne: Welcome, yes.
Axel Robert: Thank you.
Cary Sherburne: So we’ll notice a little bit of an accent.
Axel Robert: Okay, that's fine. No problem.
Cary Sherburne: Why don’t you start, Axel, by telling us a little bit about the business, about the company. How long you’ve been in business, how many employees you have, what kind of things that you do.
Axel Robert: Yeah, of course. Ubisoft is one of the most leading in the world. I currently, we are about 10,000 people works every day.
Cary Sherburne: Wow.
Axel Robert: For Ubisoft. But in fact, I’m the only one to do prepress currently. So you can say the gap between the people. So it was obviously for me to find a good solution, a good software solution to do all this kind of work.
Cary Sherburne: So automating things.
Axel Robert: To automate.
Cary Sherburne: So what does Ubisoft do? I mean, what do they do?
Axel Robert: Ubisoft is currently made video games all around the world. With a big, big fantasy titles like Assassins Creed or Rayman, the little guy who has hands and no arms , Far Cry 2, Animal, and a lot of games.
Cary Sherburne: But not...
Axel Robert: Nintendo DS for Nintendo DS.
Cary Sherburne: But no Angry Birds.
Axel Robert: No, unfortunately.
Cary Sherburne: So in your role is prepress then, you’re working with all of the documentation, the packaging, and everything that goes with those games when they go into the marketplace?
Axel Robert: Yes, exactly. I have work, I am in charge of all the printed material. So I need to check what the external critera ad agencies are made for us, and I am also responsible for all the printed material for our manufacturer and printer too. And we run all around the world., and not only in EMEA but also in USA, especially in Canada. The French part, Montreal. And Shanghai too.
Cary Sherburne: So it sounds like you’re a very busy person.
Axel Robert: Yeah, yeah.
Cary Sherburne: Yeah, and so I understand that you have used some of the EnFocus products including PitStop Connect, PitStop Server, and Switch to help automate some of the processes. So why don’t you tell us kind of how that’s changed the way that you’ve been able to work.
Axel Robert: Yes, in the beginning I started to work with PDF in 1999. Firstly it was Sony when our manufacturer, and very quickly we had a lot of problem with PDF. Wide kind of PDF problem made from new from which one exposition. It was very, very real and very difficult to have a good PDF . We always cross finger and waiting for printers. So I decided to find a better solution, than a human solution. I love human, but in production every day it was too difficult to solve all the problem when we encounter with kind of PDF . Because the graphic team, they always often always mess up these kind of technical parts.
Cary Sherburne: Fonts or the images are wrong, whatever.
Axel Robert: Yeah, fonts, information, good ICC profile. It’s another world for them.
Cary Sherburne: So thank you very much for sharing that with us today, and we’ll talk a little bit more later in more detail about what you’re doing.
