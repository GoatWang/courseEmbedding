Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Key Developments

Threshold Pharmaceuticals Announces First Patient Dosed in Immunotherapy Clinical Trial of Evofosfamide and Ipilimumab
Jun 13 17
Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has dosed the first patient in a Phase 1 immunotherapy clinical trial investigating ipilimumab and evofosfamide for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer, melanoma or human papillomavirus (HPV) negative squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck for which standard therapy does not offer the potential for increased survival. Evofosfamide (also known as TH-302) is Threshold's proprietary, hypoxia-activated prodrug of a bis-alkylating agent that is preferentially activated under severe hypoxic tumor conditions, a feature of many solid tumors. In preclinical research conducted by Michael Curran, Ph.D., Assistant Professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, evofosfamide has sensitized highly resistant solid tumor models to treatment with certain immune checkpoint inhibitors through evofosfamide-driven disruption of hypoxic zones. Specifically, hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment forms a barrier to T cell infiltration and fosters immunotherapy resistance in prostate cancer and other solid tumors. The Phase 1 clinical trial is a single-arm, open label study that will enroll up to 69 patients with metastatic or locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer, melanoma or HPV-negative squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck. Eligible patients will receive evofosfamide on Days one and eight of the first two cycles and ipilimumab on Day eight of a 28-day cycle. Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (irRECIST) response rate is the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. The study is open at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. More details can be found here.

NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 10, 2017 / Cara Therapeutics saw its shares close down nearly 10% on Friday after its phase 2b trial for its new investigational pain relief drug CR845 failed to meet its primary endpoint. Shares of Threshold Pharmaceuticals, on the other hand, saw a huge gaining day despite no remarkable news. The company announced last month that the first patient in its Phase 1 immunotherapy clinical trial that's investigating ipilimumab and evofosfamide has been dosed.

Cara Therapeutics, Inc.'s shares sank into the red on Friday, closing down 9.56%. The biotech company saw its shares collapse last week when it reported that its phase 2b trial of CR845, the company's investigational new pain relief drug for patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, didn't meet its primary endpoint. The stock started dropping from $26 a share. Shares closed on Friday at $13.62. Cara reported that all the patients who received 5 mg dose of CR845 for 8 weeks had experienced a 35% reduction in pain, but unfortunately, statistical data revealed that there is a staggering 89% chance that this reduction was because of randomness and not because the drug was effective. The FDA requires that drugs have a 95% proven effective rate so Cara's drug does not support any FDA approval. Another trial will be necessary if the company wants to bring CR845 to market.

Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was one of the biggest winners on the NASDAQ this past Friday closing up 21.62% on tremendous volume. There was no significant news from the company to explain the move. Earlier in June, the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company announced that the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has dosed the first patient in a Phase 1 immunotherapy clinical trial investigating ipilimumab and evofosfamide for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer, melanoma or human papillomavirus (HPV) negative squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck for which standard therapy does not offer the potential for increased survival. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody developed to induce the immune system by targeting a CTLA-4 protein receptor that downregulates the system. Evofosfamide is a prodrug that is designed to be activated under hypoxic conditions commonly found in the tumor microenvironment.
The Phase 1 clinical trial will enroll up to 69 patients and is a single-arm, open label study. Chief Medical Officer of Threshold Pharmaceuticals Tillman Pearce M.D., commented, "We believe that adding evofosfamide to certain immunotherapies has the potential to render some of the most therapeutically resistant cancers more sensitive to the immunotherapy and we are excited to have dosed the first patient in this study." Shares of THLD are up 10% over the last 6 months.

Item 8.01 Other Events.




As previously disclosed, on June 20, 2017, Victor Pariso ("Plaintiff"), a
purported stockholder of Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Threshold"), filed a
putative class action complaint against Threshold and members of its Board of
Directors (the "Board") in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California (the "Court"). This case is captioned Pariso v. Threshold
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:17-cv-03557-WHA (the "Action"). The
complaint alleges that (1) Threshold and the members of the Board violated
Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, by filing a Registration Statement
on Form S-4 (File No. 333-217993), including a prospectus/proxy
statement/information statement therein (the "Form S-4"), which allegedly fails
to disclose and/or misrepresents material information about Threshold's proposed
merger with Molecular Templates, Inc., and (2) the members of the Board, as
control persons of Threshold, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in
connection with the filing of the allegedly materially deficient
prospectus/proxy statement/information statement. On June 27, 2017, Threshold
filed an amendment to the Form S-4 with the SEC containing certain supplemental
disclosures (the "Supplemental Disclosures"). After the SEC declared the Form
S-4 effective on June 30, 2017, Threshold filed with the SEC a final
prospectus/proxy statement/information statement also containing the
Supplemental Disclosures pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
On July 7, 2017, Plaintiff filed a stipulation to voluntarily dismiss the Action
with prejudice as to himself because he believes the Supplemental Disclosures
mooted the claims set forth in the complaint. In voluntarily dismissing the
Action, Plaintiff asked the Court to retain jurisdiction for the sole purpose of
determining any potential application for an award of attorneys' fees and
expenses.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

					Full Description



Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Threshold), incorporated on October 17, 2001, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The Company is engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic and diagnostic agents that selectively target tumor cells for the treatment of patients living with cancer. The Company is developing two therapeutic product candidates based on hypoxia-activated prodrug technology: evofosfamide and tarloxotinib.Evofosfamide Investigational Hypoxia-Activated ProdrugEvofosfamide is designed as a prodrug that is activated under the extreme hypoxic conditions commonly found in tumors, but not in healthy tissues. The development plan for evofosfamide is focused on analyzing the MAESTRO data for the purposes of pursuing potential registration pathways in pancreatic cancer with regulatory authorities and potential partners. In addition, the Company is developing evofosfamide in combination with antiangiogenics in investigator sponsored clinical trials as supported by preclinical and clinical data. Based on preclinical studies, evofosfamide has been or is under investigation in combination with antiangiogenic therapies in a range of tumor types in human clinical trials, including TH-CR-410, a Threshold-sponsored Phase I trial that evaluated the safety of evofosfamide in combination with sunitinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET); EMR 200592-012, a Phase II Investigator Sponsored Trial to assess the activity and safety of evofosfamide in combination with sunitinib in patients with well- and moderately-differentiated metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) that are naive to systemic treatment; TH-IST-4003, a Phase I/II Investigator Sponsored Trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of evofosfamide in combination with bevacizumab in patients with recurrent glioblastoma following bevacizumab failure; TH-IST-4008, a Phase II Investigator Sponsored Trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of evofosfamide in combination with bevacizumab in patients with recurrent glioblastoma following bevacizumab failure; TH-IST-4001, a Phase I Investigator Sponsored Trial evaluating the safety of evofosfamide in combination with pazopanib in patients with advanced solid tumors, and TH-IST-4004, a Phase I/II Investigator Sponsored Trial of evofosfamide in combination with sorafenib in patients with advanced kidney cancer or liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.Tarloxotinib Investigational Hypoxia-Activated EGFR Tyrosine Kinase InhibitorTarloxotinib is a prodrug designed to selectively release a covalent (irreversible) EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), under severe hypoxia, a feature of many solid tumors. Tarloxotinib is under investigation in two Phase II proof-of-concept trials: one for the treatment of patients with mutant EGFR-positive, T790M-negative advanced NSCLC progressing on an EGFR TKI, and the other for patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.18F]-HX4 Investigational PET Imaging Agent for Hypoxia18F]-HX4 is an investigational Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging agent for hypoxia to identify and quantify the degree of hypoxia in tumors in vivo. [18F]-HX4 contains a short-lived radioisotope, 18F, which can be detected in a PET scanner. [18F]-HX4 is being used in both Phase II trials of tarloxotinib.The Company competes with Eli Lilly and Company, Roche/Genentech, Astellas Oncology, Celgene, AstraZeneca, Clovis Oncology, Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim and Merck.

                Threshold Pharma, Molecular Templates to Merge (THLD)            


    By Shobhit Seth | March 17, 2017 — 2:18 PM EDT    






Share





















































Nasdaq-listed Threshold Pharmaceuticals Inc. (THLD) agreed to merge with privately-held cancer-focused biopharmaceutical company Molecular Templates Inc. in an all-stock deal. The resulting combined company will be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and will focus on developing cancer drugs.
Under the all-stock deal, Molecular Templates will merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of Threshold Pharmaceuticals. Post merger, the current shareholders of Molecular Templates will own around 65.6% of the newly formed combined entity, while the remaining 34.4% will be owned by the current shareholders of Threshold Pharma. Threshold Pharmaceuticals will be renamed Molecular Templates and will trade under the symbol MTEM.
Product Portfolio of Merged Entity
The combined entity will have two clinical-stage candidates, which includes Molecular Templates’ lead product MT-3724, and Threshold’s evofosfamide (formerly TH-302).
MT-3724 has reported positive results in early-stages trial for treating relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. A Phase 1 combination trial of evofosfamide, clubbed with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY) Yervoy (ipilumumab), is expected to commence shortly.
Molecular Templates also has a few pre-clinical programs, which include drug candidates like MT-4019 for multiple myeloma, MT-5111 for breast cancer, MT-5050 for melanoma, and MT-6868 for SCT indication. Threshold Pharma has a pre-clinical candidate, TH-3424, which is being investigated for acute lymphocytic leukemia, liver and prostate cancers.
In September 2016, Threshold was forced to discontinue development of its then-promising cancer drug, tarloxotinib, which failed in Phase 2 studies for certain indications of non-small-cell lung cancer and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. However, it met the endpoints for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. The decision led to the departure of COO Stewart M. Kroll, along with one-quarter of the company’s workforce. (See also, COO of Threshold Pharmaceuticals to Resign.)
The merger deal has secured approval from the boards of directors of both companies, and is expected to close during the second quarter of this year. The closure will be subject to shareholder approval of each company, along with other customary conditions.
Threshold Pharma stock spiked 75% early Friday on the news, and is currently trading at 70 cents a share.

Friday’s Market Insights: Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (THLD), Innocoll Holdings PLC (INNL), xG Technology Inc (XGTI)

 S.A. Team-March 17, 2017, 1:14 PM EDT

SHARE ON:





 


 




Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:THLD) shares are rising 19% in Friday’s trading session, after the drug maker announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement under which Molecular Templates will merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of Threshold in an all-stock transaction. The transaction will result in a combined company focused on the development of novel treatments for cancer. Longitude Capital, a U.S. based venture capital firm, will invest $20 million at the close of the transaction, subject to certain conditions, including the receipt of additional equity financing commitments of $20 million.
“The merger of our two companies provides Threshold shareholders with a significant equity stake in a biopharmaceutical company with a promising cancer therapy, MT-3724, as well as an innovative and unique technology platform that has generated preclinical drug candidates to treat multiple myeloma, breast cancer and melanoma,” said Barry Selick, Ph.D. and Chief Executive Officer of Threshold. “Following an extensive and thorough review of strategic alternatives, we believe this transaction combines promising drug candidates, a solid management team and the resources to create significant value for shareholders and important new cancer therapies for patients.”
William Blair analyst John Sonnier recently noted, “We believe Threshold remains undervalued given the potential of its selective tumor targeting technology platform. With a potential partnership collaboration and regulatory path for evofosfamide, we believe in the opportunity for significant shareholder value creation.” The analyst rates THLD stock an Outperform, without providing a price target.
According to TipRanks, which measures analysts’ and bloggers’ success rate based on how their calls perform, analyst John Sonnier has a yearly average return of 18.4% and a 54% success rate. Sonnier has a 4.9% average return when recommending THLD, and is ranked #392 out of 4558 analysts.

Innocoll Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:INNL) shares tumbled over 25% to $1.37 Friday, after the company indicated that it has participated in a Type A meeting with the FDA regarding the re-submission for Xaracoll, the company’s product candidate for the treatment of postsurgical pain. Specifically, Innocoll disclosed that it has proposed conducting an additional PK study and several short-term non-clinical studies, which would delay the resubmission of its NDA.
As a reminder, in late December, Innocoll announced it received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA for Xaracoll NDA. In the letter, the FDA stated that Xaracoll should be characterized as a drug/device combination, which would require Innocoll to submit additional information to the FDA.
In reaction, Stifel analyst Annabel Samimy downgraded INNL stock from Buy to Hold, while slashing the price target to $2.00 (from $9.00). The analyst noted, “Despite this proposed path forward, in light of its 4Q16 cash of $15.8mn, INNL does not have sufficient runway to complete these regulatory requirements. As a result, the company is in discussions that may or may not lead to a firm offer for the company. At this point, we believe INNL needs to find strategic alternatives, but we cannot be certain of its consummation.”
As of this writing, all the 4 analysts polled by TipRanks (in the past 3 months) rate Innocoll stock a Hold. With a return  potential of 59%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $2.00.

xG Technology Inc (NASDAQ:XGTI) saw its shares rising over 10% today, after announcing that it has reached an agreement with Pebble Beach Systems (“the Seller” and formerly known as Vislink) for extinguishing the remaining deferred debt from the acquisition of Vislink. All deferred payments due from xG against the original promissory notes covering the acquisition of Vislink are now settled in full, and all liens are released. The agreement included cash and sharing the proceeds from a customer receivable, among other considerations.
George Schmitt, Executive Chairman and CEO of xG Technology, said, “We are pleased to announce the final settlement of all debt arising from the acquisition of Vislink. We have done this without adding any additional debt to our balance sheet, leaving us in an even better position than we expected when we originally made the acquisition. We want to thank the team at MB Technology Holdings for spearheading the negotiations involved in the acquisition on xG’s behalf, especially in reaching this most recent agreement with the seller. Their ability to bring these very difficult and time-consuming negotiations to a successful conclusion is the key reason we have been able to increase our revenue base almost tenfold.”
Roth Capital’s William Gibson recently said, “We believe the acquisitions of Integrated Microwave Technologies and Vislink Communications Systems position the company to generate cash and turn GAAP profitable in the second half this year and beyond […] In our opinion, xG Technology’s valuation reflects investor concerns about its history of losses; accumulated losses total $201 million through 3Q16 and at year-end 2015, its auditors, Marcum LP, questioned the company’s ability to continue operating as a going concern. With the added revenue and the likelihood of turning cash flow positive, we believe execution is paramount.”

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
