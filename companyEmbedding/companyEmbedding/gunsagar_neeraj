    Chip Perry, President and Chief Executive Officer


Chip Perry


	Chip Perry is president and chief executive officer of TrueCar, Inc. In his role, Perry is responsible for TrueCar's strategic direction, product vision and operations in the company’s Santa Monica headquarters and San Francisco and Austin, Texas, offices.

	 

	Perry also manages TrueCar’s relationships with key external stakeholders, including dealers, dealer associations, automakers, consumers, regulators, affinity partners and investors.

	 

	Perry joined TrueCar after serving as president and CEO of RentPath LLC, parent company of ApartmentGuide.com and Rent.com.

	 

	Previously, Perry led AutoTrader.com in 1997, serving as its CEO from the company’s inception until 2013. While there he guided AutoTrader’s evolution from a one-person startup into the world’s largest online automotive marketplace, with $1.5 billion in annual revenue, 20,000 dealer customers, 16 million monthly unique visitors and 3,500 employees. Under his guidance, AutoTrader.com also created an array of transformative digital solutions that have helped thousands of dealers expand their presence online.

	 

	Prior to starting AutoTrader.com, Chip was a vice president of new business development at the Los Angeles Times.
