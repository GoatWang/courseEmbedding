The next time you get a cup of coffee from Starbucks, a bucket of chicken from KFC or buy a new perfume packaged in a small carton — look at the bottom.
There is a good chance Memphis-based International Paper (IP)’s consumer packaging group produced that cup, bucket and carton.

                Consumer Packaging at International Paper is broken into two segments, coated paperboard… more 






 


To see a few examples, click the slideshow.
To better understand the scope of IP’s work and its products, a recent Memphis Business Journal series highlights each IP segment: industrial packaging, global cellulose fibers, papers and consumer packaging.
Click here to read the first in the series: An inside look at IP’s papers segment with W. Michael Amick Jr., senior vice president, Paper the America for International Paper. Or click here to read part two: An inside look at IP’s industrial packaging with Tim S. Nicholls, senior vice president, Industrial Packaging for International Paper.
For this edition, it is all about the consumer.
Catherine I. Slater, senior vice president, Consumer Packaging for International Paper, oversees IP's consumer packaging group of roughly 4,000 employees, who are broken into two divisions: coated paperboard and foodservice.
Coated paperboard is used in various applications for items such as packaged food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and alcohol and tobacco. The foodservice segment produces paper cups, food containers, plates, trays, bowls and more.
“What I see as the opportunity is the dynamics of the consumer continuing to change,” Slater said. “Since this is one place ... where we actually have more touch to the consumers, you have to be really aware then of what is going on with delivery of food, and how is that going to change what restaurants serve or how they serve or not. With a continued increase of people buying stuff online, how do we make sure that we are able to go to that channel and support the brand owners with their packaging? All of these are just really big changes from what has historically been the dynamics of consumer packaging.”

McDonald’s, Starbucks, YUM! Brands, Hilton and Kroger are a few of IP’s customers.




And, if you are curious when production starts to meet Starbuck’s fall/holiday cup demand the answer is now.
“You have to start early,” Slater said. “For Starbucks’ holiday things, you start making those right now for the fall. ... If it is really cold — like there are some parts of the country having more cold than normal — that will be good for the hot cup.”
IP produces about 1.6 million tons of coated paperboard annually — 1.2 million tons in North America, which accounts for a roughly 22 percent supply position, and 370,000 tons in Europe and Russia. Foodservice makes 23 billion units of cups, lids, containers and plates every year.
Roughly 20 percent of what coated paperboard produces goes to foodservice for use. The remaining 80 percent is sold on the open market to companies for similar applications.
The consumer packaging segment accounts for $2 billion of IP’s total revenue, or 9 percent.
While the consumer packaging division had a challenging first quarter in 2017, going from operating profits of $41 million in Q4 2016 to $33 million in Q1 2017 — primarily due to mills being closed for maintenance — trends such as the foam-to-paper conversion in the cup and food container segments are helping to drive industry growth.
Slater said you cannot be in business for more than 100 years like IP has and use trees if you are not thinking about sustainability.
“There are a lot of things around recycle and sustainability,” Slater said. “I think the message about what really is sustainable in the U.S. depends on what part of the country you are in, because some parts of the country are banning plastic — which is actually a positive for us — and then other parts of the country, they don’t recycle at all. … We have to have sustainable things to have the right to do business long-term, and I think we have a good message.”
In North America, there are two coated paperboard mills: one in Texarkana, Texas, and one in Augusta, Georgia, as well as an extrusion facility in Prosperity, South Carolina. An extruder is what gives a material its coating.
The three foodservice plants are in Shelbyville, Illinois; Kenton, Ohio; and Visalia, California. The foodservice plants outside North America are in Colombia, the United Kingdom and China.




 


But, consumer packaging’s work does not stop at the mills and plants.
The group also has a graphic design group strategically located in Clemson, South Carolina, to be near Clemson University and the school’s Sonoco Institute of Packaging Design and Graphics.
“They are extremely creative — a really fun group — and Clemson actually is one of the few schools that teaches people how to do this kind of graphic design, so we have sort of a hub right there,” Slater said. “If a customer wants to have a certain design of something on a cup, then they can take the design from a piece of paper and get it so you can actually put it on a round surface. A flat thing trying to make it into a cup won’t look like what you think it does without some extra effort.”
Consumer packaging also has a technical center in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. IP’s consumer packaging product development center, which was previously in Loveland, Ohio, recently consolidated to the Wisconsin facility.
At the technical center — which Slater described as an innovation research center — employees not only work to make cup machines faster and safer, but scientists work to test different types of resins for lids. New cup designs are also put through the “hold test,” which is essentially how long can a cup be held that contains a hot liquid.
“Those parts to me are the parts that are unique to IP — that we have innovation in this space — that it is not just make the products,” Slater said.
And when it comes to industry challenges, Slater said that is where opportunity lies.
“There is always going to be packaging. People are going to drink coffee out of cups,” Slater said. “Certain customers only want plain iconic cups; other people really want fancy, designed, new things. ... We are going to have to be more flexible to listen to what the customer wants, and then be able to make a change for them quickly. I would say that is a challenge but also an opportunity.”
