Baldwin Parts









Baldwin Hardware Manufacturing FactsBaldwin's superior quality is derived from a fusion of quality materials and expert craftsmanship. See below for facts about the materials and process followed to manufacture a single piece of Baldwin hardware. 100,000 lbs of brass is received at the Baldwin manufacturing facility from local foundries per weekBrass billets are heated to 1300 degrees before forging.200 tons of force forms brass billets into Baldwin hardware.30 people will work on a single Baldwin piece on average.All heavy gauge steel lock mechanisms are coated with a rust resistant compound.





Baldwin CollectionsBaldwin hardware is separated into three main collections. Each Baldwin collection is designed and built to meet specific customer needs. Below is a quick preview of the collections, so you can choose the best Baldwin product for your home.

Baldwin Brass ManufacturingBaldwin uses brass for its door hardware due to its durability, strength, and appearance. You only need to hold a solid brass Baldwin product to feel the quality and durability. Brass is heavier, stronger, and provides smoother operation compared to steel or aluminum door hardware. Baldwin is forged, not cast, so it is denser and heavier. Solid brass arrives at the Baldwin manufacturing facility in bars where it is super heated and forged by expert craftsman into its final shape. It is then trimmed and polished with extreme detail. Resulting in a very high quality piece of hardware. Baldwin is committed to providing quality door hardware, thus brass will be their material for as long as they are around.








Baldwin Luxurious FinishesBaldwin hardwares product line is extensive and now offers up to 22 unique finishes. This kind of selection allows customers to pick the exact style they are looking for, from contemporary and modern to rustic and classic. Each finish has its own manufacturer technique, of which Baldwin has nearly perfected. Chrome, Nickel, and Bronze are created with up to 30 layers of metal plating over solid brass for maximum durability.Living Finishes are aged 6 to 12 months and will continually change over time to reveal a classic vintage feel.

	For the most reliable and long lasting finish, choose a piece with Baldwin's Lifetime PVD finish. PVD stands for physical vapor deposition, which offers a superior quality, especially in coastal areas. The creation process includes adding a formula of layered nickel alloys to protect against aging and to provide high levels of resistance to corrosion from air with high salt. Baldwin pioneered the Lifetime PVD finishes for decorative hardware. Baldwin is the only manufacturer that has lifetime finishes in Satin and Polished Nickel.

Handing



X

Handing is a term used to describe which way a door handle turns. To
    determine the handing of a door, stand on the outside of the room you are
    going to enter. For example, if you are entering your house, stand outside
    the house entirely; if you are considering your bathroom door, stand in the
    room that connects to the bathroom. Face the door. Notice which side the
    hinges are on.


Door Swings Inward

Left handing - The hinges are on the left
Right handing - The hinges are on the right

Door Thickness

Door Thickness




Most interior doors are 1-3/8 inches
            thick, while most exterior doors measure 1-3/4 inches. If your door
            is thicker than this, you may need an
            additional component known as a 'thick door kit.'

The backset describes the length of
            the latch itself. To determine this, start at the edge of the door
            and measure out to the center of the borehole drilled in your
            door.

Handing



X
Handing

Handing is a term used to describe which way a door handle turns. To
    determine the handing of a door, stand on the outside of the room you are
    going to enter. For example, if you are entering your house, stand outside
    the house entirely; if you are considering your bathroom door, stand in the
    room that connects to the bathroom. Face the door. Notice which side the
    hinges are on.


Door Swings Inward

Left handing - The hinges are on the left
Right handing - The hinges are on the right




Door Swings Outward

Left hand reverse - The hinges are on the left
Right hand reverse - The hinges are on the right

Solid Construction



X
Solid Construction


Solid Construction is used to describe products composed entirely from a premium material like brass, stainless steel or bronze, and manufactured as one solid piece, with no hollow spaces or interior gaps. Representing a significant increase in quality, these products are typically more expensive than both their hollow counterparts and those that use lesser metals like zinc or aluminum. Heavier, more durable, and often times naturally corrosion resistant, they are made to last a lifetime and the difference is noticeable.

28 Degree Latch



X
28 Degree Latch
A 28 Degree Latch requires less rotation than a standard latch, fully retracting at 28 degrees. This provides smoother operation and a more ergonomic feel when turning the handle.








										28 Degree Latch

Concealed Screws



X
Concealed Screws
On many knobs and levers, the screws that mount the hardware on the door are visible on the interior. Concealed Screws means that these screws are hidden behind the rosette, providing a cleaner more decorative look to your door hardware.

Solid Construction



X
Solid Construction


Solid Construction is used to describe products composed entirely from a premium material like brass, stainless steel or bronze, and manufactured as one solid piece, with no hollow spaces or interior gaps. Representing a significant increase in quality, these products are typically more expensive than both their hollow counterparts and those that use lesser metals like zinc or aluminum. Heavier, more durable, and often times naturally corrosion resistant, they are made to last a lifetime and the difference is noticeable.

Concealed Screws

Concealed Screws
On many knobs and levers, the screws that mount the hardware on the door are visible on the interior. Concealed Screws means that these screws are hidden behind the rosette, providing a cleaner more decorative look to your door hardware.

28 Degree Latch



X
28 Degree Latch
A 28 Degree Latch requires less rotation than a standard latch, fully retracting at 28 degrees. This provides smoother operation and a more ergonomic feel when turning the handle.

Door Thickness

Door Thickness




Most interior doors are 1-3/8 inches
            thick, while most exterior doors measure 1-3/4 inches. If your door
            is thicker than this, you may need an
            additional component known as a 'thick door kit.'

Backset

Backset




The backset describes the length of
            the latch itself. To determine this, start at the edge of the door
            and measure out to the center of the borehole drilled in your
            door.

Top-Down Thematic Approach





Thorough research backs our independent approach to investing. We draw our investment ideas from our own research as well as from analysts, economists and business contacts. We begin the investment process by analyzing trends which may profoundly affect certain industries: demographics, technology, consolidation, globalization, etc. We then look for opportunities, and the companies and/or investment vehicles within them with unrecognized potential, that will eventually attract the attention of the marketplace and develop a growing following of investors. Thematic ideas can also flow from our in- house bottom up analysis.
Bottom Up Due Diligence
Once we have selected an industry group, we then identify and invest in leading, select companies and investment vehicles – looking for exceptional management, effective and efficient operations, clear product innovation, a distinct competitive edge, a strong market position, excellent financial characteristics and consistent growth in revenues and earnings.
Years of Experience Leads to Rigorous Research & Depth of Analysis

What are analysts saying about Maxim Integrated Products stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Maxim Integrated Products stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Maxim is an OEM of analog and mixed signal ICs. The fiscal third-quarter earnings of the company were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  However, over the last one year, the stock has underperformed the Zacks characterized Semi- Analog & Mixed industry. Maxim has a solid portfolio that generates steady design wins, a highly profitable and well-diversified core business, a policy of maintaining efficiency that has led to cost cutting measures and regular cash returns.  Maxim’s exposure to the consumer and communications markets increases risks. However, the diversification of the consumer revenue across a variety of tablets, wearables, peripherals and smartphones is adding stability to the company’s business profile." (6/28/2017)
2. Maxim Group analysts commented, "MXIM delivered another round of beat/raise results with F3Q (March) sales/EPS of $581M/$0.56 besting the Street’s $576M/$0.52, and F4Q (June) guidance of $610M/ $0.62 easily ahead of consensus $598M/$0.58. Auto/industrial (~50% of sales) is driving upside. GM of 65.2% was just ahead of mgmt’s LT target and expected up another 100bps Q/Q in F4Q. Investors would typically cheer such a solid upside result/ outlook; however, mgmt commentary concerning slowing auto orders could temper enthusiasm near term. In addition to MXIM, semiconductor auto bellwethers include NXPI, ADI, and TXN." (4/21/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 7 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.47)Consensus Price Target: $47.13 (4.49% upside)
