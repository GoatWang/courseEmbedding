KBI Global Investors  Ltd. is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. Registered in the Republic of Ireland, No:141475. Registered offices: 3rd Floor, 2 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1, Ireland.
































Natural Resource Strategies

For well over 10 years we have been pioneering natural resource oriented investment strategies; back in 2000 we were one of the first investment firms globally to launch separate Water and Energy Solutions Strategies, a product line-up that now includes Agribusiness and Global Resource Solutions.









Global Equity Strategies

The aim of Global Equity Strategies is to exploit the inefficiency with which the market continually under-prices the earnings potential of higher dividend paying companies. Unlike traditional 'high-yield' offerings we remove regional and industry traps and further increase the opportunity set by having 'all-cap' coverage.









Multi Asset Strategies

The Kleinwort Benson Investors Multi-Asset Strategies combine our in-house specialist products with other world class specialists. 









Who are we?

KBI Global Investors is an institutional asset manager headquartered in Dublin, Ireland with sales offices in New York and Boston. We are committed to doing what we do best - delivering specialist, sustainable and innovative investment strategies for institutional investors which deliver long term returns.

Risk statistics

Alpha?Alpha is a measure of a fund's over- or under-performance by comparison to its benchmark. If the Alpha is 5, the fund has outperformed its benchmark by 5%; so the greater the Alpha, the greater the outperformance.17 
Beta?Beta estimates a fund's volatility by comparison to that of its benchmark. A fund with a beta close to 1 means that the fund will move generally in line with the benchmark. Higher than 1 and the fund is more volatile than the benchmark and vice versa.0.64 
Sharpe?This commonly-used measure calculates the level of return over and above the return of a notional risk-free investment, such as cash. The difference in returns is then divided by the fund's volatility. The resulting ratio is an indication of the amount of excess return generated per unit of risk.0.6 
Volatility?Volatility (or standard deviation), when applied to an investment fund, expresses its risk. It shows how widely a range of returns varied from the fund's average return over a particular period. For example, if a fund had an average return of 5%, and its volatility was 15, this would mean that the range of its returns over the period had swung between +20% and -10%.12.67 
Tracking error?This measures the standard deviation of a fund's excess returns over the returns of an index or benchmark portfolio. As such, it can be an indication of 'riskiness' in the manager's investment style. A Tracking Error below 2 suggests a passive approach. At 3 and above the the manager will be deploying a more active investment style.10.51 
Information ratio?This is a useful risk-adjusted measure of actively managed fund performance. It is calculated by deducting the returns of the fund's benchmark from the fund's overall returns, then dividing the result by its tracking error. The higher the Information Ratio the better. It is generally considered that a figure of 0.5 reflects a good performance, 0.75 very good, and 1.00 outstanding.1.93 
R-Squared?An indication of how closely correlated a fund is to an index or a benchmark. Values for R-Squared range between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating no correlation at all and 1 showing a perfect match. Values upwards of 0.7 suggest that the fund's behaviour is increasingly linked to its benchmark.0.48
