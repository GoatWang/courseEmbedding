 MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, USA, July 20, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Petvivo Holdings, Inc. (OTCPINK: PETV) (www.petvivo.com) is pleased to announce its recent hire of Wesley Hayne, who will join the Petvivo team as Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Mr. Hayne will be taking over the position immediately. His immediate efforts will be to concentrate on the organizational and financial strategies of the company. “I was attracted to the company by the potential of a regenerative biomaterial that may be used in a number of tissue applications; my interest was further enhanced when I was made aware of the biomaterial’s impact in the treatment of osteoarthritis. It was easy to accept the position once I had a complete understanding of how life changing this product can be for humans in addition to animals. The sustainability of the product once injected into dogs and horses is incredible. The “Particles”, in testing to date, have proven safe, with no side effects from the various applications.” “We are very pleased to have Wes join the PetVivo team,” noted John Lai, who will now serve as the Company’s President. “Wes and I first worked together more than twenty-five years ago. Wes has an excellent track record of leading companies to commercial success and I am very confident he can do the same for PetVivo.”  Wes is an accomplished professional having served as CEO or President of several companies in start-up and/or high growth stages. He has extensive experience in strategic planning with an emphasis on finance, business development and sales/marketing.  He further has hands on expertise in investment banking, structuring capital funding, divestures and mergers and acquisitions.  Wes also has an extensive history in identifying business opportunities for expansion, motivating/managing sales forces, and providing decisive resolution to corporate problems.   “It is my intention to see this innovative technology penetrate numerous medical sectors, not only as a company introducing products to market itself, but also as a company that cultivates domestic and foreign licensing opportunities with strategic partners. In my opinion, the entire world is looking for this kind of advancement for treating many debilitating afflictions like osteoarthritis. To date there has been no real treatment for osteoarthritis, yet with age nearly all dogs, horses and humans are faced with it.” About PetVivo Holdings, Inc.    PetVivo Holdings Inc. (OTCPINK: PETV) is an emerging biomedical device company focused on the licensing and commercialization of innovative medical devices for pets and pet therapeutics. PetVivo is leveraging investments made in the human medical device industry to commercialize therapeutics for pets in a capital and time efficient way. A key component of this strategy is the accelerated timeline to revenues for veterinary medical devices, which enter the market much earlier than the more stringently regulated pharmaceuticals.    PetVivo's strategy is to commercialize proprietary products from human medical device companies specifically for the companion animal market. The company’s product pipeline includes seventeen animal and human therapeutics. A portfolio of twenty patents protects the company’s products, production processes and biomaterials. PetVivo’s lead product, a veterinarian-administered joint injection for the treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs, is scheduled for launch later this year.     The Company will also be seeking licensing partners to commercialize its portfolio of proprietary human clinical therapeutics in large market sectors, including: cardiovascular, orthopedic, urology and aesthetics.

Letter to ShareholdersMarketwiredJune 9, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareMINNEAPOLIS, MN--(Marketwired - Jun 9, 2014) - PetVivo Holdings, Inc. (  OTCQB :  PETV )Dear Shareholders: We are very pleased to provide you an update on our recent progress. As you may be aware PetVivo recently entered into a binding term sheet for a merger with our licensing and supply partner Gel-Del Technologies, Inc. Under the agreed upon terms Gel-Del will merge with PetVivo Holdings, Inc. and upon resolution of certain conditions specified as terms, a definitive agreement will consummate the merger.While the Gel-Del license included an option to merge, both parties agreed that an accelerated path to a merger would maximize shareholder value by providing a strategic inflection point that expands access to capital and accelerates commercialization of both human and animal devices. While this planned merger greatly expands our product pipeline, PetVivo remains committed to a Q4 2014 launch of our first product Kush™ for the treatment of animal lameness.Gel-Del Technologies has an extensive patent portfolio in key territories around the world including six issued US Patents. The portfolio not only protects the medical devices but also its materials and method of manufacture.Gel-Del has completed a successful pivotal US clinical trial using their novel thermoplastic biomaterial as a dermal filler for human cosmetic applications. The randomized, double-blind, multicenter study compared Gel-Del's CosmetaLife Product to Restylane. In addition to meeting the primary efficacy endpoint, more subjects preferred CosmetaLife to Restylane through the study's duration. A summary of the trial information and results can be found on clinicaltrial.gov website: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00414544The dermal filler market is a multi-billion dollar market opportunity. Last month Nestle reported it is paying $1.4 billion in cash for the rights to sell Restylane and other skin products in the U.S. and Canada. We anticipate entering the dermal filler market 18 to 24 months post merger.While the human market presents some very large opportunities for Gel-Del's novel devices in the short term PetVivo will continue to focus on the veterinary sector with the launch of the Kush product planned before year-end. We have also established a goal of being listed on NASDAQ within 12 months.We thank you for your ongoing support and we remain committed to providing ongoing shareholder updates.  Regards, John Lai Chief Executive OfficerAbout PetVivo, Inc:  PetVivo, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of PetVivo Holdings, Inc. (  OTCQB :  PETV ) based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. PetVivo is an emerging biomedical device company focused on the licensing and commercialization of innovative medical devices and other therapeutics for pets.PetVivo, Inc. believes that it can leverage the investments in the human bio-materials and medical device industries to commercialize therapeutics to pets in a capital and time efficient way. PetVivo's strategy is to in-license proprietary products from human medical device companies specifically for use in pets. A key component of this strategy is the accelerated timeline to revenues for veterinary medical devices, which enter the market much earlier than the more stringently regulated pharmaceuticals.The fore-going material may contain forward-looking statements. We caution that such statements may be subject to uncertainties and that actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Readers accordingly should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which do not reflect unknown or unanticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of these forward-looking statements.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSlimy slugs inspire 'potentially lifesaving' medical glueBBC NewsThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredSenate Health Bill's Only Win May Be Tax Relief To Device MakersForbesTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredMattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted transgender ban, and he was reportedly 'appalled' by itBusiness InsiderStarbucks is shuttering all of its Teavana stores as the retail apocalypse kills off American mallsBusiness InsiderTwitter is only famous now because of President Trump: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredGDP — What you need to know in markets on FridayYahoo FinanceRepublicans kill the border taxYahoo FinanceAmazon ploughs ahead with high sales and spending; profit plungesReutersPeople in Heavy Debt May Be in For a Big SurpriseFreedom Debt ReliefSponsoredRepublicans warn Trump: No confirmation hearing for a Sessions replacement, and no recess appointment eitherBusiness InsiderEU warns U.S. it could swiftly counter new sanctions on RussiaReutersDonald Trump hovers over Melania during a speech as only Trump canAnonymous: I put 32 years in the service -  I find it nearly impossible to feel even an inkling of patriotism when I see this POTUS adorning any military patch or regalia...
