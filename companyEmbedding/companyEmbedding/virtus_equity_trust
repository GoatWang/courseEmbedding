The Technical Analysis has been created and developed by Dorsey Wright without regard to and independently of Virtus, its business, its development of this product, and/or any prospective investor. The licensing of any Technical Analysis to Virtus is not an offer to purchase or sell, or a solicitation or an offer to buy any securities.

Investment Process Highlights




Step
1




Employ proprietary insights from Dorsey, Wright & Associates, to rank the 130 sub-industry groups of the S&P 500® and 15 country ETFs according to their relative price momentum. The Fund allocates approximately 60% to U.S. securities and 40% to non-U.S. securities.




Step
2




The overall market’s 200-day moving average, a measure of absolute price momentum, is assessed. The domestic market is represented by the S&P 500 Index and the international market by the MSCI ACWI ex-US Index.




Step
3




If the markets are exhibiting positive trends, the Fund will hold equally-weighted allocations to the top 65 U.S. sub-industry groups and top 8 country ETFs.




Step
4




If the markets have trended below their 200-day moving average, indicating a riskier market, the Fund will allocate only to those sub-industry groups and/or country ETFs demonstrating positive momentum. Generally, capital is allocated away from weaker sectors toward stronger sectors. Thus, the Fund may be partially or fully invested in cash equivalents.

Risk Considerations

Equity Securities: The market price of equity securities may be adversely affected by financial market, industry, or issuer-specific events. Focus on a particular style or on small or medium-sized companies may enhance that risk.
Industry/Sector Concentration: A fund that focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector will be more sensitive to conditions that affect that industry or sector than a non-concentrated fund.
Exchange Traded Funds: The value of an ETF may be more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities the ETF is designed to track. The costs of owning the ETF may exceed the cost of investing directly in the underlying securities.
Foreign & Emerging Markets: Investing internationally, especially in emerging markets, involves additional risks such as currency, political, accounting, economic, and market risk.
Allocation: The fund's exposure to different asset classes may not be optimal for market conditions at a given time. Asset allocation does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in declining markets.
Fund of Funds: Because the fund can invest in other funds, it indirectly bears its proportionate share of the operating expenses and management fees of the underlying fund(s).
Prospectus: For additional information on risks, please see the fund's prospectus.

 Performance data quoted represents past results. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Average annual total return is the annual compound return for the indicated period. It reflects the change in share price and the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. NAV returns do not include the effect of any applicable sales charges. POP and w/CDSC returns include the effect of maximum applicable sales charges.
Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.
1 Yields/Distributions: Distribution Yield (at NAV) is calculated by (a) annualizing the latest distribution for fixed income funds or funds less than 1 year old (b) summing all distributions over the preceding 12 months for all other funds, and dividing the NAV on the last business date of the period. SEC Yield represents the net investment income earned by a fund over a 30-day period, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on the fund's public offering share price at the end of the 30-day period.  Gross SEC Yield represents the yield if there were no expense reimbursements.
2 Distribution History: Distributions are represented on a cash basis and may be reclassified at year end for tax purposes. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. STCG: Short Term Capital Gain, LTCG: Long Term Capital Gain
3 Risk Statistics:  R2 is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund or security's movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. Beta is a quantitative measure of the volatility of a given portfolio to the overall market. Alpha is a risk adjusted measure of an investment's excess return relative to a benchmark. A positive Alpha indicates that the investment produced a return greater than expected for the risk (as measured by Beta) taken. Standard Deviation measures variability of returns around the average return for an investment fund. Higher standard deviation suggests greater risk. Risk Statistics are calculated using 36 monthly returns.
4 Characteristics: For Equity Funds: Trailing P/E: Per-share stock price divided by the latest12-months Earnings per Share; Price/Cash Flow: Per-share stock price divided by the per-share operating cash flow; Price/Book: Per-share stock price divided by the latest 12-month per-share Book Value; 3-Year EPS Growth Rate: Average of earnings per share growth for latest 3-year period. The 3-Year EPS Growth Rate is not a forecast of the fund's performance.  4 Characteristics: For Fixed Income Funds:  Duration represents the interest rate sensitivity of a fixed income fund. For example, if a fund's duration is five years, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in a 5% decline in the fund's price. Similarly, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a 5% gain in the fund's price.
Morningstar Disclosures: The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Price & Performance:

Average annual total return is the annual compound return for the indicated period. It reflects the change in share price and the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. NAV returns do not include the effect of any applicable sales charges. POP and w/CDSC returns include the effect of maximum applicable sales charges.

Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.

Net Asset Value (NAV) Per Share: The market worth of one share of a mutual fund. This figure is calculated by subtracting a fund's liabilities from total assets (securities, cash and any accrued earnings) and dividing by the number of shares outstanding.
Public Offering Price (POP): The price at which a fund's shares can be purchased. The offering price includes the current net asset value (NAV) per share plus any sales charges.
On each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading, the net asset value (NAV) is determined as of the close of trading (normally 4:00 pm Eastern Time). The NAV and POP for all funds are subject to change.

Morningstar Disclosures:The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
