30 Fastest Growing Companies of the Year 2016 
Helping you turn towards Smarter Travel Experience: TripBorn Inc.















 Silicon Review
			   2016-03-28



Having served clientele ranging from Travel Agents, Tour Operators, Enterprise Companies, Airlines and Travel Mediatory across India, TripBorn Inc. is busy building State of Art Technology platforms for the Travel Industry in Innovation, since its inception in 2014. The Headquarters and Operations Office are located in Princeton, New Jersey and Ahmedabad, India, respectively.”
When high school friends Deepak Sharma and Sachin Mandloi met at a reunion after several years, they decided to go on a road trip. But little did they know, what awaited them in their journey. Both friends braved several hassles arranging the trip, but unfortunately, were unable to find a single platform or tool to procure an enjoyable travel experience. The school duo then set out to solve and deliver better Travel experience and Management in 2014, by founding TripBorn Inc.
Popularly known as a revolutionary and influential e-Market Place platform in the Travel industry, TripBorn is today’s most visible benchmark for “all travel needs” using web and mobile technology, most scalable platforms for real-world applications. Not only is the TripBorn platform, the first of its kind, but is also one of the most effectively managed and “well-policed” eTravel platforms in the industry today.
Making the most out of the current market opportunities The travel and tourism industry has emerged as one of the key industries globally both in terms of growth and GDP contribution. While the western worlds have traditionally been the tourism market leader, new emerging markets such as India expects to witness higher growth rates in international tourist visits over the next decade. Rising purchasing power of middle class, changing lifestyles, better air, rail, and bus connectivity, and rapid adoption of smartphones continue to drive this market. Driven by factors such as rapidly growing economy, rising middle class, favorable policies and increasing foreign tourist arrivals, the country in fact, witnessed the fastest growth among the G20 nations in 2015 at 8.1%, followed by Saudi Arabia (7.9%) and China (7.7%). Owing to these factors, the total contribution of the travel and tourism sector to India’s GDP is estimated to reach US$275.2 billion by 2025 from US$136.3 billion in 2015. The travel and tourism industry in India, which comprises both domestic (85% of the market) and international inbound travel (15%), is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 12% to $27.5 bn in 2016 from $19.7 bn in 2013.
The current population of India is 1.3 billion, out of which 1/6th of the population is online i.e. 278 million (Q3 2014) says IAMAI data. India has the third largest internet population in the world, according to Google India 2017 will see 500 million internet users in India, leaving US behind and edging towards the numbers in China. India is a mobile friendly country; more people have mobiles than people having PCs. 44% of the India internet users use social media i.e. 122 million. Out of these 122 million, 75% (92 million) access social media via their mobile devices.
As travel becomes more democratized and more complex, customers need increasing help in navigating through the options. So a major focus of TripBorn’s efforts is to provide value to consumers and travel agencies which involves easing the search process and delivering to its customers solutions that enable them to present consumers with targeted options—product/service innovation with Big Data and Machine learning.
Facilitating seamless integration through API/XML/XMI with its suppliers and customers for various product offerings, TripBorn’s robust architecture delivers superior results at affordable costs by employing various analytical models and open source technologies in combination with SQL and NoSQL databases. These travel searches consider various variables such as distance from the customer’s specified preference, facilities, and the pricing deal compared to alternatives. In air travel search, TripBorn uses analytical models to ensure that prices displayed on its website are consistent with those on airline sites, since synchronization issues could occur across data sources.
A differentiated Travel Portal and Engineering Platform “We plan to architect, design and implement the next generation, service-oriented travel portal to realize a classic business model with SOA (service-oriented architecture) paradigm. It would provide our customers with composite travel packages through dynamic composition among travel-related services from distributed providers and across business domains”, said the Founders.
Further, a comprehensive TripBorn service-oriented engineering platform (TBSOEPTM) will be engineered and customized for travel portals based on a comprehensive research of existing travel platforms from world leaders and it is consciously ensured that issues that tend to become the bottlenecks in these highly successful portals are redressed and the resulting platform will incorporate efficient system design and development to support complete life cycle of ticketing process for all modes of transportation and services around these modes to make easy maneuver ability and ticketing experience for all use case scenarios.
With plans to incorporate this platform on the cloud with advanced analytics supported by machine learning, deep learning and cognitive computing abilities, the company seeks to provide device independent user interface across all popular mobility devices with support for major regional Indian language support besides, English and Hindi.
“The platform will be driven by four models: service meta-model, process model, business model and global information model. These models support semantic description and rational operations of the application and facilitate travel service discovery, process execution and business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C) integrations”, said Deepak.
Providing a professional implementation environment for service-oriented travel portal which will have extendable and scalable elastic design to rapidly add other revenue stream transactions and processes, the travel portal provides a real SOA application and well-defined business and service cases to provide a globally comprehensive platform, aiming to increase the portal’s manageability through the design of large granular services to be constructed from smaller ones, to split up a complex problem into smaller problems solved independently.
“It will thus be easier to add new services, update, replace or remove existing services without affecting the others. And it will be customizable for the service-oriented systems of other transaction types related to travel besides ticketing using a similar framework and approaches to those presented in TBSOEPTM platform”, added Sachin.
Plans for the days ahead TripBorn Inc. will be filing its S1 Registration for listing in OTC market in the United States soon, and has plans to offer an Initial Public Offering in 2016. It has secured initial funding, and is planning for a series round of capital to be raised in order to fund its growth.
The company has technology and infrastructure in place to increase its market share with a huge opportunity that exists with the Indian Railways’ who has ambitious plan for modernization where 23 million tickets are sold every day. With this planned modernization of Indian Railways and the ancillary revenue opportunity that the Indian market provides, TripBorn will reap benefits out of it.
TripBorn is working on its plan to organize the highly unorganized Bus Travel sector where up to 15 million people travel every day using Bus/Coaches that is operated by State run Transport and private players.
It has built-in inclusive business model and technology to penetrate into the growing middle-class of India into rural and semi-urban market for its growth.
Founders Speak
Q. What are the challenges faced by you and your team? Deepak: “One of the biggest challenges in the online travel space is to understand the requirements of future travel agents or reps. They are not just responsible for itineraries and welfare but also are data analysts who understand customers in their remit from their online behavior as much as their facial expressions other than choice, price and schedule. OTAs need to manage increasing the diverse supply base by overcoming technological constraints to deliver smarter travel experience, authenticity of information and most importantly grievance redressal of customers. The growth of the Indian OTA market has attracted leading Global OTAs to the country. Leading Indian OTAs have been successful in capturing market share because they understand the psyche of local customers and customize their solutions accordingly. International players may however, take some time to understand the market and capture market share especially in building the distribution network given the diversity of the unorganized eco-system of Indian travel players. Low entry barriers, large market size and high levels of user acceptance continue to attract several smaller players to the OTA space. A lot of these new entrants resort to aggressive pricing strategies, heavy discounts and offers, high commissions to affiliates/vendors during sale period, which has resulted in significant pressure on the margins of players across the industry. There is low penetration of the online bus ticketing services segment in India. The online presence of bus operators would increase their visibility, since it would enable easier access to information for tourists. Although there is significant scope for expansion, the low adoption of technology by bus operators and the fragmented nature of the bus industry hamper growth. Players need to, therefore, quickly invest in technology or risk losing out on a significant share of potential customers.”

Sachin: “Managing hotel reservations and tour packages involve higher customer engagement as it entails managing relationships with numerous hotels and tour operators across India. And in the absence of effective management, if hotels and tour operators are not able to fulfill their commitments, the reputation of OTAs will be under threat for customers who book tickets through them.Till date, most OTAs have focused on the urban population due to the availability of Internet access and the presence of affluent people who purchase domestic/international air tickets and their reach is limited in rural areas and tier II/III cities due to low internet penetration and low literacy. Besides, although rising income levels have resulted in the credit and debit card penetration in India, their online usage is limited due to apprehensions about security online. Additionally, a large chunk of the Indian population does not have access to the banking services. Hence, OTAs should offer Cash on Delivery options to serve the large unbanked sector as well as to those who are apprehensive of making banking/online transactions.”
“Our Goal as a company is to enable smarter travel experience and have customer service that is not the best but LEGENDARY.”

We are registering the shares of common stock held by our selling stockholders
to permit the resale of these shares of common stock by the selling stockholders
after the date of this prospectus. We will not receive any proceeds from the
sale of our common stock offered by the selling stockholders under this
prospectus.
 
We will bear all fees and expenses incident to our obligation to register the
shares of our common stock that the stockholders are offering for resale.


The market for travel services and products in India is highly competitive. We
currently compete with both established and other emerging providers of travel
services and products, including other online travel agencies, as well as
traditional travel agencies, tour operators, travel suppliers and operators of
travel industry reservation databases. Large, established internet search
engines have also launched applications offering travel itineraries in
destinations around the world, and meta-search companies who can aggregate
travel search results also compete with us for customers.
 
Established OTAs such as makemytrip.com, cleartrip.com, expedia.co.in,
travelocity.co.in, yatra.com, goibibo.com, booking.com and agoda.com have
achieved strong brand recognition and reliability in India. Since the travel
industry is a high-volume, low-margin business, it can be difficult for emerging
participants, such as us to capture a meaningful share of the market from OTAs
with established brands and resources. We intend to build our brand in the
underserved rural and semi-rural markets through our superior service-oriented
travel portal. We believe that being a later market entrant allows us to develop
a superior platform with up-to-date technologies.

Certain of our travel suppliers have also been steadily focusing on increasing
online demand on their own websites and decreasing or eliminating their
dependence on third-party distributors like us. For instance, many low-cost
airlines may, subject to applicable regulations, reduce or eliminate commissions
to agents such as us or restrict the amount of service fees we are able to
charge customers. Suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not
charge a processing fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such as their
own bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their offerings more
attractive to customers than offerings like ours.


Company Description
We are an online travel agency, sometimes referred to as an OTA, that offers
travel reservations and related travel services and products to travel agents in
India through our website, www.tripborn.com. Our parent holding company,
TripBorn, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2010 as


 PinstripesNYC,
Inc. We conduct our business operations under the name TripBorn through our
operating subsidiary, Sunalpha Green Technologies Private Limited, or
“Sunalpha,” which was incorporated under the laws of the Republic of India in
November 2010. Our operating subsidiary commenced operations as an online travel
agency in February 2014.
 
Currently, we operate as a business to business, or B2B, online travel agency
that serves travel agents and travel companies based in India in booking travel
services for their customers. Through our internet-based platform, our travel
agents can search and book domestic and international air tickets, hotels,
vacation packages, rail tickets and bus tickets, as well as ancillary
travel-related services. We serve over 850 travel agents in the Indian states of
Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Madya Pradesh. At present,
approximately 85% of our travel agents are based in Gujarat, primarily in and
around the city of Ahmedabad. We plan to expand our operations throughout
pan-India as opportunities present, with an immediate focus on the states of
Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi and Madya Pradesh.

Our principal executive offices are located at 812 Venus Atlantis Corporate
Park, Near Prahalad Nagar Garden, Satellite, Ahmedabad 380 015, and our
telephone number is 91 079-4019914. Our website address is www.tripborn.com.

A development agreement is a document used when an individual or company (''Developer'') is entering into a development project with an individual or company (''Company''), to create a new product. For example, this type of agreement might be used if one technology company agreed to provide development services for another technnology company. Alternatively, a restaurant chain can also use this type of agreement when entering into a business relationship with a franchisee.
The agreement is meant to protect the intellectual property of the parties, and designates certain rights and responsibilities between the parties. A development agreement usually includes information regarding obligations, compensation, and how costs shall be distributed. Stipulations regarding which party will provide materials and said materials will be handled, may also be included.  Stipulations regarding which party will provide materials and said materials will be handled, may also be included. 
The agreement may include language for ownership of all prototypes, notebooks, reports, and other related items for the development project. Insurance, indemnification clauses, and rights to termination of the agreement are also typically included in a development agreement.

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY



	 



	The following summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus and is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information and financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. This summary does not contain all of the information you should consider before investing in our common stock. Before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should read and carefully consider the following summary together with the entire prospectus, including our financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this prospectus and the matters discussed in the sections in this prospectus entitled “Risk Factors,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Some of the statements in this prospectus constitute forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the section in this prospectus entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed in the “Risk Factors” and other sections of this prospectus.



	 



	Our Company



	 





	We are an online travel agency, sometimes referred to as an OTA, that offers travel reservations and related travel services and products to travel agents in India through our website, www.tripborn.com. Our parent holding company, TripBorn, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2010 as PinstripesNYC, Inc. We conduct our business operations under the name TripBorn through our operating subsidiary, Sunalpha Green Technologies Private Limited, or “Sunalpha,” which was incorporated under the laws of the Republic of India in November 2010. Our operating subsidiary commenced operations as an online travel agency in February 2014.








	Currently, we operate as a business to business, or B2B, online travel agency that serves travel agents and travel companies based in India in booking travel services for their customers. Through our internet-based platform, our travel agents can search and book domestic and international air tickets, hotels, vacation packages, rail tickets and bus tickets, as well as ancillary travel-related services. We serve over 650 travel agents in the Indian states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madya Pradesh. At present, approximately 85% of our travel agents are based in Gujarat, primarily in and around the city of Ahmedabad. We plan to expand our operations throughout pan-India as opportunities present, with an immediate focus on the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi and Madya Pradesh.




	 




	Our Strategy



	 



	India’s rapidly growing economy and rising middle class are driving growth in India’s travel and tourism industry.

	 

	We use sophisticated information technology to offer a wide inventory of travel services via our website to offline travel agents who serve the growing middle class of travelers in semi-urban and rural regions of India. Through our proprietary technology, we consolidate and provide our travel agents with access to travel bookings and hotel reservations that otherwise would be costly and time-consuming to obtain for their customers in an often-fragmented marketplace. While some of our more established competitors have focused on selling directly to consumers in urban areas, our travel agent partners tend to be small, brick and mortar establishments that serve travelers who rely on more personalized transactions for their travel booking needs due to language barriers and lack of access to the internet and/or credit cards. We have grown our operations through referrals and a focus on addressing our customers’ needs through technology. As internet penetration in India increases, we anticipate that we will be in a position to use our established platform to offer travel services and products directly to consumers.



	 



	Distribution and Intellectual Property



	 





	We manage our OTA business through Travelcord, our proprietary internet-based online transaction platform. We engineered our internet-based platform using multiple systems platforms with an emphasis on scalability, performance and reliability. Pursuant to a Software Agreement with our affiliate, Arna Global LLC, we succeeded to the ownership and development rights of Travelcord under a Software Development Agreement with Takniki Communications, which is wholly-owned by our Vice President and director, Sachin Mandloi. By virtue of a letter agreement, we license Travelcord to Sunalpha. Arna Global LLC is wholly-owned by our President and director, Deepak Sharma.





	 





	Indian Taxes on Sales of Our Common Stock





	 





	As described more fully in the section entitled, “Risk Factors,” if the Indian tax authorities determine that our common stock derives its value substantially from assets located in India and the provisions of any relevant double tax avoidance treaty are deemed to be inapplicable in this context, you may be subject to Indian income taxes on the income arising, directly or indirectly, through the sale of our common stock.

	Risks Associated with Our Business



	 





	Before you invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider all the information in this prospectus, including the following risks and uncertainties that may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as described more fully in the section entitled “Risk Factors:”





	 









	 







	Ÿ








	We are a development stage company with a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance;








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	We have a history of operating losses, which may continue and may harm our ability to obtain financing and continue our operations;








	 







	 







	Ÿ










	We estimate that we will require approximately $1,700,000 and $5,800,000 in the next 12 and 24 months, respectively, to continue operations and to grow our business; if we are unable to obtain additional financing our business operations may be harmed or discontinued, and if we do obtain additional financing our stockholders may suffer substantial dilution;










	 













	 







	Ÿ








	The travel industry in India is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, many of whom have greater resources and more established operations and brand recognition than we do;








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	We rely on information technology to operate our business and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business;








	 












	 







	Ÿ








	Becoming subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the “Exchange Act” and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner; we estimate that we may incur approximately $260,000 in costs during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 and $384,000 in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 in connection with becoming a public company.








	 








	 







	Ÿ

	Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company



	 



	We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:



	 







	 







	Ÿ








	A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A;








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements.








	 



	We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this prospectus, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.



	 



	We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

	RISK FACTORS



	 



	Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the value of our common stock could decline, and you could lose your investment.



	 



	Risks Related to Our Business



	 



	We are a development stage company with a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance.



	 



	We have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our future performance. Our operating subsidiary was incorporated under the laws of India in 2010, and it began to focus its operations on the online travel industry in February 2014. Our senior management has limited experience in the online travel industry, and we still are in the process of fully developing our online platform and product offerings. We have generated revenues over a limited operating history and have incurred net losses. As a result of our short operating history, we have only limited financial data and business information with which to evaluate our business strategies, performance and investment in our common stock.



	 



	We have incurred net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.



	 



	We expect to incur operating losses in future periods as we incur significant expenses associated with the initial startup of our business. Our expenses will continue to increase as we continue to develop the operations necessary to further our business plan. We cannot now determine the amount by which our expenses will increase as we grow and hire additional employees, implement our sales, marketing and distribution plans, pursue contractual arrangements and partnerships and develop our internet-based infrastructure. Further, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in achieving or sustaining positive cash flow at any time in the future. Any such failure could result in the possible closure of our business and a complete loss of your investment.



	 



	We are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiary to meet our obligations.



	 



	We are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our Indian operating subsidiary to meet our obligations. The deterioration of income from, or other available assets of, our Indian operating subsidiary for any reason could limit or impair its ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.



	 



	Our lack of insurance leaves us exposed to significant liabilities.



	 



	We do not carry insurance for the risks that our business may encounter. Any significant liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, if we are able to continue in business at all.



	 



	The requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.



	 



	Following this offering, we will need to comply with new laws, regulations, requirements and certain corporate governance provisions under the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management, and will significantly increase our costs and expenses and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. In connection with becoming a reporting company, we will need to:



	 







	 







	Ÿ








	institute a more comprehensive compliance function;








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	prepare and distribute periodic and current reports under the federal securities laws;








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	establish new internal policies, such as those related to insider trading; and








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants.









	 






	Our ongoing compliance efforts will increase general and administrative expenses and may divert management’s time and attention from the development of our business, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We estimate that we may incur approximately $260,000 in costs during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 and $384,000 in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 in connection with becoming a public company.





	      







	 






	9










	 





	 



	Our lack of experienced accounting staff may impact our ability to report our future financial results on a timely and accurate basis, and we need to retain the services of additional accountants and consultants with required accounting experience and expertise.



	 





	With the exception of our Chief Financial Officer, our accounting and finance staff lacks depth and skill in the application of generally accepted accounting principles with respect to external financial reporting for Exchange Act reporting companies. We also do not have an audit committee or a member of our board of directors who would satisfy the definition of an audit committee financial expert. We intend to engage the services of additional accounting personnel to assist with our financial accounting and reporting requirements to develop our internal control over financial reporting and to produce timely financial reports. Until we do so, we may experience difficulty producing reliable and timely financial statements, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our stock to decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, and our business and financial condition could be harmed.





	 





	We will not be required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the end of the second fiscal year reported on our second annual report on Form 10-K.



	 



	We will not be required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the end of the second fiscal year reported on our second annual report on Form 10-K. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we will not be required to obtain an auditor attestation of management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting once such internal controls are in place. As a result, we may fail to identify and remediate a material weakness or deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, which may cause our financial statements and related disclosure to contain material misstatements and could cause delays in filing required financial statements and related reports. Furthermore, the process of designing and implementing internal controls over financial reporting may divert our internal resources and take a significant amount of time and expenditure to complete. The actual or perceived risk associated with our lack of internal controls could cause investors lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could negatively impact the market for our common stock and cause us to be unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all, which could cause harm to our business and financial condition.



	 



	We may not be successful in implementing our growth strategies.



	 



	Our growth strategies involve expanding our network of travel agents, expanding our service and product offerings, expanding supplier relationships, enhancing our service platforms by investing in technology and expanding into new geographic markets within India. The following factors may affect our success in implementing our growth strategies:



	 







	 







	Ÿ








	our ability to increase the number of suppliers, especially suppliers that are directly-connected to us, which depends on the willingness of such suppliers to invest in new technology;








	 







	 






	Ÿ






	our ability to continue to expand our distribution channels, and market and cross-sell our travel services and products to facilitate the expansion of our business;







	 







	 






	Ÿ






	our ability to build or acquire the required technology;







	 







	 







	Ÿ








	the general condition of the global and Indian economy and continued growth in demand for travel services, particularly online;








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	our ability to compete effectively with existing and new entrants to the Indian travel industry, including both online travel companies as well as traditional travel agents and tour providers; and








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	the growth of the internet as a medium for commerce in India.








	 



	Many of these factors are beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will succeed in implementing our strategy.



	 



	We depend on certain related persons transactions and may continue to rely on related persons for key development and support activities.



	 





	As described more fully in “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions,” we have entered into, and may continue to enter into, transactions with related persons. We rely on associates and enterprises that our President and Vice President control for key development and support activities. While we believe that our related persons’ interests align with our own, we may not have entered into such transactions on an arm’s-length basis. While we presently benefit from free services or deferred payments, in the long-term, we may have achieved more favorable terms had we entered into such transactions with unrelated parties. In addition, if these related persons withdrew their support from our business, the associated loss of preferential business arrangements could significantly increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations to the point that we might be forced to cease operations.





	      







	 






	10










	 





	 



	We will not be able to develop or continue our business if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.



	 



	Our future success depends on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain a skilled senior management team and other key personnel. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business. We face competition in securing qualified personnel possessing the skills necessary to implement our strategy, and we may fail to attract or retain the employees necessary to execute our business model successfully.



	 



	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management and other personnel. In particular, we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the technical expertise, financial support and key contracts and arrangements of our executive officers and directors, Deepak Sharma and Sachin Mandloi. Messrs. Sharma and Mandloi may voluntarily terminate their services at any time. We have not entered into employment agreements with them and do not expect to enter into such agreements following the consummation of this offering. If Messrs. Sharma, Mandloi or any other key members of our management team leave the company, our business could suffer and the value of our common stock would likely decline, if we are able to continue in business at all.



	 



	Our significant stockholders exercise significant influence over our company and may have interests that are different from those of our other stockholders.



	 





	Immediately prior to this offering, our sole directors, Deepak Sharma and Sachin Mandloi beneficially owned 93% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. If the selling stockholders sell all of the shares offered by this prospectus, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Mandloi will beneficially own 79% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. By virtue of such holdings, they have the ability to exercise significant influence over our company and our affairs and business, including the election of directors, amendments to our charter and bylaws, the approval of a merger or sale of substantially all our assets and the approval of most other actions requiring the approval of our stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may be different from or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and their influence may result in the delay or prevention of a change of management or control of our company.





	 





	Third parties claiming that we infringe on their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from operating our business.



	 



	From time to time, we may receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including claims regarding copyrights and trademarks. Former employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to suspend certain services, redesign our platform, pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. We cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We may incur significant expenditures to investigate, defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights.



	 



	We need to expand our sales, marketing and support organizations and our distribution arrangements to increase market acceptance of our products and services.



	 



	We currently have a limited number of sales, marketing, customer service and support personnel and will need to increase our staff to generate a greater volume of sales and to support any new customers or the expanding needs of existing customers. The employment market for sales, marketing, customer service and support personnel in our industry is very competitive, and we may not be able to hire the kind and number of sales, marketing, customer service and support personnel we are targeting. Our inability to hire qualified sales, marketing, customer service and support personnel may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.



	 



	Risks Related to Operations in India



	 



	Our operations in India may be adversely affected by social and political uncertainties or change, military activity, health-related risks or acts of terrorism.



	 



	From time to time India has experienced instances of civil unrest, terrorism and hostilities among neighboring countries, including Pakistan. Terrorist attacks, military activity, rioting, or civil or political unrest in the future could influence the Indian economy and our operations by disrupting operations and communications and making travel within India more difficult and less desirable. Our industry particularly is sensitive to actual or perceived safety concerns such as these, as well as health-related risks such as the influenza A virus (H1N1), avian flu (H5N1 and H7N9) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or other epidemics or pandemics. Any of these events in or around India could cause the demand for travel-related services to decline. Political or social tensions also could create a greater perception that investments in companies with Indian operations involve a high degree of risk, which could adversely affect the market and price for our common stock. We do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, military conflicts and wars, which could subject us to significant financial losses. The realization of any of these risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or share price.



	 





	 






	11










	 





	 



	Our results of operations are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.



	 



	Our presentation currency is the US dollar. However, the functional currency of our operating subsidiary is the Indian Rupee. Any fluctuation in the value of the Indian Rupee against the US dollar, such as the approximately five percent drop in the average value of the Indian Rupee as compared to the US dollar during 2015, will affect our results of operations. We expect to be adversely affected by any further depreciation of the Indian Rupee against the US dollar.



	 



	Our bank accounts in India are not insured or protected against loss, and the failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could affect our ability to continue in business.



	 





	We maintain our cash in India with both private and state-owned banks located in India. These cash accounts are not insured or otherwise protected against loss. Should any bank holding our cash deposits become insolvent, or if we are otherwise unable to withdraw funds, we would lose the cash on deposit with that particular bank. Loss of cash deposits or the inability to access such cash deposits could impair our operations, and if we are not able to access funds to pay our service providers and employees, we may be unable to continue in business.





	   





	If we violate applicable anti-corruption laws or our internal policies designed to ensure ethical business practices, we could face financial penalties and/or reputational harm that would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.



	 





	We are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in the United States and India. India’s reputation for potential corruption and the challenges presented by India’s complex business environment may increase our risk of violating applicable anti-corruption laws. Our commercial relationships with state-owned enterprises may further intensify this risk. We face the risk that we, our employees or any third parties such as our sales agents and distributors that we engage to do work on our behalf may take action determined to be in violation of anti-corruption laws in any jurisdiction in which we conduct business, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (“FCPA”), India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 and Indian Penal Code. Any violation of the FCPA or any similar anti-corruption law or regulation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations that might harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we have internal ethics policies with which we require our employees to comply in order to ensure that we conduct our business in a manner that our management deems appropriate. If these anti-corruption laws or internal policies were to be violated, our reputation and operations could also be substantially harmed. Further, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management.




	 




	Natural disasters could have a negative impact on the Indian economy and cause our business to suffer.



	 



	India has experienced natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods and drought in the past few years. For example, in November and December 2015, Chennai, the frequently visited capital city of Tamil Nadu, experienced historic flooding that closed its airport for several days and suspended rail service. In addition, in September 2014, the state of Jammu and Kashmir in northern India, another popular tourism destination, experienced widespread floods and landslides. The extent and severity of these natural disasters determines their impact on the Indian economy. Substantially all of our operations and employees are located in India and our operations may be adversely affected by natural disasters in the future. Furthermore, if any of these natural disasters occur in tourist destinations in India, travel within India could be adversely affected, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.



	 



	Necessary infrastructure upgrades in India may not keep pace with increasing internet penetration, which may adversely affect our operations and require us to make additional investments and expenditures.



	 





	Our customers complete their bookings through our Indian website. In November 2015, the Internet and Mobile Association of India forecasted that India’s internet user population would reach 402 million users by December 2015, a 49% year over year increase. Slowdowns or disruptions in upgrading India’s internet-based infrastructure to meet this demand could reduce the rate of expected increases in the use of the internet and our internet-based services, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, any slowdown or negative deviation in the anticipated increase in internet penetration in India may require us to make additional investments in alternative distribution channels, which could strain our financial and human resources, causing our operations and financial condition to suffer.




	 






	 






	12










	 





	 




	Restrictions on foreign investment in India may prevent us from making future acquisitions or investments in India, including with respect to our operating subsidiary, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and financial performance.



	 





	India regulates ownership of Indian companies by foreigners. These regulations and restrictions may apply to acquisitions by us of shares in Indian companies or the provision of funding by us to our Indian operating subsidiary. For example, under its consolidated foreign direct investment policy, the Government of India has set out criteria for foreign investments in India, including requirements with respect to downstream investments by Indian companies owned or controlled by foreign entities and the transfer of ownership or control of Indian companies in sectors with caps on foreign investment from resident Indian persons or entities to foreigners. These requirements, which currently include restrictions on valuations and sources of funding for such investments and may include prior approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, may adversely affect our ability to make investments in India, including through our operating subsidiary in India. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any required approvals for future acquisitions or investments in India, or that we will be able to obtain such approvals on satisfactory terms.




	 



	We may incur expenses, including penalties imposed by the Reserve Bank of India if we do not comply, or timely comply, with reporting requirements in connection with the acquisition and transfer of our securities by our Indian employees.



	 




	Under regulations of the Reserve Bank of India, our operating subsidiary is subject to periodic reporting requirements in connection with the acquisition and transfer of our securities by Indian residents, including with respect to our employees who acquire our shares under employee stock option plans. If we fail to meet our reporting requirements, the Reserve Bank of India may impose penalties or take other action that could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.




	 



	We are subject to regulatory and political uncertainties in India.



	 



	We conduct substantially all of our business and operations in India. Consequently, government policies and regulations, including tax policies, in India will impact our financial performance and the market price of our common stock.



	 



	The Government of India has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the Indian economy. Since 1991, successive Indian governments have generally pursued policies of economic liberalization and financial sector reforms, including by significantly relaxing restrictions on the private sector. Nevertheless, the role of the Indian central and state governments in the Indian economy as producers, consumers and regulators has remained significant and we cannot assure you that such liberalization policies will continue. The present government has continued to take initiatives that support the economic growth of the country that have been pursued by previous governments. However, there is no assurance that it will be able to generate sufficient cross-party support to implement such  initiatives. The rate of economic liberalization could change, and specific laws and policies affecting travel service companies, foreign investments, currency exchange rates and other matters affecting investments in India could change as well. A significant change in India’s policy of economic liberalization and deregulation or any social or political uncertainties could adversely affect business and economic conditions in India generally and our business and prospects.



	 



	We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.



	 



	As a US-based holding company that provides services in India through our operating subsidiary, we are subject to income taxes and non-income based taxes in the United States and in India. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates and tax regimes in the jurisdictions in which we are located and operate may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and comply with applicable laws, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If our effective tax rates were to increase, our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.



	 





	Judgments that our stockholders obtain against us may not be enforceable

	.



	 



	Substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States and substantially all of our revenue is derived outside of the United States. In addition, our director, Sachin Mandloi resides in India and our executive officer and director, Deepak Sharma spends a significant amount of time in India. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It is uncertain whether the courts of India would recognize or enforce judgments of United States or state courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the laws of the United States or any state. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether such Indian courts would be competent to hear original actions brought in India against us or such persons predicated upon the laws of the United States or any state.



	 




	Risks Related to Our Industry



	 



	We rely on information technology to operate our business and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business.



	 



	We depend on the use of sophisticated information technology and systems, which we have customized for search and reservation for flights and hotels, as well as payments, refunds, customer relationship management, communications and administration. As our operations grow in both size and scope, we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer our customers enhanced services, features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure in a cost-effective manner. Our future success also depends on our ability to upgrade our services and infrastructure ahead of rapidly evolving consumer demands while continuing to improve the performance, features and reliability of our service in response to competitive offerings.



	 





	 






	13










	 





	 



	If the number of travel agents using our services increases substantially, or if critical third-party systems stop operating as designed, we may need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems, financial and accounting systems and other infrastructure. We may not be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner, and, depending on the third-party systems affected, our transactional, financial and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time before upgrade, expansion or repair.



	 



	We may not be able to use new technologies effectively, or we may fail to adapt our website, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure to meet consumer requirements or emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced solutions, our customers may forego the use of our services in favor of those of our competitors. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations.



	 



	The travel industry in India is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.



	 





	The travel market in India is highly competitive. Factors affecting our competitive success include, price, availability and breadth of choice of travel services and products, brand recognition, customer service, fees charged to travelers, ease of use, accessibility and reliability. We currently compete with both established and other emerging providers of travel services and products, including other online travel agencies in India and abroad, such as makemytrip.com, cleartrip.com, expedia.co.in, travelocity.co.in, yatra.com, goibibo.com, booking.com and agoda.com, as well as traditional travel agencies, tour operators, travel suppliers and operators of travel industry reservation databases. Large, established internet search engines have also launched applications offering travel itineraries in destinations around the world, and meta-search companies that can aggregate travel search results also compete against us for customers. Certain of our competitors have launched brand marketing campaigns to increase their visibility with customers. For example, trivago.com has commenced a television advertising campaign in India. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than us and certain of our competitors have a longer history of established businesses and reputations in the Indian travel market (particularly in the hotels and vacation packages business) as compared with us. From time to time we may be required to reduce service fees and net revenue margins in order to compete effectively and maintain or gain market share.





	 





	Some travel suppliers are seeking to decrease their reliance on distribution intermediaries such as us, by promoting direct distribution channels. Many airlines, hotels, car rental companies and tour operators have call centers and have established their own travel distribution websites and mobile applications. From time to time, travel suppliers offer advantages, such as bonus loyalty awards and lower transaction fees or discounted prices, when their services and products are purchased from supplier-related channels. We also compete with competitors who may offer less content, functionality and marketing reach but at a relatively lower cost to suppliers. If our access to supplier-provided content or features were to be diminished either relative to our competitors or in absolute terms or if we are unable to compete effectively with travel supplier-related channels or other competitors, our business could be materially and adversely affected.



	 



	We depend on and expect to continue to depend on a small number of low cost airlines in India for a significant percentage of our air ticketing revenue.



	 



	Four low cost airlines dominate India’s domestic air travel industry. As we derive a substantial portion of our air ticketing revenue through the base commissions and incentive payments of these domestic airlines, our dependence on a limited number of domestic airlines means that a reduction or elimination in base commissions and incentive payments by any one or all of these airlines could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.



	 



	In addition, our reliance on a small number of airline suppliers in India gives those airline suppliers additional bargaining power in negotiating agreements with us. A reduction or elimination of base commissions and incentive payments by any of these domestic airline suppliers, the loss of any of these domestic airline suppliers or a domestic airline supplier exerting significant price and margin pressure on us could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



	 



	Our processing, storage, use and disclosure of customer data of our agents or visitors to our website could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements, differing views of personal privacy rights or data security breaches.



	 



	In the processing of our agent transactions, we receive and store a large volume of customer information. Such information increasingly is subject to legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions and governments are increasingly acting to protect the privacy and security of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded or amended to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As privacy and data protection become more sensitive issues in India, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities. For example, under the Indian Information Technology Act, 2000, as amended, our operating subsidiary is subject to civil liability for wrongful loss or gain arising from any negligence in implementing and maintaining reasonable security practices and procedures with respect to sensitive personal data or information on our computer systems, networks, databases and software. India has also implemented privacy laws, including the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011, which impose limitations and restrictions on the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Any liability we may incur for violation of such laws and regulations and related costs of compliance and other burdens may adversely affect our business and profitability.



	 





	 






	14










	 





	 





	We cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent data breaches. Companies that handle such information have also been subject to investigations, lawsuits and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Security breaches could damage our reputation, cause interruptions in our operations, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, and could also cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in the security of our transactions, which would have a negative effect on the demand for our services and products. Moreover, public perception concerning security and privacy on the internet could adversely affect customers’ willingness to use our websites. A publicized breach of security in India, even if it only affects other companies conducting business over the internet, could inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions, and, therefore, the prospects of our business.





	 





	These and other privacy and security developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



	 



	If we are unable to maintain existing, or establish new arrangements with our travel suppliers, our business may be adversely affected.



	 





	Our business depends on our ability to maintain our relationships and arrangements with existing suppliers, as well as our ability to establish and maintain relationships with new travel suppliers. A substantial portion of our revenue less service cost derives from fees and commissions negotiated with travel suppliers for bookings made through our website. Many of our agreements with our travel suppliers are short-term contracts that require periodic renewal on a quarterly or yearly basis and provide our counterparties with a right to terminate on short notice or without notice. Adverse changes in existing arrangements, including an inability by any travel supplier to fulfill its payment obligation to us in a timely manner, increasing industry consolidation or our inability to enter into or renew arrangements with these parties on favorable terms, if at all, could reduce the amount, quality, pricing and breadth of the travel services and products that we are able to offer, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.




	 




	We do not have formal arrangements with many of our travel suppliers.



	 



	We rely on travel suppliers to facilitate the sale of our travel services. We do not have formal agreements with many of our travel suppliers, including many hotels, whose booking systems or central reservations systems we rely on for bookings and confirmation as well as certain payment gateway arrangements. We cannot assure you that these third parties will not terminate these arrangements with us on short notice or without notice. Termination, non-renewal or suspension or an adverse amendment of any of these arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



	 



	Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by global and/or domestic economic conditions.



	 



	Due to the discretionary nature of travel expenditures, the travel industry tends to experience weak or reduced demand during economic downturns. Unfavorable changes in the business and economic conditions affecting our market could result in fewer reservations made through our websites and/or lower our net revenue margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, during periods of poor economic conditions, airlines and hotels tend to reduce rates or offer discounted sales to stimulate demand, thereby reducing our commission-based income. The weakness and uncertainty in the global economy have negatively impacted both corporate and consumer spending patterns and demand for travel services, globally and in India, and may continue to do so in the future. These poor economic conditions could adversely impact our growth plans, business, financial condition and results of operations.



	 



	Risks Related to Our Common Stock



	 



	There is no current trading market for our securities, and if a trading market does not develop, you may be unable to resell your shares.



	 



	Currently, we do not have an established public trading market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. We intend to seek a market maker to apply for admission to quotation of our securities on the OTC Bulletin Board. However, there can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved.  If for any reason our securities are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or a public trading market does not otherwise develop, purchasers of the securities may have difficulty selling their shares. As a result, you should purchase shares only as a long-term investment, and you must be prepared to hold your shares for an indefinite period of time.



	 





	 






	15










	 





	 



	We will require additional financing to support our operations, which financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all; any new equity financing could have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders.



	 





	We will require additional financing to sustain our business, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. We estimate that we will require approximately $1,700,000 and $5,800,000 in the next 12 and 24 months, respectively, to continue operations and to grow our business. We may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings or other third-party funding and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements to fully implement our business plan. For instance, we recently issued convertible notes, which may convert into shares of our common stock in the future. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, these new securities may contain certain rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of the shares of our common stock, which may decrease the value of your investment in our common stock. Further, if we do not complete an underwritten public offering on a national securities exchange when these convertible notes mature in 2019, we will be obligated to repay the principal amounts of these loans together with accrued interest, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we cannot obtain additional financing, we will not be able to achieve the sales growth that we need to cover our costs, and our results of operations would be negatively affected.





	 





	The reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors, which may lead to volatility and a decrease in the price of our common stock.



	 



	For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from reporting requirements that apply to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, which include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with the revised accounting standards. If investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of exemptions and reduced disclosure requirements, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile or may decrease.



	 



	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future; therefore, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.



	 




	We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.




	 



	You may be subject to Indian taxes on income arising through the sale of our common stock.



	 



	In India, the Income Tax Act (1961) provides that income arising directly or indirectly through the sale of a capital asset, including shares of a company incorporated outside of India, will be subject to tax in India, if such shares derive, directly or indirectly their value substantially from assets located in India, whether or not the seller of such shares has a residence, place of business, business connection, or any other presence in India, if, on the specified date, the value of such assets located in India (i) exceeds a specified amount, or (ii) represents at least fifty per cent of the value of all the assets owned by the company. Further, the amendment does not deal with the interplay between this provision of Indian tax law and the existing double tax avoidance treaties that India has entered into with the United States. If the Indian tax authorities determine that our common stock derives its value substantially from assets located in India and the provisions of any relevant double tax avoidance treaty are deemed to be inapplicable in this context, you may be subject to Indian income taxes on the income arising, directly or indirectly, through the sale of our common stock.



	 



	Our common stock will be and may continue to be subject to the “penny stock” rules of the SEC, which could make transactions in our common stock more cumbersome and may reduce the value of your investment in our common stock.



	 





	Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act defines a “penny stock” as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. To the extent a market develops for our common stock, we anticipate that our common stock will be, and may continue to be considered a penny stock. In order to approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.



	 





	 






	16










	 





	 



	The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and could depress the market value of our common stock, to the extent a market develops.



	 




	Shares of our common stock that have not been registered under federal securities laws are subject to resale restrictions imposed by Rule 144, including those set forth in Rule 144(i) which apply to a former “shell company.”



	 








	Prior to acquiring our Indian operating subsidiary we were a “shell company” under applicable SEC rules and regulations because we had no or nominal operations and either no or nominal assets, assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents, or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets.


	Resales pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, of the securities of a former shell company, such as us, are not permitted (i) until at least 12 months have elapsed from the April 18, 2016 initial filing of this prospectus, which reflected our status as a non-shell company and (ii) unless at the time of a proposed sale, we are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months, other than Form 8-K reports. As a result, any stockholders who receive shares in a transaction that is not registered under the Securities Act will be forced to hold their shares of our common stock for at least that 12-month period before they are eligible to sell those shares pursuant to Rule 144, and even after that 12-month period, sales may not be made under Rule 144 unless we and the selling stockholders are in compliance with other requirements of Rule 144. Further, it will be more difficult for us to raise funding to support our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities under the Securities Act, which could cause us to expend significant time and cash resources. Additionally, our previous status as a shell company could also limit our use of our securities to pay for any acquisitions we may seek to pursue in the future (although none are currently planned). The lack of liquidity of our securities as a result of the inability to sell under Rule 144 for a longer period of time than a non-former shell company could make an investment in our securities less attractive and could cause the share price of our common stock to decline.

	SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 





	This prospectus contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including: any projections of earnings, revenues or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new products, services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements may include the words “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “intend,” “continue,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan” or “anticipate” and other similar words. Such forward-looking statements may be contained in the sections “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business,” among other places in this prospectus.





	     





	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties, such as those disclosed in this prospectus. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by law.



	 



	Notwithstanding the above, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, expressly state that the safe harbor for forward looking statements does not apply to companies that issue penny stocks. Accordingly, the safe harbor for forward looking statements under the PSLRA is not currently available to the Company because we may be considered to be an issuer of penny stock.



	 



	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	 



	Following the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we intend to apply for quotation of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board. Until such time, the selling stockholders will offer shares of our common stock offered by this prospectus at a price between $0.20 to $0.30 per share. After our shares are listed on the OTC Bulletin Board, the selling stockholders will determine at what price they may sell their shares of common stock through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at market prices at the time of sale.



	 



	We determined the offering price of $0.20 to $0.30 per share based on a discounted cash flow analysis and a price-equity analysis relative to peer group companies. The analyses that we completed yielded a value within the offering price range.



	 



	The offering price of the shares of our common stock does not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value. The facts considered in determining the offering price based on the analyses above included our expected financial results, our financial condition, our cost of capital, the peer group companies we selected, the lack of an established market for our common stock and the minority interest the purchasers of our securities will hold, our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market.




	 





	DILUTION



	 



	If you purchase securities in this offering, your interest will be immediately and substantially diluted to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share of our common stock and the as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock after giving effect to this offering.




	 






	Our net tangible book value as of March 31, 2016 was approximately $(1,129,719), or approximately $(0.015) per share of common stock. After giving effect to the sale of the shares of our common stock in this offering at the assumed public offering price of $0.30 per share and after deducting the estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value at March 31, 2016 would have been approximately $(1,277,543) or approximately $(0.017) per share. This represents an immediate decrease in net tangible book value of approximately $(0.002) per share to our existing stockholders, and an immediate dilution of $(0.317) per share to investors purchasing shares in the offering.







	 




	Dilution in net tangible book value per share represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of our common stock in this offering and the net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering.



	 



	The following table illustrates the per share dilution to investors purchasing shares in the offering:

	USE OF PROCEEDS



	 



	We are registering the shares of common stock held by our selling stockholders to permit the resale of these shares of common stock by the selling stockholders after the date of this prospectus. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock offered by the selling stockholders under this prospectus.



	 



	We will bear all fees and expenses incident to our obligation to register the shares of our common stock that the stockholders are offering for resale.




	 





	MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK



	 



	Currently, there is no public market for our common stock. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, we intend to file to obtain a quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board in the future. In order to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved or that a public market will develop if our common stock is quoted.



	 



	Holders



	 







	As of July 11, 2016, there were six holders of record of our common stock. 








	 






	Dividends



	 



	We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, for the expansion and operation of our business. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future.



	 



	Convertible Securities



	 



	On February 8, 2016, we issued convertible promissory notes to three accredited investors in the aggregate principal amount of $350,000 pursuant to a note purchase agreement of the same date. The notes bear interest at an annual rate of 6%. The principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon becomes due and payable on February 8, 2019. In the event that we complete an “uplist transaction,” which is an underwritten public offering of our common stock in connection with a listing on a national securities exchange, prior to the February 8, 2019 maturity date, the outstanding principal balance of the note will automatically convert into a total of 9,156,206 shares of our common stock, which we refer to as the note shares. If the uplist transaction does not occur prior to the maturity date, the noteholders will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal balance or the note shares, each together with unpaid accrued interest paid in cash. The noteholders also will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal or the note shares, each together with accrued interest paid in cash, in connection with a “sale of the company” as such term is defined in the convertible promissory notes.



	 



	Beginning on February 9, 2017, to the extent note shares have been issued, and to the extent such note shares are not then tradeable pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act or otherwise, the noteholders may make one “demand request” for registration under the Securities Act of all or any portion of the note shares. The Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement under the Securities Act within 45 days of such demand request. The Company will bear all costs, fees and expenses associated with such demand registration statement. Notwithstanding this obligation, if in the good faith judgment of the Company’s board of directors it would be materially detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such registration statement to become effective for the reasons stated in the convertible promissory notes, the Company may defer taking action with respect to the demand registration statement for not more than 180 days after the demand request.



	 




	Pursuant to the note purchase agreement, dated February 8, 2016 as described above, on July 1, 2016, we issued an additional convertible promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000 to one of the accredited investors. The convertible note carries substantially the same terms as described above. In the event that we complete an “uplist transaction” prior to the July 1, 2019 maturity date, the outstanding principal balance of the note will automatically convert into a total of 3,924,088 note shares. Beginning on July 2, 2017, to the to the extent note shares have been issued, and to the extent such note shares are not then tradeable pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act or otherwise, the noteholder may make one “demand request” for registration under the Securities Act of all or any portion of the note shares.



	 








	Arna Global LLC, which is wholly-owned by Mr. Sharma, loaned us $956,000, which is evidenced by a convertible promissory note, dated March 8, 2016, which bears interest at an annual rate of 10%. The principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon becomes due and payable on March 7, 2019. In the event that we complete an “uplist transaction,” which is an underwritten public offering of our common stock in connection with a listing on a national securities exchange prior to the March 7, 2019 maturity date, the outstanding principal balance of the note will automatically convert into

	21,194,381

	shares of our common stock, which we refer to as the note shares. If the uplist transaction does not occur prior to the maturity date, Arna will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal balance or the note shares,

	each together with unpaid accrued interest paid in cash. Arna also will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal or the note shares, each together with accrued interest paid in cash, in connection with a “sale of the company” as such term is defined in the convertible promissory note.

	Mr. Sharma loaned us $156,407, which is evidenced by a convertible promissory note, dated March 8, 2016, which bears interest at an annual rate of 10%. The principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon becomes due and payable on March 7, 2019. In the event that we complete an “uplist transaction,” which is an underwritten public offering of our common stock in connection with a listing on a national securities exchange prior to the March 7, 2019 maturity date, the outstanding principal balance of the note will automatically convert into 3,432,234 shares of our common stock, which we refer to as the note shares. If the uplist transaction does not occur prior to the maturity date, Mr. Sharma will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal balance or the note shares,

	each together with unpaid accrued interest paid in cash. Mr. Sharma also will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal or the note shares, each together with accrued interest paid in cash, in connection with a “sale of the company” as such term is defined in the convertible promissory note.



	 




	Mr. Mandloi loaned us $38,076, which is evidenced by a convertible promissory note, dated March 8, 2016, which bears interest at an annual rate of 10%. The principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon becomes due and payable on March 7, 2019. In the event that we complete an “uplist transaction,” which is an underwritten public offering of our common stock in connection with a listing on a national securities exchange, prior to the March 7, 2019 maturity date, the outstanding principal balance of the note will automatically convert into 835,552 shares of our common stock, which we refer to as the note shares. If the uplist transaction does not occur prior to the maturity date, Mr. Mandloi will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal balance or the note shares,

	each together with unpaid accrued interest paid in cash. Mr. Mandloi also will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal or the note shares, each together with accrued interest paid in cash, in connection with a “sale of the company” as such term is defined in the convertible promissory note.



	 




	Rule 144



	 



	At this time, our stockholders may not sell shares of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act

	. As a former shell company, resales pursuant to Rule 144 are not permitted (i) until at least 12 months have elapsed from April 18, 2016, the initial filing date of this prospectus, which reflected our status as a non-shell company and (ii) unless at the time of a proposed sale, we are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months, other than Form 8-K reports. As a result, any stockholders who receive shares in a transaction that is not registered under the Securities Act will need to hold their shares of our common stock for at least such 12-month period before they are eligible to sell those shares, and even after such 12-month period, sales may not be made under Rule 144 unless we and the selling stockholders are in compliance with other requirements of Rule 144.




	 




	Equity Compensation Plan Information



	 



	As of March 31, 2016, we did not have any compensation plans, including individual compensation arrangements under which we could issue common stock.

	DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES



	 





	The following description includes the material attributes of our capital stock This description is not complete, and we qualify it by referring to our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, both of which we incorporate into this prospectus by reference.






	 




	Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue 210,000,000 shares of capital stock, divided into two classes:



	 







	 







	Ÿ








	200,000,000 shares of common stock, $.0001 par value








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.0001 par value








	 



	Common Stock



	 



	Our common stock has one vote per share. The holders of our common stock are entitled to vote on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. The holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights.



	 



	Directors are elected by a plurality vote of the shares represented in person or by proxy. All other actions by stockholders will be approved by a majority of votes cast except as otherwise required by law. Our amended and restated bylaws do not provide for cumulative voting.



	 



	The holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends ratably when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. Our common stock is not liable to further calls or assessment.  The holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights.  Our common stock cannot be redeemed, and it does not have any conversion rights or sinking fund provisions.



	 



	In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of common stock are entitled to share equally and ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the common stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption, sinking fund, or conversion rights. The outstanding shares of common stock are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.



	 



	Amendment of Bylaws



	 



	Our restated certificate of incorporation grants our board of directors the power to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws, except as otherwise set forth in the bylaws.



	 



	Effects on our Common Stock if we Issue Preferred Stock



	 



	Our board of directors has authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors has the authority to determine the terms of each series of preferred stock, within the limits of the restated certificate of incorporation and the laws of the state of Delaware. These terms include the number of shares in a series, dividend rights, liquidation preferences, terms of redemption, conversion rights and voting rights.



	 



	The issuance of any preferred stock may negatively affect the holders of our common stock. These possible negative effects include diluting the voting power of shares of our common stock and affecting the market price of our common stock.



	 





	 






	21










	 





	 



	Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws



	 



	Preferred Stock



	 



	We believe that the availability of the preferred stock under our certificate of incorporation provides us with flexibility in addressing corporate issues that may arise. Having these authorized shares available for issuance allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without the expense and delay of a special stockholders’ meeting. The authorized shares of preferred stock, as well as shares of common stock, will be available for issuance without further action by our stockholders, unless action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on which our securities may be listed. The board of directors has the power, subject to applicable law, to issue series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of the series, impede the completion of a merger, tender offer or other takeover attempt that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then prevailing market price of the stock.



	 



	Advance Notice Provisions



	 



	Our bylaws require that for a stockholder to nominate a director or bring other business before an annual meeting, the stockholder must give notice not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the prior year’s annual meeting. In the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year, or the date of the annual meeting of stockholders is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 70 days of such anniversary date, we must receive notice of such nominations or other business no later than the close of business on the 10th day after the earlier of the mailing of the notice of the annual meeting of stockholders or the day on which we first make a public announcement of the date of such meeting.



	 




	Exclusive Forum of Certain Actions



	 



	Our bylaws, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provide that derivative actions brought in the name of the Company, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware. Although we believe this provision benefits the Company and its stockholders by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors, officers and employees.



	 




	Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law



	 



	Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) provides that, subject to exceptions specified therein, an “interested stockholder” of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any “business combination,” including general mergers or consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares of the corporation, with the corporation for a three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder unless:



	 







	 







	Ÿ








	prior to such time, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an “interested stockholder,” the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding specified shares); or








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	on or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.








	 





	 






	22










	 









	Under Section 203, the restrictions described above also do not apply to specified business combinations proposed by an interested stockholder following the announcement or notification of one of specified transactions involving the corporation and a person who had not been an interested stockholder during the previous three years or who became an interested stockholder with the approval of a majority of the corporation’s directors, if such transaction is approved or not opposed by a majority of the directors who were directors prior to any person becoming an interested stockholder during the previous three years or were recommended for election or elected to succeed such directors by a majority of such directors. The restrictions described above also do not apply to specified business combinations with a person who is an “interested stockholder” prior to the time when the corporation’s common stock is listed on a national securities exchange, so these restrictions would not apply to a business combination with any person who is one of our stockholders prior to this offering.



	 



	Except as otherwise specified in Section 203, an “interested stockholder” is defined to include:



	 







	 







	Ÿ








	any person that is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and was the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation at any time within three years immediately prior to the date of determination; and








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	the affiliates and associates of any such person.








	 



	Under some circumstances, Section 203 makes it more difficult for a person who is an interested stockholder to effect various business combinations with us for a three-year period.




	 





	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION




	AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 



	You should read the following management’s discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes for TripBorn, Inc. (“TripBorn,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company”) and its operating subsidiary, Sunalpha Green Technologies Private Limited (“Sunalpha”).



	 



	The information contained below may be subject to risk factors. We urge you to review carefully the section of this prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of the risks associated with an investment in our common stock. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”



	 



	Overview



	 









	We are an online travel agency, sometimes referred to as an OTA, that offers travel reservations and related travel services to travel agents in India through our website, www.tripborn.com. Currently, we operate as a business to business, or B2B, online travel agency that serves travel agents and travel companies based in India in booking travel services and products for their customers. Through our internet-based platform, our travel agents can search and book domestic and international air tickets, hotels, vacation packages, rail tickets and bus tickets, as well as ancillary travel-related services. We serve over 650 travel agents in the Indian states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madya Pradesh. At this time, approximately 85% of our travel agents are based in Gujarat, primarily in and around the city of Ahmedabad.






	 








	 




	We are a holding company organized in Delaware in 2010. Deepak Sharma, who is an executive officer and director of the Company, formed our operating subsidiary, Sunalpha Green Technologies Private Limited under laws of the Republic of India in 2010. Sunalpha commenced operations as an OTA in India in February 2014.



	 





	Prior to acquiring Sunalpha in December 2015, we operated as a shell company with nominal or no assets or operations. We were known as PinstripesNYC, Inc. until January 2016. We filed reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) from August 2010 until we terminated the registration of our securities in May 2013. Our fiscal year ends on March 31. We refer to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 as fiscal 2016 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 as fiscal 2015.






	 




	We manage our online travel agency business through Travelcord, our proprietary internet-based online transaction platform. Through our website, www.tripborn.com, we offer a wide inventory of travel services and products to offline travel agents who serve the growing middle class of travelers in semi-urban and rural regions of India. Through our proprietary technology, we consolidate and provide our travel agents with access to travel bookings and hotel reservations that otherwise would be costly and time-consuming to obtain for their customers in an often-fragmented marketplace. While some of our more established competitors have focused on selling directly to consumers in urban areas, our travel agent partners tend to be small, brick and mortar establishments that serve travelers who rely on more personalized transactions for their travel booking needs due to language barriers and lack of access to the internet or credit cards. We have grown our operations through referrals and a focus on addressing our customers’ needs through sophisticated technology.



	 





	 






	23










	 





	 



	We generate revenue through our ticketing business, which includes rail ticketing, bus ticketing and air ticketing and our hotel reservations and vacation and business packages business. We also generate revenue by providing online payment services and access to visa processing services.



	 





	In our ticketing business, our main sources of revenue are (1) commissions and incentive payments from airline suppliers for tickets booked by our travel agent customers through our distribution channels and (2) service fees we charge our customers.






	 




	Historical Operations and Outlook



	 



	Since commencing operations as an OTA in February 2014, we have grown our business by initially processing a few transactions a day to processing approximately 450 transactions per day in March 2016. Flight searches on our website have grown from a few per day in February 2014 to over 2,000 flight searches per day in March 2016. During the fiscal year 2016, we have experienced increased traffic on our website due to our efforts in marketing and branding. We have steadily worked to add suppliers in order to provide additional services and better pricing for our travel agent customers. In the development stages, we have relied on user feedback to enhance our core technology. As internet penetration in India continues to increase, we anticipate that we will be in a position to use our established platform to offer travel services and related services directly to consumers. We believe our online platform is capable of managing hundreds of suppliers and millions of transactions in furtherance of our growth strategies.



	 





	In November 2015, we integrated the Indian Railway reservation system into our online platform using complex and scalable technology tools. Previously, we provided rail ticketing through a third party supplier. Becoming a principle agent has resulted in and will continue to result in an increase in rail ticketing revenue associated with an increase in fees associated with enrolling our travel agent customers and usage fees for ticketing. We have also experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to see, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with hiring additional personnel and expanding our marketing activities in connection with the expanded rail ticketing services as well as an increase in legal and consulting expenses associated with becoming a reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or “SEC.”






	 




	Assuming we are successful in enrolling new travel agents while retaining our existing travel agents, we anticipate that we will achieve sustainable and predictable cash flow and revenue growth, year-over-year. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our business model and achieving our operational and financial objectives.



	 





	We expect to see an increase in bookings through our website and a corresponding increase in revenue in fiscal year 2017 due to the recent expansion of our sales force and our expansion into the states of Maharashtra and Madya Pradesh. In fiscal year 2017 we expect to expand into other neighboring states in India.






	 




	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	 



	In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on revenue, income (loss) from operations and net income (loss), as well as the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. The application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us. Our management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly.  Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual results were to materially differ from these estimates, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.



	 



	Our critical accounting polices include the following:



	 




	Change in Control Transaction and Reverse Recapitalization



	 



	The audited consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and Sunalpha, our wholly owned operating subsidiary. All significant related party accounts and transactions between the Company and Sunalpha have been eliminated upon consolidation.



	 



	The Company was formed by two transactions, the first being a change in control transaction on December 8, 2015, whereby Arna Global LLC (“Arna”) received 71,428,570 shares of common stock for cash consideration of $95,500.  Arna is wholly-owned by the Company’s President and director, Deepak Sharma. Arna obtained control of 93% of the outstanding shares of common stock of PinstripesNYC, Inc. in connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement among PinstripesNYC, Inc., Arna, and Maxim Kelyfos, LLC dated December 8, 2015.  PinstripesNYC, Inc. changed its name to TripBorn, Inc. in January 2016.



	 



	In the second transaction, completed on December 14, 2015, the Company acquired substantially all of the outstanding shares of Sunalpha, which was incorporated under the laws of the Republic of India in November 2010. Sunalpha is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and TripBorn is the acquired company. Consequently, the assets, liabilities and results of operations that are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements prior to the December 14, 2015 transaction are those of Sunalpha and are recorded using the historical cost basis.

	The consolidated financial statements after completion of the December 14, 2015 transaction include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Sunalpha up to the day prior to the closing of the transaction, and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company and Sunalpha from and after the closing date of the transaction.

	Revenue Recognition




	 



	We recognize revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification  605, or “FASB ASC” 605. Revenue is recognized where there is a persuasive evidence of an arrangement in respect of services to be provided, where such services have been rendered, and the fee is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.

	 

	We recognize revenue on a gross or net basis depending upon the underlying relationship with our suppliers for particular transactions. We derive our revenue primarily from air ticketing, rail ticketing, bus ticketing, hotels and vacation packages, online payment services and commissions fees and penalties.



	 




	Air Ticketing

	. Revenue from the sale of airline tickets is recognized as an agent on a net commission earned basis, when we do not assume any performance obligation following the confirmation of the issuance of an airline ticket to the customer. In instances where we have procured coupons of airline tickets in advance for an anticipated future demand from customers, and assumes the risk of loss for tickets not used, the income from the sale of such airline tickets is accounted for on the gross basis.





	    




	Incentives from airlines are recognized when the performance obligations under the incentive programs are achieved.



	 




	Hotels.

	Revenue from hotel reservations, including commissions earned, is recognized on a net basis as an agent, on the date of check-in, when we do not assume any performance obligation following the issuance of a hotel confirmation voucher to the customer. Where we have pre-booked the hotel room for an anticipated future demand from the customer and assumes the risk for not using the available hotel room nights at its disposal, revenue from the sale of such hotel room nights is accounted for on the gross basis. Performance linked incentives from hotels are recognized as revenue on achievement of performance obligations.



	 




	Vacation Packages.

	Revenue from vacation packages, including revenue on airline tickets sold to customers as a part of vacation packages, is accounted for on the gross basis as we are determined to be the primary obligor in the arrangement i.e., the risks and responsibilities are taken by us, including the responsibility for delivery of services.



	 




	Rail Ticketing

	. Revenue from rail ticket reservations is recognized as an agent on a net commission earned basis, as we do not assume any performance obligation following the confirmation of the issuance of the ticket to the customer. We also earn one time agent sign-up fees from the railway agent at the time of agent enrollment. In the event of cancellation of rail tickets, the revenue we recognized is reversed, while fees charged to our customers for booking railway tickets are not reversed as part of the cancellation.



	 




	Other Revenue.

	Revenue from other sources, primarily comprising revenue from bus tickets reservations, visa processing, and pre-and post-paid expenses are recognized as the services are being performed. Revenue from bus ticket reservations is recognized as an agent on a net commission earned basis, as we do not assume any performance obligation following the confirmation of the issuance of the ticket to the customer.



	 



	Revenue is recognized net of cancellations, refunds, discounts and taxes. In the event of cancellation of tickets, revenue recognized with respect to gross amounts earned by us on such tickets is reversed, and we recognize a liability with respect to the refund due to our customers, net of penalties, if any. Airlines may charge penalties for cancellations. We recognize penalties we collect from our customers as income, and recognize penalties paid to the airlines or suppliers as expenses at the time of cancellation. In addition, a liability is recognized in respect of the refund due to our customers for the gross amount charged to such customers net of cancellation fees. Revenue generally is recognized (1) on the date of departure for vacation packages, (2) on the date of booking for hotel reservations and (3) on the date of ticket issuance for the sale of airline tickets. Cancellations, if any, do not impact revenue recognition since revenue is recognized upon availment of services by the customer.



	 



	Cost of Revenue



	 



	Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs paid to hotel and vacation package suppliers for the acquisition of relevant services and products for sale to customers, and includes the procurement cost of hotel rooms and other services.



	 



	Cost of revenue is the amount paid or accrued against procurement of these services and products from the respective suppliers and do not include any other operating cost to provide these services or products. Cost of revenue is recognized when incurred, which coincides with the recognition of the corresponding revenue.



	 



	Operating expenses include costs such as advertising and business promotion costs, utilities, rent, payroll and consultants fees and charges, which are recognized on an accrual basis. Depreciation and amortization costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets.




	 





	 






	25










	 





	 



	Use of Estimates



	 



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The estimates underlying the Company’s Financial Statements relate to, accruals for travel transactions, valuation of accounts receivable, useful life of long-lived assets and income taxes.



	 



	Receivables and Credit Policies



	 





	Accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms which generally range from 24 hours to seven to ten days from the time and date of transaction. Accounts receivable are stated at the amount billed to the customer. Customer account balances with invoices exceeding credit terms are considered delinquent. Payments of accounts receivable are allocated to specific invoices identified on the customer’s remittance advice or, if unspecified, are applied to the earliest unpaid invoices.




	 




	Intangible Assets



	 



	Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets that have limited useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their useful or legal lives.



	 



	Property and Equipment



	 



	Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company charges repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets to expenses as incurred.



	 



	Foreign Currency Translation



	 





	The Company translates the foreign currency financial statements into US Dollar using the year or reporting period end or average exchange rates in accordance with the requirements of ASC 830-10, Foreign Currency Matters. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect for the periods presented. The cumulative translation adjustment is included in the accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) within shareholders’ equity (deficit).

	Revenues



	 



	Net revenues for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 were $193,415, compared to $119,329 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2015. Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 primarily consisted of $119,586 from air ticketing compared to $51,723 in the prior year, $1,745 from bus ticketing compared to $147 in the prior year, $5,269 from rail ticketing compared to $0 in the prior year, ($1,941) from hotel booking compared to $4,107 in the prior year, $31,030 from vacation packages compared to $36,947 in the prior year, and $4,740 from payment services and $32,986 from incentives from our aggregators and suppliers and fees, penalty income and surcharges from our travel agent customers compared to $0 and $26,405 in the prior year, respectively. The primary driver underlying the revenue growth from air ticketing, bus ticketing, rail ticketing, payment services and incentives was an increase in the number of transactions that were processed, which resulted from our expansion efforts and the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel. The decrease of $6,048 in revenue from hotel booking resulted from an increase in costs paid to third party providers. The decrease of $5,917 in revenue from vacation packages resulted from lower sales prices for vacation packages caused by competitive pressures.

	Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit



	 



	The cost of revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, was $30,950, compared to $34,187 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2015. The cost of revenue represents fees charged by our suppliers. The decrease in cost of revenue from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 resulted from a decrease in the costs associated with the components included in our vacation packages. We plan to continue to manage our cost of revenue by optimizing pricing from our suppliers and aggregators to increase our profitability and by implementing pricing algorithms and profitability calculations.



	 



	Gross profit from revenues for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 were $162,465 compared to $85,142 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2015.



	 





	Operating Expenses



	 



	Total operating expenses for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 were $319,912 compared $85,749 for the prior period. Our operating expenses include our sales and marketing, payroll and general and administrative costs and the increase in these costs was driven by our increased headcount as we ramp up our operations. Included in our operating expenses is an increase of $129,060 in legal and consulting expenses associated with our preparation to become a reporting company with SEC.



	 



	We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to grow the business and hire experienced personnel to support our growing business and operations. Our general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase as we incur expenses associated with become a reporting company under the Exchange Act and the quotation of our shares on the OTC Bulletin Board.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 



	As of March 31, 2016, we had $251,971 in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $23,580 as of March 31, 2015. The $228,391 increase in cash was primarily driven by the sale of convertible notes. As of March 31, 2016, we had a shareholder’s equity deficit of $55,898 compared to a deficit of $4,559 in the prior year which resulted from an increase in operating losses during fiscal 2016.



	 



	We believe we have sufficient capital to continue operations through December 2016. We require additional capital to continue to fund our operations, and will look to raise funds through public and private offerings of our securities.  We estimate that we will require approximately $1.7 million and $5.8 million in the next 12 and 24 months to support our continued operations.



	 



	We took the following steps during fiscal years 2015 and 2016 to manage our liquidity, to avoid default on any material third-party obligations and to continue moving our business towards cash-flow break-even, and ultimately profitability: 



	 







	 







	Ÿ







	We continue to employ “on demand” procurement processes for travel products that we sell to our customer. We also continue our attempts to collect customer payments promptly based on their payment terms, which has helped us manage our working capital needs.







	 







	 







	Ÿ







	In order to manage our working needs, we are negotiating with our key vendors for extended payment terms for our procurement of products that we sell.







	 







	 







	Ÿ







	We raised $350,000 in the last quarter of fiscal year 2015 and an additional $150,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 pursuant to the Company’s issuance of convertible notes. The notes have a three-year term, and bear interest at the rate of six percent payable at maturity. The principal amount of each note is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at the noteholder’s option at maturity.







	 







	 







	Ÿ







	We issued convertible notes to affiliates totaling $1,150,483 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The notes have a three-year term, and bear interest at the rate of ten percent payable at maturity. The principal amount of each note is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at the noteholder’s option at maturity. One such note in the principal amount of $956,000 was issued to Arna to finance the purchase of our Travelcord software under a Software Agreement with Arna, dated as of December 16, 2015.







	 







	 







	Ÿ







	We received short term advances of $24,000 from related parties to support our working capital needs. These advances were repaid on July 11, 2016.







	 







	 







	Ÿ







	The Company expects to seek a market maker to apply for admission to quotation of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board.







	 



	There are no assurances that these steps will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing necessary to support our working capital requirements. We can also give no assurance that additional capital financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. If adequate working capital is not available, we may not be able to continue our operations or execute our business plan.



	 




	Stock Based Compensation



	 



	On April 15, 2016, we adopted the TripBorn, Inc. 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which authorized the issuance of 7,680,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other awards authorized under the terms of the plan. No awards have been issued under the Plan.



	 





	In the next six months, we anticipate awarding approximately 6,000,000 to 11,500,000 shares of time-vesting restricted stock to certain outside consultants as compensation for their services to the Company outside of the Plan. We expect the restricted stock will be subject to performance and/or time vesting.






	 




	Contractual Obligations



	 





	Our agreement with the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, or “IRCTC,” requires us to pay annual maintenance charges based on the number of active railway agents that use our rail booking services on our platform. Based on an estimate of 1,000 agents, $7,500 in annual maintenance charges will be payable for fiscal year 2016. We estimate that $15,000 in annual maintenance charges will be payable for fiscal year 2017. Currently, we have enrolled approximately 120 agents to use the railway booking services on our platform.






	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 





	As of March 31, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

	Operating Metrics




	 




	In evaluating our business, we use operating metrics, including gross bookings and revenue margin. Gross bookings is a measure of total dollar volume of transactions that we process. This metric is an operating metric used by management, the investor community, and analysts who follow the travel industry to measure our market share and to measure our scale and growth. We calculate revenue margin as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings.

	The number of transactions processed by the Company increased by 68,251 in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 as the Company began selling rail tickets, significantly increased its air ticketing business and entered more markets. Corresponding with the increase in the number of transactions processed, the amount of gross bookings increased. The decrease in the Company’s revenue margin is driven primarily by the increase in the sale of rail tickets that have a lower margin than our other revenue streams.

	BUSINESS



	 



	Overview




	 





	We are an online travel agency, sometimes referred to as an OTA, that offers travel reservations and related travel services to travel agents in India through our website, www.tripborn.com. Currently, we operate as a business to business, or B2B, online travel agency that serves travel agents and travel companies based in India in booking travel services and products for their customers. Through our internet-based platform, our travel agents can search and book domestic and international air tickets, hotels, vacation packages, rail tickets and bus tickets, as well as ancillary travel-related services. We serve approximately 650 travel agents in the Indian states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madya Pradesh. At this time, approximately 85% of our travel agents are based in Gujarat, primarily in and around the city of Ahmedabad. We plan to expand our presence throughout pan-India as opportunities present, with an immediate focus on the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi and Madya Pradesh.



	 






	 


	 




	We are a holding company organized in Delaware in 2010. Our President and director, Deepak Sharma formed our operating subsidiary, Sunalpha Green Technologies Private Limited under laws of the Republic of India in 2010. Sunalpha commenced operations as an OTA in India in February 2014.



	 



	We engineered our internet-based platform, Travelcord using multiple systems platforms with an emphasis on scalability, performance and reliability. We integrated other software platforms, applications and database systems into Travelcord. We designed these internal platforms to include open application protocol interfaces that can provide connectivity to our travel services suppliers. Our travel services suppliers include aggregators and individual providers, such as individual hotels. Our applications use secure communications and transactions, as appropriate.



	 



	Our Market



	 



	India’s rapidly growing economy and rising middle class are driving growth in India’s travel and tourism industry. According to the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”), India’s gross domestic product (“GDP”) grew at an estimated 7.3% in 2015 and is projected to grow by 7.3% and 7.5% in each of 2016 and 2017. In 2011, the National Council for Applied Economic Research estimated that the Indian middle class would grow from 160 million people in 2011 to 267 million people in 2016 and would reach 547 million people by 2026. According to the IMF, nominal per capital income of the Indian population also is increasing. All of these factors tend to increase discretionary spending in areas such as travel and leisure. According to Word Travel & Tourisms Council’ Economic Impact 2015, the travel and tourism sector in India has been increasingly contributing to overall GDP. Domestic tourists accounted for over 80% of the spending in 2015.



	 





	 






	30










	 





	 



	Although internet penetration and use of debit and credit cards is rapidly increasing, India continues to have a significant unbanked population, particularly outside of urban areas. According to the Reserve Bank of India, approximately 40% of households do not have access to banking services. According to India’s 2011 Census, 69% of India’s population lives in rural areas, while 5% live in semi-urban areas. In addition, lower internet penetration and literacy rates in more rural areas mean that OTAs are unable to reach a significant portion of the population directly. Due to a combination of these factors, semi-urban and rural travelers are more likely to require an intermediary to book travel related services and products.



	 



	Our Strategy



	 



	We manage our online travel agency business through Travelcord, our proprietary internet-based online transaction platform. Through our website, www.tripborn.com, we offer a wide inventory of travel services and products to offline travel agents who serve the growing middle class of travelers in semi-urban and rural regions of India. Using our proprietary technology, we consolidate and provide our travel agents with access to travel bookings and hotel reservations that otherwise would be costly and time-consuming to obtain for their customers in an often fragmented marketplace. While some of our more established competitors have focused on selling directly to consumers in urban areas, our travel agent partners tend to be small, brick and mortar establishments that serve travelers who rely on more personalized transactions for their travel booking needs due to language barriers and lack of access to the internet or credit cards. We have grown our operations through referrals and a focus on addressing our customers’ needs through sophisticated technology. In the development stages, we have relied on user feedback to enhance our core technology. As internet penetration in India continues to increase, we anticipate that we will be in a position to use our established platform to offer travel services and products directly to consumers.



	 



	Corporate History



	 




	TripBorn, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Delaware in January 2010. We operated as a shell company with nominal or no assets or operations until December 2015 when we acquired our Indian operating subsidiary, Sunalpha Green Technologies Private Limited, or “Sunalpha.” We were known as PinstripesNYC, Inc. until January 2016. We filed reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) from August 2010 until we terminated the registration of our securities in May 2013. In December 2015, Sachin Mandloi and Arna Global LLC, which is wholly-owned by Deepak Sharma acquired 93% of our outstanding common stock in a private transaction. Mr. Sharma formed Sunalpha under the laws of India in 2010. Sunalpha began operations as an online travel agency known as Tripborn in February 2014. Our principal executive offices are located at 812 Venus Atlantis Corporate Park, Near Prahalad Nagar Garden, Satellite, Ahmedabad 380 015, and our telephone number is 91 079-4019914. Our website address is www.tripborn.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and are not considered part of, this prospectus. You should not rely on any information on our website in making your decision to purchase our common stock

	Our Services and Products



	 



	Our internet-based platform at www.tripborn.com provides our participating travel agents, travel managers, arrangers and corporations with the ability to quickly search and book the services described below for their offline customers. Many of our arrangements with our suppliers are informal and provide our counterparties with the ability to terminate or suspend the arrangements with little or no notice. Our arrangements with our suppliers with respect to the terms of our sales targets, incentives, commissions and discounts often are subject to change at the discretion of our supplier and are negotiated periodically on a quarterly or yearly basis, if not more frequently. We also typically pay fees to our travel suppliers to directly connect into their booking systems on an initial and/or ongoing basis.



	 



	Air ticketing



	 



	Our travel agent customers can book domestic or international flights through our website. We have agreements with India’s three domestic low cost carriers. In addition, through our website we offer our travel agents access to international air tickets to destinations worldwide as an approved agent of the International Association of Travel Agents, or “IATA,” and through our aggregators, which have agreed to provide us with access to their airline ticket inventory.



	 



	Our platform at www.tripborn.com allows our customers to search for available tickets based on their customers’ requirements. Our platform quickly processes the available inventory of our aggregators and suppliers and displays the results, including availability, schedules and prices. The prices displayed include the commission that our customers will earn on the ticket sales.



	 





	 






	31










	 





	 



	We typically procure tickets from our suppliers and sell them to our travel agent customers. We earn revenue by charging a markup or adding fees to the ticket price and by charging booking fees, service charges and/or payment gateway charges for using our website. We also receive revenue from our suppliers by earning incentives and/or commissions based on the volume of tickets we purchase from our suppliers. We may pre-purchase blocks of air tickets from our suppliers and hold them to resell within specified time periods. If we are not able to sell these pre-purchased tickets, we recognize a loss. We also may pay in advance for air tickets to receive a discount on purchases from our suppliers. These advance payments are credited toward future air ticket sales.



	 



	Hotel reservations



	 



	We offer access to reservations with 400,000 hotels across the world, including hotels in India through aggregators who we have directly connected into our booking system. Our platform allows our travel agent customers to meet their customers’ needs by searching for hotel availability by location and sorting search results by star ratings and price. Our search results include photos and descriptions of the hotels’ amenities. We arrange for hotel bookings for our travel agent customers by securing the booking at base rates and earn revenue by including a markup or fees on the rates billed to our travel agent customers and by charging booking fees, service charges and/or payment gateway charges for using our website. We also may earn incentives and/or commissions from our suppliers for completing bookings. In some cases, our employees may arrange for hotel bookings directly with individual hotels. In addition, we may pre-purchase blocks of reservations from our suppliers and hold them to resell within specified time periods. If we are not able to sell these reservations, we recognize a loss.



	 



	Bus ticketing



	 




	Our travel agent customers can book bus tickets on our website through an aggregator that is directly connected into our booking system. Our platform consolidates ticketing for largely unorganized regional bus services for the benefit of our travel agents and their customers. As a value added service, our platform allows travel agents to select specific seats by gender, which is of interest to their Indian customers

	.  We may also procure bus tickets offline from individual bus operators for our travel agent customers. We procure bus tickets for our travel agent customers at base rates and earn revenue by including a markup or fees on the tickets. We also earn incentives and commissions from our supplier for completing bookings.



	 



	Rail ticketing



	 



	We are a B2B Principal Agent of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, or IRCTC, which is a government entity that allows us to offer reservations through Indian Railways’ passenger reservation system on our webpage. Indian Railways is India’s state-owned railway, which owns and operates most of India’s rail transportation. We have integrated our system with IRCTC’s to provide a seamless booking process for our travel agents. According to the 2014-15 annual report of the Ministry of Railways, Indian Railways carries approximately 23 million passengers daily. Rail travel is the primary mode of transportation for Indians, particularly in rural areas.



	 



	As a Principal Agent, we enroll our travel agent customers to book rail tickets for their customers through our platform. We earn revenue by collecting enrollment fees from our travel agent customers, by collecting service charges on each seat booked and by collecting payment gateway charges on the amount of the transaction. The IRCTC determines ticket prices and the maximum amount of the service charge (currently, between approximately $0.30 and $0.60 per ticket). We also may charge our travel agent customers a fee based on the percentage of the transaction value for payment gateway charges (currently, up to two percent).



	 



	Our agreement with IRCTC provides for a one-year term that expires in October 2016. IRCTC may terminate or temporarily suspend the agreement without prior notice..



	 



	Visa processing



	 



	Through third parties, we can arrange for visa processing as an ancillary service for the customers of our travel agents. We pay our suppliers for the service and collect fees from our travel agent customers.



	 





	 






	32










	 





	 



	Vacation packages



	 



	Our travel agent partners can search our platform for available vacation packages or submit inquiries regarding their customers’ preferences to be fulfilled by us and/or our third-party suppliers. Our call center also is available to our customers to facilitate these requests. We arrange for vacation package bookings for our travel agent customers by securing the booking at base rates and earn revenue by including a markup or fees on the rates billed to our travel agent customers and by charging booking fees, service charges and/or payment gateway charges for using our website. We also may earn incentives and/or commissions from our suppliers for completing bookings. In addition, we may create packages based on our travel agent customers’ specifications by purchasing the components of the package from our suppliers as necessary.



	 



	Pre- and post-paid services and utilities



	 



	As a value-added service, our travel agents may use our internet platform to pay make pre- and post-paid mobile payments and payments for television service and data cards on behalf of their customers. We pay our suppliers for the services and earn a commission as a percentage of the price of the services. We also pass a service charge on to our travel agent customers.



	 



	White label solution



	 



	Through our internet platform, we provide white label travel solutions that allow our travel agents to use their own branded platform for customer use. Agents that take advantage of this service of ours may offer tickets and reservations through their own branded website powered by our platform and can issue tickets that include their own logos.



	 



	Distribution



	 



	Our travel agent customers search and book travel services and products for their clients through our internet-based platform at www.tripborn.com. Our sales and marketing team enrolls the new agents and distributors. We train these agents to use our systems and processes. The travel agents can enroll with us to access some or all of the booking services available on our platform. For example, some agents may choose only to access rail ticketing, while others may choose to access our entire offering of services. We do not have formal arrangements with our travel agent customers, but we evaluate each travel agent customer prior to enrolling them into our system to assess their credit-worthiness and negotiate payment terms. We require our travel agent customers to provide payment for services booked through us from within 24 hours to as many as seven to ten days. We also charge our travel agent customers a one-time enrollment fee.



	 



	We engineered our internet-based platform using multiple systems platforms with an emphasis on scalability, performance and reliability to ensure our platform is always available for our customers. We primarily host our systems infrastructure and web and database servers of our operations in the United Kingdom through IBM, which provides network connectivity, networking infrastructure, uninterruptable power supply and 24-hour monitoring and engineering support typical of hosted data centers. All data center facilities have a continuous power supply system, generators, redundant servers and multiple back-up systems. Although we take steps to mitigate the effects of any loss or reduction in service at one of our hosting facilities, if a hosting facility were inaccessible or otherwise experienced a disruption in service for any reason, we could experience a disruption to our services, loss of transactions and revenue and consumer complaints.



	 



	We also maintain a call center to provide customer support and troubleshooting solutions.



	 



	Sales and Marketing



	 



	We facilitate the sale of third parties’ travel services and products through our internet website to largely offline travel agents, who book hotels and tickets for their customers. In the past 16 months, we have built a network of over 650 travel agents by reputation and word of mouth. Our travel agents primarily are based in and around the city of Ahmedabad in Gurjarat, but also operate in the states of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madya Pradesh. We are expanding our sales team and hiring employees to expand our marketing and sales efforts.



	 





	Competition



	 



	The market for travel services and products in India is highly competitive. We currently compete with both established and other emerging providers of travel services and products, including other online travel agencies, as well as traditional travel agencies, tour operators, travel suppliers and operators of travel industry reservation databases. Large, established internet search engines have also launched applications offering travel itineraries in destinations around the world, and meta-search companies who can aggregate travel search results also compete with us for customers.



	 



	Established OTAs such as makemytrip.com, cleartrip.com, expedia.co.in, travelocity.co.in, yatra.com, goibibo.com, booking.com and agoda.com have achieved strong brand recognition and reliability in India. Since the travel industry is a high-volume, low-margin business, it can be difficult for emerging participants, such as us to capture a meaningful share of the market from OTAs with established brands and resources. We intend to build our brand in the underserved rural and semi-rural markets through our superior service-oriented travel portal. We believe that being a later market entrant allows us to develop a superior platform with up-to-date technologies.



	 





	 






	33










	 





	 



	Certain of our travel suppliers have also been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and decreasing or eliminating their dependence on third-party distributors like us. For instance, many low-cost airlines may, subject to applicable regulations, reduce or eliminate commissions to agents such as us or restrict the amount of service fees we are able to charge customers. Suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such as their own bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive to customers than offerings like ours. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Industry — The travel industry in India is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.”



	 



	Intellectual Property



	 



	We manage our online travel agency business through Travelcord, our proprietary internet-based online transaction platform. Under a Software Agreement with our affiliate, Arna Global LLC, dated December 16, 2015 (the “Software Agreement”), we acquired Arna’s ownership and development rights with respect to Travelcord, which rights Arna acquired under a Software Development Agreement, dated January 26, 2015 with Takniki Communications (the “Software Development Agreement”), which is owned by our director, Sachin Mandloi. Under this Software Development Agreement, Takniki Communications agreed to develop Travelcord and provide support for a maximum fee of $906,000. In turn, Arna licensed Travelcord to Sunalpha under a Software Licensing Agreement dated April 1, 2015 (the “Software Licensing Agreement”). Following our acquisition of Sunalpha, Arna assigned its ownership rights in Travelcord under the Software Development Agreement to us pursuant to the Software Agreement dated December 16, 2015. Under the Software Agreement, Arna also transferred its right to license the software to Sunalpha under the Software Licensing Agreement. As a result of these transactions, we agreed to pay Arna $956,000 for Travelcord, which we provided in the form of a convertible promissory note. By virtue of a letter agreement, we license Travelcord to our operating subsidiary, Sunalpha as licensor under the Software Licensing Agreement. Sunalpha has agreed to pay us a one-time implementation and customization user fee of $956,000 and a fee of $215,000 for each five-year term under the Software Licensing Agreement.



	 



	We rely on confidentiality and non-compete agreements and provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. We have applied for trademark registration in India for our name, TripBorn.




	 





	Employees



	 



	We currently have 25 employees based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe that we have satisfactory employee relations. 



	 



	Government Regulation



	 



	In the United States and India, we are subject to or affected by international, federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies, including anti-bribery rules, trade sanctions, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, which are constantly subject to change. In addition, certain government trade sanctions affect our ability to operate in Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Syria and the Ukraine. The descriptions of the laws, regulations and policies that follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the laws and regulations. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws, regulations and policies that affect our businesses.



	 



	We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws, regulations and policies. Although we cannot predict the effect of changes to the existing laws, regulations and policies or of the proposed laws, regulations and policies that are described below, we are not aware of proposed changes or proposed new laws, regulations and policies that will have a material adverse effect on our business.



	 



	Under the Indian Information Technology Act, 2000, as amended, we are subject to civil liability to compensate for wrongful loss or gain to any person arising from negligence in implementing and maintaining reasonable security practices and procedures with respect to sensitive personal data or information that we possess, deal with or handle in our computer systems, networks, databases and software. India has also implemented privacy laws, including the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011, which impose limitations and restrictions on the collection, use and disclosure of personal information.



	 



	The consolidated foreign direct investment policy, or the “FDI Policy,” issued by the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Government of India and the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, as amended, and the regulations framed thereunder, or the “FEMA,” regulates foreign investment in India. In addition, the regulations have certain requirements with respect to downstream investments by Indian companies that are owned or controlled by foreign entities, as well as investments and acquisition by foreign entities in certain sectors with caps on foreign investments. These requirements currently include restrictions on issuances, pricing and valuation of shares of Indian companies and sources of funding for such investments, which may, in certain cases, require prior notice to or approval of the Government of India.

	The Companies Act, 2013 and the rules thereunder, or the “new Companies Act,” which has recently been enacted, contains significant changes to Indian company law, including in relation to the issue of capital by companies, related party transactions, corporate governance, audit matters, shareholder class actions, restrictions on the number of layers of subsidiaries, corporate social responsibility spending and a penal provision with respect to non-compliance with the provisions of the new Companies Act. While several provisions of the new Companies Act are currently effective, the existing Companies Act, 1956 remains in effect with respect to other provisions.



	 



	We operate in jurisdictions in which local business practices may be inconsistent with international regulatory requirements, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery regulations prescribed under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which, among other things, prohibits giving or offering to give anything of value with the intent to influence the awarding of Government contracts. Also India’s Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2013, (“PCA”) prohibits giving bribe to a public servant. Although we believe that we have adequate policies and enforcement mechanisms to ensure legal and regulatory compliance with the FCPA, PCA and other similar regulations, it is possible that some of our employees, subcontractors, agents or partners may violate any such legal and regulatory requirements, which may expose us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including penalties. To help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, we have adopted specific risk management and compliance practices and policies, including a specific policy addressing the FCPA.



	 



	The United States maintains trade and economic sanctions with respect to various foreign countries, individuals, and entities worldwide. Among other things, these sanctions prohibit most transactions by U.S. persons relating to Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan. The sanctions also restrict U.S. persons in their transactions and dealings with various individuals and entities considered Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.

	PROPERTIES



	 



	We lease approximately 2,455 square feet of office space for our principal executive officers in Ahmedabad. Currently, our President, Chief Executive Officer and director, Deepak Sharma leases this space to us at no charge. As of March 2016, we also lease approximately 2,300 square feet of office space for our call center and operations in Ahmedabad. We believe these properties suit our operations and business needs.




	 





	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	 



	We are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings. From time-to-time we anticipate we will be involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business and otherwise. The ultimate costs to resolve any such matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. We could be forced to incur material expenses with respect to these legal proceedings, and in the event there is an outcome in any that is adverse to us, our financial position and prospects could be harmed.

	N/A














	The following includes a brief biography for each of our directors and executive officers, with each director biography including information regarding the experiences, qualifications, attributes or skills that caused our board of directors to determine that each member of our board of directors should serve as a director as of the date of this prospectus. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers.




	 




	Deepak Sharma

	has served as our President, Chief Executive Officer and a director since December 2015. He served as our Chief Financial Officer from December 2015 to May 2016. Mr. Sharma founded our Indian operating subsidiary, Sunalpha and has been serving as its managing director and President of Sunalpha since 2010. Mr. Sharma is the President of Alphatech Systems and Consulting Inc., an information technology service company that he founded in 2006. Alphatech provides customer solutions including software development and maintenance services.



	 





	 






	35










	 





	 



	The board of directors believes that Mr. Sharma’s institutional knowledge as a founder of the company as well as his experience in business development and software product development are crucial to successfully growing our business.



	 




	Sachin Mandloi

	has served as our Vice President and a director since December 2015. Mr. Mandloi is responsible for technology development, quality assurance and product delivery. Mr. Mandloi is the founder and president of Takniki Communications, an information technology service company formed under the laws of the Republic of India that provides information technology solutions, including software development and maintenance services. Mr. Mandloi has served as the president of Takniki Communications since he founded it in 1998. Mr. Mandloi has served as a director of our Indian operating subsidiary, Sunalpha since 2014.



	 



	The board of directors believes that Mr. Mandloi’s experience in software development and maintenance in India, as well as his in-depth knowledge of digital marketing and data analytics are crucial to successfully growing our business.



	 




	Richard J. Shaw

	has served as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer since May 2016. Mr. Shaw has served as the President of LogiCore Strategies, LLC, a financial and business advisory services firm since June 2014. Mr. Shaw also has served as Chief Financial Officer of BirchBioMed, Inc., a clinical-stage biomedical company focused on the commercialization, clinical evaluation and development of anti-scarring drugs, autoimmune therapeutics/therapies and novel strategies for transplantation, since March 2016. In addition, Mr. Shaw has served as Chief Operating Officer of Roberts Office Furniture Concepts, a designer, manufacturer and remanufacturer of sustainable office furniture and workplace systems, since September 2013. Previously, Mr. Shaw served as Chief Financial Officer of High Peaks Hospitality, LLC, an independent hotel ownership, development construction and management company from June 2012 to August 2013, and Chief Financial Officer of Harden Furniture, Inc., a manufacturer of solid wood furniture and upholstery from May 2008 to June 2012. Mr. Shaw is a Certified Public Accountant, licensed by the State of New York.



	 



	We are not party to any employment agreements or other agreements with Messrs. Sharma and Mandloi that prevent them from providing similar services to other companies in our industry, which could potentially give rise to a conflict of interest if they chose to offer their services to a competitor. However, under Delaware law, as directors, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Mandloi owe a duty of loyalty to our stockholders, which places limits on their ability to enter into transactions that conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In the event that Mr. Sharma or Mr. Mandloi left the Company, they would not be prevented from participating in a venture or business that competes with us.



	 



	At this time, we are not required to and do not have any committees of the board of directors.

	DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE



	 



	Although our shares are not listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market or any other exchange, we use the independence standards of the NASDAQ Listing Rules in evaluating the independence of our directors. Our directors, Deepak Sharma and Sachin Mandloi do not meet the definition of “independent directors” as that term is defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules due to their relationships with the Company as founders of our Indian operating subsidiary. In the future, if we list our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we will be required to have a majority of independent directors and we intend to comply with applicable requirements relating to director independence in connection with such listing.




	 





	EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION



	 



	In compliance with Instruction 4 to Item 402(m) of regulation S-K, we have omitted the Summary Compensation, Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End and Director Compensation tables because we did not award or pay, and our named executive officers and directors did not otherwise earn, any compensation with respect to our last two fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015. Our named executive officers are Deepak Sharma, Sachin Mandloi and Clifford Teller. Mr. Sharma serves as our President, Chief Executive Officer and director and Sachin Mandloi serves as our Vice President and director. Prior to our acquisition by Arna Global LLC in December 2015, Clifford Teller served as our President and sole director.



	 



	Effective May 24, 2016, we entered into a consulting agreement with LogiCore Strategies, LLC, pursuant to which Richard J. Shaw serves as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. The Company compensates LogiCore for Mr. Shaw’s time as an independent contractor at an annual rate of $60,000. The Company will reimburse Mr. Shaw for reasonable travel expenses. The consulting agreement has a one-year term that is automatically renewable for subsequent one year terms unless terminated by either party.




	 





	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS



	 



	In the course of our development, we have participated in transactions with Deepak Sharma and Sachin Mandloi. Mr. Sharma is the founder and Messrs. Sharma and Mandloi are executive officers and directors of our Indian operating subsidiary, Sunalpha. In addition, Messrs. Sharma and Mandloi have been executive officers and directors of TripBorn since December 2015.



	 



	On December 8, 2015, Arna Global LLC, or “Arna,” purchased 71,428,570 shares of our common stock in a private transaction for an aggregate purchase price of $95,500. On that date, these shares represented 71% of our authorized share capital and 93% of our common stock outstanding. Arna is a Delaware limited liability company whose sole member is Deepak Sharma. Immediately prior to the purchase, Maxim Kelyfos, LLC was the beneficial owner of 93% of our outstanding common stock.



	 



	On December 14, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the outstanding shares of Sunalpha from Mr. Mandloi for $95,835.



	 



	The above transactions were effected to incorporate our business in the state of Delaware. Therefore, neither Mr. Sharma nor Mr. Mandloi had a quantifiable interest in these transactions.



	 



	On December 16, 2015, Arna entered into a software agreement with us whereby we succeeded to the rights of Arna with respect to our proprietary software pursuant to a Software Development Services Agreement between Takniki Communications and Arna. Mr. Mandloi is the founder and President of Takniki Communications. Pursuant to this Software Agreement, Arna assigned its rights to the developed software, any further development with respect to the software and its rights as licensor of the software to Sunalpha. In consideration for the assignment, we agreed to pay Arna $956,000, which is evidenced by a convertible promissory note described below.



	 



	Arna loaned us $956,000, which is evidenced by a convertible promissory note, dated March 8, 2016, which bears interest at an annual rate of 10%. The principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon becomes due and payable on March 7, 2019. In the event that we complete an “uplist transaction,” which is an underwritten public offering of our common stock in connection with a listing on a national securities exchange prior to the March 7, 2019 maturity date, the outstanding principal balance of the note will automatically convert into 21,194,381 shares of common stock, which we refer to as the note shares. If the uplist transaction does not occur prior to the maturity date, Arna will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal balance or the note shares, each together with accrued unpaid interest paid in cash. Arna also will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal or the note shares, each together with accrued unpaid interest paid in cash, in connection with a “sale of the company” as such term is defined in the convertible promissory note.



	 



	Mr. Sharma loaned us $156,407, which is evidenced by a convertible promissory note, dated March 8, 2016, which bears interest at an annual rate of 10%. The principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon becomes due and payable on March 7, 2019. In the event that we complete an “uplist transaction,” which is an underwritten public offering of our common stock in connection with a listing on a national securities exchange prior to the March 7, 2019 maturity date, the outstanding principal balance of the note will automatically convert into 3,432,234 shares of common stock, which we refer to as the note shares. If the uplist transaction does not occur prior to the maturity date, Mr. Sharma will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal balance or the note shares, each together with accrued unpaid interest paid in cash. Mr. Sharma also will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal or the note shares, each together with accrued unpaid interest paid in cash, in connection with a “sale of the company” as such term is defined in the convertible promissory note.



	 





	 






	37










	 





	 



	Mr. Mandloi loaned us $38,076, which is evidenced by a convertible promissory note, dated March 8, 2016, which bears interest at an annual rate of 10%. The principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon becomes due and payable on March 7, 2019. In the event that we complete an “uplist transaction,” which is an underwritten public offering of our common stock in connection with a listing on a national securities exchange, prior to the March 7, 2019 maturity date, the outstanding principal balance of the note will automatically convert into 835,552 shares of common stock, which we refer to as the note shares. If the uplist transaction does not occur prior to the maturity date, Mr. Mandloi will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal balance or the note shares, each together with accrued unpaid interest paid in cash. Mr. Mandloi also will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal or the note shares, each together with accrued unpaid interest paid in cash, in connection with a “sale of the company” as such term is defined in the convertible promissory note.



	 



	We lease approximately 2,455 square feet of office space for our principal executive officers in Ahmedabad. Currently, our President, Chief Executive Officer and director, Deepak Sharma owns the premises and leases this space to us at no charge. If and when our operations become profitable, we expect to enter into a lease agreement to pay market-based rent for the space. We have no immediate plans to enter into a lease agreement with Mr. Sharma.



	 



	Mr. Sharma’s deposits with IndusInd Bank Ltd. serve as collateral for a guarantee in the amount of $50,000 in favor of the IATA on behalf of our operating subsidiary, Sunalpha. IndusInd Bank Ltd. will pay the guaranteed amount for claims through September 30, 2016.



	 



	We entered into a consulting agreement effective May 24, 2016 with LogiCore Strategies, LLC (“LogiCore”), pursuant to which Richard J. Shaw serves as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. The Company compensates LogiCore for Mr. Shaw’s time at an annual rate of $60,000. Mr. Shaw wholly owns LogiCore. His interest in the transaction is $60,000.







	We received an advance of $2,501 from Mr. Sharma and $21,457 from Arna, which is wholly-owned by Mr. Sharma, for working capital expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We repaid the advances as of July 11, 2016.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	 



	The selling stockholders may sell some or all of their shares at prices ranging from $0.20-$0.30 per share until our shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. Prior to being quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, the selling stockholders may sell their shares in private transactions to other individuals. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, we intend to file to obtain a quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board in the future. In order to be quoted on the OTCBB, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved.



	 



	Once a market has developed for our common stock, the shares may be sold or distributed from time to time by the selling stockholders, directly to one or more purchasers or through brokers or dealers who act solely as agents, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices, at negotiated prices or at fixed prices, which may be changed. The distribution of the shares may be effected in one or more of the following methods:



	 







	 







	Ÿ








	ordinary brokers transactions, which may include long or short sales;








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	transactions involving cross or block trades on any securities market where our common stock is trading








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	through direct sales to purchasers or sales effected through agents;








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	privately negotiated transactions;








	 





	 






	39










	 





	 







	 







	Ÿ








	any combination of the foregoing; or








	 







	 







	Ÿ








	any other method permitted by law








	 



	In addition, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers who may engage in short sales, if short sales were permitted, of shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume with the selling stockholders. The selling security holders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers that require the delivery by such broker-dealers of the shares, which shares may be resold thereafter pursuant to this prospectus.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 






	The Board of Directors and Stockholders




	Tripborn, Inc.:







	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tripborn, Inc. (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits

	.




	 



	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.



	 



	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	TRIPBORN, INC.







	Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements




	March 31, 2016 and 2015



	 



	1.           

	Organization and the Nature of Business




	 



	TripBorn, Inc. (“TripBorn” or the “Company”) is a business to business online travel agency (“OTA”) that offers travel reservations and related travel services and products to travel agents in India through its proprietary internet-based platform at www.tripborn.com. TripBorn is a holding company that was incorporated in Delaware in January 2010 and operated as a shell company with nominal or no assets or operations until December 2015 when it acquired substantially all of the outstanding common stock of its operating subsidiary, Sunalpha Green Technologies Private Limited (“Sunalpha”). The Company has selected March 31 as its fiscal year end.



	 



	TripBorn was known as PinstripesNYC, Inc. until January 2016. TripBorn filed reports as PinstripesNYC, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act from August 2010 until it terminated its registration under the Exchange Act in May 2013.



	 



	On December 14, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sunalpha, which is incorporated under the laws of the Republic of India on November 4, 2010. The transaction is being accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Sunalpha is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and TripBorn is the acquired company.



	 



	2.           

	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	 



	Accounting Policies



	 



	These financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) as detailed in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”).



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 



	The acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Sunalpha by TripBorn on December 14, 2015 is being accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Sunalpha is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and TripBorn is the acquired company. Consequently, the assets, liabilities and results of operations that are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements prior to the December 14, 2015 transaction are those of Sunalpha and are recorded using the historical cost basis. The consolidated financial statements after completion of the December 14, 2015 transaction include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Sunalpha up to the day prior to the closing of the transaction, and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company and Sunalpha from and after the closing of the transaction on December 14, 2015. All significant related party accounts and transactions between the Company and Sunalpha have been eliminated upon consolidation.



	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 




	The Company provides travel products and services to leisure and corporate travelers in India and abroad. The revenue from rendering these services is recognized at the time when significant risk and rewards are transferred to the customer. This is generally the case: 1) on the date of departure for vacation packages, 2) on the date of check in for hotel booking business and 3) on the date of issuance for the sale of airline tickets.




	 



	Revenue from the sale of airline tickets is recognized as an agent on a net commission earned basis, when the Company does not assume any performance obligation following the confirmation of the issuance of an airline ticket to the customer. In instances where the Company has procured coupons of airline tickets in advance for an anticipated future demand from customers, and assumes the risk of loss for tickets not used, the revenue from the sale of such airline tickets is accounted for on the gross basis.



	 



	Incentives from airlines are recognized when the performance obligations under the incentive programs are achieved.



	 



	Revenue from hotel reservations, including commissions earned is recognized on a net basis as an agent, on the date of check-in, when the Company does not assume any performance obligation following the issuance of a hotel confirmation voucher to the customer. Where the Company has pre-booked the hotel room for an anticipated future demand from the customers and assumes the risk for not using the available hotel room nights at its disposal, revenue from the sale of such hotel room nights is accounted for on the gross basis. Performance linked incentives from hotels are recognized as income on achievement of performance obligations.



	 



	Revenue from vacation packages, including income on airline tickets sold to customers as a part of vacation packages, is accounted for on the gross basis as the Company is determined to be the primary obligor in the arrangement i.e., the risks and responsibilities are taken by the Company, including the responsibility for delivery of services.



	 



	Revenue from other sources, primarily comprising revenue from rail and bus ticket reservations is recognized as the services are being performed. Revenue from the rail and bus ticket reservations is recognized as an agent on a net commission earned basis, as the Company does not assume any performance obligation following the confirmation of the issuance of the ticket to the customer.



	 





	 






	F-6










	 





	 



	Revenue is recognized net of cancellations, refunds, discounts and taxes. In the event of cancellation of tickets, revenue recognized with respect to commissions earned by the Company on such tickets is reversed and is netted against the revenue earned during the fiscal period, at the time the cancellation is made by the customer. In addition, a liability is recognized in respect to the refund due to the customers for the gross amount charged to such customers net of cancellation fees. The revenue from the sale of vacation packages and hotel reservations is recognized on the customer’s departure and check-in dates, respectively. Cancellations, if any, do not impact revenue recognition since revenue is recognized upon the availment of services by the customer.



	 



	Cost of Revenue



	 



	Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs paid to hotel and vacation package suppliers for the acquisition of relevant services and products for sale to customers, and includes the procurement cost of hotel rooms and other services.



	 



	Cost of revenue is the amount paid or accrued against procurement of these services and products from the respective suppliers and do not include any other operating cost to provide these services or products. Cost of revenue is recognized when incurred, which coincides with the recognition of the corresponding revenue.



	 



	Operating Expenses



	 



	Operating expenses include costs such as advertising and business promotion costs, utilities, rent, payroll and consultants fees and charges, which are recognized on an accrual basis. Depreciation and amortization costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets.



	 



	Use of Estimates



	 



	The preparation of financial statements in US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The estimates underlying the Company’s Financial Statements relate to, accruals for travel transactions, valuation of accounts receivable, useful life of long-lived assets and income taxes.



	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 



	The Company considers all highly-liquid investments (including money market funds) with an original maturity at acquisition of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances, which may exceed federally insured limits. The Company does not believe that this results in any significant credit risk.







	Sunalpha has six accounts denominated in Indian Rupees. As of March 31, 2016, the cash balance in financial institutions in India was USD $163,138. The transactions are undertaken in Indian Rupees and results in foreign currency translation adjustment. The Company’s cash deposits in India are not insured against loss. The Company does not believe that this results in any significant credit risk.



	 



	Receivables and Credit Policies



	 



	Accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms which generally range from 24 hours to seven to ten days from the time and date of transaction. Accounts receivable are stated at the amount billed to the customer. Customer account balances with invoices exceeding credit terms are considered delinquent. Payments of accounts receivable are allocated to specific invoices identified on the customer’s remittance advice or, if unspecified, are applied to the earliest unpaid invoices.



	 



	Property and Equipment



	 



	Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company charges repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets to expenses as incurred.



	 



	Intangible Assets



	 



	Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets that have limited useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their useful or legal lives.



	 



	Concentration of Credit Risk



	 



	Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.



	 





	 






	F-7










	 





	 



	The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, which are not insured. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash.



	 



	Income Taxes



	 



	The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.







	The Company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported on the balance sheets as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred taxes are classified as current or noncurrent based on the balance sheet classification of the related assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax results primarily from temporary differences related to net property and equipment for financial and income tax reporting.







	US GAAP requires Company management to evaluate tax positions taken by the Company and recognize a tax liability or asset if the Company has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by the internal revenue service. The Company has concluded that as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 there are no material uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability or asset or disclosure in the financial statements.  The Company is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions; however there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress. Company management believes that the Company’s income tax returns for the last three years remain subject to examination based on normal statutory periods subject to audits, notwithstanding any events or circumstances that may exist which could expand the open period.



	 



	Foreign Currency Translation



	 



	The Company translates the foreign currency financial statements into US Dollars using the year or reporting period end or average exchange rates in accordance with the requirements of ASC subtopic 830-10, Foreign Currency Matters (“ASC 830-10”). Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect for the periods presented. The cumulative translation adjustment is included in the accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) within shareholders’ equity (deficit).

	New Accounting Pronouncements




	 







	 






	i.






	In August 2014,  FASB issued amended guidance related to disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. The new guidance requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and, as necessary, to provide related footnote disclosures. The guidance has an effective date of December 31, 2016. The Company believes that the adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on its financial statements.







	 







	 







	ii.







	In May 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standard Update, or ASU, 2014-09-Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The core principal of this ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.







	 







	 






	iii.






	In January 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-01-Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items, which seeks to simplify Extraordinary Items. This Update eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement—Extraordinary and Unusual Items, required that an entity separately classify, present and disclose extraordinary events and transactions. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.

Pursuant to an Application Programming Interface (API) agreement, dated October 5, 2015, the Company is required to pay a minimum annual maintenance fee of $7,500 to IRCTC. In the event the agreement is renewed, the amount based on the number of active railway agents that use the Company rail booking services on the Company’s platform will be payable annually.







	Until December 8, 2015, the Company shared office space with Maxim Group LLC. The majority member of Maxim Group LLC is the sole stockholder of Maxim Kelyfos, LLC. which owned 93% of the Company’s common stock outstanding prior to the acquisition of Sunalpha by the Company.







	Through Sunalpha, the Company currently occupies approximately 2,455 square feet of office space owned by a director of the Company on a rent free basis. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not paid any rent. The Company is expected to pay market rate rent once the Company is profitable.







	The Company has leased office space in Ahmedabad, India effective from March 1, 2016 for a term of five years. The operations of the Company are being undertaken from the new premises. The Company will pay approximately $1,260 per month pursuant to the lease agreement.

	Subsequent Events




	 



	The Company has evaluated subsequent events through July 18, 2016, the date on which the financial statements were available to be issued. The Company entered into a consulting agreement effective May 24, 2016 with LogiCore Strategies, LLC (“LogiCore”), pursuant to which Richard J. Shaw serves as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. The Company compensates LogiCore for Mr. Shaw’s time at an annual rate of $60,000.







	On July 1, 2016, the Company issued convertible promissory notes to an accredited investor in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000 pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated February 8, 2016. Interest will accrue at the rate of 6% per annum. In the event that the Company completes an underwritten public offering of its common stock in connection with a listing on a national securities exchange (an “Uplist Transaction”), prior to the July 1, 2019 maturity date, the outstanding principal balance of the note will automatically convert into a total of 3,924,088 shares of common stock (the “Note Shares”). If the Uplist Transaction does not occur prior to the maturity date, the noteholder will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Note shares each together with accrued unpaid interest paid in cash. The noteholder also will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal or the note shares, together with accrued unpaid interest paid in cash, in connection with a “sale of the company” as such term is defined in the convertible promissory note.



	 




	The Company repaid advances of $2,501 and $21,457 received from Mr. Sharma and Arna, respectively, as of July 11, 2016.

	Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.



	 



	TripBorn, Inc. (the “Company”) is incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”).



	 



	Section 145(a) of the DGCL provides that a Delaware corporation shall have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person’s conduct was unlawful.



	 



	Section 145(b) of the DGCL provides that a Delaware corporation shall have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person acted in any of the capacities set forth above, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted under standards similar to those discussed above, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine that despite the adjudication of liability, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to be indemnified for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.



	 



	Section 145 of the DGCL further provides that to the extent a director or officer of a corporation has been successful in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith; and that indemnification provided for by Section 145 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the indemnified party may be entitled; and that the corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a director or officer of the corporation against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity or arising out of such person’s status as such whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under Section 145.



	 



	Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL provides that a corporation may eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided that such provisions shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (1) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) under section 174 of the DGCL or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. No such provision shall eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any act or omission occurring before the date when such provision becomes effective.



	 





	 






	43










	 





	 



	Article VII of the Company’s certificate of incorporation, limits the liability of directors to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. The effect of this provision is to eliminate the Company’s rights, and the rights of its stockholders, through stockholder derivative suits on behalf of the Company, to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, including breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior. However, the Company’s directors will be personally liable to the Company and its stockholders for monetary damages if they acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized illegal dividends or redemptions or derived improper benefit from their actions as directors. In addition, the Company’s certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that the Company has the right to indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law.




	 





	Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.

	On February 8, 2016, we issued convertible promissory notes to three accredited investors in the aggregate principal amount of $350,000 pursuant to a note purchase agreement of the same date.

In the event that we complete an “uplist transaction,” which is an underwritten public offering of our common stock in connection with a listing on a national securities exchange, prior to the February 8, 2019 maturity date, the outstanding principal balance of the note will automatically convert into a total of 9,156,206 shares of common stock, which we refer to as the note shares. If the uplist transaction does not occur prior to the maturity date, the noteholders will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal balance or the note shares, each together with unpaid accrued interest paid in cash.

In the event that we complete an “uplist transaction,” which is an underwritten public offering of our common stock in connection with a listing on a national securities exchange prior to the March 7, 2019 maturity date, the outstanding principal balance of the note will automatically convert into 3,432,234 shares of common stock, which we refer to as the note shares. If the uplist transaction does not occur prior to the maturity date, Mr. Sharma will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal balance or the note shares, each together with accrued unpaid interest paid in cash.

If the uplist transaction does not occur prior to the maturity date, Mr. Mandloi will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal balance or the note shares. Mr. Mandloi also will have the option to receive full payment of the outstanding principal or the note shares, each together with accrued unpaid interest paid in cash, in connection with a “sale of the company” as such term is defined in the convertible promissory note.

	Item 17. Undertakings.



	 



	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:



	 



	1.           To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement:



	 







	 






	i.






	To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;







	 





	 






	46










	 





	 







	 






	ii.






	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement.







	 







	 






	iii.






	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.







	 



	2.           For the purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.



	 



	3.           To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.



	 



	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Note 1
– Organization and Description of Business

 

TripBorn,
Inc. (“TripBorn” or the “Company”) is a
business to business online travel agency (“OTA”) that
offers travel reservations and related travel services and products
to travel agents in India through its proprietary internet-based
platform at www.tripborn.com. TripBorn is a holding company that
was incorporated in Delaware in January 2010 and operated as a
shell company with nominal or no assets or operations until
December 2015 when it acquired substantially all of the outstanding
common stock of its operating subsidiary, Sunalpha Green
Technologies Private Limited (“Sunalpha”). The Company
has selected March 31 as its fiscal year end.

 

TripBorn
was known as PinstripesNYC, Inc. until January 2016. TripBorn filed
reports as PinstripesNYC, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Exchange Act from August 2010 until it
terminated its registration under the Exchange Act in May
2013.

 

On
December 14, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
shares of Sunalpha, which is incorporated under the laws of the
Republic of India on November 4, 2010. The transaction was
accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Sunalpha was the
acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and TripBorn is the
acquired company.

 

 

Note 2 – Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Accounting
Policies

 

These
financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of
accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) as
detailed in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”).

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the US ("GAAP")
for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q
and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X, each as promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The
Company's condensed consolidated financial statements do not
include all information and notes required by GAAP for complete
financial statements. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet as
of March 31, 2016 presented herein was derived from the
Company’s audited consolidated balance sheet as of March 31,
2016. For additional information, please refer to the consolidated
financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2016 ("fiscal 2016") included in the Company's Registration
Statement on Form S-1/A as filed with the SEC on August 5,
2016.

 

The
acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
Sunalpha by TripBorn on December 14, 2015 was accounted for as a
reverse recapitalization. Sunalpha is the acquirer for financial
reporting purposes, and TripBorn is the acquired company.
Consequently, the assets, liabilities and results of operations
that are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements prior to the December 14, 2015 transaction are those of
Sunalpha and are recorded using the historical cost basis. The
consolidated financial statements after completion of the December
14, 2015 transaction include the assets, liabilities and results of
operations of the Company and Sunalpha.  All significant
related party accounts and transactions between the Company and
Sunalpha have been eliminated upon consolidation.

 

Revenue
Recognition

 

The
Company provides travel products and services to leisure and
corporate travelers in India and abroad. The revenue from rendering
these services is recognized at the time when significant risk and
rewards are transferred to the customer. This is generally the
case: 1) on the date of departure for vacation packages, 2) on the
date of check in for hotel booking business and 3) on the date of
issuance for the sale of airline tickets.

 

 

 

7

  

Table of
Contents

 

 

Revenue
from the sale of airline tickets is recognized as an agent on a net
commission earned basis, when the Company does not assume any
performance obligation following the confirmation of the issuance
of an airline ticket to the customer. In instances where the
Company has procured coupons of airline tickets in advance for an
anticipated future demand from customers, and assumes the risk of
loss for tickets not used, the revenue from the sale of such
airline tickets is accounted for on the gross basis.

 

Incentives
from airlines are recognized when the performance obligations under
the incentive programs are achieved.

 

Revenue
from hotel reservations, including commissions earned is recognized
on a net basis as an agent, on the date of check-in, when the
Company does not assume any performance obligation following the
issuance of a hotel confirmation voucher to the customer. Where the
Company has pre-booked the hotel room for an anticipated future
demand from the customers and assumes the risk for not using the
available hotel room nights at its disposal, revenue from the sale
of such hotel room nights is accounted for on the gross basis.
Performance linked incentives from hotels are recognized as income
on achievement of performance obligations.

 

Revenue
from vacation packages, including income on airline tickets sold to
customers as a part of vacation packages, is accounted for on the
gross basis as the Company is determined to be the primary obligor
in the arrangement i.e., the risks and responsibilities are taken
by the Company, including the responsibility for delivery of
services.

 

Revenue
from other sources, primarily comprising revenue from rail and bus
ticket reservations is recognized as the services are being
performed. Revenue from the rail and bus ticket reservations is
recognized as an agent on a net commission earned basis, as the
Company does not assume any performance obligation following the
confirmation of the issuance of the ticket to the
customer.

 

Revenue is
recognized net of cancellations, refunds, discounts and taxes. In
the event of cancellation of tickets, revenue recognized with
respect to commissions earned by the Company on such tickets is
reversed and is netted against the revenue earned during the fiscal
period, at the time the cancellation is made by the customer. In
addition, a liability is recognized in respect to the refund due to
the customers for the gross amount charged to such customers net of
cancellation fees. The revenue from the sale of vacation packages
and hotel reservations is recognized on the customer’s
departure and check-in dates, respectively. Cancellations, if any,
do not impact revenue recognition since revenue is recognized upon
the availment of services by the customer.

 

Cost of
Revenue

 

Cost of
revenue primarily consists of costs paid to hotel and vacation
package suppliers for the acquisition of relevant services and
products for sale to customers, and includes the procurement cost
of hotel rooms and other services.

 

Cost of
revenue is the amount paid or accrued against procurement of these
services and products from the respective suppliers and do not
include any other operating cost to provide these services or
products. Cost of revenue is recognized when incurred, which
coincides with the recognition of the corresponding
revenue.

 

Operating
Expenses

 

Operating
expenses include costs such as advertising and business promotion
costs, utilities, rent, payroll and consultants fees and charges,
which are recognized on an accrual basis. Depreciation and
amortization costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of
the assets.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in US GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results
could differ significantly from those estimates. The estimates
underlying the Company’s Financial Statements relate to,
accruals for travel transactions, valuation of accounts receivable,
useful life of long-lived assets and income taxes.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

The
Company considers all highly-liquid investments (including money
market funds) with an original maturity at acquisition of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash
balances, which may exceed federally insured limits. The Company
does not believe that this results in any significant credit
risk.

Table of
Contents

 

 

Sunalpha
has six accounts denominated in Indian Rupees. As of June 30, 2016,
the cash balance in financial institutions in India was USD
$155,886. The transactions are undertaken in Indian Rupees and
results in foreign currency translation adjustment. The
Company’s cash deposits in India are not insured against
loss. The Company does not believe that this results in any
significant credit risk.

 

Receivables
and Credit Policies

 

Accounts
receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under
normal trade terms which generally range from 24 hours to seven to
ten days from the time and date of transaction. Accounts receivable
are stated at the amount billed to the customer. Customer account
balances with invoices exceeding credit terms are considered
delinquent. Payments of accounts receivable are allocated to
specific invoices identified on the customer’s remittance
advice or, if unspecified, are applied to the earliest unpaid
invoices.

 

Property
and Equipment

 

Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The Company charges repairs and maintenance costs that do not
extend the lives of the assets to expenses as incurred.

 

Intangible
Assets

 

Intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at
least annually. Intangible assets that have limited useful lives
are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their
useful or legal lives.

 

Concentration
of Credit Risk

 

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and
accounts receivable.

 

The
Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, which are not
insured. The Company has not experienced any losses in such
accounts. The Company believes that it is not exposed to any
significant credit risk on cash.

 

Income
Taxes

 

The
Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability
method in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

 

The
Company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary
differences between tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts
reported on the balance sheets as well as operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. Deferred taxes are classified as current or
noncurrent based on the balance sheet classification of the related
assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax results primarily from
temporary differences related to net property and equipment for
financial and income tax reporting.

 

US GAAP
requires Company management to evaluate tax positions taken by the
Company and recognize a tax liability or asset if the Company has
taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be
sustained upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The
Company has concluded that as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 there are
no material uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken
that would require recognition of a liability or asset or
disclosure in the financial statements.  The Company is
subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions; however there
are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress. Company
management believes that the Company’s income tax returns for
the last three years remain subject to examination based on normal
statutory periods subject to audits, notwithstanding any events or
circumstances that may exist which could expand the open
period.

 

Foreign
Currency Translation

 

The
Company translates the foreign currency financial statements into
US Dollars using the year or reporting period end or average
exchange rates in accordance with the requirements of ASC subtopic
830-10, Foreign Currency Matters (“ASC 830-10”). Assets
and liabilities are translated at exchange rates as of the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates
in effect for the periods presented. The cumulative translation
adjustment is included in the accumulated other comprehensive gain
(loss) within shareholders’ equity (deficit).

Note 3 – Change
in Control Transaction

 

On
December 8, 2015, the Company issued 71,428,570 shares of common
stock to Arna Global LLC (“Arna”) for cash
consideration of $95,500. Arna is wholly-owned by the
Company’s President and director, Deepak Sharma. The Company
accounted for the change in control transaction with Arna using the
acquisition method of accounting. Arna obtained control of 93% of
the outstanding shares of common stock of PinstripesNYC, Inc. in
connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement among PinstripesNYC,
Inc., Arna, and Maxim Kelyfos, LLC dated December 8, 2015, and is
the acquirer. This transaction resulted in (1) no identifiable
assets being acquired, (2) no liabilities being assumed, (3) no
goodwill being recognized and (4) no gains being recognized from a
bargain purchase.

 

Note 4 -
Acquisition of Sunalpha Green Technologies Private
Limited

 

On
December 14, 2015, the Company acquired substantially all of the
outstanding shares of Sunalpha which was incorporated under the
laws of the Republic of India in November 2010. The transaction was
accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Sunalpha was the
acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and TripBorn was
the acquired company. Consequently, the assets, liabilities and
results of operations that are reflected in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements prior to the December 14, 2015
transaction are those of Sunalpha and are recorded using the
historical cost basis. The consolidated financial statements after
completion of the December 14, 2015 transaction include the assets,
liabilities and results of operations of the Company and
Sunalpha.

 

Note 5 -
Increase in Authorized Shares

 

The
Company amended its certificate of incorporation on January 13,
2016 to (a) increase the authorized number of shares of common
stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000 and (b) change its name from

Note 11 -
Income Tax

 

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes. The deferred tax assets at June 30, 2016 and March 31,
2016 are $88,567 and $33,680, respectively.

 

The
Company files its income tax returns on a fiscal year
basis.

 

The future
effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as the
Company’s income (loss) before taxes, tax legislation and the
geographic composition of pre-tax income.

 

The
Company files income tax returns in the US. Sunalpha files tax
returns in India. The Company is generally subject to US Federal
examinations by tax authorities for the past three
years.

New Accounting Pronouncements

 

i. In
August 2014, FASB issued amended guidance related to disclosure of
uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a
going concern. The new guidance requires management to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability
to continue as a going concern and, as necessary, to provide
related footnote disclosures. The guidance has an effective date of
December 31, 2016. The Company believes that the adoption of this
new standard will not have a material impact on its financial
statements.

 

ii. In May
2014, FASB issued Accounting Standard Update, or ASU,
2014-09-Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides a
single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers. The core principal of this ASU is that an entity
should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosure
about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant
judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs
incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB
issued an ASU deferring the effective date of the revenue standard
so it would be effective for annual and interim reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption
prohibited before December 15, 2016. We are in the process of
evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new guidance on our
consolidated financial statements.

Note 14 -
Commitments

 

The
Company is the B2B Principal Agent of the Indian Railway Catering
and Tourism Corporation, or IRCTC, which is a government entity
that allows the Company to offer reservations through Indian
Railways’ passenger reservation system on the Company’s
webpage. Indian Railways is India’s state-owned railway which
owns and operates most of India’s rail transportation. The
Company has integrated its online portal with IRCTC’s to
provide a seamless booking process. Pursuant to an Application
Programming Interface (API) agreement, dated October 5, 2015, the
Company is required to pay a minimum annual maintenance fee of
$7,500 to IRCTC. In the event the agreement is renewed, the amount
based on the number of active railway agents that use the Company
rail booking services on the Company’s platform will be
payable annually.

 

Until
December 8, 2015, the Company shared office space with Maxim Group
LLC. The majority member of Maxim Group LLC is the sole stockholder

common stock outstanding prior to the acquisition of Sunalpha by
the Company.

 

Through
Sunalpha, the Company currently occupies approximately 2,455 square
feet of office space owned by a director of the Company on a rent
free basis. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not paid
any rent. The Company is expected to pay market rate rent once the
Company is profitable.

 

The

Company are being undertaken from the new premises. The Company
will pay approximately $1,260 per month pursuant to the lease
agreement.

  

Note 15 -
Subsequent Events

 

Pursuant
to the note purchase agreement, dated February 8, 2016 as described
in Note 10, on July 1, 2016, we issued an additional convertible
promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000 to
one of the accredited investors. The convertible note carries
substantially the same terms as described above. In the event that
we complete an “uplist transaction” prior to the July
1, 2019 maturity date, the outstanding principal balance of the
note will automatically convert into a total of 3,924,088 note
shares. Beginning on July 2, 2017, to the to the extent note shares
have been issued, and to the extent such note shares are not then
tradeable pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act or otherwise,
the noteholder may make one “demand request” for
registration under the Securities Act of all or any portion of the
note shares.

 

The
Company repaid advances of $2,501 and $21,457 received from Mr.
Sharma and Arna, respectively, as of July 11, 2016.

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Forward-Looking
Statements

 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”). All
statements other than statements of historical fact are
“forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal
and state securities laws, including: any projections of
earnings, revenues or other financial items; any statements
regarding the adequacy, availability and sources of capital, any
statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management
for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new
products, services or developments; any statements regarding future
economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and
any statements of assumptions underlying any of the
foregoing. Forward-looking statements may include the words
“may,” “will,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “continue,”
“believe,” “expect,” “plan” or
“anticipate” and other similar words. In addition
to any assumptions and other factors and matters referred to
specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements,
factors that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ
materially from those contained in forward-looking statements
include those factors set forth in this Quarterly Report,
particularly under the headings, “Risk Factors” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" and subsequent reports that we
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking
statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially
from those projected or assumed. Our future financial
condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking
statements, are subject to change and to inherent risks and
uncertainties, such as those disclosed in this prospectus. We
do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any
forward-looking statement, except as required by law.

 

Notwithstanding
the above, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, expressly states that the safe harbor for forward looking
statements does not apply to companies that issue penny stocks.
Accordingly, the safe harbor for forward looking statements under
the PSLRA is not currently available to the Company because we may
be considered to be an issuer of penny stock.

 

The
information included in this management’s discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be
read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and
the notes included in this Quarterly Report, and the audited
consolidated financial statements and notes and Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-1/A
(File No. 333-210821) filed on August 5, 2016. .

We are a
holding company organized in Delaware in 2010. Deepak Sharma, who
is an executive officer and director of the Company, formed our
operating subsidiary, Sunalpha Green Technologies Private Limited
under laws of the Republic of India in 2010. Sunalpha commenced
operations as an OTA in India in February 2014.

 

We
engineered our internet-based platform, Travelcord using multiple
systems platforms with an emphasis on scalability, performance and
reliability. We integrated other software platforms, applications
and database systems into Travelcord. We designed these internal
platforms to include open application protocol interfaces that can

counterparties with the ability to terminate or suspend the
arrangements with little or no notice. Our arrangements with our
suppliers with respect to the terms of our sales targets,
incentives, commissions and discounts often are subject to change
at the discretion of our supplier and are negotiated periodically
on a quarterly or yearly basis, if not more frequently. We also
typically pay fees to our travel suppliers to directly connect into
their booking systems on an initial and/or ongoing
basis.

agents to select specific seats by gender, which is of interest to
their Indian customers.  We may also procure bus tickets
offline from individual bus operators for our travel agent
customers. We procure bus tickets for our travel agent customers at
base rates and earn revenue by including a markup or fees on the
tickets. We also earn incentives and commissions from our supplier
for completing bookings.

 

Rail

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

 

There have
been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and
estimates from the information provided in our Form S-1 filing for
fiscal year end March 31, 2016.

 

  

RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

 

During the
first quarter of fiscal year 2017 we continued to add new markets
and add an increasing number of sales agents that offer our
services.  These changes drove an increase in our net
revenues.  Our costs of revenue and operating expenses
increased as we expanded our market reach and drove the increase in
net loss from operations.

$10,011 in the prior year. The primary driver underlying the
revenue growth from bus ticketing, rail ticketing, hotel booking,
vacation packages, payment services, and incentives was an increase
in the number of transactions that were processed, which resulted
from the introduction of rail ticketing and our expansion efforts
into new markets and the hiring of additional sales and marketing
personnel, which expanded our market reach. The decrease of $3,990
in revenue from air ticketing resulted from an increase in costs
paid to third party providers and pricing pressure.

 

Cost of
Revenues and Gross Profit

 

The cost
of revenue for the first quarter ended June 30, 2016, was $68,946
compared to $15,955 for the prior year quarter. The cost of revenue
represents fees charged by our suppliers. The increase in cost of
revenue from the first quarter ended June 30, 2016 to the prior
year quarter resulted from an increase in the costs associated with
our vacation packages as revenues grew by $28,050 in the quarter
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year quarter. We are
continuing to manage our cost of revenue by optimizing pricing from
our suppliers and aggregators to increase our profitability and by
implementing pricing algorithms and profitability
calculations.

 

Gross
profit from revenues for the first quarter ended June 30, 2016 was
$25,296 compared to $41,449 for the prior year quarter.  The
$16,153 decrease is driven primarily by an increase in costs to
provide revenue combined with competitive pricing
pressure.

 

Operating
Expenses

 

Total
operating expenses for the first quarter ended June 30, 2016 were
$125,135 compared $43,282 for the prior year quarter. Our operating
expenses include our sales and marketing, payroll and general and
administrative costs and the increase in these costs was driven by
our increased headcount as we ramp up our operations. Included in
our operating expenses is an increase of $76,968 in legal and
consulting expenses associated with our becoming a reporting
company with the SEC.

 

We expect
our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to grow
the business and hire experienced personnel to support our growing
business and operations. Our general and administrative expenses
are expected to continue to increase as we incur expenses
associated with become a reporting company under the Exchange Act
and seek the quotation of our shares on the OTC.

 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 

As of June
30, 2016, we had $164,478 in cash and cash equivalents, compared to
$251,971 as of March 31, 2016. The $87,493 decrease in cash was
driven by selling, general, and administrative costs incurred
during the quarter exceeding net revenues generated. As of June 30,
2016, we had a stockholder’s equity deficit of $182,248
compared to a deficit of $52,493 at March 31, 2016, which resulted
from an increase in operating losses during the quarter ended June
30, 2016.

 

We require
additional capital to continue to fund our operations, and will
look to raise funds through public and private offerings of our
securities.  We estimate that we will require approximately
$1.7 million and $5.8 million in the next 12 and 24 months to
support our continued operations.

We took
the following steps during fiscal years 2016 and 2017 to manage our
liquidity and to avoid default on any material third-party
obligations:

 




 



·



We
continue to employ “on demand” procurement processes
for travel products that we sell to our customer. We also continue
our attempts to collect customer payments promptly based on their
payment terms, which has helped us manage our working capital
needs.




 




 



·



We raised
$350,000 in the last quarter of fiscal 2016 and an additional
$150,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 pursuant to the
Company’s issuance of convertible notes. The notes have a
three-year term, and bear interest at the rate of six percent
payable at maturity. The principal amount of each note is
convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at the
noteholder’s option at maturity.




 




 



·



We issued
convertible notes to affiliates totaling $1,150,483 in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2016. The notes have a three-year term, and bear
interest at the rate of ten percent payable at maturity. The
principal amount of each note is convertible into shares of the
Company’s common stock at the noteholder’s option at
maturity. One such note in the principal amount of $956,000 was
issued to Arna to finance the purchase of our Travelcord software
under a Software Agreement with Arna, dated as of December 16,
2015.




 

The
Company is actively seeking a market maker to apply for admission
to quotation of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin
Board.

 

There are
no assurances that these steps will generate sufficient cash flow
from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient
financing necessary to support our working capital requirements. We
can also give no assurance that additional capital financing will
be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to us.
If adequate working capital is not available, we may not be able to
continue our operations or execute our business plan.

  

OPERATING
METRICS

 

In
evaluating our business, we use operating metrics, including gross
bookings and revenue margin. Gross bookings is a measure of total
dollar volume of transactions that we process. This metric is an
operating metric used by management, the investor community, and
analysts who follow the travel industry to measure our market share
and to measure our scale and growth. We calculate revenue margin as
revenue as a percentage of gross bookings.

 




 



Quarter
Ended June 30,

1 Gross
bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked
through us, generally including taxes, fees and other charges, and
are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds.

 

2 Reveue
margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross
bookings.

 

The
increase in gross bookings is driven primarily by increases in air
ticketing, rail ticketing, and vacation packages. Revenue margin
declined quarter over quarter due to price pressure on air
ticketing and low margin rail ticketing outpacing higher margin
vacation and hotel package offerings.

 

 

OFF
BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

 

As of June
30, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

1A. RISK FACTORS

 

The
following are factors that could have a significant impact on our
operations and financial results and could cause actual results or
outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any
forward-looking statements.

 

Risks
Related to Our Business

 

We are a
development stage company with a limited operating history, which
may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict
our future performance.

 

We have a
limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our future
performance. Our operating subsidiary was incorporated under the
laws of India in 2010, and it began to focus its operations on the
online travel industry in February 2014. Our senior management has
limited experience in the online travel industry, and we still are
in the process of fully developing our online platform and product
offerings. We have generated revenues over a limited operating
history and have incurred net losses. As a result of our short
operating history, we have only limited financial data and business
information with which to evaluate our business strategies,
performance and investment in our common stock.

 

We have
incurred net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will
continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable
future.

 

We expect
to incur operating losses in future periods as we incur significant
expenses associated with the initial startup of our business. Our
expenses will continue to increase as we continue to develop the
operations necessary to further our business plan. We cannot now
determine the amount by which our expenses will increase as we grow
and hire additional employees, implement our sales, marketing and
distribution plans, pursue contractual arrangements and
partnerships and develop our internet-based infrastructure.
Further, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in
achieving or sustaining positive cash flow at any time in the
future. Any such failure could result in the possible closure of
our business and a complete loss of our stockholders’
investment.

 

We are a
holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other
payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiary to
meet our obligations.

 

We are a
holding company that does not conduct any business operations of
our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends
and distributions and other transfers from our Indian operating
subsidiary to meet our obligations. The deterioration of income
from, or other available assets of, our Indian operating subsidiary
for any reason could limit or impair its ability to pay dividends
or other distributions to us, which in turn could adversely affect
our financial condition and results of operations.

Our lack
of insurance leaves us exposed to significant
liabilities.

 

We do not
carry insurance for the risks that our business may encounter. Any
significant liability may require us to pay substantial amounts,
which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations, if we are able to continue in business at
all.

 

The
requirements of being a public company, including compliance with
the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our
costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with
these requirements in a timely or cost-effective
manner.

 

As a newly
public company we now are required to comply with new laws,
regulations, requirements and certain corporate governance
provisions under the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements will
occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and
management, and will significantly increase our costs and expenses
and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. In
connection with becoming a reporting company, we need
to:

 





 



·



institute
a more comprehensive compliance function;




 





 



·



prepare
and distribute periodic and current reports under the federal
securities laws;




 





 



·



establish
new internal policies; and




 





 



·



involve
and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and
accountants.




 

Our
ongoing compliance efforts will increase general and administrative
expenses and may divert management’s time and attention from
the development of our business, which may adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations. We estimate that we
may incur approximately $260,000 in costs during the fiscal year
ending March 31, 2017 and $384,000 in the fiscal year ending March
31, 2018 in connection with becoming a public company.

 

Our lack
of experienced accounting staff may impact our ability to report
our future financial results on a timely and accurate basis, and we
need to retain the services of additional accountants and
consultants with required accounting experience and
expertise.

 

With the
exception of our Chief Financial Officer, our accounting and
finance staff lacks depth and skill in the application of generally
accepted accounting principles with respect to external financial
reporting for Exchange Act reporting companies. We also do not have
an audit committee or a member of our board of directors who would
satisfy the definition of an audit committee financial expert. We
intend to engage the services of additional accounting personnel to
assist with our financial accounting and reporting requirements to
develop our internal control over financial reporting and to
produce timely financial reports. Until we do so, we may experience
difficulty producing reliable and timely financial statements,
which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported
financial information, the market price of our stock to decline
significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing on
acceptable terms, and our business and financial condition could be
harmed.

 

As a
newly public company, we currently are not required evaluate our
internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

We are not
currently required to evaluate our internal control over financial
reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition,
as a smaller reporting company, we will not be required to obtain
an auditor attestation of management’s evaluation of internal
controls over financial reporting once such internal controls are
in place. As a result, we may fail to identify and remediate a
material weakness or deficiency in our internal control over
financial reporting, which may cause our financial statements and
related disclosure to contain material misstatements and could
cause delays in filing required financial statements and related
reports. Furthermore, the process of designing and implementing
internal controls over financial reporting may divert our internal
resources and take a significant amount of time and expenditure to
complete. The actual or perceived risk associated with our lack of
internal controls could cause investors lose confidence in our
reported financial information, which could negatively impact the
market for our common stock and cause us to be unable to obtain
additional financing on acceptable terms or at all, which could
cause harm to our business and financial condition.

We may
not be successful in implementing our growth
strategies.

 

Our growth
strategies involve expanding our network of travel agents,
expanding our service and product offerings, expanding supplier
relationships, enhancing our service platforms by investing in
technology and expanding into new geographic markets within India.
The following factors may affect our success in implementing our
growth strategies:

 





 



·



our
ability to increase the number of suppliers, especially suppliers
that are directly-connected to us, which depends on the willingness
of such suppliers to invest in new technology;




 





 



·



our
ability to continue to expand our distribution channels, and market
and cross-sell our travel services and products to facilitate the
expansion of our business;




 





 



·



our
ability to build or acquire the required technology;




 





 



·



the
general condition of the global and Indian economy and continued
growth in demand for travel services, particularly
