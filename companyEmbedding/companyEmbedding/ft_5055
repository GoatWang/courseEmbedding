Have fun with wall decor.If your floor space is limited, it’s important to make the most of your walls by using every inch for home decor. If your walls are looking a little barren, spice them up with colorful artwork. Your own photo collage can add a personal touch to any room, while mirrors can make a small space seem larger thanks to their reflective qualities. If storage is an issue, use shelves and stack them with fun trinkets or flowers. Don’t forget about the wall itself! Add some flavor with colorful, patterned wallpaper or go for a brightly painted accent wall. Home decorations make great table toppers.If your living room needs a lift, liven it up by adding a few thoughtful home decor accessories. Photos always make great additions, but keep them interesting by mixing and matching your frames. When lit, candles add a romantic, relaxing feel, and coffee table books about travel, home design, fashion or photography make for great conversation starters. House decorations can cozy up your floor.While floor space may be limited, there’s always room for a well-placed area rug or two. These are a great way to add texture, color and warmth to a hardwood or tile floor. Choose a traditional floral pattern or some funky chevrons to get started, then pair your  pattern with a textured Berber rug or soft shag for ultimate indulgence. Add some vibrancy to neutral-colored furniture. One of the easiest ways to punch up a look is through the fabric you display. Swap out throw pillows and blankets to liven up a dull home decor foundation, and search right here on Houzz for bold or mismatched patterns, comfy throws and cushy pillows. Don’t forget the drapes.Dress up your windows with elegant, bold or even light and airy treatments. Because of their size, floor-length curtains can make a dramatic difference and can transition a room from traditional to contemporary all by themselves.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreWhat size   rug works best for my space?There are a lot of traditional rules when it comes to the correct rug size, but most designers today will encourage you to break those rules. It's your call, but keep in mind what is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Look to your furniture to determine the size; in a living room,   rugs should offer plenty of coverage from one sofa to the next. After all, if there are too many gaps, its small size will be easy to notice. You should also keep in mind architectural cues. One near the front door is often just large enough to slightly surpass the door frame, while a narrow hallway requires equally narrow runner rugs. In the end, your space and furniture will dictate the size more than anything else.What material should my   rug be made of?Some rugs are more durable than others, so before you pick out your favorite  pattern, determine how much traffic the space is going to get. For a high-traffic entryway, jute rugs and sisal rugs can be good choices, since they tend to hide dirt and show less wear and tear. Cotton, synthetic and wool rugs work well for larger areas in bedrooms and living rooms — they come in fun  colors and offer more cushion. If you love luxury more than practicality, you can always opt for silk or fur options. Regardless, be sure you keep your family in mind as well; silk and fur don't mesh well with little kids or family pets. And don't forget rug pads — these handy additions help you avoid creating an accidental slip and slide.What style   accent rug should I look for?Because it's one of the largest decorative pieces in your space, it should accurately reflect your style. For those with traditional tastes,   Persian rugs and floral patterns are go-to options, while geometric patterns and bright colors are trendier and more contemporary. In the end, it's great to mix and match   rugs and decor, but avoid conflicting patterns and colors.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreWhat materials are best for area rugs?It’s recommended that you don’t skimp when it comes to purchasing a new area rug, as high quality natural fibers like wool and silk are best but tend to be more expensive. Other natural fibers such as jute, grass and sisal can cost less but won’t wear as well. Another quality to look for is how easy it is to clean the materials, especially if you have children or pets. If you’re having trouble gauging how much you’re comfortable spending on a new area rug, take a look at how much other pieces of furniture in the room cost and search for area rugs that are priced similarly. What size area rug should I purchase?As a general rule, it’s recommended you choose area rugs that are two feet shorter than the shortest wall in the room where they’ll be placed. For example, if your bedroom is 11 feet by 13 feet, limit your search to bedroom rugs that are no more than nine feet long. Of course, this rule may not work in certain circumstances, like dining room rugs or living room rugs. For a dining room, look for an area rug that extends at least 18 inches past the edge of your dining table so that your dining chairs will fit on top. A living room rug should help designate conversation areas and should be big enough so that the front third of each piece of furniture sits on top of the rug. If your living room or den is large enough to hold more than one conversation area, you might consider buying two or more living room area rugs.

Description of Services




                    Drive-Thru Pickup
                

                    This option is available for our in-stock and special order items.  Simply order online and drive to one of our store/warehouse locations to pick up your order.  Due to the limited availability and specific qualities of our special order products, NFM must assess a 25% non-refundable deposit.  This deposit must be made with a major credit or debit card.  We offer an option that allows you to use your Nebraska Furniture Mart Card for the remainder of the balance.  To complete an order this way, please call our Phone Sales Team at 800-336-9136.
                



                    Driveway Delivery
                

                    On your scheduled delivery date, you’ll be given a 2-hour time window that you can expect to receive your delivery. Our drivers can also call ahead of time if it has been requested. With Driveway Delivery, our delivery drivers will place your items on the nearest sidewalk, driveway, or inside your garage. The items will be left in their factory packaging. If you live in an apartment or if you cannot safely move the items into your home, you should consider upgrading to In-Home Delivery.
                



                    In-Home Delivery
                

                    With this White Glove Delivery Service, you will receive a phone call 48 hours prior to your delivery that will set up and confirm a two hour window for your item’s scheduled arrival.  At that time, delivery agents will bring the product(s) into your home, uncrate them, and place them in the area of your choice. They will also remove any of the packaging material from your home. However, this does not include the setup of Ready to Assemble products. For guidelines and what to expect, please see our Home Delivery FAQ  page.  If you have any questions about assembly please call our Phone Sales Team at 800-336-9136.
In-Home Gun Safe Delivery 
Because of the size and weight of gun safes there is an additional charge of $99 for in home delivery that will be added to the price of the regular in home delivery at the time of purchase.  Any additional installation including the removal of legs is not included in Gun Safe Delivery and cannot be performed by NFM Delivery Teams.
                



                    Next Day In-Home Delivery
                

                    With Next-Day Delivery, you will receive a call that will set up and confirm a two-hour window for your item’s scheduled arrival. At that time, delivery agents will bring the product(s) into your home, uncrate them, and place them in the area of your choice. They will also remove any of the packaging material from your home. However, this does not include Flooring or the setup of Ready to Assemble products. Purchases made from Midnight to 9:00 PM are eligible for Next Day Delivery. Any purchase made after the 9:00 PM cutoff time will be added to the following day’s queue. For guidelines and what to expect, please see our Home Delivery FAQ  page. If you have any questions about assembly, please call our Phone Sales Team at 800-336-9136.
                



                    Standard Truck Delivery
                

                    When your order has arrived at a local depot, you will receive a phone call to set up a 4 hour window for your delivery date. An adult 18 years or older must be present for the delivery. Upon arrival, a delivery specialist will remove the product from the truck and place it in your driveway or outside the front of your residence. Transporting the item into the home is the customers responsibility. If you live in an apartment, or will have trouble moving the product into your home by yourself you may want to consider upgrading to In Home Delivery.
                



                    Factory Direct Delivery
                

                    With Factory Direct Delivery it will typically ship in one to five business days after placing your order. It will arrive at your home from one of a few possible small parcel carriers such as (UPS, Fedex or USPS). We will send you a tracking number so you can track the shipment to your home.
                









                    UPS Delivery by
                

                    Options displaying “Delivery by” will be delivered via UPS by the date indicated. With this delivery method, we will send you a tracking number so that you can follow the progress of your order.
