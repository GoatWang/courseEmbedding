Written with warmth, wit and authority, Best Baby Products will help alleviate some of the anxiety caused by all the questions running through a new parent's mind.

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential.

Nonfiction books span the gamut of human experience, and some people have done unbelievable things. Nonfiction isn't limited to memoirs and biographies, either; it covers anything that isn't made up.Take a Step Into the PastHistory has always been a popular form of nonfiction, largely because there are so many different kinds of history. You can study everything from military history, to the history of quilting on the Canadian prairies. Anything people have ever done has a history, and in most cases you can find a nonfiction book about it. History covers everything from the broad sweep of empires to the personal stories of a single week in an individual's life. It's the story of humanity.Discover Your Inner SpiritualityEven as the world grows more and more materialistic, people find themselves turning toward nonfiction books on religion and spirituality. These books provide many people a way to find meaning in a world that is moving faster and faster every day. You can find everything from closely reasoned apologetics for the major faiths, to New Age life guides in the same place. Perhaps you'll succeed at your quest for meaning between the pages of a nonfiction book.Everyone Has to EatAll cultures have one thing in common; recipes. No matter what the culture, someone has written a cookbook, spreading cuisine around the world. You can find books on French, German, Italian, Caribbean, and just about any other form of cuisine you can imagine. In addition to cookbooks, there is also a whole world of diet books. Whether you want to lose weight, gain weight, or manage a health condition, there is a diet book to fit your needs.The Eyes Have ItArt and photography books bring the vision of the world to your very eyes. Art is fundamental to the human experience, and just one art book can show you millions of dollars' worth of old masters from around the world without the need to leave your couch. Photography books let you see the world as people like Ansel Adams and F-Stop Fitzgerald see it.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksNonfiction BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesTextbooks & Educational BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverPaperbackMixed LotSubjectsee allArt & PhotographyBiography & AutobiographyBooks on CollectingHistoryMilitary & WarReligion & SpiritualitySports & RecreationTransportationPublication Yearsee all1800-18991900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSpecial Attributessee all1st EditionDust JacketEx-LibraryIllustratedLarge PrintSignedLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

I’d like to share a story about sorrow, survival, strength, and success - the miracle of my life. This story is told as it was experienced by me, not someone else’s version of what they thought was happening, but what I felt about what was happening with me and my siblings as we not only survived but flourished in spite of horrendous circumstances.  This is a true story of one little girl’s journey from sorrow to success. This is my story.

                                Ms. Johnson has written a poignant autobiography. She has shared insights into her young life and the challenges her young life presented. Any child who has lost a parent then lived with extended family or in foster care could relate to Ms. Johnson's story and feelings.

                                At once heart-breaking and inspiring...a real profile in courage and resolve. A must-read for anyone experiencing or having lived through abuse as a child.

                                Sandy's book was very realistic and sometimes sad. It was a great story that made me think about how lucky I am to have good parents and people that love me. I didn't know Sandy had gone through all she did and I wouldn't have thought after going through all that she would be as nice or as successful as she is today.-- Elle Jones, Age 9

                                Sandy and I have been friends for over 25 years now and I have always known her as someone with an enormous passion for teaching and helping others. I have been on the receiving end of that at various times during our friendship. I knew that Sandy had lost her mother at a very young age and was raised by other family members, but I had no idea about the cruel reality of her youth. It’s definitely not something Sandy dwells on or that you would ever perceive when meeting her. I’m so glad she has taken the time to share her story, once again, in an effort to offer help to others. The reminder that seemingly “normal” children are often suffering a very harsh home life, while showing no indication of that life, is something we can all use. Although, it’s difficult to say I actually “enjoyed” Sandy’s book due to the sorrow, I am thrilled to know more about her and pray it accomplishes what she hopes.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
