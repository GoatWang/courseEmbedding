This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

                            Kolleen Kennedy | President, Varian Oncology Systems | 2017 Women of Influence                        
Matt Beardsley Photo










 


Kolleen Kennedy has demonstrated both leadership and strength, two characteristics she put to use as co-captain of the women’s hockey team at the University of Colorado and in her 20-year career at Varian Medical Systems. As a corporate officer, she is responsible for managing the company’s $2.5 billion oncology division.




She is working hard to help turn cancer into a chronically managed disease. During her tenure, Varian’s products have won many medical design awards. She regularly speaks on Capitol Hill on topics related to the health care industry.
Still, Kennedy is not all work and no play. Although she routinely works 70-hour weeks, she likes to unwind by gardening or enjoying an aromatherapy massage.
Residence: Palo Alto
Education: BS, psychology, and BS, radiation oncology, Wayne State University; MS, medical physics, University of Colorado
Career path: Radiation therapist, dosimetrist, oncology administration, medical physicist, medtech sales, vice president marketing and engineering and vice president customer support services.
Employees: 6,100
What has been your biggest challenge professionally? Feeling comfortable taking that next big career leap has always been a challenge, primarily due to a strong desire for broad and deep knowledge in the role before stepping up.
If you weren't doing what you do now, what would it be? Own a bespoke flower boutique.
