William Randall Broaddrick's Experience
Title: Chief Financial Officer
               Company: Ring Energy, Inc.
Job Details
               We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Some of our competitors possess and employ financial resources substantially greater than ours and some of our competitors employ more technical personnel. These factors can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than what our financial or technical resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to identify, evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. The actual price range of crude oil is largely established by major crude oil purchasers and commodities trading. Pricing for natural gas is based on regional supply and demand conditions. To this extent we believe we receive oil and gas prices comparable to other producers. There is little risk in our ability to sell all our current production at current prices with a reasonable profit margin. The risk of domestic overproduction at current prices is not deemed significant. We view our primary pricing risk to be related to a potential decline in prices to a level which could render our current production uneconomical. We are presently committed to use the services of the existing gathering systems of the companies that purchase our natural gas production. This commitment is tied to existing natural gas purchase contracts associated with our production This commitment potentially gives such gathering companies certain short-term relative monopolistic powers to set gathering and transportation costs, because obtaining the services of an alternative gathering company would require substantial additional costs (since an alternative gathering company would be required to lay new pipeline and/or obtain new rights of way to any lease from which we are selling production). We are not subject to third party gathering systems for our oil production. Some of our oil production is sold through a third party pipeline which has no regional competition. All other oil production is transported by the oil purchaser by trucks with competitive trucking costs in the area.
