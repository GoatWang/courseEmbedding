						                            Fir Tree helped design and lead an innovative board design and selection process for what is now the largest bankruptcy in history. Incentives were put in place to align interests and empower the board to increase the overall value of the estate on an expedited basis. Fir Tree, a hedge-fund creditor that helped select the directors, said in statement that it tried to "attract best in class directors who will work to maximize value" for Lehman creditors. Fir Tree said it looked for people who are "highly respected in a range of critical areas, including real estate, derivatives, private equity and restructuring." Wall Street Journal, December 5, 2011 Lehman says its "active board" approach resembles a private equity board and says its new directors were recruited to work closely with the team that has been managing its still considerable real-estate holdings.…"Given the highly results-oriented nature of this compensation package, …I would say this is an eminently reasonable package and likely to deliver more value to debtors…," said Paul Hodgson, compensation expert at GMI Ratings. Dow Jones, March 19, 2012







Nextel Communications (formerly NXTL: NASDAQ)



	
						                            “Fir Tree approached Nextel with an inventive debt for equity swap that greatly improved our company’s financial strength."
								                
Dennis Weibling,  former Chief Executive Officer






Plains Exploration & Production Company (formerly PXP: NYSE)



	
						                            "As a large owner of our company in 2007, through a series of constructive dialogues, we worked with Fir Tree on a shareholder value creation program that was implemented following a large company acquisition."
								                
James Flores,  Chief Executive Officer






Powerhouse Technologies, Inc. (formerly PWRH: NASDAQ)



	
						                            "Fir Tree’s long term view and support of my management team was a critical component of our successful turnaround.  It was refreshing to have a major investor with both highly constructive ideas and a long term view."
								                
Richard Haddrill,  Chairman of the Board and former Chief Executive Officer






R.H. Donnelly Corp (formerly RHD: NYSE)



	
						                            "In 2000 I was appointed to the RH Donnelley board as Fir Tree’s representative.   At the time Donnelley was the largest yellow page business in the US and it had recently been spun  off from its parent company, Dun & Bradstreet.  This was a time when the Internet began to emerge as a game changing technological threat and so my focus for value creation centered on tech initiatives and ensuring that capital allocation was done to maximize shareholder value."
								                
Darius Gaskins, former Fir Tree representative to RH Donnelly Board of Directors






Rite Aid Corporation (RAD: NYSE)



	
						                            "I first met the Fir Tree team when they were large holders of Rite-Aid debt and they approached me with an innovative debt-for-equity swap proposal.  We ended up completing many debt-for-equity swaps with Fir Tree which both helped us deleverage and provided us with the financial flexibility to grow our business."
								                
Dave Jessick,  former Chief Financial Officer






Syncora Guarantee Inc. (SYCRF: OTC US)



	
						                            "We have worked with Fir Tree on a number of inventive restructuring transactions for us, and they have been a good partner.  They provided constructive support to our management team and were quick to commit large sums of capital to complex deals."
								                
Claude LeBlanc,  Chief Restructuring Officer 






The Official Information Company (formerly TCM: NYSE)



	
						                            “The principals at Fir Tree were instrumental partners in the growth and development of The Official Information Company.  Their smart and constructive advice helped us develop, finance and execute a growth plan that created five separate operating businesses which were later sold in multiple value-enhancing transactions on behalf of our shareholders.”
								                
Ian Thomas,  former Chief Executive Officer






W.P. Carey Inc. (WPC: NYSE)



	
						                            "Fir Tree's meaningful suggestions regarding our dividend policy and information disclosures were enormously helpful.  We believe they significantly enhanced shareholder value."
								                
Trevor Bond, Chief Executive Officer
