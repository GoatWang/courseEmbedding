EPS represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. Net income (reported or estimated) for a period of time is divided by the total number of shares outstanding (TSO) during that period; See growth rate measures for EPS. Our vendor's methodology for the EPS on the infoquote and Summary Quote pages follows the EPS used by the majority of the analysts following the stock, in many cases this is EBITDA EPS.

About Us


KCAP Financial, Inc. ("KCAP" or the "Company") is an internally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that is regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act").
    

We have three principal areas of investment:


First, we originate, structure, and invest in senior secured term loans and mezzanine debt primarily in privately-held middle market companies (the "Debt Securities Portfolio"). In addition, from time to time we may invest in the equity securities of privately held middle market companies.
    

Second, we have invested in asset management companies (Katonah Debt Advisors, L.L.C. and Trimaran Advisors, L.L.C., collectively the "Asset Manager Affiliates") which manage collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs").
    

Third, we invest in debt and subordinated securities issued by CLOs ("CLO Fund Securities"). These CLO Fund Securities are primarily managed by our Asset Manager Affiliates, but from time-to-time we make investments in CLO Fund Securities managed by other asset managers. The CLOs typically invest in broadly syndicated loans, high-yield bonds and other credit instruments.
    

        The Company may also invest in other investments such as loans to larger, publicly-traded companies, high-yield bonds and distressed debt securities. The Company may also receive warrants or options to purchase common stock in connection with its debt investments.
    
OUR DEBT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

        In our Debt Securities Portfolio, our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from the investments made in senior secured term loans, mezzanine debt and selected equity investments in privately-held middle market companies. We define the middle market as comprising companies with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of $10 million to $50 million and/or total debt of $25 million to $150 million.
    

        We primarily invest in first and second lien term loans which, because of their priority in a company's capital structure, we expect will have lower default rates and higher rates of recovery of principal if there is a default and therefore we expect them to generate a stable stream of interest income. We also invest in mezzanine debt, which generally is subordinated to senior loans and is generally unsecured. While our primary investment focus is making loans to, and selected equity investments in, privately-held middle market companies, we may also invest in other investments such as loans to larger, publicly-traded companies, high-yield bonds and distressed debt securities. We may also receive warrants or options to purchase common stock in connection with our debt investments.
    
OUR ASSET MANAGER AFFILIATES

        With respect to our Asset Manager Affiliates investment, we expect to receive recurring dividend distributions and to generate capital appreciation through the addition of new CLO Funds managed by our Asset Manager Affiliates. The Asset Manager Affiliates manage CLO Funds that invest in broadly syndicated loans, high-yield bonds and other credit instruments. Collectively, the Asset Manager Affiliates have approximately $3 billion of par value assets under management. The Asset Manager Affiliates are registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and are managed independently from the Company by a separate portfolio management team. 
    

See also: Trimaran Advisors

OUR CLO FUND SECURITIES INVESTMENTS

        Our investments in CLO Fund Securities, which are primarily made up of a minority investment in the subordinated securities or preferred stock of CLO Funds raised and managed by our Asset Manager Affiliates, are anticipated to provide the Company with recurring cash distributions and complement the growth of our Asset Manager Affiliates. 
    
OUR STRUCTURE

        Because we are internally managed by our executive officers under the supervision of our Board of Directors and do not depend on a third party investment advisor, we do not pay investment advisory fees, but instead incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals. We believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a beneficial operating expense structure when compared to other publicly-traded and privately-held investment firms which are externally managed, and our internally managed structure allows us the opportunity to leverage our non-interest operating expenses as we grow our investment portfolio.

About Us


KCAP Financial, Inc. ("KCAP" or the "Company") is an internally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that is regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act").
    

We have three principal areas of investment:


First, we originate, structure, and invest in senior secured term loans and mezzanine debt primarily in privately-held middle market companies (the "Debt Securities Portfolio"). In addition, from time to time we may invest in the equity securities of privately held middle market companies.
    

Second, we have invested in asset management companies (Katonah Debt Advisors, L.L.C. and Trimaran Advisors, L.L.C., collectively the "Asset Manager Affiliates") which manage collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs").
    

Third, we invest in debt and subordinated securities issued by CLOs ("CLO Fund Securities"). These CLO Fund Securities are primarily managed by our Asset Manager Affiliates, but from time-to-time we make investments in CLO Fund Securities managed by other asset managers. The CLOs typically invest in broadly syndicated loans, high-yield bonds and other credit instruments.
    

        The Company may also invest in other investments such as loans to larger, publicly-traded companies, high-yield bonds and distressed debt securities. The Company may also receive warrants or options to purchase common stock in connection with its debt investments.
    
OUR DEBT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

        In our Debt Securities Portfolio, our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from the investments made in senior secured term loans, mezzanine debt and selected equity investments in privately-held middle market companies. We define the middle market as comprising companies with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of $10 million to $50 million and/or total debt of $25 million to $150 million.
    

        We primarily invest in first and second lien term loans which, because of their priority in a company's capital structure, we expect will have lower default rates and higher rates of recovery of principal if there is a default and therefore we expect them to generate a stable stream of interest income. We also invest in mezzanine debt, which generally is subordinated to senior loans and is generally unsecured. While our primary investment focus is making loans to, and selected equity investments in, privately-held middle market companies, we may also invest in other investments such as loans to larger, publicly-traded companies, high-yield bonds and distressed debt securities. We may also receive warrants or options to purchase common stock in connection with our debt investments.
    
OUR ASSET MANAGER AFFILIATES

        With respect to our Asset Manager Affiliates investment, we expect to receive recurring dividend distributions and to generate capital appreciation through the addition of new CLO Funds managed by our Asset Manager Affiliates. The Asset Manager Affiliates manage CLO Funds that invest in broadly syndicated loans, high-yield bonds and other credit instruments. Collectively, the Asset Manager Affiliates have approximately $3 billion of par value assets under management. The Asset Manager Affiliates are registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and are managed independently from the Company by a separate portfolio management team. 
    

See also: Trimaran Advisors

OUR CLO FUND SECURITIES INVESTMENTS

        Our investments in CLO Fund Securities, which are primarily made up of a minority investment in the subordinated securities or preferred stock of CLO Funds raised and managed by our Asset Manager Affiliates, are anticipated to provide the Company with recurring cash distributions and complement the growth of our Asset Manager Affiliates. 
    
OUR STRUCTURE

        Because we are internally managed by our executive officers under the supervision of our Board of Directors and do not depend on a third party investment advisor, we do not pay investment advisory fees, but instead incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals. We believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a beneficial operating expense structure when compared to other publicly-traded and privately-held investment firms which are externally managed, and our internally managed structure allows us the opportunity to leverage our non-interest operating expenses as we grow our investment portfolio.

Welcome to KCAP.


        We are an internally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that is regulated as a business development company or "BDC" under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We have three principal areas of investment:
    

Debt Securities Portfolio
Asset Manager Affiliates
CLO Fund Securities


        We believe that we have significant advantages over other providers of capital in the markets in which we compete:
    


Internally managed structure and significant management resources. We are internally managed by our executive officers under the supervision of our Board of Directors and therefore we do not pay investment advisory fees.  All of our income is available to pay our operating costs, which include employing investment and portfolio management professionals, and making distributions to our stockholders.
        

Multiple sourcing capabilities for middle market investments. We have multiple sources of loans, mezzanine investments and equity investments through our industry relationships.
        

Disciplined investment process. We employ a rigorous credit review and due diligence process which our senior management has developed over an average of approximately 25 years of investing experience.
        

Investments across a wide variety of industries. Our Debt Security Portfolio is spread across 25 different industries.
        

Significant equity ownership and alignment of incentives. Our Directors and senior management team have a significant equity interest in the Company, ensuring that their incentives are strongly aligned with those of our stockholders.
        

100% ownership of Asset Manager Affiliates. Our CLO Fund investments and management of those securities through the Asset Manager Affiliates provide us with a competitive advantage by creating synergies with our investment operations and a source of recurring dividend cash flows.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Welcome to KCAP.


        We are an internally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that is regulated as a business development company or "BDC" under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We have three principal areas of investment:
    

Debt Securities Portfolio
Asset Manager Affiliates
CLO Fund Securities


        We believe that we have significant advantages over other providers of capital in the markets in which we compete:
    


Internally managed structure and significant management resources. We are internally managed by our executive officers under the supervision of our Board of Directors and therefore we do not pay investment advisory fees.  All of our income is available to pay our operating costs, which include employing investment and portfolio management professionals, and making distributions to our stockholders.
        

Multiple sourcing capabilities for middle market investments. We have multiple sources of loans, mezzanine investments and equity investments through our industry relationships.
        

Disciplined investment process. We employ a rigorous credit review and due diligence process which our senior management has developed over an average of approximately 25 years of investing experience.
        

Investments across a wide variety of industries. Our Debt Security Portfolio is spread across 25 different industries.
        

Significant equity ownership and alignment of incentives. Our Directors and senior management team have a significant equity interest in the Company, ensuring that their incentives are strongly aligned with those of our stockholders.
        

100% ownership of Asset Manager Affiliates. Our CLO Fund investments and management of those securities through the Asset Manager Affiliates provide us with a competitive advantage by creating synergies with our investment operations and a source of recurring dividend cash flows.

					Full Description



KCAP Financial, Inc., incorporated on August 8, 2006, is an internally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company. The Company has approximately three principal areas of investments. First, the Company originates, structures and invests in senior secured term loans and mezzanine debt in privately-held middle market companies (the debt securities portfolio). In addition, the Company may invest in the equity securities of privately held middle market companies. Second, the Company invests in asset management companies (the Asset Manager Affiliates) that manage collateralized loan obligation funds (CLO Funds). Third, the Company invests in debt and subordinated securities issued by CLOs (CLO fund securities). These CLO fund securities are managed by its Asset Manager Affiliates, but from time-to-time the Company makes investments in CLO Fund Securities managed by other asset managers. The CLO funds typically invest in syndicated loans, high-yield bonds and other credit instruments. The Company may also invest in other investments, such as loans to larger, publicly-traded companies, high-yield bonds and distressed debt securities. The Company may also receive warrants or options to purchase common stock in connection with its debt investments.In the Company's debt securities portfolio, its investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation from the investments in senior secured term loans, mezzanine debt and selected equity investments in privately-held middle market companies. The Company invests in first and second lien term loans. The investments in its debt securities portfolio are all or predominantly below investment grade, and have speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. From its Asset Manager Affiliates investment, the Company expects to receive recurring cash distributions and generate capital appreciation through the addition of new CLO Funds managed by its Asset Manager Affiliates. The Company's investments in CLO Fund Securities, which are made up of minority investments in the subordinated securities or preferred stock of CLO Funds raised and managed by its Asset Manager Affiliates, are anticipated to provide the Company with recurring cash distributions and complement the growth of its investment in the Asset Manager Affiliates. The Company invests in various industries, including aerospace and defense; beverage, food and tobacco; banking, finance, insurance and real estate; capital equipment; chemicals, plastics and rubber; construction and building; containers, packaging and glass; forest products and paper; healthcare and pharmaceuticals, and telecommunications.
