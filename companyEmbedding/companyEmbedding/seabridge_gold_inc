The Bubble in Financial Assets Continues

Source: Streetwise Reports

 

July 14, 2017 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Rudi Fronk and Jim Anthony explore the connection between market bubbles and the price of gold.




We thought that when the gold price broke above its five-year downtrend in early June, it would establish an upward trend. We were wrong. Another false start, it seems. The bubble in financial assets continues.
We think understanding bubbles is the key to discerning the big moves in the gold price. The west has documented seven financial manias or bubbles in the last 250 years. These bubbles peaked and then collapsed in 1720, 1772, 1825, 1873, 1929, 2000 and 2008. In every case, gold performed relatively less well in the expansion years of the bubble and outperformed every other asset class in real terms in the contraction phase. 
In the recent manias, we also know that gold stocks substantially outperform gold during the contraction phase because operating costs fall.
Let's look at the recent examples. In 2001, the dot.com mania collapsed and gold soared to new highs. In 2008 a bubble in housing led to a collapse of the financial system and once again gold took off to new highs. In 2012, the Fed succeeded in creating yet another bubble in stocks and bonds after dropping rates to zero and flooding the system with liquidity via an alphabet of programs, chief among them QE (quantitative easing). Gold performance has since fallen well behind stocks and bonds in the expansion phase of the current mania. 
As we have often noted, gold is the ultimate risk-averse protector of wealth. And bubbles are the ultimate expression of risk-taking. Risk–taking is still the order of the day. 
What's a bubble?
Bubbles are periods of widespread high-risk investor behavior marked by extreme valuations and extremely bullish sentiment unsupported by economic facts, ending in a crash. Bubbles have three necessary components:
1) A credit boom: Investors use large amounts of leverage to enhance returns. Investors reach for yield. Debt substantially increases risk. The results is forced liquidation and a liquidity panic when markets fall.
2) A narrative: The extreme valuations are explained by a narrative that says "this time is different." The dot.com bubble was supported by the expectation that Internet technology would drive a New Economy of faster growth, amazing productivity gains and higher profits. The housing bubble was supported by the supposed fact that housing prices could not fall, that a national housing bubble was not possible and that a new paradigm of risk-reducing, AAA-ranked MBS could virtually eliminate risk. Today's everything/everywhere bubble is supported by the supposed ability of central banks to manage their economies and mitigate financial system risks by keeping interest rates very low and liquidity very high.
3) Time: The third element is a long period of growth, with no recessions, low market volatility and accommodative monetary policy. Hyman Minsky noted in his Stability Hypothesis that the longer the period of economic and financial stability, the greater the resulting instability. Recessions especially clear the system of unproductive debt and the deleveraging reduces risk. Otherwise, Hedged Finance (in which debt is backed by a growing ability to repay) is followed by Speculative Finance (in which debt must be rolled over but the interest is covered by earnings) to Ponzi Finance (in which the interest is paid from fresh borrowings). That's why bubbles always occur near the end of long economic expansions, when the economy is already slowing down but risk-taking is at its peak.
The key question to be asked now by investors is whether or not financial markets are truly in a bubble or just a wild bull market. These alternatives reward very different strategies. We will provide our view in the next installment.

Seabridge Gold



































Seabridge Gold's resource base of gold, copper and silver is one of the world's largest. Our principal projects are located in Canada. Our objective is to grow resource and reserve ownership per share. Our risk-reducing strategy: acquire North American deposits; expand them through exploration; move them to reserves through engineering; and sell or joint venture them to established producers for mine construction and operation.

FEATURED PROJECTS:

KSM
The KSM Project is one of the largest undeveloped gold projects in the world measured by reserves. An updated Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS) estimates proven and probable reserves total 38.8 million ounces of gold and 10.2 billion pounds of copper (see table). The KSM Project has completed a joint harmonized environmental assessment review as outlined by the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. In July, 2014 the project received its Environmental Assessment Certificate from the provincial authorities. Final federal approval was received in December, 2014. For more information, see this fact sheet.
Current Programs:
Exploration continues to produce major improvements in the economic and environmental parameters of KSM. From 2013 to 2016, Seabridge successfully targeted higher grade zones beneath KSM's near surface porphyry deposits, resulting in the discovery of Deep Kerr (2013) and the Iron Cap Lower Zone (2014). These discoveries led to sizeable resource expansions of higher grade material configured for low cost block cave underground mining. This mining technique substantially reduces the project footprint and waste generation. 
Based on these exploration successes, we announced an updated Preliminary Feasibility Study on September 19, 2016 (see news release). This PFS did not include the higher grade Deep Kerr and Iron Cap Lower Zone deposits because their resources are inferred only. These deposits were integrated into a new PEA study of KSM released on October 6, 2016 (see news release). This study confirmed significant further gains for KSM including estimated Base Case Life of Mine Operating Costs (net of Cu and Ag credits) of negative US$179 per ounce of gold produced. Total Cost (including all capital, operating and closure costs and net of credits) was estimated at US$358 per ounce of gold produced. The new design also results in a much smaller footprint; 2.4 billion tonnes (or 81%) less waste rock is generated compared to the 2016 PFS.
Exploration this year is expected to generate further gains. In 2016, the last exploration hole drilled (IC-16-62) made two important discoveries at the Iron Cap deposit: the down plunge extension of Iron Cap’s higher grade core zone where a 556 meter intercept averaged 0.83g/T Au and 0.24 % Cu; and a new distinctly separate mineralized zone near surface which returned a 61 meter interval averaging 1.2 g/T gold and 0.95% copper. 
In 2017, we will drill additional holes at Iron Cap designed to (i) fill-in and expand the down dip extension of the core zone found in hole IC-16-62, and (ii) obtain additional pierce points into the exciting new discovery made at the top of IC-16-62 to determine if it could be KSM’s fifth major deposit. We expect to add significant new gold and copper resources at grades above our reserves. KSM is already the world’s largest undeveloped gold deposit measured by reserves but we believe its full potential is still to be determined.

 

Iskut
The Iskut Project was obtained with the closing of Seabridge’s acquisition of SnipGold Corp. in June, 2016. The property is located in northwestern British Columbia, about 110 km northwest of Stewart, BC and 30 km by air from Seabridge’s KSM Project. The Iskut property consists of a contiguous block of 100 BC Mineral Claims, 2 Mineral Leases and 13 Crown Grants covering 29,436 hectares (294 km2) situated in the Liard Mining Division.
The property includes the former high grade gold Johnny Mountain Mine and the copper-gold Bronson Slope deposit. Seabridge is reviewing past resource estimates for Iskut to determine what can be reported. 
Current Programs:
Seabridge completed its first exploration program at Iskut in 2016. The multi-pronged program achieved its primary objective: identifying a prospective new porphyry copper-gold system with a potentially intact epithermal precious metals zone at its top, for drill testing in 2017.   
The untested target, known as Quartz Rise, has all the hallmarks of a porphyry lithocap, a geological feature found at the top of major porphyry systems throughout the world. A lithocap is a clay-silica-rich alteration feature which is a product of hydrothermal fluids escaping at the top of a porphyry mineralizing system. Typically, these features act as a cover obscuring structurally-controlled epithermal gold and silver systems that evolve from intrusive-related porphyry systems. 
The Quartz Rise target has the right high temperature crystalline clay-silica alteration for a lithocap and a coincident magnetotelluric anomaly with the appropriate signature. Historical data from magnetic surveys support the lithocap hypothesis and iron mineral ratio analysis used successfully in the industry to identify productive lithocaps is also positive. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the surface of the lithocap contains visible gold. Collectively, these data point to a large and compelling target for the potential discovery of an intermediate-sulfidation epithermal precious metals system overlying porphyry copper-gold mineralization.
Seabridge completed a limited amount of drilling in 2016 at the old high grade Johnny Mountain gold mine to test detailed ore control concepts on a known deposit while proceeding with the comprehensive program. Drilling confirmed the key structures that control mineralization and the likely elevation where higher grades can be expected.  
The old mine is found at the bottom of the slope and the high grade gold mineralization does not continue to depth. The Johnny Mountain mine is on the edge of a larger system and lies near the bottom of the productive gold-bearing zone which was largely eroded away by glaciation. The nearby, higher elevation Quartz Rise resisted glaciation and remains largely intact in part due to its higher silica content. The upper parts of a porphyry system with higher grades of precious minerals may lie intact above the Johnny Mountain mine and under the lithocap on Quartz Rise. This target will be drill tested this summer. (See image below)

Seabridge Gold is a Toronto-based North American resource exploration company. It owns Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell (KSM), a copper-gold-silver-molybdenum porphyry project in northern British Columbia. KSM's proven-probable reserves amount to 38.2 million ounces of gold, 191 million ounces of silver, 9.988 billion pounds of copper and 213 million pounds of molybdenum. Gold reserves at the Courageous Lake deposit total 6.5 million ounces.[1] The property is part of a bigger deposit containing another gold project known as Snowfield (Pretium Resources); the entire deposit is the largest undeveloped gold deposit in North America.[2] The KSM project will cost more than $4.7 billion to build but funding is not yet in place.[3]

Properties/KSM[edit]

The 100% owned KSM project located in north-western British Columbia has proven and probable reserves of 38.2 million ounces of gold and 9.9 billion pounds of copper (2.16 billion tonnes averaging 0.55 gpt gold and 0.21% copper),[4] making it the largest gold reserve in Canada and one of the largest in the world. The project's EA Application received provincial government approval in July, 2014.[5] The 100% owned Courageous Lake project located in Northwest Territories contains one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in Canada.
History and major projects[edit]
The company was initially incorporated as Chopper Mines Incorporated on September 14, 1979. It was renamed Dragoon Resources Ltd on November 9, 1984, and then Seabridge Resources Ltd on May 20, 1998, before adopting its current name on June 20, 2002.[6]
KSM[edit]
In June 2000 Seabridge purchased the Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell (KSM) property from Placer Dome for 500,000 common shares and royalty payments capped at C$4.5 million. The project consisted of two contiguous claim blocks in the Iskut-Stikine region in British Columbia, approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi) southeast of the Eskay Creek Mine. When Seabridge acquired it, the project hosted two distinct deposits which were modelled separately by Placer Dome (CLA) Limited. At the two deposits, Placer Dome had estimated an historical indicated gold resource of 2.1 million ounces, with an additional 1.3 million ounces of gold in the inferred resource category as well as 2.8 billion pounds of copper resources. KSM's resources stand at 38.2 million ounces of gold, 191 million ounces of silver, 9.988 billion pounds of copper and 213 million pounds of molybdenum.[4]
In May 2002, Seabridge purchased 100% of its second largest gold property, Courageous Lake in the NWT from Newmont Mining and Total Resources for $5.5 million plus a 2% NSR royalty. The project at that time reported an historical resource of 5.9 million ounces of gold.
Seabridge began exploring KSM in 2006. After five years of drilling, Seabridge reported a new NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate in February 2012 which estimated measured and indicated resources totalling 49.0 million ounces of gold, 12.7 billion pounds of copper, 261 million ounces of silver and 304 million pounds of molybdenum in 2.8 billion tonnes grading 0.55 gpt gold and 0.21% copper.[7] An updated Preliminary Feasibility Study released on May 14, 2012 reported reserves of 38.2 million ounces of gold, 9.9 billion pounds of copper, 191 million ounces of silver and 213 million pounds of molybdenum in 2.2 billion tonnes grading 0.55 gpt gold and 0.21% copper.[8] The new PFS included engineering changes designed to increase the production rate, facilitate permitting and enhance economics. NPVs, IRRs and capital paybacks substantially improved over the 2011 PFS. Base case life of mine cash operating costs fell significantly to $141 per ounce of gold produced (see executive summary). Further core drilling in August, 2013 discovered a very large, high-grade core zone at Deep Kerr. An initial NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was released for the new Deep Kerr deposit which confirmed an inferred resource of 515 million tonnes grading 0.53% copper and 0.36 g/T gold for 6.1 billion pounds of copper and 5.9 million ounces of gold.[9]
The KSM Project is undergoing a joint harmonized environmental assessment review as outlined by the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. In February, 2013 Seabridge submitted its EA/EIS Application to the provincial and federal regulatory authorities and the Application was accepted into the formal review process in June, 2013 after meeting the requirements of the screening process. In July, 2014 the project received its Environmental Assessment Certificate from the provincial authorities. Seabridge also expects to receive final federal approval in 2014.
In November 2016 Seabridge received a licence from the Government of Canada required for the construction, operation and maintenance of the Water Storage Facility and associated ancillary water works for KSM. [10]
Courageous Lake[edit]
At Courageous Lake, after six years of work, an updated PFS completed in July, 2012 estimated proven and probable reserves of 6.5 million ounces of gold (91.1 million tonnes grading 2.2 gpt), an average annual production of 385,000 ounces at an average cost of $780 per ounce and a mine life of 15 years.[11] An $8.5 million exploration program in 2012 focused on finding a second major deposit along the Greenstone Belt.[12] This program discovered the Walsh Lake deposit.[13] An initial resource for the Walsh Lake deposit was announced in early 2014 totalling 4.62 million tonnes grading 3.24 g/T and containing 482,000 ounces of gold, all inferred.[14]
Minor projects[edit]
Red Mountain (Stewart, British Columbia) – Acquired in 2001 from North American Metals Corp. for 800,000 common shares.[6]
Quartz Mountain (Oregon) – Acquired December 2001. This project has been optioned to Alamos Gold for a total consideration of $21 million.[15]

KSM's resources stand at 38.2 million ounces of gold, 191 million ounces of silver, 9.988 billion pounds of copper and 213 million pounds of molybdenum.[4]
In May 2002, Seabridge purchased 100% of its second largest gold property, Courageous Lake in the NWT from Newmont Mining and Total Resources for $5.5 million plus a 2% NSR royalty. The project at that time reported an historical resource of 5.9 million ounces of gold.
Seabridge began exploring KSM in 2006. After five years of drilling, Seabridge reported a new NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate in February 2012 which estimated measured and indicated resources totalling 49.0 million ounces of gold, 12.7 billion pounds of copper, 261 million ounces of silver and 304 million pounds of molybdenum in 2.8 billion tonnes grading 0.55 gpt gold and 0.21% copper.[7] An updated Preliminary Feasibility Study released on May 14, 2012 reported reserves of 38.2 million ounces of gold, 9.9 billion pounds of copper, 191 million ounces of silver and 213 million pounds of molybdenum in 2.2 billion tonnes grading 0.55 gpt gold and 0.21% copper.[8] The new PFS included engineering changes designed to increase the production rate, facilitate permitting and enhance economics. NPVs, IRRs and capital paybacks substantially improved over the 2011 PFS. Base case life of mine cash operating costs fell significantly to $141 per ounce of gold produced (see executive summary). Further core drilling in August, 2013 discovered a very large, high-grade core zone at Deep Kerr. An initial NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was released for the new Deep Kerr deposit which confirmed an inferred resource of 515 million tonnes grading 0.53% copper and 0.36 g/T gold for 6.1 billion pounds of copper and 5.9 million ounces of gold.[9]
The KSM Project is undergoing a joint harmonized environmental assessment review as outlined by the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. In February, 2013 Seabridge submitted its EA/EIS Application to the provincial and federal regulatory authorities and the Application was accepted into the formal review process in June, 2013 after meeting the requirements of the screening process. In July, 2014 the project received its Environmental Assessment Certificate from the provincial authorities. Seabridge also expects to receive final federal approval in 2014.
In November 2016 Seabridge received a licence from the Government of Canada required for the construction, operation and maintenance of the Water Storage Facility and associated ancillary water works for KSM. [10]
Courageous Lake[edit]
At Courageous Lake, after six years of work, an updated PFS completed in July, 2012 estimated proven and probable reserves of 6.5 million ounces of gold (91.1 million tonnes grading 2.2 gpt), an average annual production of 385,000 ounces at an average cost of $780 per ounce and a mine life of 15 years.[11] An $8.5 million exploration program in 2012 focused on finding a second major deposit along the Greenstone Belt.[12] This program discovered the Walsh Lake deposit.[13] An initial resource for the Walsh Lake deposit was announced in early 2014 totalling 4.62 million tonnes grading 3.24 g/T and containing 482,000 ounces of gold, all inferred.[14]
Minor projects[edit]
Red Mountain (Stewart, British Columbia) – Acquired in 2001 from North American Metals Corp. for 800,000 common shares.[6]
Quartz Mountain (Oregon) – Acquired December 2001. This project has been optioned to Alamos Gold for a total consideration of $21 million.[15]

Seabridge Gold is a Toronto-based North American resource exploration company. It owns Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell (KSM), a copper-gold-silver-molybdenum porphyry project in northern British Columbia. KSM's proven-probable reserves amount to 38.2 million ounces of gold, 191 million ounces of silver, 9.988 billion pounds of copper and 213 million pounds of molybdenum. Gold reserves at the Courageous Lake deposit total 6.5 million ounces.[1] The property is part of a bigger deposit containing another gold project known as Snowfield (Pretium Resources); the entire deposit is the largest undeveloped gold deposit in North America.[2] The KSM project will cost more than $4.7 billion to build but funding is not yet in place.[3]

Properties/KSM[edit]

The 100% owned KSM project located in north-western British Columbia has proven and probable reserves of 38.2 million ounces of gold and 9.9 billion pounds of copper (2.16 billion tonnes averaging 0.55 gpt gold and 0.21% copper),[4] making it the largest gold reserve in Canada and one of the largest in the world. The project's EA Application received provincial government approval in July, 2014.[5] The 100% owned Courageous Lake project located in Northwest Territories contains one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in Canada.
History and major projects[edit]
The company was initially incorporated as Chopper Mines Incorporated on September 14, 1979. It was renamed Dragoon Resources Ltd on November 9, 1984, and then Seabridge Resources Ltd on May 20, 1998, before adopting its current name on June 20, 2002.[6]
KSM[edit]
In June 2000 Seabridge purchased the Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell (KSM) property from Placer Dome for 500,000 common shares and royalty payments capped at C$4.5 million. The project consisted of two contiguous claim blocks in the Iskut-Stikine region in British Columbia, approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi) southeast of the Eskay Creek Mine. When Seabridge acquired it, the project hosted two distinct deposits which were modelled separately by Placer Dome (CLA) Limited. At the two deposits, Placer Dome had estimated an historical indicated gold resource of 2.1 million ounces, with an additional 1.3 million ounces of gold in the inferred resource category as well as 2.8 billion pounds of copper resources. KSM's resources stand at 38.2 million ounces of gold, 191 million ounces of silver, 9.988 billion pounds of copper and 213 million pounds of molybdenum.[4]

Seabridge Gold Inc. SEA:TSX; SA:NYSE.MKT 

































Streetwise Reports The Gold Report The Energy Report The Life Sciences Report


The Gold ReportThe Energy ReportThe Life Sciences Report

































SEA:TSX; SA:NYSE.MKT





                
                    Seabridge Gold Inc.
                










                Seabridge Gold Inc. is designed to provide its shareholders with exceptional leverage to a rising gold price. From 1999 through 2002, when the gold price was lower, Seabridge acquired nine North American projects with substantial gold resources, including Courageous Lake and KSM. Subsequent exploration by Seabridge has significantly expanded its acquired gold resource base.

Seabridge considers each of its common shares to represent an indirect ownership interest in its reserves and resources. Our aim is to increase the value of this ownership interest by growing reserves and resources faster than shares outstanding. Project acquisitions, exploration and engineering programs are carefully designed and monitored to ensure that equity dilution required to fund these activities is more than offset by additional reserves and resources.

Seabridge is pursuing three value-enhancing strategies. First, the Company continues to search for gold projects in North America which would be accretive in terms of gold resources. Second, Seabridge funds exploration and engineering work considered likely to expand resources and upgrade them to reserves. Third, Seabridge sells or partners its projects when they reach the production stage, to limit risk and share dilution.

Expert Comments:










Explorer Purchases Nevada Property from Legendary Investor John Paulson and Gains Paulson & Co as Major Shareholder
				(7/3/17)

			    		As this gold explorer expands its base into Nevada by acquiring the Snowstorm property from John Paulson, it also moves forward with exploration and permitting at its KSM project in northwestern British Columbia.

      Mike Kozak, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(4/27/17)

		
		"We are resuming research coverage of Seabridge Gold Inc. following the closing of its CA$37.7M equity financing. . .the capital injection will support a robust exploration program at KSM, with results at Iron Cap in particular likely to serve as catalysts for the share price. Maintain Buy."
		
		












  
      Raj Ray, National Bank of Canada 
  

(3/30/17)

		
		"Seabridge Gold Inc. announced bought deal offering of 1M (1.1M including over-allotment option) common shares at $14.3/share and concurrent private placement of 1M (1.1M including over-allotment
option) flow-through common shares at $20/share for aggregate gross proceeds of $34.3M ($37.7 including over-allotment). . .proceeds from the financings grant the company flexibility to proceed with ongoing exploration at the flagship KSM project and the recently acquired Iskut project."

		
		
















Iskut Could Be as Important to Seabridge as KSM
				(3/23/17)

			    		Seabridge's Iskut project has the potential to be another success story like its flagship, 100%-owned KSM project.

      Don Maclean, Paradigm Capital
  

(3/16/17)

		
		"With the summer drilling season approaching, Seabridge Gold Inc. is focusing on two key exploration programs: continuously improving the massive 100%-owned KSM project and exploring the nearby Iskut project for higher-grade epithermal mineralization with deep porphyry potential. . .given that it is relatively uncommon to find a fully preserved system (from porphyry to lithocap), we will be eagerly watching to see how the Quartz Rise target will play out."

		
		









  Jeffrey Briggs, Singular Research 

(3/13/17)

		
		"Seabridge Gold Inc. has made advances on several fronts over the past few months, including a resource expansion at its flagship KSM project; the company has also recently acquired a new project, the SnowStorm project, with high upside and minimal dilution for shareholders. We are maintaining our Buy rating."
		
		









  
      Tony Lesiak, Canaccord Genuity
  

(3/8/17)

		
		"We continue to believe that Seabridge Gold Inc.'s 100%-owned KSM project will find a development partner. . .while a development partner for KSM remains the key rerating catalyst for the company's shares, in our view, we also highlight Seabridge's exceptional historical leverage to the gold price and the improving exploration potential."
		
		












  
      Gary Baschuk, PearTree Securities
  

(3/2/17)

		
		"Seabridge Gold Inc. announced an update to the Inferred mineral resources on the Deep Kerr deposit at the 100%-owned Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell (KSM) project in northwestern British Columbia. The resources were calculated assuming a block cave mining method and resulted in an additional 3 Moz gold and 2.1 Blb copper above the Inferred estimate announced in the 43-101 compliant technical report on KSM of September 2016."
		
		
















Seabridge Gold Ups the Ante with Nevada Acquisition Deal and Updated Resource at Deep Kerr
				(2/23/17)

			    		Seabridge Gold's recent announcement of an increased resource estimate at its KSM project caught the attention of one analyst, and follows another announcement that the company intends to purchase a project that potentially intersects three of Nevada's well-known gold trends.

      Raj Ray, National Bank Financial
  

(2/16/17)

		
		"Seabridge Gold Inc. announced an updated inferred resource estimate from the Deep Kerr Deposit at its 100%-owned KSM project in British Columbia. Deep Kerr is one of the three ore bodies (Kerr, Sulphurets and Mitchell) that make up the KSM project and is of relatively higher grade. . .the KSM project provides attractive optionality and is one of the few fully permitted large-scale projects in a stable jurisdiction."
		
		









  Cantor Fitzgerald 

(1/23/17)

		
		"We  favor  high-quality  geopolitically  stable  gold/silver  developers  and  smaller tier  operators  capable  of  demonstrating  output growth in the "sweet spot" of the production curve.  Our preferred equities include Seabridge Gold Inc., which we rate a Speculative Buy." 
		
		









  
      Mike Kozak, Cantor Fitzgerald
  

(12/12/16)

		
		"To call Seabridge Gold Inc.�s 100%-owned KSM Au-Cu project 'massive' is an understatement. In terms of Proven and Probable gold and copper reserves, KSM ranks as the largest undeveloped mining project globally. . .the sheer size/scale of KSM (+1.2 MMoz AuEq/yr over a mine-life of +50 years) makes it a truly unique, sought-after asset, and one that is highly likely to attract a number of potential top-tier JV partners that will help fund the initial capex hurdle. . .we are initiating coverage of Seabridge  with a Speculative Buy recommendation."
		
		









  
      Don Maclean, Paradigm Capital
  

(10/26/16)

		
		"We believe Seabridge provides investors with ownership in one of the most strategically compelling and prolific copper‐gold projects in the world, the KSM project in BC, at one of the lowest market caps per ounce to the investor. . .a new PEA, released on Oct. 6, outlines further game-changing improvements. . .the PEA shows better economics. . .steady improvements, as encapsulated in the PEA, are hastening the day when a senior miner or partnership will seek to buy KSM. . .long-term minded investors with a positive view for the price of gold and copper might consider owning SEA now."
		
		









  
      Tony Lesiak, Canaccord Genuity
  

(10/7/16)

		
		"Seabridge Gold Inc.'s KSM will be of strategic interest to both a major gold miner and a diversified miner, noting the increased copper bias (higher grade copper in Deep Kerr). A fully permitted project in a politically stable jurisdiction (Canada) producing +1Mozpa Au and +300Mlbpa Cu in the first 7 years of operation will, in our opinion, not go unnoticed. . .our target price of C$25 continues to assume a 50 percent development risk discount." 
		
		












  
      Raj Ray, National Bank Financial
  

(10/7/16)

		
		"Seabridge Gold Inc.'s flagship asset is the KSM project which hosts four large copper-gold porphyry deposits with total reserves of 10.2 billion lbs of copper, 38.8 million oz of gold and significant amount of silver and molybdenum by-products. . .the importance of the KSM project lies in its significant scale (one of the largest undeveloped copper-gold deposits) at grades that are comparable to currently producing large porphyry deposits around the world. . .we maintain Sector Perform rating but lowering target to $15.50(was $17.50). . .our target is based on 0.95x our est. NAVPS 10% of $16.28(was $18.41)." 

		
		









  
      Tony Lesiak, Canaccord Genuity
  

(9/21/16)

		
		"Seabridge Gold Inc. announced the results of an updated PFS for its KSM project; the project showcased an 8% after-tax IRR at $1,230/oz gold and $2.75/lb copper. The weaker CAD/USD (-17%) rate utilized almost completely offset higher capital parameters (+14%) and weaker gold (-8%) and copper (-20%) price assumptions. . .we note that the project is fully permitted, is located in one of the world's best mining jurisdictions, and has longer-term optionality (with a +40 year reserve life or +100-year total resource life) that is not recognized in IRR or NAV analysis."
		
		












  
      Raj Ray, National Bank Financial
  

(9/19/16)

		
		"We expect the results of the upcoming PEA will include a positive updated resource estimate at Seabridge Gold Inc's KSM gold-silver-copper-Molybdenum project. . .Note that both the updated 2016 PFS and initial 2012 PFS vary from our assumptions considerably given the fact that neither PFS accounts for upside potential at Deep Kerr and Iron Cap Lower Zone. . .We assume 50/50 open-pit/underground production with two open-pit and three underground block-cave operations vs.
the company�s estimate for 70/30 for the PFS with three open-pit and two underground operations. . .We maintain our Sector Perform rating and $17.50 target."
		
		












  
      Charles Gibson, Edison Investment Research
  

(8/30/16)

		
		"Comprising 64.0Moz in total, Seabridge Gold Inc.'s Kerr-Sulphurets-Mitchell (KSM) is the largest undeveloped gold deposit in North America and among the top 10 in the world, on a par with Pascua-Lama, Donlin, Pueblo Viejo, Boddington and Penasquito. . .Seabridge has been granted permits for the first 2.5 years of construction and is working on the balance. An update to the PFS is expected imminently, while subsequent drilling has been successful in identifying high-grade zones beneath the surface porphyry deposits (Deep Kerr and the Iron Cap Lower zone deposit)."


		
		









  
      Tony Lesiak, Canaccord Genuity
  

(6/22/16)

		
		"Seabridge Gold Inc. completed the acquisition of SnipGold, which has a 100% interest in the 2.2 Moz Iskut Project, located in the Golden Triangle region of northwestern BC, 20km from SEA's KSM Project. . .Overall we view the Snip acquisition favorably, given the large (294sq km) highly prospective land package, historic high grade (HG) profile (+25g/t Au), and potential synergies with KSM. . .The 2016 program at Snip is expected to step out on structures on the Johnny Mtn. trend (7m @ 46.5g/t historic hole) and delineate the source area for the multiounce boulders at McFadden."
		
		












  
      Eric Lemieux, ZZZZZPearTree Securities
  

(4/21/16)

		
		"On April 19, 2016, Seabridge Gold Inc. announced an agreement to acquire SnipGold Corp., a Canadian exploration company focused on exploration in the Golden Triangle area of northwestern British Columbia; SnipGold's primary asset (Iskut project) is a contiguous block of ground in excess of 286km2 assembled since 2005. Seabridge's KSM project has geological similarities to the Iskut project, host to the Bronson Slope Porphyry deposit. . .the proposed transaction should enhance SEA's exploration potential in an area where its technical team has built up significant expertise." 
		
		












  
      Gwen  Preston, Resource Maven
(4/20/16)

		
		"Seabridge Gold Inc. is buying Snipgold in a $10M deal aimed at SGG's 
Iskut property; Iskut is 40km northwest of Seabridge's KSM project, which is adjacent to Pretium's Brucejack property. The area is known as British Columbia's Golden Triangle. . .the potential to discover another Valley of the Kings or another Deep Kerr along this Red Line is what has attracted so many explorers to the Golden Triangle�and it is undoubtedly what compelled Seabridge to acquire Snipgold." 


		
		









  Singular Research 

(4/8/16)

		
		"Seabridge Gold Inc. continues to make progress at KSM, announcing a large increase to the mineral resource at Deep Kerr. . .We expect additional increases in mineral resource at Deep Kerr as it remains open in most directions. . .We are maintaining our BUY rating and raising our price target of $16.00. . Seabridge announced a large increase in the inferred mineral resource at Deep Kerr, adding 3.2 Moz gold and 2.1 Mlb copper. . .This outpaces the 1.6M flow-through shares issued to finance the drilling program, keeping inline with management's objective of increasing ounces of gold/share. "
		
		









  
      Tony Lesiak, Canaccord Genuity
  

(3/8/16)

		
		"Seabridge Gold Inc. announced a positive update to the Deep Kerr underground resource. . .The Deep Kerr resource increased 29% from 782Mt to 1.01Bt and remains open for further expansion at depth and along strike. . . On a gold equivalent basis the Deep Kerr resource grade is 32% above the KSM project average. . .KSM remains the world's largest undeveloped gold resource and is fully permitted. . .We reiterate our SPECULATIVE BUY rating and have increased our target to C$20.00 from the C$15.50 target price."
		
		









  Matthew DiLallo, Motley Fool
(3/4/16)

		
		"Higher gold prices are important for gold producers because they have so much leverage to its price both to generate cash flow as well as its impact on the value of their reserves. Seabridge Gold Inc., for example, has the highest per-share leverage of any gold producer with 0.86 reserve ounces per share, compared to 0.15 from its nearest peer."

Seabridge Gold is a Toronto-based North American resource exploration company. It owns Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell (KSM), a copper-gold-silver-molybdenum porphyry project in northern British Columbia. KSM's proven-probable reserves amount to 38.2 million ounces of gold, 191 million ounces of silver, 9.988 billion pounds of copper and 213 million pounds of molybdenum. Gold reserves at the Courageous Lake deposit total 6.5 million ounces.[1] The property is part of a bigger deposit containing another gold project known as Snowfield (Pretium Resources); the entire deposit is the largest undeveloped gold deposit in North America.[2] The KSM project will cost more than $4.7 billion to build but funding is not yet in place.[3]

Properties/KSM[edit]

The 100% owned KSM project located in north-western British Columbia has proven and probable reserves of 38.2 million ounces of gold and 9.9 billion pounds of copper (2.16 billion tonnes averaging 0.55 gpt gold and 0.21% copper),[4] making it the largest gold reserve in Canada and one of the largest in the world. The project's EA Application received provincial government approval in July, 2014.[5] The 100% owned Courageous Lake project located in Northwest Territories contains one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in Canada.
History and major projects[edit]
The company was initially incorporated as Chopper Mines Incorporated on September 14, 1979. It was renamed Dragoon Resources Ltd on November 9, 1984, and then Seabridge Resources Ltd on May 20, 1998, before adopting its current name on June 20, 2002.[6]
KSM[edit]
In June 2000 Seabridge purchased the Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell (KSM) property from Placer Dome for 500,000 common shares and royalty payments capped at C$4.5 million. The project consisted of two contiguous claim blocks in the Iskut-Stikine region in British Columbia, approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi) southeast of the Eskay Creek Mine. When Seabridge acquired it, the project hosted two distinct deposits which were modelled separately by Placer Dome (CLA) Limited. At the two deposits, Placer Dome had estimated an historical indicated gold resource of 2.1 million ounces, with an additional 1.3 million ounces of gold in the inferred resource category as well as 2.8 billion pounds of copper resources. KSM's resources stand at 38.2 million ounces of gold, 191 million ounces of silver, 9.988 billion pounds of copper and 213 million pounds of molybdenum.[4]
In May 2002, Seabridge purchased 100% of its second largest gold property, Courageous Lake in the NWT from Newmont Mining and Total Resources for $5.5 million plus a 2% NSR royalty. The project at that time reported an historical resource of 5.9 million ounces of gold.
Seabridge began exploring KSM in 2006. After five years of drilling, Seabridge reported a new NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate in February 2012 which estimated measured and indicated resources totalling 49.0 million ounces of gold, 12.7 billion pounds of copper, 261 million ounces of silver and 304 million pounds of molybdenum in 2.8 billion tonnes grading 0.55 gpt gold and 0.21% copper.[7] An updated Preliminary Feasibility Study released on May 14, 2012 reported reserves of 38.2 million ounces of gold, 9.9 billion pounds of copper, 191 million ounces of silver and 213 million pounds of molybdenum in 2.2 billion tonnes grading 0.55 gpt gold and 0.21% copper.[8] The new PFS included engineering changes designed to increase the production rate, facilitate permitting and enhance economics. NPVs, IRRs and capital paybacks substantially improved over the 2011 PFS. Base case life of mine cash operating costs fell significantly to $141 per ounce of gold produced (see executive summary). Further core drilling in August, 2013 discovered a very large, high-grade core zone at Deep Kerr. An initial NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was released for the new Deep Kerr deposit which confirmed an inferred resource of 515 million tonnes grading 0.53% copper and 0.36 g/T gold for 6.1 billion pounds of copper and 5.9 million ounces of gold.[9]
The KSM Project is undergoing a joint harmonized environmental assessment review as outlined by the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. In February, 2013 Seabridge submitted its EA/EIS Application to the provincial and federal regulatory authorities and the Application was accepted into the formal review process in June, 2013 after meeting the requirements of the screening process. In July, 2014 the project received its Environmental Assessment Certificate from the provincial authorities. Seabridge also expects to receive final federal approval in 2014.
In November 2016 Seabridge received a licence from the Government of Canada required for the construction, operation and maintenance of the Water Storage Facility and associated ancillary water works for KSM. [10]
Courageous Lake[edit]
At Courageous Lake, after six years of work, an updated PFS completed in July, 2012 estimated proven and probable reserves of 6.5 million ounces of gold (91.1 million tonnes grading 2.2 gpt), an average annual production of 385,000 ounces at an average cost of $780 per ounce and a mine life of 15 years.[11] An $8.5 million exploration program in 2012 focused on finding a second major deposit along the Greenstone Belt.[12] This program discovered the Walsh Lake deposit.[13] An initial resource for the Walsh Lake deposit was announced in early 2014 totalling 4.62 million tonnes grading 3.24 g/T and containing 482,000 ounces of gold, all inferred.[14]
Minor projects[edit]
Red Mountain (Stewart, British Columbia) – Acquired in 2001 from North American Metals Corp. for 800,000 common shares.[6]
Quartz Mountain (Oregon) – Acquired December 2001. This project has been optioned to Alamos Gold for a total consideration of $21 million.[15]

Seabridge Gold is a Toronto-based North American resource exploration company. It owns Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell (KSM), a copper-gold-silver-molybdenum porphyry project in northern British Columbia. KSM's proven-probable reserves amount to 38.2 million ounces of gold, 191 million ounces of silver, 9.988 billion pounds of copper and 213 million pounds of molybdenum. Gold reserves at the Courageous Lake deposit total 6.5 million ounces.[1] The property is part of a bigger deposit containing another gold project known as Snowfield (Pretium Resources); the entire deposit is the largest undeveloped gold deposit in North America.[2] The KSM project will cost more than $4.7 billion to build but funding is not yet in place.[3]

Properties/KSM[edit]

The 100% owned KSM project located in north-western British Columbia has proven and probable reserves of 38.2 million ounces of gold and 9.9 billion pounds of copper (2.16 billion tonnes averaging 0.55 gpt gold and 0.21% copper),[4] making it the largest gold reserve in Canada and one of the largest in the world. The project's EA Application received provincial government approval in July, 2014.[5] The 100% owned Courageous Lake project located in Northwest Territories contains one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in Canada.
History and major projects[edit]
The company was initially incorporated as Chopper Mines Incorporated on September 14, 1979. It was renamed Dragoon Resources Ltd on November 9, 1984, and then Seabridge Resources Ltd on May 20, 1998, before adopting its current name on June 20, 2002.[6]
KSM[edit]
In June 2000 Seabridge purchased the Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell (KSM) property from Placer Dome for 500,000 common shares and royalty payments capped at C$4.5 million. The project consisted of two contiguous claim blocks in the Iskut-Stikine region in British Columbia, approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi) southeast of the Eskay Creek Mine. When Seabridge acquired it, the project hosted two distinct deposits which were modelled separately by Placer Dome (CLA) Limited. At the two deposits, Placer Dome had estimated an historical indicated gold resource of 2.1 million ounces, with an additional 1.3 million ounces of gold in the inferred resource category as well as 2.8 billion pounds of copper resources. KSM's resources stand at 38.2 million ounces of gold, 191 million ounces of silver, 9.988 billion pounds of copper and 213 million pounds of molybdenum.[4]
In May 2002, Seabridge purchased 100% of its second largest gold property, Courageous Lake in the NWT from Newmont Mining and Total Resources for $5.5 million plus a 2% NSR royalty. The project at that time reported an historical resource of 5.9 million ounces of gold.
Seabridge began exploring KSM in 2006. After five years of drilling, Seabridge reported a new NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate in February 2012 which estimated measured and indicated resources totalling 49.0 million ounces of gold, 12.7 billion pounds of copper, 261 million ounces of silver and 304 million pounds of molybdenum in 2.8 billion tonnes grading 0.55 gpt gold and 0.21% copper.[7] An updated Preliminary Feasibility Study released on May 14, 2012 reported reserves of 38.2 million ounces of gold, 9.9 billion pounds of copper, 191 million ounces of silver and 213 million pounds of molybdenum in 2.2 billion tonnes grading 0.55 gpt gold and 0.21% copper.[8] The new PFS included engineering changes designed to increase the production rate, facilitate permitting and enhance economics. NPVs, IRRs and capital paybacks substantially improved over the 2011 PFS. Base case life of mine cash operating costs fell significantly to $141 per ounce of gold produced (see executive summary). Further core drilling in August, 2013 discovered a very large, high-grade core zone at Deep Kerr. An initial NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was released for the new Deep Kerr deposit which confirmed an inferred resource of 515 million tonnes grading 0.53% copper and 0.36 g/T gold for 6.1 billion pounds of copper and 5.9 million ounces of gold.[9]
The KSM Project is undergoing a joint harmonized environmental assessment review as outlined by the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. In February, 2013 Seabridge submitted its EA/EIS Application to the provincial and federal regulatory authorities and the Application was accepted into the formal review process in June, 2013 after meeting the requirements of the screening process. In July, 2014 the project received its Environmental Assessment Certificate from the provincial authorities. Seabridge also expects to receive final federal approval in 2014.
In November 2016 Seabridge received a licence from the Government of Canada required for the construction, operation and maintenance of the Water Storage Facility and associated ancillary water works for KSM. [10]
Courageous Lake[edit]
At Courageous Lake, after six years of work, an updated PFS completed in July, 2012 estimated proven and probable reserves of 6.5 million ounces of gold (91.1 million tonnes grading 2.2 gpt), an average annual production of 385,000 ounces at an average cost of $780 per ounce and a mine life of 15 years.[11] An $8.5 million exploration program in 2012 focused on finding a second major deposit along the Greenstone Belt.[12] This program discovered the Walsh Lake deposit.[13] An initial resource for the Walsh Lake deposit was announced in early 2014 totalling 4.62 million tonnes grading 3.24 g/T and containing 482,000 ounces of gold, all inferred.[14]
Minor projects[edit]
Red Mountain (Stewart, British Columbia) – Acquired in 2001 from North American Metals Corp. for 800,000 common shares.[6]
Quartz Mountain (Oregon) – Acquired December 2001. This project has been optioned to Alamos Gold for a total consideration of $21 million.[15]
