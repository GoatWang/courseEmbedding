The manager said he would speak with the groomer after our transaction. When he did I saw her mouth" I don't care if she's watching". The groomer continued despite the dogs pain level and provided no comforting words or petting during or after. I passed by again 30 minutes later, after grocery shopping, and she had the dogs...                        Read more

                            We just picked up our puppy from getting his 1st "puppy cut" where they trim their private parts and clean up their face, ears. He doesn't even look like our dog but we could get passed that after washing him out wjen we got home. What we couldn't/can't get passed is the fact that cut some of his tail down to the meat and the poor fellow has half a butt cheek shaved all the way down to the skin. There are dangling patches of long hair all the...                        Read more

                            Used to have a Big R locally, loved the store! Missed it greatly! Was super excited when I stumbled into their online store, and so many great deals! -- Great in theory anyway. Although their site brags for "Same Day shipping if ordered before 2pm! Next day if later than 2pm!" I made my order at 10:45am on the 20th, and my order didn't ship until the 24th ... Ok, fine, disappointed but I can handle waiting a couple more days...

                            I was at PetSmart today on 16th Ave in Gainesville. A poodle like dog was getting his/ her nails cut and screaming in pain. The manager said he would speak with the groomer after our transaction. When he did I saw her mouth" I don't care if she's watching". The groomer continued despite the dogs pain level and provided no comforting words or petting during or after. I passed by again 30 minutes later, after grocery shopping, and she had the dogs...                        Read more

            The package that we order was wrong. Tried to reorder was told to refuse our order never even touch the box. Now can't get a refund or reorder the right product. This company is horrible from customer service down to the managers. Thinking this company is one big scam

            I just want to say, I ordered the system on Augest 4th, 2016, it is now the 25th. Still don't have product. Have called customer service three times. Terrible customer service. Rude, and uncaring. Promised product soon. Will never order with company again.

                                    Sounds like you need to try another training system ! Your review is one sided. Just because it didn't work for you, it doesn't mean it won't work for someone else. There is a reason Don is so successful. I have read many books and tried many training tools.

Don Sullivan - Review about Product Return from Stanwood, Washington

 









 Stanwood, Washington 




        Jan 08, 2015    

            7.6K views

After watching the infomercial I decided to call and order this.The call started out with getting my credit card info and then went on for another 20 minutes with offers to buy all kinds of things that had nothing to do with dogs.
I began to feel leary about this company and told the representative that I wanted to  cancel my order.
She told me she could not cancel it, that I had to wait 48 hours and then call a different number.I am moving all the money off that card first thing in the morning then calling that company and then making phone calls to consumer protection agencies. 
Reason of review: Poor customer service.
 




 


        Review #579783 is a subjective opinion of
                    poster.

Hello anonymous.We sincerely apologize that we only just discovered your review on this independent website.
Your review was never sent to our company directly. If you contact us directly via Don Sullivan's website, we will be very happy to help you find an acceptable solution to this issue. 
Don Sullivan's Perfect Dog products had to be contracted out to a global distributor in order to handle such a large volume of widespread orders. This company champions many other products, and it's simply part of their system to make callers aware of other offers before completing the purchase.
We do apologize that you were uncomfortable with the experience. 
There is nothing to be leary about at all. Feel free to browse the Internet for pages and pages of unbiased and unsolicited real customer reviews. These will be sure to reassure you.
Thousands of customers have ordered Don Sullivan's products over the years using the same ordering process and they have been exceptionally pleased with their purchase.
We wouldn't want you to miss out on your opportunity to transform your relationship with your dog, for your dog's sake at least.
Sincerely, The DogFather Team.

Your experience with the SALES representative is basic infomercial product purchase via telephone STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE.I'd guess almost everybody, at one time or another, interested in an infomercial product has made same mistake at least once and take care not to make it again.
Try using the website instead & bypass the upsales tactics...easy shmeasy.

3 hours ago
Somethingsphishy


                            I unfortunately placed an order today (friday ), then realized these scammers had no phone or address. I emailed them multiple times to cancel my order 15 minutes after it was placed because I became highly suspicious of not being able to contact these people (whoever they are). They finally emailed me back after multiple threats and said they were an internet company and I would be charged a 20% restocking fee including shipping fees and my...

Petsmart


                            We just picked up our puppy from getting his 1st "puppy cut" where they trim their private parts and clean up their face, ears. He doesn't even look like our dog but we could get passed that after washing him out wjen we got home. What we couldn't/can't get passed is the fact that cut some of his tail down to the meat and the poor fellow has half a butt cheek shaved all the way down to the skin. There are dangling patches of long hair all the...                        Read more

Big R


                            Used to have a Big R locally, loved the store! Missed it greatly! Was super excited when I stumbled into their online store, and so many great deals! -- Great in theory anyway. Although their site brags for "Same Day shipping if ordered before 2pm! Next day if later than 2pm!" I made my order at 10:45am on the 20th, and my order didn't ship until the 24th ... Ok, fine, disappointed but I can handle waiting a couple more days... For 1/3 of my...                        Read more

From the manufacturer










        Patented Command Collar Action Works Like a Mother Dog – So why Use Anything Else?
    

        Mother dogs instinctively know how to train their pups. A simple nip on the back of their pup’s neck gets their attention so they understand it’s time to do what mama dog wants. Now with Don Sullivan’s Command Collar you can use this technique too!
    






        Nature's Training Approach Now In a Collar!
    




        Author, Professional Animal Expert & Celebrity TV Trainer
    



        Guaranteed Results – No More Aggressive Leash Pulling, Unwanted Barking, Biting & Lunging and More
    

        Perfect for virtually any breed and dogs of all ages. Command Collar training makes a real difference the very first time you try it. In fact, hundreds of thousands of people have used the Command Collar product worldwide to fix the problems that drove them crazy.
    



        Easy as 1-2-3 – A Simple Tug Is All It Takes
    

        The Command Collar design uses a controlled “flex” action so the links “grip” your dog’s fur much like a mother dog's nuzzling bite. Just pull your training lead/leash to create the firm but gentle effect. The built-in safety loop prevents choking while the grip gets your dog’s attention so it responds to your corrective command without electric shock, noise, or sprays.
    



        A Product That Works
    

        Each Command Collar package includes one patented collar (large or small), Four extra quick fit links for easy sizing, Don Sullivan’s written training tips plus a companion training DVD that has step-by-step instructions to show you everything you need to get the results you want FAST!
    



        Easy to Follow DVD Training Included
    

        Don Sullivan has spent years perfecting his training technique. The net result of his experience is available to you in the included '30 Minutes to the Perfect Dog' DVD. Divided into chapters dealing with the top seven problems virtually all dog owners face, getting the results you want has never been easier.
    






        Small / Large Sizes - Fit Any Size Dog
    



        Pick the Right Size For Your Dog
    

        Fitting your dog with the collar is super simple. All you do is pick the right size and then add or subtract the included interchangeable links. The DVD even shows you how. Once it's properly sized you can then use the quick release clasp to get it on and off your dog in seconds.
    




                Small Size – Min./Max. Neck Diameter - 5.5 to 18.5 inches
            



                Small is suitable for puppies, tiny, small, and medium size breeds including Chihuahua, Yorkshire, Terrier, Toy Poodle, Cocker Spaniel, Jack Russell, Beagle and larger breed puppies.
            



                Large Size – Min./Max Neck Diameter – 7 to 24 inches
            



                Large is suitable for large to extra large breeds including Irish Setter, Labrador, Retriever, German Shepherd, Rottweiler, and Great Dane.
            



                Works humanely without electric shock or excessive choking.

But the collar does work, but in your own TRAINING METHODS. When I'm not out on a training session, I turn the collar that the smooth side is against the neck. SO--My pooches are learning that when the pointy side is touching their neck, they must do as I say. When this style is repeated enough times, it just becomes 2nd nature to obey my voice commands at any given time.

First one broke on the master link and had to return it for a second one. Second one had another link (not the master) break as well. However, I will say that my 75 lb GSD does respond favorably to it. I just don't know if I go to pull on it hard if it will hold up.Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsCustomer (No) Service from Perfect DogBytreegyn1on April 10, 2015Size: l|Verified PurchaseI ordered the Command Collar based on the reviews, for our at the time, 5 1/2 month old Aussie.  Before anyone comments, we watched the videos and made sure we understood the training process.  The initial results were excellent - our dog got the commands almost instantly.  We worked with our dog every day, making sure to be consistent and repetitive, trying not to exceed 30-45 minutes per session.  However, under even the slightest distraction, his attention would wonder.  We would try him for short stretches off the line, but he would never respond properly.  An Aussie is a high energy dog that needs lots of exercise.  But, he cannot get this exercise if he always must be on the line.Reaching this impasse, I wrote to the Perfect Dog folks via their website, asking for additional assistance.  Note that none of the training videos feature an Aussie....Other than responding that they had received my question, they completely ignored my request for assistance.  Clearly, Perfect Dog is more interested in selling, than supporting their product to ensure customers get the results promised in the videos.  Because of (non) customer service, I cannot give a positive review.  Our Command Collar is now gathering dust, and we are moving on to other approaches.Read more11 comment|

He has not used these products much yet, but the part that he did give feedback about, was very good.

My pup is only 12 weeks old, so she' not very hard on it. I think I could achieve the same results with a simple choker chain or prong collar. Other than that, I think the product is great!Read more11 comment|

            The package that we order was wrong. Tried to reorder was told to refuse our order never even touch the box. Now can't get a refund or reorder the right product. This company is horrible from customer service down to the managers. Thinking this company is one big scam

Just because it didn't work for you, it doesn't mean it won't work for someone else. There is a reason Don is so successful. I have read many books and tried many training tools.

"I can now trust Luna at home 100%"“Don’s DVDs were empowering… I can now trust "Luna" at home 100%... Within 5 minutes "Luna" was obeying the “Down” command with a whole lot of distraction going on around her. I didn’t think that would be possible with such a young puppy! If you’re going to be a responsible dog owner, you should have Don’s System…it’s fantastic!” *









"Within 20 minutes there was a remarkable difference in their behavior"“The dogs had taken control of our house. It was overwhelming. Don’s System was miraculous…to see so many changes in such a short time when we had spent literally weeks taking them to obedience class. I never dreamed that we would have calm dogs. Within 20 minutes there was a remarkable difference in their behavior…I was awed!” *









"I can now walk her without holding onto the leash!"“Using Don’s System, Daisy went from crazy to calm in 15 minutes. It was absolutely amazing! I can now walk her without holding onto the leash. She doesn’t even care when the doorbell rings now. I never thought in a million years I’d be able to clip her toenails, but now she just lays there! It’s a complete transformation. It has changed my life. Daisy is now my dream dog!” *
