 Educational Background



Bachelor of Arts 


Georgetown University

                  Georgetown University is a private research university in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1789, it is the oldest Jesuit and Catholic university in the United States. Georgetown's main campus, located in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood, is noted for Healy Hall, a National Historic Landmark in the Romanesque revival style. Georgetown operates a law center on Capitol Hill and auxiliary campuses in Italy, Turkey, and Qatar.                




J.D. 


University of California Berkeley - Boalt Hall School of Law

                  The University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, commonly referred to as Berkeley Law and Boalt Hall, is one of 14 schools and colleges at the University of California, Berkeley. Berkeley Law is consistently ranked as one of the top law schools in the nation, with acceptance rates lower than every school except Yale and Stanford. The Department of Jurisprudence was founded at Berkeley in 1894. In 1912, the department was renamed the School of Jurisprudence, which was then renamed the School of Law in 1950.

The School was originally located in the center of the main UC Berkeley campus in the Boalt Memorial Hall of Law, built in 1911 with funds largely from Elizabeth Josselyn Boalt donated in memory of her late husband, John Henry Boalt. In 1951, the School moved to its current location in the new Boalt Hall, at the southeast corner of the campus, and the old Boalt Hall was renamed Durant Hall.

In April 2008, the law school rebranded itself from "Boalt Hall" to "Berkeley Law", in order to more closely tie the law school's name with the campus upon which it resides. The administration hopes that this move will further increase the law school's prestige, since people will now associate it with the Berkeley campus.

Colin Manley Morris (born 1929) is an English Methodist minister. Born into a mining family,[1] after his ordination he served the Methodist Church in Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) for fifteen years.[1] He stood out for racial integration within the church, became a close friend of the leader of the independence movement, Kenneth Kaunda, and was closely involved in the formation of the United Church in Zambia soon after the country became independent.[2] He has always espoused an explicitly anti-racist and socialist position and argued that it represents the authentic spirit of Christianity.
After returning from Zambia, Colin Morris occupied prominent positions in British Methodism, becoming first the superintendent minister of Wesley's Chapel in London,[1] and subsequently General Secretary of the Church's Overseas Division. He was President of the Methodist Conference, elected in July 1976 and serving for the customary year term.[3]
From early in his career, Morris has been a regular speaker on the BBC Radio 4 programme Thought for the Day, with a radical perspective and an instantly recognizable voice.[4] For a period in 1971 he withdrew from the programme in protest against alleged representations by the Conservative Party Whips against his criticism on the programme of the party's immigration policy as un-Christian, an incident that caused questions to be asked in the House of Lords.[5] He was still contributing to Thought for the Day in 2010.
In 1978 Colin Morris moved out of the ordinary work of the Methodist ministry to work for the BBC, as head of TV Religious Programmes.[1] He subsequently held the posts of Head of Religious Broadcasting, Special Advisor to the Director-General, and Controller of BBC Northern Ireland. Since retiring from management within the BBC he has continued to broadcast, presenting numerous religious programmes. From 1991 to 1996 he served as Director of the Centre for Religious Communication in Oxford.
As well as his broadcasting work, Colin Morris has been a prolific author of books and pamphlets. Most of his published work reflects either his experience as a white missionary in black Africa, or as an ordained minister working as a professional broadcaster.
