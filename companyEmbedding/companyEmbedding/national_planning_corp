		Recovering Losses
		Caused By Investment Misconduct





National Planning Corporation
Investment Fraud Lawyers Reclaim Wrongful Losses
National Planning Corporation is one of the nation's largest broker-dealer
	 networks. A subsidiary of National Planning Holdings, Inc., the company
	 was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Santa Monica, California.
	 National Planning Corporation provides access to products and advisory
	 services through independent investment professionals.
Misconduct, Negligence, and Lack of Supervision
Unfortunately, National Planning Corporation is not above violating the
	 rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and it has
	 been levied fines in two disciplinary actions in the last decade. In 2006,
	 National Planning representatives were not trained or supervised well
	 regarding the sale of Class A, B, and C shares. The vital difference between
	 these shares, in this case, is the sort of fees that they carry and their
	 investment purpose.

	For example, Class C shares have significantly larger fees for holding
	 them, so they are ideal for short-term investments. Representatives did
	 not sell these shares in the best interests of clients, sometimes trading
	 Class C shares to clients who were investing over $100,000 long-term (making
	 them ideal for Class A shares, with lower long-term percentage-based fees). National Planning Corporation was fined $315,000 for trading that favored the pockets of brokers, not clients.


	Only a year prior, National Planning Corporation was part of a multi-firm
	 action that accused large firms of trading for the sake of the firm, not
	 for the sake of the investors. In this case, these firms, including National
	 Planning,
	provided higher commissions for the sale of certain stock, rewarding representatives for clearing certain investments over others.
	 This is a direct violation of FINRA laws because it encourages representatives
	 to behave in their own interests.


	Because this is a crucial rule to ensure an honest, transparent financial
	 industry,
	National Planning was fined $1.2 million, in addition to a $100,000 fee for other violations. The other firms were
	 fined in varying amounts, but National Planning was fined the second-largest
	 amount for their part in the arrangement. Massive fines are intended to
	 deter other firms from engaging in dishonest behavior, ideally creating
	 a healthier financial industry.

Investors Have the Right to File Claims

	Because National Planning Corporation is licensed by FINRA,
	they are subject to the laws that FINRA enforces. One crucial law is that National Planning is responsible for ensuring
	 that their brokers are trading ethically, transparently, and in the best
	 interest of their clients. They ideally accomplish this through careful
	 supervision and vigilance. If a representative from National Planning
	 loses your assets through negligence or fraud, it immediately puts National
	 Planning at fault for failing to supervise their broker.
	FINRA law then dictates that you can hold the firm legally liable to recover
		 your damages.

	 resources go toward taking on investment giants like National Planning

Challenges

Growth
The growth opportunity is the size of the market and what you can capture.

Know thy customer
Paint a picture of your customers by creating custom personas. Describe everything about them and then link the personas to actual features so you know who you are building for.












Track the competition

        Define the whys, whens, and whats


        Roadmapping comes first, build what matters second
      







          Aha! is the one product management tool you need to lead product with conviction and be happy doing it. If you are like most product managers, Aha! is what you have always wanted to replace the Word, Google, Excel, Dropbox, and PPT docs that are scattered all over your hard drive and the cloud.
        











How does your product team work?
No matter what type of product team you work with, Aha! is a tool for driving product strategy, sharing your roadmap, and detailing features and user stories. We call this the why, when, and what of roadmapping. Engineering teams are responsible for how features get developed.



The Why
Goals and initiatives


The When
Schedules and timelines


The What
Releases and features


The How
Engineering development



We know that you are doing your best to explain where the product is headed, highlight the business value, and lead your product team. We also know that engineering teams can be demanding. They want to understand your vision for the product and they require detailed features and user stories to efficiently build what customers want. The reality is that it’s not easy with the product management tools you have.
How does your engineering team work?
While many engineering teams have a bug tracking system to manage their work, others do not. Aha! works in both environments but is fundamentally designed for you – the product manager. If your engineering team uses a bug system like JIRA, we integrate directly with it allowing you to set strategy, releases, and features in Aha! and send them to JIRA to be worked. As engineers work and update JIRA, Aha! is automatically updated and you can always easily check what's happening without having to navigate another tool.
Aha! also works well for teams that do not have a bug or other engineering planning system. Aha! provides a workflow board for agile or scrum teams, status controls by feature and requirement, and cross-functional release gantt charts so you are always informed. So, regardless of how your team works, Aha! is the product tool built for you.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
