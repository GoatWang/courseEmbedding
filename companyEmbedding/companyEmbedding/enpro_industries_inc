"Indian companies need to invest ahead of time to prove their capability to customers"

							Four entrepreneurs share their journey of scaling up and going global at the Smart Enterprise Cluster Meet in Pune — Part 2						


(L-R) V Keshavdev, executive editor, Outlook Business; Hariprasad Rao, regional director, Asia-Pacific, Lear Corporation; Vikram Salunkhe, MD, Accurate Gauging & Instruments; Tushar Mehendale, MD, ElectroMech and Srikrishna Karkare, MD, Enpro Industries 











V Keshavdev, executive editor, Outlook Business: Tushar, in your case how critical were alliances in scaling up and going global?
Tushar Mehendale, MD, ElectroMech: If you want to go global, then you should know how global companies work. We have emerged as a company that has a wide product portfolio — right from manufacturing small cranes for small workshops to big cranes and tower cranes for construction sites. We have a tie-up with two German companies ABUS and Stahl, a joint venture with Zoomlion of China, which is the world’s largest manufacturer of tower cranes, and a recent tie-up with Hyster-Yale. These alliances allow us to increase our product portfolio, but the most important aspect is the tremendous amount of learning that happens while dealing with these companies.
For example, if we place an order with our German partner ABUS, it would say that the order would be delivered on week 36. Sure enough, the order would be dispatched on week 36. That has been a tradition for the past 13 years and it has never missed the delivery or fallen short of a commitment. So, it's not only about the output you see. When you interact with such clients and observe the systems that work at the backend, you are exposed to a lot more things and begin to see how the evolved the processes are. It helps you realise the requirements of the global market.
These partnerships have helped us in improving our product processes, understanding the requirements of the international market and have played a significant part in our going global. When I first entered the international market, I was quite naïve. It took me quite a few tumbles to learn it and I was lucky to survive. The main hurdle that we face in going outside India is that capital goods, which are made in India, are not in the top five list. So there is a tremendous amount of headwind that comes your way. But you have to be able to keep that aside for a while and present to the customer your approach towards executing the order. You have to understand those pain points and come up with solutions. You have to be able to supply the equipment to them on time and have all the aspects of reliability, quality, safety and performance. Building up your reputation is a step-by-step process.
Keshavdev: Vikram, in your case of precision equipment, how did you go into the global market and fetch those deals?
Vikram Salunkhe, MD, Accurate Gauging & Instruments: We have a very wide range of products and some of these can go through a very standard channel. This means that the customer can buy it and use it for his/her own company. But there is a lot of integration required with electronics, software knowledge and application engineering. In India, we are strong on all these aspects. That is how we have built our business. When you want to sell these products outside, it is equally important that we bring these aspects to the customer’s notice. Nobody would buy the machine only because factory X is cheaper than an alternative source.
We started with building partnerships outside — that is, the distributors in countries abroad could also contribute to some part of the solution. With these kind of partnerships, we could approach the customers to show that we had local support. That is how we started selling machines in America, Europe, and Russia. Wherever we have been able to build these partnerships, we were able to go into the market. Otherwise, it becomes a little difficult.
Keshavdev: Hari, you look at the Asia-Pacific region for sourcing. What are the strengths of Indian SME suppliers vis-a-vis China? Do you see the Chinese still having the upper hand in terms of quality and price? Do you also source for the domestic operations in India from China?
Hariprasad Rao, regional director, Asia-Pacific, Lear Corporation: We do buy a little from China. Whenever we try making comparisons between India and China, we see Indian sources to be competent enough. We have chosen Indian suppliers based on their competitiveness, so they have earned it when it comes to the business. There are certain areas in which we still depend a lot on China, particularly the tooling industry. The kind of scale, machines, investments, processes, the fact that multinationals have been around there more – all this makes it difficult for Indian companies to match up to them. Where there is less variety and high volume, it is difficult for Indian companies to compete in that space. But where you have high variety and low volume, Indian companies have a good edge and I do see significant differences there.
Keshavdev: Srikrishna, have you encountered the Chinese in the market, especially when you have gone global? How do you stand vis-a-vis the Chinese?
Srikrishna Karkare, MD, Enpro Industries: Like Hari said, where there is high variety and low volume, we have a natural advantage. Similarly, when there is a greater degree of customisation, Indian companies tend to have an advantage. Due to the language barrier, smaller Chinese companies do not have the competence of dealing internationally in English. Unfortunately, ours is a niche business, which does not interest larger Chinese corporations. So we don't see much competition from China or, for that matter, from most non-English speaking countries. It is not that we don’t have any competition — we simply seem to have an advantage over other countries due to the language barrier. For a Japanese customer, we face competition from a Japanese supplier; for a French customer we would face competition from a French supplier. But we have very few truly global competitors. There are some based out of the US and the UK, but we do enjoy a cost advantage over them.
Keshavdev: What is the value proposition that you bring to the table vis-a-vis your other competitors?
Karkare: The value proposition that we bring to the table is solutions. We did start as a semi-ancillary to a Japanese customer, but over a period of time we have had a very good knowledge management system. We have been assimilating everything that we learnt along the journey. Today, we are clearly the knowledge leaders in the field of lubrication worldwide. Our customers depend upon our knowledge to provide the right kind of lubrication system for their product. We are all familiar with the end-customer specifications across the globe. So, suppose a system is to be supplied to a shell project in Europe, we would know the requirements to build that system much better than any of our customers would, and they depend on us for that knowledge.
Keshavdev: Tushar, in your case how did you move up the value chain and how are you maintaining an edge? Like you said, initially quality was an issue for you and alliances brought a change later.
Mehendale: I mirror exactly what Mr Karkare said about learning from different customers and economies. Luckily for us, when it comes to cranes, we know what is required because we have been in this industry for close to 37 years now. Having said that, what really helps us is our knowledge about the industry when we’re sitting across the customer and discussing requirements. Understanding the criticalities of the crane in its processes helps us to configure the system and design it in a way that helps us speak the language of the customer. 
This has been possible over a period of time. My entire sales team comprises mechanical engineers. When they come on board, we teach them to be designers first and only then salesmen. That allows them to speak the language of an engineer and not that of a salesperson. This goes a long way in crafting the right solutions for the customers. We have our systems in place and review meetings and, by way of quarterly reviews, take corrective actions for continuous improvement. On the systems front, we have new ideas and action plans to address the problems we come across. We have now captured all our knowledge and learning in what we call electronic operative system. We have built up our SOP, which gets continuously updated and which we have tried to make more process-dependent, less person-dependent as quality is always consistent.
Keshavdev: What about you, Vikram?
Salunkhe: In our business, we have to do a lot of value addition for our customers in India. Until we satisfied customers in India, we were unable to export. After the advent of globalisation, our first goal was to make sure that the needs of all the MNCs that came to India were fully met, and to make knowledge our tool for going global. Holistic but application-based knowledge is key to solving customer problems. Today, this is is one of our biggest strengths, apart from the products. We provide a lot of services — we handle measurement programmes, we have a make for our machine that can be assembled anywhere in the world and so on. For any problem that we work on, we first solve it for Indian customers before going global to deliver it. 
Keshavdev: Hari, how are you hand-holding your SMEs? You had refused and let them handle their own problems. Is the process working?
Rao:  I don't think hand-holding is necessary at this stage. It is possible for SMEs to cluster or rather group themselves and make some common investments. If they realise that there is only 5% utilisation of a particular measuring instrument, they might question the need to invest in it. They  can find specific clusters to join. Such an ecosystem should develop here. I don’t think multinationals would then want to pitch in when there’s such an ecosystem.
Also, it's necessary for people to move up the value chain and define the standards. I have known so many companies that do this. In Germany, you could go in the middle of the black forest and find a niche company there, which would be a master in its  field. It could come up with solutions that would be of a certain standard. There are companies that have developed a niche in their own specialised areas. I don't see any reason why Indian companies cannot do that. It's a matter of time and needs the right partnerships to grow together.
Keshavdev: What are the three things a company should do to scale up and three things that are not to be done? 
Karkare: Indian companies need to invest ahead of time to prove their capability to customers. How you invest — whether you get the investment from outside or you plough back all of your accruals — is a question that individual entrepreneurs can answer for themselves. Secondly, companies should embrace technology. Ten years ago, among our peer suppliers, we were the first to embrace 3D designs because that was the need of the customer then. We were among the first to undergo computerised testing for our equipment, whereas our Japanese customers were still struggling with it. So, embracing technology is a must if you want to emerge on a global scale. Thirdly, I would say that maintain the hygiene of quality, safety and sustainability as far as the multinational customer and international market is concerned.
Mehendale: As an entrepreneur, you have to take it as it comes. You have to be responsive and remember that in every adversity, there is an opportunity. It is very easy to be vain about the topline you have or your margins. But the most important thing is the cash flow of the business. My defining philosophy is to focus on the cash flow and ensure that the cash keeps coming into the business. You have to build your business around that particular philosophy. It’s about building a model that will really set your business apart.
Salunkhe: Invest in teams because the business ahead is into solutions, which in turn is all about knowledge. In several companies, the founder has all the knowledge. But if teams don’t have the knowledge, companies cannot scale up. We need to have teams who are able to deliver entirely on their own. Therefore, investment in people is foremost.
Rao: It is the innovation differentiation that is important. For me, the primary thing is whether or not the people have differentiated themselves and have a clear innovation plan. Secondly, SMEs by nature are also fragile, which large corporations are not. Decision-making in a large corporation is very complicated. SMEs have the advantage of taking quick decisions and moving forward. So, this flexibility is something that they need to keep. They have to scale up while staying fragile. Thirdly, anything that SMEs do needs to be sustainable. It cannot be a fad — they cannot keep changing frequently. Sustainability is very important, which also means that they cannot ignore small issues.

"For us to be successful, our suppliers have to be self-sufficient first"

							Four entrepreneurs share their journey of scaling up and going global at the Smart Enterprise Cluster Meet in Pune — Part 1						


(L-R) V Keshavdev, executive editor, Outlook Business; Hariprasad Rao, regional director, Asia-Pacific Lear Corporation; Vikram Salunkhe, MD, Accurate Gauging and Instruments; Tushar Mehendale, MD, ElectroMech and Srikrishna Karkare, MD, Enpro Industries 











V Keshavdev, executive editor, Outlook Business: It is my great pleasure to host the second Outlook Business Smart Enterprise Cluster Meet. For close to 10 years now, we have been covering 52 prominent industrial clusters. We have seen quite a few SMEs scale up and go global over the years. It's really been an insightful story for us to share with our readers. I hope you can share your story of scaling up and going global. So Srikrishna, how did your entrepreneurial journey start off?
Srikrishna Karkare, MD, Enpro Industries: Getting into this business was not planned, but we evolved as we got opportunities. We started off by trading some items related to the engineering industry and, over a period of time, we found that there was a need to package the products that we were trading. A lot of customers were looking for this service. So, packaged piping systems is our business where we provide value. Our application has evolved over the years in the industries where we serve.
Keshavdev: How did you stumble upon the idea of getting into it and how easy was it to scale up? Hitachi was your first client and that set the ball rolling for Enpro Industries. Could you you take us through that interesting story?
Karkare: Hitachi was our first international customer. It so happened that they quite literally walked into our factory one day. Our small plant was located next to the Thermax unit. There was a delegation from Hitachi that was keen on sourcing from low-cost countries. They were visiting Thermax to find out if they could source something from these countries. Lubrication systems were also on their list and they asked Thermax to refer them to someone who could do it. I had started my career in Thermax, so a lot of people knew me and the business that I was into. That was quite a serendipity. We encashed this opportunity well and Hitachi found in us an interesting partner to work with. But later on that relationship became harrowing for us. 
Initially, there was this gentleman called Mr. Hagiwara, who led the delegation. For reasons best known to him, he chose to work with us after interviewing the entire company — right from the vendor to me. After travelling across the country auditing each of our sub-vendors, they chose to give us an order of about 17-18 lakh at that time. Our turnover then was a little over 1 crore. Knowing that it's an international opportunity, we accepted the order without thinking much. At the end of six months, despite us executing it successfully, we had spent more than 30 lakh on that order. So financially, it was a loss-making order. But the knowledge that we gained and the track record that we built while successfully executing the first export order was phenomenal. From then on, with that reference under our belt, we signed on many other international customers.
Keshavdev: Tushar, in your case, you took over the business under rather unfortunate circumstances
Tushar Mehendale, MD, ElectroMech: My father started the business in 1979. It was a small company primarily engaged in manufacturing cranes and supplying it to the local market — more so in the western part of India. When I completed my education in the US and returned to India, I wanted to do something on my own. Unfortunately, within three months of my return to the country, I lost my father. Since there was nobody else to look after the business, I joined the company at the age of 24. It has been an interesting journey because I had no business or manufacturing experience.
The first few years were pretty bad. I secured one of the biggest orders in my first week itself. It comprised 30% of our total turnover. At that point, we had manufactured it in record time. But the company simply refused to pick up the equipment citing some dealer and customer issue. We had executed the order within five months, but it didn't get picked up for about two-and-half years. You can imagine what happens to the working capital and the overall morale of the company. This happened way back in 2001, when the economy was also in doldrums. We fought against that big group, even though people warned me against it over the fear of being blacklisted. But I held my ground that if I did not fight, I would be in trouble. I got my money and also delivered the product. Things really moved forward thereon, and the business has grown 100x. However, those difficult days really built me up as a businessman.
Keshavdev: Being an SME, how was the struggle to extract money from a bigger firm?
Mehendale: Working capital management is the key to any business. You get some margins, but gradually, those margins become thin. So, it is more about how you focus on the operational efficiencies, how you are able to manage your working capital and increase returns on the capital employed. After that experience, we implemented a policy wherein we have the right to decide payment terms and the way we execute an order. In order to go to the market and get those payments, we have to provide that delta to the customers, which will ensure that they are happy and willing to come to us. It has taken a lot of time to reach this position. It's a continuous journey but this policy of working capital management has stood us in good stead.
Keshavdev: Vikram, your father started business in a completely different era way back in 1963. Describe the journey over the years and how did you oversee the transition when you took over?
Vikram Salunkhe, MD, Accurate Gauging & Instruments: My father presided over the business till I joined in 1988. I started very early at the age of 22. My father had very different objectives. The business was about precision gauges. The DNA of our company was that of an import substitute, because we never developed any product that was already being made in India. Obviously, the customers demanded [products of] a very high quality and it had to be established over a period of time. Nobody buys an equipment just because it has a good price. So we imporved the products by listening to our customers. From single axis measurement to two-axis measurement, and finally three-axis measuring machines, we've come a long way. We leveraged the knowledge that the company had assimilated over a period of time. We eventually positioned ourselves as a viable alternative for many import substitute products. Today, we have the finest capabilities across the globe.
At first, we did not have engineering graduates in the workforce. Some of them had only studied till 10th grade. Getting things done by diploma engineers and skilled labour helped us. But later, when it came to designing machines, we engaged some technologically experienced people from the West. Many of our products were designed with a contemporary European approach. We also had the opportunity to acquire a foreign company and move it lock, stock and barrel to India. Through that process, we learnt certain skills that we could engage in. We combined those skills with our energies and that is how the journey started.
Keshevdev: Hari, how did you create a base for a supply chain in India primarily comprising SMEs?
Hariprasad Rao, regional director, Asia-Pacific Lear Corporation: We have seen different kinds of progression with the vendors. There was a time when we told our ex-employees to take our machine and be our vendor. This was between the late 90s and early 2000 when the ecosystem was not there and nobody had those machines. All the companies wanted to become competent. During that time, a good revolution was taking place in India with the automotive majors bringing in a cluster concept to develop the vendors. I think India today is in a much better position because of the fundamental work being done by some major automotive players. Companies such as Toyota and Maruti have contributed significantly to the development of this vendor base. Initially, it was a challenge but now people are willing to invest.
Keshevdev: So how many SMEs did you incubate?
Rao: At that time, we were running about four clusters and each had one 12 SMEs. So 48 to 50 SMEs were coached for over three-four years. They were not necessarily from Lear. They came in at different points of time, were put together and then there were some competing companies but they had a common cause to develop. We had some people, who were coaching some homegrown executives. It all helped in the development, and we ourselves helped because for us to be successful, our supply chain had to be successful as well. We want suppliers to be self-sufficient. We deploy a hands-on approach, since the ecosystem is developed now. About 60-70% of our suppliers come from SMEs and that is quite a significant amount.
Some of them were filtered out due to lack innovation, not in terms of design but with regard to the process. They were not able to differentiate themselves from the rest. The second factor we looked for was companies with a strong customer focus. That doesn't mean saying yes to everything that the customer demands. It is more about solving customer problems. Today, when I look at a source, I assess if the company has the capability to solve its clients' problems. The third is about variability management. We have a lot of variabilities — suppliers, machine, supply chain. We see if the company has the capability to go to the source of the variability. Do they have the capability to manage that by getting to the root of it? It is not easy to detect variability because it shows up in the organisation. Maybe it's over-capacity or inventory or attrition. The symptoms are different and it is for the management to identify the issue. If it is not able to do it, that company will fall behind.
Keshavdev: Srikrishna, in your case you said Hitachi walked in and the Japanese came and took over your entire process. Can you take us through that phase — the company hand-holding an SME and the entire incubation cycle? How did Hitachi open the doors for you to go global?
Karkare: The arrangement with Hitachi was very intense. For the first four to six months when they took us through the order, we had no idea about the quality requirements in the international market. While making the commitment, it said four months. We agreed but two months down the line, when we were supposed to be in the middle stage of manufacturing, the man from Japan turns up. He asks for the product that we were to manufacture for him. The material hadn't arrived then, so I was in a state of shock. From then on, he took over our company and asked us how we would do it. When we explained, he said that we were lying because it was never going to happen even in six months or more. That was the first time that I heard a customer tell me that it was not happening, which was partly right. It was time for us to be honest with ourselves and that has stood us in good stead. Later, Hitachi helped us through each of the processes — be it purchasing or welding, which is the most critical process. It sent welding experts, who couldn't speak English and had them stationed at our shop for two months. We got our welders trained by them, but despite a language problem, they hit off pretty well. We are very proud to say that today we have the best welders in the world. It is a skill that we developed over time.
Keshavdev: After Hitachi, was the process of securing global clients easier?
Karkare: Definitely. That opened doors for us and even with our Indian customers, we had the approach of solving problems and providing solutions. The product that we manufactured for Hitachi was lube oil systems, which is an equipment that lubricates the bearings of large rotating machineries. It's a very critical product because if it fails even for a few seconds, the large equipment that Hitachi, GE or Siemens may be manufacturing would come to a standstill. The reliability requirements are extremely high. Hitachi indeed took a very big risk with us but we lived up to the expectations.
Keshavdev: How did you de-risk and diversify your business?

Karkare: At one point, we had Hitachi and Reliance as our biggest clients. Later, we had 70% of our business with GE. However, after a year it changed its policy because there was a bubble in the market that burst. It wanted only two suppliers worldwide for a particular commodity. Back then, there was too much business from China. So, it retained one supplier from China and one from its home base in the US. Naturally, we lost 70% of our business overnight and that's when we decided to not depend on a single customer for more than 25% of our business. Till date, we have a diversified customer base of not more than 20-25 international customers and no single client contributes more than 20% to the business.

History[edit]
On May 31, 2002, Goodrich Corporation (now UTC Aerospace Systems) spun off its Engineered Industrial Products business segment into a new company, named EnPro Industries, Inc. The spinoff consisted of businesses that were originally owned by Coltec Industries, which had been purchased by Goodrich in 1998.[3] The businesses included in the spinoff were: Garlock Sealing Technologies, GGB Bearing Technology, STEMCO, Fairbanks Morse Engine and Quincy Compressor[1][4] (which was sold to Atlas Copco in 2010).[5] Asbestos liability was limited by complicate tax manipulation, Joseph Andolino was one of the architects.
Since the formation of EnPro Industries, the company has acquired a number of companies that are focused on engineered industrial products.

History[edit]
On May 31, 2002, Goodrich Corporation (now UTC Aerospace Systems) spun off its Engineered Industrial Products business segment into a new company, named EnPro Industries, Inc. The spinoff consisted of businesses that were originally owned by Coltec Industries, which had been purchased by Goodrich in 1998.[3] The businesses included in the spinoff were: Garlock Sealing Technologies, GGB Bearing Technology, STEMCO, Fairbanks Morse Engine and Quincy Compressor[1][4] (which was sold to Atlas Copco in 2010).[5] Asbestos liability was limited by complicate tax manipulation, Joseph Andolino was one of the architects.
Since the formation of EnPro Industries, the company has acquired a number of companies that are focused on engineered industrial products.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
On May 31, 2002, Goodrich Corporation (now UTC Aerospace Systems) spun off its Engineered Industrial Products business segment into a new company, named EnPro Industries, Inc. The spinoff consisted of businesses that were originally owned by Coltec Industries, which had been purchased by Goodrich in 1998.[3] The businesses included in the spinoff were: Garlock Sealing Technologies, GGB Bearing Technology, STEMCO, Fairbanks Morse Engine and Quincy Compressor[1][4] (which was sold to Atlas Copco in 2010).[5] Asbestos liability was limited by complicate tax manipulation, Joseph Andolino was one of the architects.
Since the formation of EnPro Industries, the company has acquired a number of companies that are focused on engineered industrial products.

History[edit]
On May 31, 2002, Goodrich Corporation (now UTC Aerospace Systems) spun off its Engineered Industrial Products business segment into a new company, named EnPro Industries, Inc. The spinoff consisted of businesses that were originally owned by Coltec Industries, which had been purchased by Goodrich in 1998.[3] The businesses included in the spinoff were: Garlock Sealing Technologies, GGB Bearing Technology, STEMCO, Fairbanks Morse Engine and Quincy Compressor[1][4] (which was sold to Atlas Copco in 2010).[5] Asbestos liability was limited by complicate tax manipulation, Joseph Andolino was one of the architects.
Since the formation of EnPro Industries, the company has acquired a number of companies that are focused on engineered industrial products.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
