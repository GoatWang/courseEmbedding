      Fitch Affirms GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2013-GC13
    





June 01, 2016 04:23 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of GS Mortgage Securities Trust 
      2013-GC13 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 
      2013-GC13. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool since issuance. As of the May 2016 distribution date, 
      the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 2.5% to $1.3 
      billion from $1.334 billion at issuance. There have been no delinquent 
      or specially serviced loans since issuance.
    

      There are seven loans on the servicer watch list (5.5% of the pool); the 
      loans are on the watch list due to deferred maintenance and declines in 
      occupancy and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR).
    

      The largest watch list loan and Fitch Loan of Concern (1.6% of the pool) 
      is the Warehouse & Flex Portfolio loan; a portfolio of four 
      warehouse/flex buildings consisting of 216,415 sf located in Bucks 
      County, PA (suburban Philadelphia). The sole tenant at one of the 
      properties, Asset Management Specialists (18.7% of NRA, 40,500 sf) 
      vacated upon lease expiration in September 2015. Near-term rollover was 
      a consideration at issuance and at closing a $2.275 million reserve was 
      funded to address potential rollover in 2015 for the lease expirations 
      of L-3 Communications (33% of NRA, lease extended to December 2020 from 
      December 2015), Vestcom New Century (19.3% of NRA, lease extended to 
      March 2017 from March 2015), and Asset Management Specialists. With 
      successful lease extensions for L-3 Communications and Vestcom New 
      Century, the leasing reserve is available to cover shortfalls related to 
      Asset Management Specialists' former space. Occupancy has declined to 
      71% as of 1Q 2016. Net operating income (NOI) DSCR was 1.32x and 1.03x 
      as of year-end (YE) 2015 and 1Q 2016, respectively, as a result of the 
      decrease in occupancy. Fitch will continue to monitor.
    

      The largest loan in the pool (11.5% of the pool) is the 11 West 42nd 
      Street loan, a 943,701 square foot (sf), 32-story office tower located 
      in midtown New York, NY. The property was originally built in 1927 and 
      renovated in 1978. As of the September 2015 rent roll, major tenants 
      included CIT Group, Inc. (16% net rentable area [NRA], expires October 
      2021), NYU (11.9% NRA, expires September 2021), Estee Lauder Companies 
      Inc. (11.9% NRA, expires March 2025) and WellPoint Holding Corp (11.2%, 
      expired December 2015). While the WellPoint lease renewal has not been 
      confirmed, the office submarket is strong, and subject occupancy was 
      100% with NOI DSCR at 2.53x as of YE 2015.
    

      The second largest loan in the pool (11.3% of the pool) is the Mall St. 
      Matthews loan, a 1,020,376 sf regional mall located in Louisville, KY. 
      The mall is anchored by Dillard's (expires December 2045) and Dillard's 
      Men's & Home (expires December 2045), which are not part of the 
      collateral, while JC Penney (expires August 2017) and Forever 21 
      (expires February 2026) are included in the collateral. Total collateral 
      is 670,376 sf. The property was originally built in 1962 but most 
      recently renovated in 2013. Occupancy was 96% as of December 2015, which 
      is in-line with performance at issuance. NOI DSCR was 1.97x as of YE 
      2015.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Rating Outlooks for all classes remain Stable, as overall pool 
      performance has been stable since issuance. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics. Upgrades may occur with stable to improved pool performance and 
      significant paydown or defeasance. Additional information on rating 
      sensitivity is available in the report 'GS Mortgage Securities Trust 
      2013-GC13' (Jan. 17, 2014), available at www.fitchratings.com.

and
 
 CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS REALTY CORP.,
 
SELLER
 
MORTGAGE LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT
 
Dated as of July 1, 2013
 
Series 2013-GC13




 



 


  


  





  


 
This Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”), dated as of July 1, 2013, is between GS Mortgage Securities Corporation II, a Delaware corporation, as purchaser (the “Purchaser”), and Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., a New York corporation, as seller (the “Seller”).
 
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2013 (the “Pooling and Servicing Agreement”), among the Purchaser, as depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (in such capacity, the “Master Servicer”), LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer (the “Special Servicer”), Trimont Real Estate Advisors, Inc., as operating advisor, U.S. Bank National Association, as certificate administrator (in such capacity, the “Certificate Administrator”) and as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”), pursuant to which the Purchaser will transfer the Mortgage Loans (as defined herein), together with certain other mortgage loans, to a trust fund and certificates representing ownership interests in the Mortgage Loans and such other mortgage loans will be issued by the trust fund (the “Trust Fund”).  In exchange for the Mortgage Loans and such other mortgage loans, the Trust Fund will issue to or at the direction of the Depositor certificates to be known as GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2013-GC13, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-GC13 (collectively, the “Certificates”).  For purposes of this Agreement, “Mortgage Loans” refers to the mortgage loans listed on Exhibit A to this Agreement (the “Mortgage Loan Schedule”) and “Mortgaged Properties” refers to the properties securing such Mortgage Loans.
 
The Purchaser and the Seller wish to prescribe the manner of sale of the Mortgage Loans from the Seller to the Purchaser and in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements hereinafter set forth, agree as follows:
 
SECTION 1     Sale and Conveyance of Mortgages; Possession of Mortgage File.  The Seller does hereby sell, transfer, assign, set over and convey to the Purchaser, without recourse (except as otherwise specifically set forth herein), all of its right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans including all interest and principal received on or with respect to the Mortgage Loans after the Cut-Off Date (and, in any event, excluding payments of principal and interest first due on the Mortgage Loans on or before the Cut-Off Date.  Upon the sale of the Mortgage Loans, the ownership of each related Note, the Seller’s interest in the related Mortgage securing the Note and the other contents of the related Mortgage File will be vested in the Purchaser and immediately thereafter the Trustee, and the ownership of records and documents with respect to each Mortgage Loan prepared by or which come into the possession of the Seller shall immediately vest in the Purchaser and immediately thereafter the Trustee.  The Purchaser will sell certain of the Certificates (the “Public Certificates”) to the underwriters (the “Underwriters”) specified in the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of July 17, 2013 (the “Underwriting Agreement”), between the Purchaser and the Underwriters, and the Purchaser will sell certain of the Certificates (the “Private Certificates”) to the initial purchasers (the “Initial Purchasers” and, collectively with the Underwriters, the “Dealers”) specified in the Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 17, 2013 (the “Certificate Purchase Agreement”), between the Purchaser and Initial Purchasers.
 
The sale and conveyance of the Mortgage Loans is being conducted on an arms-length basis and upon commercially reasonable terms.  As the purchase price for the Mortgage 
 


  


  





  


 
Loans, the Purchaser shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the Seller or at the Seller’s direction $321,938,346.36, plus accrued interest on the Mortgage Loans from and including July  1, 2013 to but excluding the Closing Date (but subject to certain post-settlement adjustment for expenses incurred by the Underwriters and the Initial Purchasers on behalf of the Depositor and for which the Seller is specifically responsible).
 
The purchase and sale of the Mortgage Loans shall take place on the Closing Date.
 
SECTION 2     Books and Records; Certain Funds Received After the Cut-Off Date. From and after the sale of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, record title to each Mortgage and each Note shall be transferred to the Trustee subject to and in accordance with this Agreement.  Any funds due after the Cut-Off Date in connection with a Mortgage Loan received by the Seller shall be held in trust on behalf of the Trustee (for the benefit of the Certificateholders) as the owner of such Mortgage Loan and shall be transferred promptly to the Certificate Administrator.  All scheduled payments of principal and interest due on or before the Cut-Off Date but collected after the Cut-Off Date, and all recoveries and payments of principal and interest collected on or before the Cut-Off Date (only in respect of principal and interest on the Mortgage Loans due on or before the Cut-Off Date and principal prepayments thereon), shall belong to, and shall be promptly remitted to, the Seller.
 
The transfer of each Mortgage Loan shall be reflected on the Seller’s balance sheets and other financial statements as the sale of such Mortgage Loan by the Seller to the Purchaser.  The Seller intends to treat the transfer of each Mortgage Loan to the Purchaser as a sale for tax purposes.  Following the transfer of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser, the Seller shall not take any actions inconsistent with the ownership of the Mortgage Loans by the Purchaser and its assignees.
 
The transfer of each Mortgage Loan shall be reflected on the Purchaser’s balance sheets and other financial statements as the purchase of such Mortgage Loan by the Purchaser from the Seller.  The Purchaser intends to treat the transfer of each Mortgage Loan from the Seller as a purchase for tax purposes.  The Purchaser shall be responsible for maintaining, and shall maintain, a set of records for each Mortgage Loan which shall be clearly marked to reflect the transfer of ownership of each Mortgage Loan by the Seller to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.
 
SECTION 3     Delivery of Mortgage Loan Documents; Additional Costs and Expenses. (a) The Purchaser hereby directs the Seller, and the Seller hereby agrees, such agreement effective upon the transfer of the Mortgage Loans contemplated herein, to deliver or cause to be delivered to the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee), the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, respectively, on the dates set forth in Section 2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, all documents, instruments and agreements required to be delivered by the Purchaser, or contemplated to be delivered by the Seller (whether at the direction of the Purchaser or otherwise), to the Custodian, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as applicable, with respect to the Mortgage Loans under Section 2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and meeting all the requirements of such Section 2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided that the Seller shall not be required to deliver any draft documents,

privileged communications, credit underwriting, due diligence analyses or data or internal worksheets, memoranda, communications or evaluations.
 
(b)           The Seller shall deliver to and deposit with (or cause to be delivered to and deposited with) the Master Servicer within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date a copy of the Mortgage File and documents and records not otherwise required to be contained in the Mortgage File that (i) relate to the origination and/or servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans, (ii) are reasonably necessary for the ongoing administration and/or servicing of the Mortgage Loans (including any asset summaries related to the Mortgage Loans that were delivered to the Rating Agencies in connection with the rating of the Certificates) or for evidencing or enforcing any of the rights of the holder of the Mortgage Loans or holders of interests therein and (iii) are in the possession or under the control of the Seller, together with (x) all unapplied Escrow Payments and reserve funds in the possession or under control of the Seller that relate to the Mortgage Loans and (y) a statement indicating which Escrow Payments and reserve funds are allocable to each Mortgage Loan, provided that copies of any document in the Mortgage File and any other document, record or item referred to above in this sentence that constitutes a Designated Servicing Document shall be delivered to the Master Servicer on or before the Closing Date; provided that the Seller shall not be required to deliver any draft documents, privileged or other communications, credit underwriting, due diligence analyses or data or internal worksheets, memoranda, communications or evaluations.
 
SECTION 4     Treatment as a Security Agreement. Pursuant to Section 1 hereof, the Seller has conveyed to the Purchaser all of its right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans.  The parties intend that such conveyance of the Seller’s right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a purchase and sale and not a loan.  If such conveyance is deemed to be a pledge and not a sale, then the parties also intend and agree that the Seller shall be deemed to have granted, and in such event does hereby grant, to the Purchaser, a first priority security interest in all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the Mortgage Loans, all payments of principal or interest on such Mortgage Loans due after the Cut-Off Date, all other payments made in respect of such Mortgage Loans after the Cut-Off Date (and, in any event, excluding scheduled payments of principal and interest due on or before the Cut-Off Date) and all proceeds thereof, and that this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law.  If such conveyance is deemed to be a pledge and not a sale, the Seller consents to the Purchaser hypothecating and transferring such security interest in favor of the Trustee and transferring the obligation secured thereby to the Trustee.
 
SECTION 5     Covenants of the Seller. The Seller covenants with the Purchaser as follows:
 
(a)           it shall cause Anderson McCoy & Orta, P.C. to record and file in the appropriate public recording office for real property records or UCC financing statements, as appropriate (or, with respect to any assignments that the Certificate Administrator has agreed to record or file pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, deliver to the Certificate Administrator for such purpose and cause the Certificate Administrator to record and file), the assignments of assignment of leases, rents and profits and the assignments of Mortgage and each related UCC-2 and UCC-3 financing statement referred to in the definition of Mortgage File from the Seller to the Trustee as and to the extent contemplated under Section 2.01(c) of the

Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  All out of pocket costs and expenses relating to the recordation or filing of such assignments, assignments of Mortgage and financing statements shall be paid by the Seller.  If any such document or instrument is lost or returned unrecorded or unfiled, as the case may be, because of a defect therein, then the Seller shall prepare or cause the preparation of a substitute therefor or cure such defect or cause such defect to be cured, as the case may be, and the Seller shall record or file, or cause the recording or filing of, such substitute or corrected document or instrument or, with respect to any assignments that the Certificate Administrator has agreed to record or file pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, deliver such substitute or corrected document or instrument to the Certificate Administrator (or, if the Mortgage Loan is then no longer subject to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the then holder of such Mortgage Loan);
 
(b)           as to each Mortgage Loan, if the Seller cannot deliver or cause to be delivered the documents and/or instruments referred to in clauses (2), (3) and (6) (if recorded) and (15) of the definition of “Mortgage File” in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement solely because of a delay caused by the public recording or filing office where such document or instrument has been delivered for recordation or filing, as applicable, it shall forward to the Certificate Administrator a copy of the original certified by the Seller to be a true and complete copy of the original thereof submitted for recording.  The Seller shall cause each assignment referred to in Section (5)(a) above that is recorded and the file copy of each UCC-2 and UCC-3 assignment referred to in Section (5)(a) above to reflect that it should be returned by the public recording or filing office to the Certificate Administrator or its agent following recording (or, alternatively, to the Seller or its designee, in which case the Seller shall deliver or cause the delivery of the recorded original to the Certificate Administrator promptly following receipt); provided that, in those instances where the public recording office retains the original assignment of Mortgage or assignment of Assignment of Leases, the Certificate Administrator shall obtain therefrom a certified copy of the recorded original.  On a monthly basis, at the expense of the Seller, the Certificate Administrator shall forward to the Master Servicer a copy of each of the aforementioned assignments following the Custodian’s receipt thereof;

(d)           Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, if (i) any party thereto discovers or receives notice alleging that any document constituting a part of a Mortgage File has not been properly executed, is missing, contains information that does not conform in any material respect with the corresponding information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, or does not appear to be regular on its face (each, a “Document Defect”), or discovers or receives notice alleging a breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller made pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Agreement with respect to any Mortgage Loan (a “Breach”) or (ii) the Special Servicer or the Purchaser receives a Repurchase Request, such party is required to give prompt written notice thereof to the Seller.

material respects (which cure shall include payment of any losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses associated therewith) or, if such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, cannot be cured within such 90 day period, the Seller shall either (i) substitute a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan for such affected Mortgage Loan (provided that in no event shall any such substitution occur later than the second anniversary of the Closing Date) and pay the Master Servicer, for deposit into the Collection Account, any Substitution Shortfall Amount in connection therewith or (ii) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan or any related REO Property (or the Trust Fund’s interest therein) at the applicable Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Collection Account; provided, however, that if (i) such Material Document Defect or Material Breach is capable of being cured but not within such 90 day period, (ii) such Material Document Defect or Material Breach is not related to any Mortgage Loan’s not being a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of the REMIC Provisions and (iii) the Seller has commenced and is diligently proceeding with the cure of such Material Document Defect or Material Breach within such 90 day period, then the Seller shall have an additional 90 days to complete such cure (or, in the event of a failure to so cure, to complete such repurchase of the related Mortgage Loan or substitute a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan as described above) it being understood and agreed that, in connection with the Seller’s receiving such additional 90 day period, the Seller shall deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee, the Special Servicer and the Certificate Administrator setting forth the reasons such Material Document Defect or Material Breach is not capable of being cured within the initial 90 day period and what actions the Seller is pursuing in connection with the cure thereof and stating that the Seller anticipates that such Material Document Defect or Material Breach will be cured within such additional 90 day period; and provided, further, that, if any such Material Document Defect is still not cured after the initial 90 day period and any such additional 90 day period solely due to the failure of the Seller to have received the recorded document, then the Seller shall be entitled to continue to defer its cure, substitution or repurchase obligations in respect of such Document Defect so long as the Seller certifies to the Trustee, the Special Servicer and the Certificate Administrator every 30 days thereafter that the Document Defect is still in effect solely because of its failure to have received the recorded document and that the Seller is diligently pursuing the cure of such defect (specifying the actions being taken), except that no such deferral of cure, substitution or repurchase may continue beyond the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date.  Any such repurchase of a Mortgage Loan shall be on a servicing released basis.  The Seller shall have no obligation to monitor the Mortgage Loans regarding the existence of a Breach or a Document Defect, but if the Seller discovers a Material Breach or Material Document Defect with respect to a Mortgage Loan, it will notify the Purchaser.

In addition, the Seller shall provide the Depositor, upon request, such other information in its possession as would permit the Depositor to comply with its obligations under Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act to disclose fulfilled and unfulfilled repurchase requests.  Any such information requested shall be provided as promptly as practicable after such request is made.
 
The Seller agrees that no 15Ga-1 Notice Provider will be required to provide information in a 15Ga-1 Notice that is protected by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrines.  In addition, the Seller hereby acknowledges that (i) any 15Ga-1 Notice provided pursuant to Section 2.03(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement is so provided only to assist the Seller, the Depositor and their respective Affiliates to comply with Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act, Items 1104 and 1121 of Regulation AB and any other requirement of law or regulation and (ii)(A) no action taken by, or inaction of, a 15Ga-1 Notice Provider and (B) no information provided pursuant to Section 2.03(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by a 15Ga-1 Notice Provider shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or defense to the exercise of any legal right the 15Ga-1 Notice Provider may have with respect to this Agreement, including with respect to any Repurchase Request that is the subject of a 15Ga-1 Notice.
 
Each party hereto agrees that the receipt of a 15Ga-1 Notice or the delivery of any notice required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 6(i) shall not, in and of itself, constitute delivery of notice of, receipt of notice of, or knowledge of the Seller of, any Material Document Defect or Material Breach.
 
Each party hereto agrees and acknowledges that, as of the date of this Agreement, the “Central Index Key” number of the Trust Fund is 0001578422.

the Seller and the Purchaser shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  Except as set forth in Section 6(h) of this Agreement, the rights and remedies herein expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any party would otherwise have pursuant to law or equity.  No notice to or demand on any party in any case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances, or constitute a waiver of the right of either party to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.
 
SECTION 21     No Partnership.    Nothing herein contained shall be deemed or construed to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties hereto.  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed or construed as creating an agency relationship between the Purchaser and the Seller and neither party shall take any action which could reasonably lead a third party to assume that it has the authority to bind the other party or make commitments on such party’s behalf.
 
SECTION 22     Miscellaneous.    This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.  Neither this Agreement nor any term hereof may be waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver, discharge or termination is sought.
 
SECTION 23     Further Assurances.   The Seller and Purchaser each agree to execute and deliver such instruments and take such further actions as any party hereto may, from time to time, reasonably request in order to effectuate the purposes and carry out the terms of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT B
 
MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 




(1)


Whole Loan; Ownership of Mortgage Loans.  Except with respect to a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan, each Mortgage Loan is a whole loan and not a participation interest in a Mortgage Loan.  Each Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan is a senior or pari passu portion of a whole loan evidenced by a senior or pari passu note.  At the time of the sale, transfer and assignment to Depositor, no Mortgage Note or Mortgage was subject to any assignment (other than assignments to the Seller), participation or pledge, and the Seller had good title to, and was the sole owner of, each Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, charges, pledges, encumbrances, participations, any other ownership interests on, in or to such Mortgage Loan other than any servicing rights appointment or similar agreement and rights of the holder of a related Companion Loan pursuant to a Co-Lender Agreement.  Seller has full right and authority to sell, assign and transfer each Mortgage Loan, and the assignment to Depositor constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment of such Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, pledges, charges or security interests of any nature encumbering such Mortgage Loan other than the rights of the holder of a related Companion Loan pursuant to a Co-Lender Agreement.



 




(2)


Loan Document Status. Each related Mortgage Note, Mortgage, Assignment of Leases (if a separate instrument), guaranty and other agreement executed by or on behalf of the related Mortgagor, guarantor or other obligor in connection with such Mortgage Loan is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Mortgagor, guarantor or other obligor (subject to any non-recourse provisions contained in any of the foregoing agreements and any applicable state anti-deficiency or market value limit deficiency legislation), as applicable, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except (i) as such enforcement may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) that certain provisions in such Loan Documents (including, without limitation, provisions requiring the payment of default interest, late fees or prepayment/yield maintenance fees, charges and/or premiums) are, or may be, further limited or rendered unenforceable by or under applicable law, but (subject to the limitations set forth in clause (i) above) such limitations or unenforceability will not render such Loan Documents invalid as a whole or materially interfere with the Mortgagee’s realization of the principal benefits and/or security provided thereby (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the “Standard Qualifications”).



 
Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, there is no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right of rescission available to the related Mortgagor with respect to any of the related Mortgage Notes, Mortgages or other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any such valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right based on intentional fraud by Seller in connection with the origination of the Mortgage Loan, 
 


  


B-1





  


 
 
that would deny the Mortgagee the principal benefits intended to be provided by the Mortgage Note, Mortgage or other Loan Documents.
 




(3)


Mortgage Provisions.  The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan contain provisions that render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the practical realization against the Mortgaged Property of the principal benefits of the security intended to be provided thereby, including realization by judicial or, if applicable, nonjudicial foreclosure subject to the limitations set forth in the Standard Qualifications.



 




(4)


Mortgage Status; Waivers and Modifications.  Since origination and except by written instruments set forth in the related Mortgage File (a) the material terms of such Mortgage, Mortgage Note, Mortgage Loan guaranty, and related Loan Documents have not been waived, impaired, modified, altered, satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded in any respect which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage; (b) no related Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof has been released from the lien of the related Mortgage in any manner which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the use or operation of the remaining portion of such Mortgaged Property; and (c) neither the related Mortgagor nor the related guarantor has been released from its material obligations under the Mortgage Loan.



 




(5)


Lien; Valid Assignment.  Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each assignment of Mortgage and assignment of Assignment of Leases to the Issuing Entity constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment to the Issuing Entity.  Each related Mortgage and Assignment of Leases is freely assignable without the consent of the related Mortgagor.  Each related Mortgage is a legal, valid and enforceable first lien on the related Mortgagor’s fee (or if identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, leasehold) interest in the Mortgaged Property in the principal amount of such Mortgage Loan or allocated loan amount (subject only to Permitted Encumbrances (as defined below) and the exceptions to paragraph (6) below (each such exception, a “Title Exception”)), except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications. Such Mortgaged Property (subject to and excepting Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions) as of origination was, and as of the Cut-off Date, to the Seller’s knowledge, is free and clear of any recorded mechanics’ liens, recorded materialmen’s liens and other recorded encumbrances which are prior to or equal with the lien of the related Mortgage, except those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by a lender’s title insurance policy (as described below), and, to the Seller’s knowledge and subject to the rights of tenants (as tenants only) (subject to and excepting Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions), no rights exist which under law could give rise to any such lien or encumbrance that would be prior to or equal with the lien of the related Mortgage, except those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by a lender’s title insurance policy (as described below).  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of Uniform Commercial Code financing statements is required in order to effect such perfection.



 


  


B-2





  


 




(6)


Permitted Liens; Title Insurance.  Each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan is covered by an American Land Title Association loan title insurance policy or a comparable form of loan title insurance policy approved for use in the applicable jurisdiction (or, if such policy is yet to be issued, by a pro forma policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a “marked up” commitment, in each case binding on the title insurer) (the “Title Policy”) in the original principal amount of such Mortgage Loan (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan secured by multiple properties, an amount equal to at least the allocated loan amount with respect to the Title Policy for each such property) after all advances of principal (including any advances held in escrow or reserves), that insures for the benefit of the owner of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage, the first priority lien of the Mortgage, which lien is subject only to (a) the lien of current real property taxes, water charges, sewer rents and assessments due and payable but not yet delinquent; (b) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public record; (c) the exceptions (general and specific) and exclusions set forth in such Title Policy; (d) other matters to which like properties are commonly subject; (e) the rights of tenants (as tenants only) under leases (including subleases) pertaining to the related Mortgaged Property and condominium declarations; (f) if the related Mortgage Loan constitutes a Cross-Collateralized Mortgage Loan, the lien of the Mortgage for another Mortgage Loan contained in the same Cross-Collateralized Group; and (g) if the related Mortgage Loan is part of a Whole Loan, the rights of the holder of the related Companion Loan pursuant to a Co-Lender Agreement; provided that none of which items (a) through (g), individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely interferes with the value or current use of the Mortgaged Property or the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the Mortgagor’s ability to pay its obligations when they become due (collectively, the “Permitted Encumbrances”).  Except as contemplated by clause (f) of the preceding sentence, none of the Permitted Encumbrances are mortgage liens that are senior to or coordinate and co-equal with the lien of the related Mortgage.  Such Title Policy (or, if it has yet to be issued, the coverage to be provided thereby) is in full force and effect, all premiums thereon have been paid and no claims have been made by the Seller thereunder and no claims have been paid thereunder. Neither the Seller, nor to the Seller’s knowledge, any other holder of the Mortgage Loan, has done, by act or omission, anything that would materially impair the coverage under such Title Policy.



 




(7)


Junior Liens.  It being understood that B notes secured by the same Mortgage as a Mortgage Loan are not subordinate mortgages or junior liens, except for any Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan, there are no subordinate mortgages or junior liens securing the payment of money encumbering the related Mortgaged Property (other than Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, taxes and assessments, mechanics and materialmens liens (which are the subject of the representation in paragraph (5) above), and equipment and other personal property financing).  Except as set forth on an exhibit to the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, the Seller has no knowledge of any mezzanine debt secured directly by interests in the related Mortgagor.



 





(8)


Assignment of Leases and Rents.  There exists as part of the related Mortgage File an Assignment of Leases (either as a separate instrument or incorporated into the related 




 


  


B-3





  


 



 

Mortgage). Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, each related Assignment of Leases creates a valid first-priority collateral assignment of, or a valid first-priority lien or security interest in, rents and certain rights under the related lease or leases, subject only to a license granted to the related Mortgagor to exercise certain rights and to perform certain obligations of the lessor under such lease or leases, including the right to operate the related leased property, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications.  The related Mortgage or related Assignment of Leases, subject to applicable law, provides that, upon an event of default under the Mortgage Loan, a receiver is permitted to be appointed for the collection of rents or for the related Mortgagee to enter into possession to collect the rents or for rents to be paid directly to the Mortgagee.



 




(9)


UCC Filings.  If the related Mortgaged Property is operated as a hospitality property, the Seller has filed and/or recorded or caused to be filed and/or recorded (or, if not filed and/or recorded, have been submitted in proper form for filing and/or recording), UCC financing statements in the appropriate public filing and/or recording offices necessary at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan to perfect a valid security interest in all items of physical personal property reasonably necessary to operate such Mortgaged Property owned by such Mortgagor and located on the related Mortgaged Property (other than any non-material personal property, any personal property subject to a purchase money security interest, a sale and leaseback financing arrangement as permitted under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents or any other personal property leases applicable to such personal property), to the extent perfection may be effected pursuant to applicable law by recording or filing, as the case may be.  Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each related Mortgage (or equivalent document) creates a valid and enforceable lien and security interest on the items of personalty described above.  No representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of UCC financing statements are required in order to effect such perfection.



 




(10)


Condition of Property.  Seller or the originator of the Mortgage Loan inspected or caused to be inspected each related Mortgaged Property within six months of origination of the Mortgage Loan and within thirteen months of the Cut-off Date.



 




  


An engineering report or property condition assessment was prepared in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan no more than thirteen months prior to the Cut-off Date.  To the Seller’s knowledge, based solely upon due diligence customarily performed in connection with the origination of comparable mortgage loans, as of the Closing Date, each related Mortgaged Property was free and clear of any material damage (other than deferred maintenance for which escrows were established at origination) that would affect materially and adversely the use or value of such Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan.



 





(11)


Taxes and Assessments.  All taxes, governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges (including, without limitation, water and sewage charges), or installments thereof, which could be a lien on the related Mortgaged Property that would 




 


  


B-4





  


 



 

be of equal or superior priority to the lien of the Mortgage and that prior to the Cut-off Date have become delinquent in respect of each related Mortgaged Property have been paid, or an escrow of funds has been established in an amount sufficient to cover such payments and reasonably estimated interest and penalties, if any, thereon.  For purposes of this representation and warranty, real estate taxes and governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges and installments thereof shall not be considered delinquent until the earlier of (a) the date on which interest and/or penalties would first be payable thereon and (b) the date on which enforcement action is entitled to be taken by the related taxing authority.



 




(12)


Condemnation.  As of the date of origination and to the Seller’s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding pending, and, to the Seller’s knowledge as of the date of origination and as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding threatened, for the total or partial condemnation of such Mortgaged Property that would have a material adverse effect on the value, use or operation of the Mortgaged Property.



 




(13)


Actions Concerning Mortgage Loan.  As of the date of origination and to the Seller’s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there was no pending or filed action, suit or proceeding, arbitration or governmental investigation involving any Mortgagor, guarantor, or Mortgagor’s interest in the Mortgaged Property, an adverse outcome of which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect (a) such Mortgagor’s title to the Mortgaged Property, (b) the validity or enforceability of the Mortgage, (c) such Mortgagor’s ability to perform under the related Mortgage Loan, (d) such guarantor’s ability to perform under the related guaranty, (e) the principal benefit of the security intended to be provided by the Mortgage Loan documents or (f) the current principal use of the Mortgaged Property.



 




(14)


Escrow Deposits.  All escrow deposits and payments required to be escrowed with Mortgagee pursuant to each Mortgage Loan are in the possession, or under the control, of the Seller or its servicer, and there are no deficiencies (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods) in connection therewith, and all such escrows and deposits (or the right thereto) that are required to be escrowed with Mortgagee under the related Loan Documents are being conveyed by the Seller to Depositor or its servicer.



 




(15)


No Holdbacks.  The principal amount of the Mortgage Loan stated on the Mortgage Loan Schedule has been fully disbursed as of the Closing Date and there is no requirement for future advances thereunder (except in those cases where the full amount of the Mortgage Loan has been disbursed but a portion thereof is being held in escrow or reserve accounts pending the satisfaction of certain conditions relating to leasing, repairs or other matters with respect to the related Mortgaged Property, the Mortgagor or other considerations determined by Seller to merit such holdback).



 





(16)


Insurance.  Each related Mortgaged Property is, and is required pursuant to the related Mortgage to be, insured by a property insurance policy providing coverage for loss in accordance with coverage found under a “special cause of loss form” or “all risk form” that includes replacement cost valuation issued by an insurer meeting the requirements of the related Loan Documents and having a claims-paying or financial strength rating of at least “A-:VIII” from A.M. Best Company or “A3” (or the equivalent) from Moody’s 




 


  


B-5





  


 



 

Investors Service, Inc. or “A-“ from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service (collectively the “Insurance Rating Requirements”), in an amount (subject to a customary deductible) not less than the lesser of (1) the original principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (2) the full insurable value on a replacement cost basis of the improvements, furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment owned by the Mortgagor and included in the Mortgaged Property (with no deduction for physical depreciation), but, in any event, not less than the amount necessary or containing such endorsements as are necessary to avoid the operation of any coinsurance provisions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property.



 
Each related Mortgaged Property is also covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by business interruption or rental loss insurance which (subject to a customary deductible) covers a period of not less than 12 months (or with respect to each Mortgage Loan on a single asset with a principal balance of $50 million or more, 18 months).
 
If any material part of the improvements, exclusive of a parking lot, located on a Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as “a Special Flood Hazard Area,” the related Mortgagor  is required to maintain insurance  in the maximum amount available under the National Flood Insurance Program.
 
If the Mortgaged Property is located within 25 miles of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina or North Carolina, the related Mortgagor is required to maintain coverage for windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or “named storms” issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements or endorsement covering damage from windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or named storms.
 
The Mortgaged Property is covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by a commercial general liability insurance policy issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements including coverage for property damage, contractual damage and personal injury (including bodily injury and death) in amounts as are generally required by prudent institutional commercial mortgage lenders, and in any event not less than $1 million per occurrence and $2 million in the aggregate.
 
An architectural or engineering consultant has performed an analysis of each of the Mortgaged Properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4 in order to evaluate the structural and seismic condition of such property, for the sole purpose of assessing the scenario expected limit (“SEL”) for the Mortgaged Property in the event of an earthquake. In such instance, the SEL was based on a 475-year return period, an exposure period of 50 years and a 10% probability of exceedance. If the resulting report concluded that the SEL would exceed 20% of the amount of the replacement costs of the improvements, earthquake insurance on such Mortgaged Property was obtained by an insurer rated at least “A:VIII” by A.M. Best Company or “A3” (or the equivalent) from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or “A-“  by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service in an amount not less than 100% of the SEL.
 


  


B-6





  


 
The Loan Documents require insurance proceeds in respect of a property loss to be applied either (a) to the repair or restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property, with respect to all property losses in excess of 5% of the then outstanding principal amount of the related Mortgage Loan, the Mortgagee (or a trustee appointed by it) having the right to hold and disburse such proceeds as the repair or restoration progresses, or (b) to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage Loan together with any accrued interest thereon.
 
All premiums on all insurance policies referred to in this section required to be paid as of the Cut-off Date have been paid, and such insurance policies name the Mortgagee under the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns as a loss payee under a mortgagee endorsement clause or, in the case of the general liability insurance policy, as named or additional insured. Such insurance policies will inure to the benefit of the Trustee.  Each related Mortgage Loan obligates the related Mortgagor to maintain all such insurance and, at such Mortgagor’s failure to do so, authorizes the Mortgagee to maintain such insurance at the Mortgagor’s reasonable cost and expense and to charge such Mortgagor for related premiums.  All such insurance policies (other than commercial liability policies) require at least 10 days’ prior notice to the Mortgagee of termination or cancellation arising because of nonpayment of a premium and at least 30 days prior notice to the Mortgagee of termination or cancellation (or such lesser period, not less than 10 days, as may be required by applicable law) arising for any reason other than non-payment of a premium and no such notice has been received by Seller.
 




(17)


Access; Utilities; Separate Tax Lots.  Each Mortgaged Property (a) is located on or adjacent to a public road and has direct legal access to such road, or has access  via an irrevocable easement or irrevocable right of way permitting ingress and egress to/from a public road, (b) is served by or has uninhibited access rights to public or private water and sewer (or well and septic) and all required utilities, all of which are appropriate for the current use of the Mortgaged Property, and (c) constitutes one or more separate tax parcels which do not include any property which is not part of the Mortgaged Property or is subject to an endorsement under the related Title Policy insuring the Mortgaged Property, or in certain cases, an application has been, or will be, made to the applicable governing authority for creation of separate tax lots, in which case the Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to escrow an amount sufficient to pay taxes for the existing tax parcel of which the Mortgaged Property is a part until the separate tax lots are created.



 




(18)


No Encroachments.  To Seller’s knowledge based solely on surveys obtained in connection with origination and the Mortgagee’s Title Policy (or, if such policy is not yet issued, a pro forma title policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a “marked up” commitment) obtained in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan, all material improvements that were included for the purpose of determining the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property at the time of the origination of such Mortgage Loan are within the boundaries of the related Mortgaged Property, except encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy.  No improvements on adjoining parcels encroach onto the related Mortgaged Property except for encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value 



 


  


B-7





  


 




 

or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy.  No improvements encroach upon any easements except for encroachments the removal of which would not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements obtained with respect to the Title Policy.




 




(19)


No Contingent Interest or Equity Participation.  No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation feature, any other contingent interest feature or a negative amortization feature or an equity participation by Seller.



 




(20)


REMIC.  The Mortgage Loan is a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code (but determined without regard to the rule in Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that treats certain defective mortgage loans as qualified mortgages), and, accordingly, (A) the issue price of the Mortgage Loan to the related Mortgagor at origination did not exceed the non-contingent principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and (B) either: (a) such Mortgage Loan is secured by an interest in real property (including buildings and structural components thereof, but excluding personal property) having a fair market value (i) at the date the Mortgage Loan was originated at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage Loan on such date or (ii) at the Closing Date at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage Loan on such date, provided that for purposes hereof, the fair market value of the real property interest must first be reduced by (A) the amount of any lien on the real property interest that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (B) a proportionate amount of any lien that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan; or (b) substantially all of the proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used to acquire, improve or protect the real property which served as the only security for such Mortgage Loan (other than a recourse feature or other third-party credit enhancement within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(1)(ii)).  If the Mortgage Loan was “significantly modified” prior to the Closing Date so as to result in a taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code, it either (x) was modified as a result of the default or reasonably foreseeable default of such Mortgage Loan or (y) satisfies the provisions of either sub-clause (B)(a)(i) above (substituting the date of the last such modification for the date the Mortgage Loan was originated) or sub-clause (B)(a)(ii), including the proviso thereto.  Any prepayment premium and yield maintenance charges applicable to the Mortgage Loan constitute “customary prepayment penalties” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-1(b)(2).  All terms used in this paragraph shall have the same meanings as set forth in the related Treasury Regulations.



 




(21)


Compliance with Usury Laws.  The Mortgage Rate (exclusive of any default interest, late charges, yield maintenance charge, or prepayment premiums) of such Mortgage Loan complied as of the date of origination with, or was exempt from, applicable state or federal laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to usury.



 




(22)


Authorized to do Business.  To the extent required under applicable law, as of the Cut-off Date or as of the date that such entity held the Mortgage Note, each holder of the Mortgage Note was authorized to originate, acquire and/or hold (as applicable) the Mortgage Note in the jurisdiction in which each related Mortgaged Property is located, or 



 


  


B-8





  


 




 

the failure to be so authorized does not materially and adversely affect the enforceability of such Mortgage Loan by the Trust.




 




(23)


Trustee under Deed of Trust.  With respect to each Mortgage which is a deed of trust, as of the date of origination and, to the Seller’s knowledge, as of the Closing Date, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, currently so serves and is named in the deed of trust or has been substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law or may be substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law by the related Mortgagee.



 




(24)


Local Law Compliance.  To the Seller’s knowledge, based upon any of a letter from any governmental authorities, a legal opinion, an architect’s letter, a zoning consultant’s report, an endorsement to the related Title Policy, or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar commercial and multifamily mortgage loans intended for securitization, there are no material violations of applicable zoning ordinances, building codes and land laws (collectively “Zoning Regulations”) with respect to the improvements located on or forming part of each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan as of the date of origination of such Mortgage Loan (or related Whole Loan, as applicable) and as of the Cut-off Date, other than those which (i) are insured by the Title Policy or a law and ordinance insurance policy or (ii) would not have a material adverse effect on the value, operation or net operating income of the Mortgaged Property.  The terms of the Loan Documents require the Mortgagor to comply in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, zoning and building laws.



 




(25)


Licenses and Permits.  Each Mortgagor covenants in the Loan Documents that it shall keep all material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations necessary for its operation of the Mortgaged Property in full force and effect, and to the Seller’s knowledge based upon any of a letter from any government authorities or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar commercial and multifamily mortgage loans intended for securitization, all such material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations are in effect.  The Mortgage Loan requires the related Mortgagor to be qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged Property is located.



 




(26)


Recourse Obligations.  The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan provide that such Mortgage Loan (a) becomes full recourse to the Mortgagor and guarantor (which is a natural person or persons, or an entity distinct from the Mortgagor (but may be affiliated with the Mortgagor) that has assets other than equity in the related Mortgaged Property that are not de minimis) in any of the following events: (i) if any voluntary petition for bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation pursuant to federal bankruptcy law, or any similar federal or state law, shall be filed by the Mortgagor; (ii) Mortgagor or guarantor shall have colluded with (or, alternatively, solicited or caused to be solicited) other creditors to cause an involuntary bankruptcy filing with respect to the Mortgagor or (iii) voluntary transfers of either the Mortgaged Property or equity interests in Mortgagor made in violation of the Loan Documents; and (b) contains provisions providing for recourse against the Mortgagor and guarantor (which is a natural person or persons, or an 



 


  


B-9





  


 
entity distinct from the Mortgagor (but may be affiliated with the Mortgagor) that has assets other than equity in the related Mortgaged Property that are not de minimis), for losses and damages sustained by reason of Mortgagor’s (i) misappropriation of rents after the occurrence of an event of default under the Mortgage Loan; (ii) misappropriation of (A) insurance proceeds or condemnation awards or (B) security deposits or, alternatively, the failure of any security deposits to be delivered to Mortgagee upon foreclosure or action in lieu thereof (except to the extent applied in accordance with leases prior to a Mortgage Loan event of default); (iii) fraud or intentional material misrepresentation; (iv) breaches of the environmental covenants in the Loan Documents; or (v) commission of intentional material physical waste at the Mortgaged Property.
 




(27)


Mortgage Releases.  The terms of the related Mortgage or related Loan Documents do not provide for release of any material portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage except (a) a partial release, accompanied by principal repayment, of not less than a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (i) 110% of the related allocated loan amount of such portion of the Mortgaged Property and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, (b) upon payment in full of such Mortgage Loan, (c) upon a Defeasance defined in (32) below, (d) releases of out-parcels that are unimproved or other portions of the Mortgaged Property which will not have a material adverse effect on the underwritten value of the Mortgaged Property and which were not afforded any material value in the appraisal obtained at the origination of the Mortgage Loan and are not necessary for physical access to the Mortgaged Property or compliance with zoning requirements, or (e) as required pursuant to an order of condemnation or taking by a State or any political subdivision or authority thereof.  With respect to any partial release under the preceding clauses (a) or (d), either: (x) such release of collateral (i) would not constitute a “significant modification” of the subject Mortgage Loan within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(b)(2) and (ii) would not cause the subject Mortgage Loan to fail to be a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3)(A) of the Code; or (y) the Mortgagee or servicer can, in accordance with the related Loan Documents, condition such release of collateral on the related Mortgagor’s delivery of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect specified in the immediately preceding clause (x).  For purposes of the preceding clause (x), for all Mortgage Loans originated after December 6, 2010, if the fair market value of the real property constituting such Mortgaged Property after the release is not equal to at least 80% of the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan outstanding after the release, the Mortgagor is required to make a payment of principal in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions.



 
With respect to any partial release under the preceding clause (e), for all Mortgage Loans originated after December 6, 2010, the Mortgagor can be required to pay down the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions and, to such extent, such amount may not be required to be applied to the restoration of the Mortgaged Property or released to the Mortgagor, if, immediately after the release of such portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage (but taking into account the planned restoration) the fair market value of the real property constituting the remaining Mortgaged Property is not equal to at least 80% of the remaining principal balance of the Mortgage Loan.
 


  


B-10





  


 
No Mortgage Loan that is secured by more than one Mortgaged Property or that is cross-collateralized with another Mortgage Loan permits the release of cross-collateralization of the related Mortgaged Properties or a portion thereof, including due to partial condemnation, other than in compliance with the REMIC Provisions.
 




(28)


Financial Reporting and Rent Rolls.  The Mortgage Loan documents for each Mortgage Loan require the Mortgagor to provide the owner or holder of the Mortgage with quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties) and annual operating statements, and quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties) rent rolls for properties that have leases contributing more than 5% of the in-place base rent and annual financial statements, which annual financial statements with respect to each Mortgage Loan with more than one Mortgagor are in the form of an annual combined balance sheet of the Mortgagor entities (and no other entities), together with the related combined statements of operations, members’ capital and cash flows, including a combining balance sheet and statement of income for the Mortgaged Properties on a combined basis.



 




(29)


Acts of Terrorism Exclusion.  With respect to each Mortgage Loan over $20 million, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) do not specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (collectively referred to as “TRIA”), from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy.  With respect to each other Mortgage Loan, the related special all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) did not, as of the date of origination of the Mortgage Loan, and, to Seller’s knowledge, do not, as of the Cut-off Date, specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy.  With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the related Loan Documents do not expressly waive or prohibit the Mortgagee from requiring coverage for Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, or damages related thereto; provided, however, that if TRIA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then, provided that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the Mortgagor under each Mortgage Loan is required to carry terrorism insurance, but in such event the Mortgagor shall not be required to spend more than the Terrorism Cap Amount on terrorism insurance coverage, and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds the Terrorism Cap Amount, the Mortgagor is required to purchase the maximum amount  of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to the Terrorism Cap Amount.  The “Terrorism Cap Amount”  is the specified percentage (which is at least equal to 200%)  of the amount of the insurance premium that is payable at such time  in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the related Loan Documents (without giving effect to the cost of terrorism and earthquake components of such casualty and business interruption/rental loss insurance).



 




(30)


Due on Sale or Encumbrance.  Subject to specific exceptions set forth below, each Mortgage Loan contains a “due on sale” or other such provision for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan if, without the consent of the holder of the Mortgage (which consent, in some cases, may not be 



 


  


B-11





  


 
unreasonably withheld) and/or complying with the requirements of the related Loan Documents (which provide for transfers without the consent of the Mortgagee which are customarily acceptable to prudent commercial and multifamily mortgage lending institutions lending on the security of property comparable to the related Mortgaged Property, including, without limitation, transfers of worn-out or obsolete furnishings, fixtures, or equipment promptly replaced with property of equivalent value and functionality and transfers by leases entered into in accordance with the Loan Documents), (a) the related Mortgaged Property, or any equity interest of greater than 50% in the related Mortgagor, is directly or indirectly pledged, transferred or sold, other than as related to (i) family and estate planning transfers or transfers upon death or legal incapacity, (ii) transfers to certain affiliates as defined in the related Loan Documents, (iii) transfers of less than, or other than, a controlling interest in the related Mortgagor, (iv) transfers to another holder of direct or indirect equity in the Mortgagor, a specific Person designated in the related Loan Documents or a Person satisfying specific criteria identified in the related Loan Documents, such as a qualified equityholder, (v) transfers of stock or similar equity units in publicly traded companies or (vi) a substitution or release of collateral within the parameters of paragraphs (27) and (32) herein or the exceptions thereto set forth on Annex E-2, or (vii) as set forth on an exhibit to the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement by reason of any mezzanine debt that existed at the origination of the related Mortgage Loan, or future permitted mezzanine debt as set forth on an exhibit to the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement or (b) the related Mortgaged Property is encumbered with a subordinate lien or security interest against the related Mortgaged Property, other than (i) any Companion Loan of any Mortgage Loan or any subordinate debt that existed at origination and is permitted under the related Loan Documents, (ii) purchase money security interests (iii) any Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan, as set forth on an exhibit to the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement or (iv) Permitted Encumbrances.  The Mortgage or other Loan Documents provide that to the extent any Rating Agency fees are incurred in connection with the review of and consent to any transfer or encumbrance, the Mortgagor is responsible for such payment along with all other reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Mortgagee relative to such transfer or encumbrance.
 




(31)


Single-Purpose Entity.  Each Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to be a Single-Purpose Entity for at least as long as the Mortgage Loan is outstanding.  Both the Loan Documents and the organizational documents of the Mortgagor with respect to each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date Principal Balance in excess of $5 million provide that the Mortgagor is a Single-Purpose Entity, and each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date Principal Balance of $20 million or more has a counsel’s opinion regarding non-consolidation of the Mortgagor.  For this purpose, a “Single-Purpose Entity” shall mean an entity, other than an individual, whose organizational documents (or if the Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Principal Balance equal to $5 million or less, its organizational documents or the related Loan Documents) provide substantially to the effect that it was formed or organized solely for the purpose of owning and operating one or more of the Mortgaged Properties securing the Mortgage Loans and prohibit it from engaging in any business unrelated to such Mortgaged Property or Properties, and whose organizational documents further provide, or which entity represented in the related Loan 



 
 


  


B-12





  


 
Documents, substantially to the effect that it does not have any assets other than those related to its interest in and operation of such Mortgaged Property or Properties, or any indebtedness other than as permitted by the related Mortgage(s) or the other related Loan Documents, that it has its own books and records and accounts separate and apart from those of any other person (other than a Mortgagor for a Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the related Mortgage Loan), and that it holds itself out as a legal entity, separate and apart from any other person or entity.
 




(32)


Defeasance.  With respect to any Mortgage Loan that, pursuant to the Loan Documents, can be defeased (a “Defeasance”), (i) the Loan Documents provide for defeasance as a unilateral right of the Mortgagor, subject to satisfaction of conditions specified in the Loan Documents; (ii) the Mortgage Loan cannot be defeased within two years after the Closing Date; (iii) the Mortgagor is permitted to pledge only United States “government securities” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(ii), the revenues from which will, in the case of a full Defeasance, be sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Mortgage Loan when due, including the entire remaining principal balance on the maturity date (or on or after the first date on which payment may be made without payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment penalty), and if the Mortgage Loan permits partial releases of real property in connection with partial defeasance, the revenues from the collateral will be sufficient to pay all such scheduled payments calculated on a principal amount equal to a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (i) 110% of the allocated loan amount for the real property to be released and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan; (iv) the Mortgagor is required to provide a certification from an independent certified public accountant that the collateral is sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Mortgage Note as set forth in (iii) above, (v) if the Mortgagor would continue to own assets in addition to the defeasance collateral, the portion of the Mortgage Loan secured by defeasance collateral is required to be assumed (or the Mortgagee may require such assumption) by a Single-Purpose Entity; (vi) the Mortgagor is required to provide an opinion of counsel that the Mortgagee has a perfected security interest in such collateral prior to any other claim or interest; and (vii) the Mortgagor is required to pay all rating agency fees associated with defeasance (if rating confirmation is a specific condition precedent thereto) and all other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with defeasance, including, but not limited to, accountant’s fees and opinions of counsel.



 




(33)


Fixed Interest Rates.  Each Mortgage Loan bears interest at a rate that remains fixed throughout the remaining term of such Mortgage Loan, except in situations where default interest is imposed.



 




(34)


Ground Leases.   For purposes of this Annex E-1, a “Ground Lease” shall mean a lease creating a leasehold estate in real property where the fee owner as the ground lessor conveys for a term or terms of years its entire interest in the land and buildings and other improvements, if any, comprising the premises demised under such lease to the ground lessee (who may, in certain circumstances, own the building and improvements on the land), subject to the reversionary interest of the ground lessor as fee owner and does not include industrial development agency (IDA) or similar leases for purposes of conferring a tax abatement or other benefit.



 


  


B-13





  


 
With respect to any Mortgage Loan where the Mortgage Loan is secured by a leasehold estate under a Ground Lease in whole or in part, and the related Mortgage does not also encumber the related lessor’s fee interest in such Mortgaged Property, based upon the terms of the Ground Lease and any estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor in favor of Seller, its successors and assigns, Seller represents and warrants that:
 
(1) The Ground Lease or a memorandum regarding such Ground Lease has been duly recorded or submitted for recordation in a form that is acceptable for recording in the applicable jurisdiction.  The Ground Lease or an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor permits the interest of the lessee to be encumbered by the related Mortgage and does not restrict the use of the related Mortgaged Property by such lessee, its successors or assigns in a manner that would materially adversely affect the security provided by the related Mortgage.  No material change in the terms of the Ground Lease had occurred since the origination of the Mortgage Loan, except as reflected in any written instruments which are included in the related Mortgage File;
 
(2) The lessor under such Ground Lease has agreed in a writing included in the related Mortgage File (or in such Ground Lease) that the Ground Lease may not be amended or  modified, or canceled or terminated by agreement of lessor and lessee, without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee;
 
(3) The Ground Lease has an original term (or an original term plus one or more optional renewal terms, which, under all circumstances, may be exercised, and will be enforceable, by either Mortgagor or the Mortgagee) that extends not less than 20 years beyond the stated maturity of the related Mortgage Loan, or 10 years past the stated maturity if such Mortgage Loan fully amortizes by the stated maturity (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan that accrues on an actual 360 basis, substantially amortizes);
 
(4) The Ground Lease either (i) is not subject to any liens or encumbrances superior to, or of equal priority with, the Mortgage, except for the related fee interest of the ground lessor and the Permitted Encumbrances or (ii)  is subject to a subordination, non disturbance and attornment agreement to which the Mortgagee on the lessor’s fee interest in the Mortgaged Property is subject;
 
(5) The Ground Lease does not place commercially unreasonably restrictions on the identity of the Mortgagee and the Ground Lease is assignable to the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of the lessor thereunder (provided that proper notice is delivered to the extent required in accordance with the Ground Lease), and in the event it is so assigned, it is further assignable by the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of (but with prior notice to) the lessor;
 
(6) The Seller has not received any written notice of material default under or notice of termination of such Ground Lease.  To the Seller’s knowledge, there is no material default under such Ground Lease and no condition that, but for the passage of time or giving of notice, would result in a material default under the terms of such Ground Lease and to the Seller’s knowledge, such Ground Lease is in full force and effect as of the Closing Date;
 


  


B-14





  


 
(7) The Ground Lease or ancillary agreement between the lessor and the lessee requires the lessor to give to the Mortgagee written notice of any default, and provides that no notice of default or termination is effective against the Mortgagee unless such notice is given to the Mortgagee;
 
(8) The Mortgagee is permitted a reasonable opportunity (including, where necessary, sufficient time to gain possession of the interest of the lessee under the Ground Lease through legal proceedings) to cure any default under the Ground Lease which is curable after the Mortgagee’s receipt of notice of any default before the lessor may terminate the Ground Lease;
 
(9) The Ground Lease does not impose any restrictions on subletting that would be viewed as commercially unreasonable by a prudent commercial mortgage lender;
 
(10)    Under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds or the portion of the condemnation award allocable to the ground lessee’s interest (other than (i) de minimis amounts for minor casualties or (ii) in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking as addressed in subpart (k)) will be applied either to the repair or to restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property with (so long as such proceeds are in excess of the threshold amount specified in the related Loan Documents) the Mortgagee or a trustee appointed by it having the right to hold and disburse such proceeds as repair or restoration progresses, or to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest;
 
(11)    In the case of a total or substantially total taking or loss, under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds, or portion of the condemnation award allocable to ground lessee’s interest in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking of the related Mortgaged Property to the extent not applied to restoration, will be applied first to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest; and
 
(12)    Provided that the Mortgagee cures any defaults which are susceptible to being cured, the ground lessor has agreed to enter into a new lease with Mortgagee upon termination of the Ground Lease for any reason, including rejection of the Ground Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding.

(38)


Bankruptcy.  As of the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan and to the Seller’s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, neither the Mortgaged Property (other than any tenants of such Mortgaged Property), nor any portion thereof, is the subject of, and no Mortgagor, guarantor or tenant occupying a single-tenant property is a debtor in state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
