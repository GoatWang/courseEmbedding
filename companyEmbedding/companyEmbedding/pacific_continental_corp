Trump's approval rating at 70-year low
18 July 2017



Despite this historic low, President Trump struck a cautiously optimistic tone Sunday morning, tweeting that the score was "not bad" even though it was, in fact, the worst of all time six months in. Sixty-eight percent believe his tweets - which do everything from attack rivals to tout his successes - are inappropriate; 65 percent view them as insulting; and 52 percent believe they're unsafe.Mr Trump's standing with the American people has worsened amid mounting criticism of alleged Russian links to his campaign team, healthcare reform, and perceptions of weaker United States leadership overseas.The poll indicated that the Russian government's meddling during the 2016 election would continue to haunt Trump's presidency; 60 percent of national adults believed Russia tried to influence the election outcome and 44 percent believed that Trump benefited from that influence.48 percent of Americans see USA leadership in the world weaker under Trump; 27 percent say it's stronger.

The survey has a margin of error of 3 percent. First, Trump's approval rating is at 36%, not 40%.With respect to the meeting, 63% of respondents believe Trump Jr.'s actions were inappropriate. A majority, 52% also said they were of the opinion that Donald Trump was trying to impede the Russian investigation.

Yep, that is a 36 percent approval rating, and a 58 percent disapproval rating. Half of Americans preferred Obamacare to the proposals the Republicans have drawn up to replace it.Among Republicans, 38 percent of those polled said Trump's conduct has been unpresidential, a view shared by 48 percent of white evangelical protestants reached by the poll and 55 percent of white men without a college degree who responded to it.The poll also offers a look at the perception of the Democratic party.

Lakers' Lonzo Ball to miss Summer League finale with calf strain
18 July 2017



Lonzo Ball doesn't have an official sponsorship deal with Nike, Adidas or Under Armour. He has even established winning chemistry with Kuzma that has been the hallmark of L.A.'s Summer League run.The point guard from UCLA scored 28 points in the second half, but the Lakers couldn't get him the ball on an inbounds pass trailing by one. Apparently not. ESPN reported record Summer League ratings, thanks to Lonzo, and that means we're only going to get more of the Balls on TV. So, you know, playing him, it's going to be a lot of fun.Again, Ingram only played in one game, but he was dominant.


Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAOI) Downgraded by Vetr Inc. to Buy
The transaction was disclosed in a document filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission, which is available through this link. Following the transaction, the insider now directly owns 320,455 shares of the company's stock, valued at $21,150,030.
While there were questions about Ball's athleticism and shooting form, many believed his ability to see the court, make on-target passes, and find open teammates would make him, at the least, a rotation-worthy guard. Ball is a floor general and a big reason for the Lakers' Summer League success and why they are heading to the Summer League Finals against the Portland Trailblazers.Lonzo Ball scored 36 points in his third NBA Summer League game on Wednesday against the Philadelphia 76ers, seemingly quietening critics who question whether he's poised for NBA stardom. David Nwaba was waived mid-Summer League. And despite that incredibly small sample, he shot almost 10 percent better in games he started as opposed to games he came off of the bench.Kyle Kuzma has shown signs of brilliance continually throughout these summer league games. When it comes to high expectations, it's hard not to put the Lakers in that box. Boy has that changed quickly. In his first two games, he opted to wear his signature Big Baller Brand "ZO2", in which he averaged 8 points, 7.5 rebounds and 8 assists. But after starting zero-for-five, he made two big jumpers (including a fake-and-dribble triple) in the fourth quarter to help the Mavs haul in that big deficit and set up the exciting finish that had never looked likely.
HSBC Holdings plc Raises Carnival plc (CCL) Price Target to GBX 5600
It is positive, as 39 investors sold Hays plc shares while 169 reduced holdings. 2 funds opened positions while 0 raised stakes. The Company's divisions include Asia Pacific; Continental Europe & Rest of World, and United Kingdom & Ireland.
This certainly seems like part of a long-term play by LaVar and Lonzo. Now we're seeing it.Some of the other over/under lines have the Golden State Warriors at 67.5, the Houston Rockets at 56.5, and the Los Angeles Clippers at 41.5 wins for this season. Not that Summer League is an indicator that Ball will be able to maintain this excellence against top-flight competition, but his performance and persuasion is definitely encouraging.

Does Pacific Continental Corporation’s (PCBK) July stock price reflect its future growth?



Jodi Pearce 


            				July 18, 2017			        


 Pacific Continental Corporation (NASDAQ:PCBK) is considered a high growth stock, but some investors are starting to doubt its last closing price of $25.2 can be still justified by the high growth potential. When questioning the value of a company’s share price, I have a few metrics I check. Let’s see how PCBK stacks up against those measures. Check out our latest analysis for Pacific Continental 
What can we expect from PCBK in the future?
 Analysts covering PCBK are predicting a 39.1% increase in earnings over the next 1-2 years. This would see the earnings rise to $1.48 levels. No doubt this would please existing investors who are used to $0.94 over the past years. 
 

 Pacific Continental (NasdaqGS:PCBK) Past Future Earnings Jul 18th 17
 
                         This means earnings will be above what has been seen in the past few years. 
 In the same period we are supposed to see the revenue grow from $90 Million to $117 Million in 2018 and profits (net income) are predicted to rise from $20 Million to $33 Million in 2018, roughly growing 1.6x. Margins are predicted to be extremely healthy during this time as well. 
What is Pacific Continental’s value based on its current earnings?
 Pacific Continental is available at price to earnings ratio of 25.8x, showing us it is overvalued based on current earnings compared to the Banks industry average of 14.1x and overvalued when compared to the US market average of 23.6x . 
 

 Pacific Continental (NasdaqGS:PCBK) PE PEG Gauge Jul 18th 17
 
 P/E ratio is simply a stock’s price divided by its earnings per share (EPS). It is a straightforward and popular way of assessing how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar a company earns. 
So does PCBK’s earnings growth justify its valuation?
 We already know that PCBK appears to be overvalued when compared to its industry average.But since Pacific Continental is a high growth stock, we must also account for its earnings growth by using calculation called PEG ratio.
 The PEG ratio (price/earnings to growth ratio) is a valuation metric used to assess the relative trade-off between the price of a stock, the earnings per share (EPS), and the company’s expected growth. Since P/E ratio is in general higher for a company with a higher growth rate, using just the P/E ratio would make high-growth companies appear overvalued relative to others. By dividing the P/E ratio by the earnings growth rate, the resulting ratio is considered to provide a more complete picture when comparing companies with different growth rates. 
 Pacific Continental’s PE ratio of 25.8x and estimated 39.1% growth in earnings next year give it a very low PEG ratio of 0.7x. This means that when accounting for its growth Pacific Continental’s stock can be viewed a very good value based on fundamental analysis.

NEW! Same Day ACH




Same Day ACH
Starting Friday, September 23, qualifying ACH credit transactions submitted before the Same Day ACH (SDA) deadline – 11:45 a.m. Pacific – may settle as same-day transactions. 
What does this mean for recipients?

Payments sent to you as Same Day ACH will be deposited into your account on that day. Financial institutions are required to receive SDA payments and deposit them to your account by the end of their business processing day.
If you are a business receiving an SDA payment, your records must reflect a receipt date that is no later than the settlement date for the originator’s payment in order to remain compliant with National Automated Clearing House Association rules.
Over the next 18 months, more transactions will start qualifying for SDA. We will continue to update you as these changes occur.

Please Note: If you are using Pacific Continental Bank to originate ACH transactions, we are not currently offering the ability to send Same Day ACH. However, we are working towards availability of that function in early 2017 and will make you aware when it is available. Click here to learn more.

ABOUT PACIFIC CONTINENTAL





Our History 
Our business was born when our original company, Pacific Cordage Corporation was established in Sto. Domingo, Legaspi City in the Bicol province. Pacific Cordage Corporation grew steadily over the next nine years and achieved a reputation as a supplier of high quality Manila rope products. The demand for our product grew to such a high point that in 1987, Pacific Continental Co., Inc. (PCCI)  was formed and a new factory was constructed in Las Piñas City, Metro Manila. Showing signs of good prosperity, PCCI acquired the complete set of rope machineries of TCG Rope from Davao City for additional efficiency measures. 
In 1993, Pacific Cordage Corporation ceased operations. Pacific Continental Co., Inc. moved the equipments originally installed in Pacific Cordage in order to meet the demands of its growing market. 
Today, our company operates 3 hard fiber preparation lines at Las Piñas, an 8,000 square meter building in 24,000 square meter of manufacturing space which is an annual installed capacity of over 10,000,000 pounds (4,800,000 kg) per year. We manufacture three-strand products ranging from 6mm (1/4 inch) to 48mm (2 inches) diameter and four strand products ranging from 14mm (7/16 inch) to 48mm (2 inches) diameter. 
Our customers' industries range from a variety of different establishments such as oil drilling companies, government military sectors, fishing, maritime, agriculture, mining, construction and industrial supply groups. 
We will continue our commitment to give our valued clients superior quality products and they can expect that every order will be shipped promptly and in excellent form. We are confident that Pacific Continental Company, Inc . will maintain its global reputation as an effective, efficient and reliable Manila rope manufacturer.

Pacific Continental Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 3.02% Yield (PCBK)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.
