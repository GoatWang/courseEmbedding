Synopses & ReviewsSynopsisThe fate of the newly independent nation is absorbing the attention of statesmen and scholars. This comprehensive study of Ceylon since its independence in 1947 provides a case study of the fundamental issues in these new Asian and African nations. Mr. Wriggins, who spent two years in Ceylon, presents the full historic, economic, political, and social background. He discusses the current political situation in Ceylon, the effect of universal franchise, the increasing communal disorders, the resulting dilemma of representative government, the search for an adequate foreign policy. His findings, which are based on extensive on-the-spot research, illuminate the crucial problem of political change.Originally published in 1960.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.
