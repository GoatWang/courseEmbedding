Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in common stocks, with at least 65% of the amount so invested being invested in common stocks of large capitalisation issuers that meet the Funds selection criteria. The Fund may invest the remainder of its common stock investments in companies that meet the Funds selection criteria but whose market capitalisation is considered to be middle sized or mid-cap. In current market conditions, the investment adviser initially intends to focus the Funds investments in the i) consumer discretionary and retail, ii) technology, iii) medical/health care and pharmaceutical and iv) financial institutions sectors. Substantially all of the common stocks in the Funds portfolio will be issued by U.S companies, although the Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in U.S dollar-denominated securities of foreign issuers. The Fund will also employ an option strategy of writing covered call options on a substantial portion of the common stocks in its portfolio. In addition, the Fund may to a lesser extent (not more than 20% of its total assets), pursue an option strategy that includes the writing of both put options and call options on certain common stocks in the Funds portfolio.

Madison Strategic Sector Premium Fund (MSP)


Fund Objective

MSP has a primary objective of obtaining a high level of current income and gains, with a secondary objective of achieving long-term capital appreciation. We believe these goals can be met by investing in large and mid-capitalizations stocks that are, in our opinion, selling at a reasonable price with respect to their long-term earnings growth rates. The income comes in the form option premiums which are generated by writing covered calls on a majority of stocks in the portfolio.



Investment Strategies

MSP will invest in stocks within certain economic sectors that, in our opinion, are the most attractive for our �Growth-at-a-Reasonable Price� style of investing. In current market conditions, it is our belief that these sectors provide opportunities for higher option premiums than call options on stocks in other sectors. MSP�s sector concentration has most often fallen in the following four areas:

Consumer Discretionary and Retail
Technology
Medical/Health and Pharmaceutical
Financial Institutions

Madison Strategic Sector Premium Fund (MSP)



Fund Objective

MSP has a primary objective of obtaining a high level of current income and gains, with a secondary objective of achieving long-term capital appreciation. We believe these goals can be met by investing in large and mid-capitalizations stocks that are, in our opinion, selling at a reasonable price with respect to their long-term earnings growth rates. The income comes in the form option premiums which are generated by writing covered calls on a majority of stocks in the portfolio.



Investment Strategies

MSP will invest in stocks within certain economic sectors that, in our opinion, are the most attractive for our �Growth-at-a-Reasonable Price� style of investing. In current market conditions, it is our belief that these sectors provide opportunities for higher option premiums than call options on stocks in other sectors. MSP�s sector concentration has most often fallen in the following four areas:

Consumer Discretionary and Retail
Technology
Medical/Health and Pharmaceutical
Financial Institutions
