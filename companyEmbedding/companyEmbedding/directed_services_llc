You should consider the investment objectives, risks and charges, and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options carefully before investing. The prospectuses for the variable annuity and underlying investment options contain this and other information. You may obtain free prospectuses by calling your financial professional or 800-366-0066. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing.
Variable annuities are issued by Voya Insurance and Annuity Company (Des Moines, IA) and distributed by Directed Services LLC. Both are members of the Voya® family of companies.
A variable annuity is a long-term investment designed for retirement planning. It is a contract between you and an insurance company, under which the insurer agrees to make periodic payments to you. Additionally, variable annuities offer the opportunity to allocate premiums among fixed and variable investment options that have the potential to grow income tax-deferred, until an income stream begins. These payments, called annuity income, will begin either immediately or at a future date and a part of which may be the return of your premium or principal. This income is guaranteed by the issuing insurance company for a specified period of time or for the life of the annuitant.
Variable annuities are subject to investment risk, are not guaranteed and will fluctuate in value. In addition, there is no guarantee that any variable investment option will meet its stated objective.
IRAs and other qualified plans already provide tax deferral like that provided by an annuity. Additional features and benefits such as contract guarantees, death benefits and the ability to receive a lifetime income are contained within the annuity for a cost. Please be sure the features and costs of the annuity are right for you when considering the purchase of the annuity. Neither the company nor its agents or representatives can provide tax, legal or accounting advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor about your specific circumstances. The contract does not directly participate in any stock or equity products.
All guarantees are based on the financial strength and claims paying ability of  Voya Insurance and Annuity Company, who is solely responsible for all obligations under its polices.   





1Withdrawals may be subject to Federal/State income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, an additional 10% Federal penalty tax.

Annuities are issued by Voya Insurance and Annuity Company (Des Moines, IA), member of the Voya® family of companies.
All withdrawals reduce the death benefit and may reduce the value of any optional benefits. Early withdrawals and other distributions of taxable amounts may be subject to ordinary income tax, a surrender charge, and if taken prior to age 59½, an IRS 10% premature distribution penalty tax unless an exception applies. Federal law requires that withdrawals be taken first from interest credited. A withdrawal includes any partial surrender. All distributions from qualified annuities may be taxable. State premium taxes may reduce the final value of your annuity.
IRAs and other qualified plans already provide tax deferral like that provided by an annuity. Additional features and benefits such as contract guarantees, death benefits and the ability to receive a lifetime income are contained within the annuity for a cost. Please be sure the features and costs of the annuity are right for you when considering the purchase of the annuity.
Neither the company nor its agents or representatives can provide tax, legal or accounting advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor about your specific circumstances.
The contract does not directly participate in any stock or equity products.   





1Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of Voya Insurance and Annuity Company (VIAC).
2Annuity income is defined as a series of periodic payments, a part of which may be return of your premium or principal, which is guaranteed by the issuing insurance company for a specified period of time or for the life of the annuitant.

Overview+



What is an annuity? 
An annuity is an insurance product that pays you periodic income payments in exchange for your premium payment. It can be used as part of your overall retirement strategy. Depending on the type of annuity, it may help you grow your retirement savings, protect your savings from loss, and offer death benefits to protect your beneficiaries. 




How to choose an annuity
Make your choice based on how your needs match up to the features of the annuity. Do you need to grow your retirement savings or are you concerned with losing principal? Or both? Do you need income that starts now or in the future? Do you want to leave a legacy to your heirs? These are some of the questions to ask yourself to determine which annuity might work for you. 




Why Voya?
Voya Financial is ready to help Americans build a secure financial future—one person, one family, one institution at a time. We are ready to make a difference—to deliver financial solutions to help all Americans become retirement ready.
