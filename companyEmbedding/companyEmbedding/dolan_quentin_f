Dolan Media Buys Acollaid Product Line from Acxiom 

Read preview




Article excerpt

MINNEAPOLIS (JR) -- Dolan Media Co. on Thursday said it has
acquired the Acollaid product line from Acxiom Corp.
Acollaid -- a contraction of the term ACOLLection AID -- serves
the credit management and collection industry by screening credit
accounts through highly specialized databases, resulting in more
accurate files and better collections results for lenders, creditors
and credit managers. 
The transaction was announced by James P. Dolan, president and
CEO of Minneapolis-based Dolan Media, which owns The Journal Record.
Purchase price and terms were not disclosed.
Acollaid is based in Phoenix. Dolan said all the unit's employees
would be retained.
Acollaid will become part of Dolan Media's National Group under
Group President Brian Long. 
The group includes business lines serving the financial and
credit management industries, including Banko, a bankruptcy
database; Probate Finder, the first national database of probate
information; and Identity Guardian, launched earlier this year to
curb identity theft.
The group also includes Oklahoma City-based Hogan Information
Services Co., the nation's largest gatherer of public records.
"Our group works hard to help the credit management industry
reduce losses, increase collection performance and make smarter,
faster marketing decisions," Long said. "Acollaid is an important
addition to our mix of services. ‚Ä¶

                                                         - I&#39;ve never been one to publicize my training progress.  I&#39;ve always felt I have had some nagging injury and progress would suddenly pick up rapidly if I were injury free.  As if the years training with any pain were inevitably less fruitful.  It took me 5 or so years to realize that no lifter and or athlete trains in a perfect state of health and wether you have a nagging shoulder or hip injury it is your job to best educate yourself regarding ways to train and minimize if not eliminate those injuries.  To be pain free in the gym or in sport is a great goal, but it&#39;s elusiveness should not stop you from giving your all in every workout.  Here is a year of progress despite a year of working around a host of shoulder issues.  Here&#39;s to chasing the most pain free year of training - 2017.
