Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Firmoo Answers







Why do I have blurry vision after reading?

I think you may have read for a long time. Normally, people are suggested to have a break when reading to avoid eye strain, eye dry and blurring. If it happens frequently, you can buy some eye drops for eye blurring and drip some drops when you feel blurred.



Can i wear false eyelashes with contacts?

Of course you can. When it comes to colored contact lenses, I must enhance that you'd better chose the pair that is fit for your face shape and face skin. Because different colored contacts lenses have different function. Some can make your eyes bigger than before, while others may make your eyes brighter than ever. But you must be careful during wearing false eyelashes, You cannot make them into eyes, or they will cause eye infection which is harmful to your eye health.



What are some hip glasses for women over 40s?

oversized eyeglasses are very popular with women over 40. Although there are some other types of glasses preferred my many women, oversized glasses are still popular today not only because these glasses create a unique look to wearers but they can cover the eye and surrounding part of the face. Women who are over 40 will look more fashionable with these big frame glasses. But if you have a smaller face, oversized glasses may not be suitable for you.



Are reading glasses good for your eyes?

reading glasses are worn by millions of wearers for their great function, fun and fashion. To be more specifically, reading glasses are awfully essential to people in their 50s or older ones. reading glasses are their second windows of the soul, enabling them more easily focus on nearby objects. Besides, reading glasses are also good for the eye. That is to say, wearing reading glasses can help stop far-sighted eyes getting worse and worse but instead enable you keep healthy eyes. And reading glasses are all the same not bad means of ensuring wearere an energetic and youthful life style.



What should I do if my eyes get hurt by my nail?

Oh, i am sorry to heard it. Do you still feel pain right now. If so, apply cold compress to help you reduce pain. Then, check your eyes with mirror if it is badly hurt. Check if the nail cause scratches on the surface of the eyes. If it does, you'd better consult an eye doctor what can you do right now to help the eyes. If not, it is a good news that your eyes may not got serious damages by nail. Good luck.   



Can I use Systane when I am wearing soft contacts lenses?

Does milk help burning eyes?

Well, yes, milk can be helpful to treat burning eyes. Generally speaking, milk is used in many ways, but we can also use it to protect our eyes, especially when someone suffers burning eyes.

Also, you can have some cold compresses, and put some cool ice or cool cucumbers on your eyes. In that way, it can relieve your symptom and make you feel well. Also, you should eat a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables which provide lots of antioxidants, especially vitamins A and C and then do a good job to your symptom. Anyway, just have a try.
