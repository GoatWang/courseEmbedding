Apocrypha Books






                                            Also known as Deutercanonical Books, these texts are books included as part of the Septuagint (the Greek version of the Old Testament), but not included in the Hebrew Bible. The Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches include all of the apocrypha (except for the books of Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh), but refer to them as "deuterocanonical" books. These same books, books of Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh, are referred to by Protestants as the "pseudoepigrapha."

Whether you are just beginning to read Scripture or have been studying the Bible daily, commentaries offer greater understanding with background information on authorship, history, setting, and theme of the Gospel. Verse by verse exposition of the New and Old Testament can be found in commentary written by some of the greatest Christian church leaders including John Calvin, Matthew Henry, Charles Spurgeon, and C.I.

Concordances






                                            A Bible concordance is an alphabetical listings of words and phrases found in the Holy Bible and shows where the terms occur throughout all books of Scripture. With cross-references for verses, concordances make it easy to understand the meaning of terms and the context in which those words are used. Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance is the most widely known and popular and includes Greek and Hebrew dictionaries for a better understanding of the original meaning. Additional concordances such as Naves Topical and Torreys Topical are valuable Bible study resources.
                                        







Dictionaries






                                            Bible dictionaries are one of the most practical and useful theological reference books available. The combination of definitions and proper names for Biblical words with online verse reference, allows users to define and analyze Scripture. Discover the meaning of words and study them in context to the theological concepts of that specific verse or passage. Many word searches also include the original Greek and Hebrew word with meaning. Popular dictionaries of the Bible include Baker’s Evangelical, Easton’s, and Smiths – named after their well-known theological authors.
                                        







Encyclopedias






                                            Bible encyclopedias contain articles and definitions to thousands of words and terms used in Scripture. Entries include full historical references such as date, religious environment, family life, customs, language, and literature. All encyclopedia terms are cross-referenced and linked to the verses where they are found to help understand the full meaning of the word in context to its use in specific verses of the Bible. These online articles, provided by well-known and respected Christian leaders, have been written to help those seeking a greater knowledge of Biblical characters, events and places.
                                        







History






                                            Study Bible history online with popular books, texts, and writings on the beginning of the early church. Information found in these resources includes chronological timelines, Biblical facts, and overviews of history of both BC (Before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini).

Lexicons






                                            Bible lexicons provide definitions and meaning of Biblical words found in the original New Testament Greek and Old Testament Hebrew languages of the Holy Bible.

Classics






                                            Today's Christians follow centuries of thoughtful Christians before them who wrestled with difficult points of theology, penned bestselling allegories, or simply encouraged others with honest accounts of their spiritual journey. This collection of classic Christian works includes cherished favorites like John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and landmark Christian works like St. Augustine's Confessions and Thomas a Kempis's The Imitation of Christ. It also includes more recent classics from theologians like B.B. Warfield and Christian writers like G.K. Chesterton.

Description


Product Details




                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.
The Memorial Candle Program has been designed to help offset the costs associated with hosting this Tribute 
Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of John Gill can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month


Candle will be lit for the limited time of one year


Candle will be lit indefinitely

Candle message preserved on the memorial site for perpetuity

John Gill Books




John Gill (1697–1771) was born in Kettering, Northamptonshire. He became a Baptist clergyman, a biblical scholar, and a staunch Calvinist. Gill was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Aberdeen in 1748. Gill pastored at Benjamin Keach’s former church, New Park Street Chapel. Later, he pastored what would become Charles Spurgeon’s Metropolitan Tabernacle for 51 years.
Gill is the first major Baptist theologian writer. His stance on Calvinism is somewhat a matter of debate. Some say Gill would not describe himself as hyper-Calvinist, while others contend that he indeed was.
Some of Gill’s most important academic works are The Doctrine of the Trinity Stated and Vindicated, The Cause of God and Truth, and A Body of Doctrinal Divinity, all of which appear in The Works of John Gill (19 vols.).

Overview

John Gill was one of the most influential Baptist thinkers and pastors of his day, and all of his writings are contained in this massive 19 volume collection. Known for his expository works on all of Scripture and for compiling a practical book of theology for his congregation, he is most famous for his passionate defense of Calvinism and the sovereignty of God in all situations. In Sermons and Tracts, vol. 3, Gill includes his famous essays, The Doctrine of the Trinity Stated and Vindicated and A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language, Letters, Vowel-Points, and Accents.
Gill’s writings helped to define and encourage Reformed Baptist thinking in the 18th century. Considered to be the first major Baptist scholar, Gill continues to shape modern Calvinism. Although modern scholars debate about Gill’s role as the father of Baptist hyper-Calvinism, it cannot be denied that at the very least, he was a forerunner to that tradition. During his lifetime, Gill and his church backed the preaching and ministry of George Whitefield. His work represents not only essential eighteenth-century biblical scholarship, but a turning point in Reformed theology.
Gill’s commentaries are still widely used today by laity and pastors, being theologically sound and practical for daily study. Gill makes the Scripture accessible and applicable to the everyday reader, believing that sound doctrine impacts daily life. Containing over 12,000 pages, The Works of John Gill is an essential resource for any student of the Scriptures and of Reformed thinking. Perfect for the general reader, professors, and Bible scholars, these 19 volumes will enlighten, encourage, and stimulate thinking and application. Gill’s writings include everything from exposition, commentary, essays, and a biography to help aid understanding of this prominent man of faith and his works. The Logos edition makes study easy by linking with every Scripture reference to the Bibles in your library.

Praise for the Print Edition

His doctrinal and practical writings will live, and be admired, and be a standing blessing to posterity, when their opposers are forgotten, or only remembered by the refutations he has given them. While true religion and sound learning have a single friend remaining [. . .], the works and name of Gill will be precious and revered.
—Augustus M. Toplady
For good, sound, massive, sober sense in commenting, who can excel Gill?
—Charles Spurgeon
Taking its place among the truly famous theologies of this period, it deserves a niche in all representative collections of systems of theology. His mastery of ancient language and ancient writings, as well as of the Scriptures, is reflected not only in his theology but in his expositions.
—Professor John F. Walvoord, Dallas Theological Seminary

He addresses reprobation, election, redemption, grace, predestination, and original sin.

Author: John Gill
Publisher: Thomas Turnbull
Publication Date: 1805
Pages: 354

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In this classic work, Gill discusses the Song of Solomon, arguing for a spiritual reading of the book with the Bride as the Bride of Christ and Christ as the Bridegroom. He sees this book as the story of Christ’s love for his Church, and though Gill brings up alternative interpretations, he ultimately seeks to defend the authority and validity of the spiritual reading. He examines each verse of the book, cross-referencing with other Scriptures. This clear and concise volume remains valuable for understanding and interpreting this poetic book of the Old Testament.

Author: John Rippon
Publisher: John Bennett
Publication Date: 1838
Pages: 177

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




John Gill was an inspiration to his congregation and his fellow clergyman, and John Rippon presents a compelling biography of this influential preacher and theologian. He gives an account of Gill’s life as well as a summary of his considerable writings. Rippon also includes the elegy delivered at Gill’s funeral by Benjamin Francis.


John Rippon was born in 1751 in England. He was an English Baptist clergyman and when Gill died in 1771, Rippon took over his church. He is most famous for publishing a hymnal entitled A Selection of Hymns from the Best Authors. He died in 1836.







A Discourse of the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion

Author: Anthony Collins
Publisher: W. Winterbotham
Publication Date: 1724
Pages: 360

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Deist thinker Anthony Collins’ treatise on reason and free-thinking caused a theological and philosophical commotion when it was first published in 1724. Promoting reason as a valid way to determine truth, Collins criticizes all churches for not legitimatizing critical thinking. John Gill wrote The Prophecies of the Old Testament in response to Collin’s arguments. This edition features the 1724 printing.


 
Anthony Collins was born in 1676 in England. He was a Deist philosopher and died in 1729.

Publisher: F. C. and J. Rivington
Publication Date: 1816
Pages: 470

In 1710, clergyman Daniel Whitby published this treatise defending the principles of Arminianism. It elicited a response from John Gill, his The Cause of God and Truth, as well as from Jonathan Edwards, with Freedom of the Will.


Daniel Whitby was born in 1638 and became an Arminian minister and theologian. Famous for his defense of Arminianism, Whitby was one of the first theologians and pastors to promote postmillennialism. He died in 1726.

About John Gill

John Gill was born in 1697 in England. A Baptist clergyman, Gill was also a biblical scholar, learning Latin and Greek by age 11. He was also a fervent Reformed thinker, holding to the Five Points of Calvinism. Gill is considered by many to be the father of hyper-Calvinism. He was a preacher at the Strict Baptist Church for fifty–one years, which later became the Metropolitan Tabernacle, pastorate of Charles Spurgeon. Because of his considerable scholarship, Gill was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Aberdeen in 1748. He is most known for being the author of definitive academic works, including, The Doctrine of the Trinity Stated and Vindicated, The Cause of God and Truth, and A Body of Doctrinal Divinity, all of which are included in this collection. Gill died in 1771.

Product Description

Exposition of the Old & New Testaments, in which the Sense of the Sacred Text is given, Doctrinal and Practical Truths are set in a plain and easy light. Complete and Unabridged.
Endorsements  The Philadelphia Baptist Association, in its official minutes of October 1807 recommended, "that each member church of the Association subscribe for a copy of Dr. Gill's incomparable Exposition of the Old and New Testaments for the use of their ministers, and urge all sister associations to aid in the accomplishment of this desirable object."
The Baptist historian David Benedict noted that the Charleston Baptist Association "recommended to the churches and the public to encourage, by subscription, the undertaking . . . to republish Dr. Gill's Exposition and each church was advised to provide a copy for the use of its minister."
