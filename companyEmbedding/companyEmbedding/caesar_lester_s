Lester S Caesar's Experience
Title: Controller
               Company: The Mitchell Gold Co
Job Details
               Originally incorporated in 1980 as Triad Energy Corporation, the Company changed its name to Global Gold Corporation in 1995, and has been headquartered in Rye, New York since 2011. Global Gold is engaged in the exploration, development, and mining of gold and other minerals primarily in Armenia and Chile. Over the years, Global Gold has been involved in projects in several other countries as well and regularly assesses new opportunities that fit our profile. Global Gold operates through its subsidiaries Global Gold Mining LLC in Armenia. In the mid 1990's, Global Gold began operating in Armenia through a joint venture with the government by developing the Zod and Mehgradzor deposits along with the reprocessing of tailings at the Ararat plant southeast of the capital city, Yerevan. These projects were subsequently acquired through an earn for stock, cash and other consideration. Currently in Armenia, the company's focus is on the exploration, development and production of gold at the Toukhmanuk property in the North Armenian Belt and the Marjan and an expanded Marjan North property in southwest Armenia. In addition, the Company is exploring and developing other sides in Armenia, including the Getik property. The Company also holds royalty and participation rights in other location in the country through affiliates and subsidiaries. The Global Gold Mining headquarters are located in the capital, Yerevan. Global Gold has been involved in exploration and development in Chile since 2001, when we acquired the Santa Candelaria copper/gold property in Chanaral District III in Chile and then the Valdiria Property in southern Chile which we sold in 2011. Our Vice President maintains an office in Santiago. While Global Gold invested in Canadian uranium and mineral properties in 2007, we are no longer engaging in uranium exploration and divested our interests in the uranium properties. Global Gold holds a royalty interest on sales of uranium products from Cochrane Pond Property in Newfoundland.
