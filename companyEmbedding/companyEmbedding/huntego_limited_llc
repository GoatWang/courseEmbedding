Talking With The Man Behind HECS
Posted by Desert Rat


I’d really like to thank Mike Slinkard, the President of HECS Stealthscreen for taking the time to answer a bunch of my questions about HECS! ~DesertRat

1. I was pleased to see real scientific research backing up your product. Is one of your biggest challenges overcoming hunters who have been burned on fads, gadgets and “snake oil”?
In the beginning that was a huge problem. We had a solution to a problem most hunters never recognized they had. While all hunters have seen the effects of animals pickling up on their emitted EM fields not many realized what they were seeing. Like any truly new innovation we were seen by many as the next great gimmick back when we launched HECS.  Fortunately we found a few thousand open minded hunters who gave HECS a try and saw the difference right away. It took a couple of years but now HECS is accepted as a valuable tool to help keep people more concealed from most types of animals. To this day we almost never have a customer who used HECS as directed who has given a negative report. In 2016 we sold well over 30,000 suits and had a total of 2 negative reports from customers in the field. Our ace in the hole has always been that the technology truly works and that knowledge was what kept us going in those early days.
2. What was the biggest challenge developing this product and getting it to market?
Once we asked ourselves the question of why animals act the way they do when they get in close even when all conditions are right, and further developed the (then) theory of electromagnetic fields being involved, the greatest challenge was determining the correct grid size and conductivity necessary to attenuate those specific wavelengths of energy. Fortunately we had meters that could measure the fields emitted by humans and some great experts to help us develop the original HECS technology that is the basis for our 5 issued US patents. Once we were able to effectively attenuate these fields we were then able to prove the concept and the rest as they say is history.
3. Will this technology continue to evolve or is it cut and dried?
HECS technology is constantly evolving as we learn more and more about how it effects the users in different environments and for different purposes.  For instance once we developed HECS for land based use it became apparent that the technology would also be useful under water.  The challenge was that our grid had to be more conductive than the medium around it to be effective. To overcome this we had to change the grid size and up the conductivity of the grid significantly but we were eventually able to get the same effect under water as we had seen topside. More recently we have begun providing HECS technology to US special forces and police departments who need added concealment when in harm’s way. We have begun development of specific fits and features on our tactical products to work best in these situations. There is just so many different purposes for HECS technology that I doubt we will reach them all anytime soon.
4. How will you diversify from here? Different patterns? Different products? Different markets?
We have already begun bringing HECS technology into several different markets. HECS hunting (HECS LLC) and HECS Aquatic LLC are both going strong and bringing the HECS advantage to hunters and divers all over the world. Recently we launched HECS Tactical LLC in response to demand from military operators who had tested and approved HECS technology as an advantage in that realm. We chose AARDVARK Tactical of Laverne California to be the exclusive distributor of HECS technology to military and police units across the country. Coming soon will be HECS wildlife LLC which we are very excited about. HECS wildlife will be headed up by well-known wildlife biologist Forrest Galante who is a well-respected scientist and also a familiar face on Animal planet, Nat Geo wild and discovery channel. HECS wildlife will be focused on anyone who wants to have closer, safer and more enjoyable interaction with wildlife. We think this may well be the biggest division of HECS over time.  With every division we are striving to bring the best quality products with features that our customers will appreciate on top of the advantage HECS technology affords. 

5. Your basic setup includes pants, shirt and headwear. Is effectiveness proportional to how completely you suit up in the HECS gear?
Yes the more you cover the more effective HECS is. This is especially true with birds like turkeys and waterfowl. Birds are proven to see electrical fields visually and as such it is these fields that birds can use to tell a living being (and movement from living beings) from inanimate objects and motions. With birds it is essential that everything is covered in HECS for good results. With animal species the smaller muscle regions like the hands and feet are somewhat less critical than with birds but still the more you cover the better the result. The thing to remember with animals is that with the exception of the heart (which produces large amounts of electrical energy proportionate to is size) the intensity if the field is directly proportionate to the size of the muscle  being flexed. So shirt and pants are most important followed by head and neck and those smaller muscles like hands and feet being somewhat less critical (but still highly recommended).
6. What are you most proud of, regarding your product/company?
I am most proud of our team here at HECS. We have been blessed with a very capable and highly intelligent group of men and women who have faced the challenges of developing  and introducing an innovative but relatively unknown product/concept to market in the face of initial skepticism. Our team has not only taken on these challenges with fervor and optimism , but has succeeded beyond my greatest expectations. We all knew we had something significant and a technology that could really help people to have better, safer, and more enjoyable interactions with animals birds and fish but it took a very special group of professionals to bring it to fruition.
7. If You had an opportunity to talk with my readers who had never heard of your product, what would you want them to know?
We realize many hunters have yet to be introduced to HECS technology and many are not aware the true effects that the EM energy output of our bodies can have in their success in the woods. I would urge them to go to our website at www.hecsllc.com and watch the videos and learn more about the difference HECS can make in their own adventures. In a nutshell HECS simply makes you appear more like an inanimate object and helps you get closer and stay close longer than ever before. 
8. You’re a hunter – whats the dream hunt on your bucket list?
I have been extremely blessed to have been able to bowhunt all over the world and have taken some awesome trophies. I have hunted in the majority of US states as well as New Zealand, Africa 3 times Canada and Mexico. I guess the one big dram animals I haven’t yet hunted would be the big brown bears of Alaska. There is just something about those giants and the danger involved with bowhunting them that has always intrigued me. Someday I will scratch that one off the list.

I’d really like to thank Mike again for taking time out to answer a few questions. What a cool product! You can watch some videos about the technology, and some real encounters in the field here: HECS Videos.

SPOT SATELLITE DEVICE REACHES MAJOR MILESTONE WITH 5000 RESCUES WORLDWIDE
Posted by Desert Rat


Covington, LA (April 19, 2017) – SPOT, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Globalstar, Inc. (NYSE: GSAT) and a leader in satellite messaging and emergency notification technologies, announced today that its SPOT family of products has surpassed a milestone of initiating 5,000 rescues around the world since its launch in 2007. These rescues have taken place on six continents and in over 89 countries.  
Recent rescue Connor Gallagher was solo hiking in Colorado at an elevation of 11,000’ and activated the S.O.S. button on his SPOT Gen3 device when he began to see the early signs of hypothermia.
“Without the SPOT Gen3, I’m not sure if I would be here today and I am extremely thankful for the West Elk Mountain Rescue team that helped me,” said Connor Gallagher. “I highly recommend SPOT to anyone who is planning to head out on a long trail. I am forever thankful for the little orange block that saved my life.”
Other rescues include a lone worker who pressed his S.O.S. after suffering from a seizure while on a logging job site; a man who was transported to a hospital via helicopter after a skiing accident in Switzerland; and a woman who was in a snowmobile accident in Canada and was airlifted after suffering severe injuries. 
“For nearly a decade, we have dedicated ourselves to offering affordable, lifesaving technology that people can rely on,” said Jay Monroe, Chief Executive Officer of Globalstar. “We are proud that SPOT has been universally accepted as the leader in satellite messaging and that we have been able to provide peace of mind to families, co-workers and loved ones worldwide. This 5000 rescue milestone is a result of the hard work put in by the entire team at Globalstar, our partners at GEOS and the Search and Rescue community.”
SPOT products work virtually everywhere in the world offering peace of mind through satellite-based connectivity to hundreds of thousands of people including hunters, hikers, fishermen, snowmobilers, motorcyclist and many others who enjoy the outdoors and travelling off-the-grid. SPOT users have the ability to track assets, use location-based messaging and get help when beyond cellular coverage. 
“We are happy to be a part of such a large number of rescues and to continue to provide such an important service for owners of SPOT devices as well as their family and friends,” commented Mark Garver, CEO of GEOS Safety and Response. “People should be able to focus on their travels and adventures when off the grid. Our 24/7 emergency response center and certified team at the International Emergency Response Coordination Center (IERCC) ensures that should an emergency occur, we’ll get you out quickly and safely.”
SPOT customers are currently initiating nearly two rescues a day. SPOT excludes test messages, false alarms, lost or stolen units and duplicate messages from rescue count. 
SPOT Gen3® gives you a critical, life-saving line of communication when you travel beyond the boundaries of cell service. The latest generation of award-winning SPOT devices, SPOT GEN3 lets family and friends know you’re okay, or if the worst should happen, sends emergency responders your GPS location – all with the push of a button.

CleanShot Bore Cleaning Device – An Interview With Curt From Huntego
Posted by Desert Rat


A big shout out to Curt Whitworth for taking some time to talk to me about Huntego and their products. These innovative products are sure to make a splash in the industry. ~DesertRat

From the Release:
CleanShot Fires Off:  First-Ever “Shoot Through” Bore Cleaning Device Unveiled
Huntego Limited’s newest innovation to be the first product ever launched on Firefunder.com –
the shooting industry’s crowdfunding platform
www.huntegoltd.com
(Northville, Michigan) – It’s a double barreled shot of unprecedent ed breakthroughs for the gun industry. Huntego Limited is launching CleanShot, the industry’s first of its kind shoot-through bore cleaning cartridges. CleanShot is fast, efficient, convenient and compared to traditional field cleaning methods, more affordable. 
CleanShot is a patented high-velocity bore cleaning device that uses approximately 9,600 psi of outward pressure to power scrub, trap particles and wipe the bore clean. Simply load a CleanShot round in the chamber like any other cartridge, safely fire and your gun is field-cleaned in an instant. Designed to be used in the field or at a range, CleanShot allows shooters to maintain their firearms with minimal cleaning equipment, effort and mess.  
The first product in the Huntego Limited line is now available at Firefunder.com:
https://firefunder.com/campaigns/huntego-limited–cleanshot#/about
Huntego Limited is launching the 12-gauge model now and intends to release 20, 28 and 410 gauges i n the year ahead. They are also actively working on the 9MM handgun and military grade applications such as the 5.56 model. 
The 12-gauge CleanShot uses a standard shotgun hull and is manufactured using the same process and standards as ammunition currently manufactured by the OEM brands today.
The product can be used by a wide range of shooting consumers including:
recreational and target shooters, hunters, law enforcement, military, government agencies and more.
CleanShot sells for $2.50 on FireFunder.com

Talking with Curt:
1) How on earth did you think of this?
You know – the old story that it just came to me… sorta. Was at the SHOT Show with a client and happen to see something, then another and another. For me 2+2=4 that day – it made perfect sense. I was really into “if I had an idea, I would write it down” on a small pad that I always carried at the time. Drew a few pictures, made some notes – by the flight home I was on page 6 of a business plan. Spent a lot of time looking online, then Patent Office – next thing you know it just took over. I knew that it solves a number of issues, would be easy to use and be cost effective. That was about 5 years ago.
2) What prompted you to develop the concept and go to market?
I am a firm believer in disruptive invention. Something that may be unconventional or “outside the box” to an industry that has done something the same way for hundreds of years – to me is exhilarating and/or addicting. I didn’t live inside that industry’s box – and wasn’t restrained to 4 walls, I just went in and figured it out. Once I got into something that I felt would work, I was completely hooked. So mornings, evenings and weekends were consumed with shotshells, wads, CAD, books and patent research. Its the thrill of the chase. Fast forward to today – we have made investments in large capacity molds for 12 gauge and production is in full scale production for an April 17 delivery.
3) What next for  your company? Will this technology work on rifled barrels?
To complete the shotgun market, we have development scheduled for 12, 20, 28 and 410 lines for production. We have 9MM prototype materials in hand and are excited to move into more handgun gauges such as 7MM and 40cal in 2017. We also have .223 CAD concepts moving forward with possible release dates in 2018… and a few more innovative bore cleaning solutions up our sleeves… cant give it all away.
Rifled barrels. We have found the CleanShot® to be a very effective field cleaning device for rifled barrels. We have tested on a number of shotgun brands with consistent results.
4) Does this product eliminate traditional bore cleaning or supplement it?
CleanShot® is a shoot-through field cleaning device. After a day at the range, clays, in the field dogging birds/waterfowl or just plinking targets – simply load a CleanShot and safely fire. The device is designed to scrub, trap particles and wipe the bore clean. Huntego Limited is an absolute advocate of scheduled bench cleaning when you have the time, energy and funds to do so.
5) What has been the most surprising challenge in getting the product to market?
Oh, that’s loaded question. Its been a really long, educational, eye-opening process – on so many fronts – as it should be, we are talking ammunition products. 
6) For readers who have never heard of your company, what would you want to tell them?
Watch this space. Huntego Limited has a number of new product innovations to release… changing the game forever. We are extremely excited to enter the industry with a product like CleanShot and the possibilities that lie ahead.

Thanks again to curt for taking the time to talk with me. Can’s wait to see the progress! ~DesertRat

Talking to the Folks From Swagger Bipods
Posted by Desert Rat


A big shout out to Josh Kinser, the Marketing Director from Performance Plus Outdoors for taking some time to talk to me about Swagger Bipods.

1) What prompted you to go into bipods? 
When our team first saw this idea and design – the versatility was unmatched by anything in the market. We had never seen something that could adapt to adverse situations in the field. We saw the opportunity to help hunters in a way that current bipods and shooting sticks currently cannot.
2) What makes your design different? 
Everything – flexibility, maneuverability, change from flexible to rigid with a click, no “bipod hop”, the ability to adapt to the situation in the field as it happens and much more accessibility to a solid rest to complete the mission or fill the tag.
3) What has been the biggest challenge you’ve faced, getting these to market?
We make a lot of this bipod in the United States but that is a huge challenge because we get compared to products manufactured in China in both quality and price. We are labeled as a “conventional bipod” and everybody thinks, “Oh, this is just a bipod or a cheap shooting stick.” We are a much higher end and versatile product than what most consumers are used to seeing.
4) For someone not familiar with your company, what would you want them to know?
Swagger Bipods is owned by Performance Plus Outdoors which also owns Big & J Long Range Attractants and The Given Right, a show hosted by Kenneth Lancaster and airing on the Pursuit Channel.
5) Whats next for Swagger?
Swagger is going to continue to be a leader of innovative products for the shooter and hunter. We are going to continue to bring more and more products and are currently working on prototypes for 2018.
6) Whats your favorite thing to hunt?
My favorite is whitetail hands down. I love hunting them in different environments and especially love to rattle down here in Texas. Outside of that I love the mountains – I’ve been on a couple of New Zealand tahr hunts, spike camping. I would do that every year if I could.
7) What’s the big dream hunt on your bucket list? 
I can’t go with just one. For my mountain hunts, I really want to go after a Mid-Asian Ibex and a Dagestan Tur. For deer, high on my list is getting a coues deer in the Arizona mountains and hunting blacktails on Kodiak Island.

From their website: “Revolutionary Crazy Legs Technology gives you shooting agility and flexibility like never before, which will dramatically expand your shooting zone. Swagger replaces ordinary “stiff ” bipods and shooting sticks that have to be held to stabilize, must be carried, and are heavy, noisy and limited in how they allow you to shoot. Swagger is the all-terrain bipod and can do anything the others can do, and a whole lot more!
With Swagger, you can raise up, lower down, slide left , inch right, move forward, lean back, twist or contort as the shot calls for. All thanks to flexible, hyper-extending Crazy Legs. You can shoot prone, sitting or standing without the need to hold or stabilize. And, Swagger retracts into the chassis for easy, quiet transport.
Swagger’s legs retract into the chassis, where they are concealed and protected.
And when you sling your firearm over your shoulder, Swagger won’t dig into it like other bipods can!”

A Review – “Buck, Buck, Moose” by Hank Shaw
Posted by Desert Rat


I wanted to thank Kathi Johnson and Hank Shaw for getting me a copy of “Buck, Buck, Moose” to review. ~Desert Rat

From  the Press Release:
Noted cookbook author and James Beard award-winning writer Hank Shaw has just released his third cookbook:  Buck, Buck, Moose: Recipes and Techniques for Cooking Deer, Elk, Moose, Antelope and Other Antlered Things (H&H Books 2016). 
More than a cookbook, Buck, Buck, Moose is the first and only comprehensive guide to working with and cooking all forms of venison – and it’s available just in time for hunting season and the holidays. In addition to more than 100 recipes, the book includes:
−	Stories of the hunt and essays on why venison holds such a special place in society
−	Instructions for butchering, aging and storing your venison and how to handle all parts of the carcass (including the odd bits)
−	Extensive section on curing venison and how to make sausages, dry-cured salami and jerky
−	And… venison beer and wine pairings
Shaw takes the cook/reader around the world from nose to tail, with recipes from six continents for every part of the animal. From the simple – Country Fried Venison, to the classic – Steak Diane, to the unexpected – Venison Tripe Neapolitan. 
Released in September, this essential guide already has sold more than 10,000 copies and has received nearly 100 percent “5 star reviews” (179) on AMAZON.
About Hank Shaw: A former restaurant cook and journalist, Shaw is the author of three cookbooks: Hunt, Gather, Cook (Rodale 2011), Duck, Duck, Goose (Ten Speed 2013), and Buck, Buck, Moose (H&H Books 2016), as well as the James Beard Award-winning website Hunter Angler Gardener Cook (honest-food.net). He has been featured in numerous major media outlets ranging from the New York Times to NPR and Field & Stream, as well as on numerous television shows, including Travel Channel’s Bizarre Foods and CNN’s Somebody’s Gotta Do It with Mike Rowe. His writings have appeared in Food & Wine, Organic Gardening, Garden & Gun, Petersen’s Hunting, The Art of Eating, among others. 
So first off – to call this book a “Cook Book” is to do it a huge disservice; this is a coffee table book that happens to be full of amazing wild game recipes. It’s a manual on how to care for you game in the field. It is a primer on food safety. It’s part technical guide, part personal musings and partly a conversation with your butcher about what cuts work best for what.
The photography is amazing; the recipes are exotic and homey and comforting and zesty. At the time of the review I had an elk roast left in the freezer. I’m usually not too big on roasts, so I thought this would make for a good test case. I picked the Italian Pot Roast recipe.
As might be expected, this recipe is a “red-winey, tomatoe-y, oregano/thyme and rosemary-y” pot of goodness. The roast came out tender and nicely flavored with lots of accompanying sauce to drizzle over the meat.

The recipes in this book are amazing; literally a trip around the world. These recipes account for different cuts of meat and different types of game. From South African Bobotie to Massaman Curry to Icelandic Venison with Blueberry Sauce there is something for every taste. The book is smartly divided into sections of cuts – roasts, loins, primal cuts, stews, ribs, meatballs, etc. If you’re one that likes the “wobbly bits” as Hank calls them – heart, liver, kidneys, etc. – there is a whole section dedicated to those recipes. My favorite section is the section on sausage. I can’t wait to try all of those recipes!
My only concern with the book was that these recipes could be intimidating for the novice hunter-chef. Rest assured, these recipes are well-explained and easy to follow. Anyone with the most basic level of skill in the kitchen will now have the ability to table some amazing fare – well beyond grilled steaks or spaghetti sauce that had become the staples for many of us. Even better – if you have someone in your circle of friends or family that turns up their nose at wild game – I guarantee you’ll find a cure for that somewhere in this book. There are some amazing recipes in here and Hank does a great job coaching the cook through the why and the how as well.
If you like to hunt moose, deer, caribou or antelope – this may well be the last book you’ll ever need to buy. From the time the creature hits the ground, until it lands on your table – Hank has you covered. The book is well-organized with fantastic photography, clear instructions and lots of narrative which provides a ton of info besides the actual recipe.
I would absolutely, 100% recommend this book. Right now, you can buy it on Amazon for less than 25 bucks. It will be the best 25 bucks you’ll ever spend – especially when it comes to putting game on the table.

A Review – Rugged Maps
Posted by Desert Rat


I’d like to thank the folks over at Rugged Maps for sending me one of their maps to review.

They were kind enough to send me one in time for my Mule Deer Hunt in Unit 22 here in Arizona. I hunt 22 quite a bit, so this is a great map to review.
The first thing you notice about the map is the material.These maps are printed on a tarp-like material that appears to be almost indestructible. I can tell you with confidence that you won’t poke a hole in it, or tear it by accident. I was able to write on the maps with a ballpoint pen, pencil was a bit harder. I couldn’t find any of my Omnichrome or grease pencils to try on the map but I bet they would work fine.

I suppose you might be able to cut it with a blade or drive a screwdriver through it, but I guarantee that you would be hard-pressed to damage it through routine use.
Rugged maps prints maps of Game Management Units, Nautical Charts, Topo maps, NOAA maps, USGS 7.5 minute maps, RM Lite Quads/Hiking maps and even custom maps.
You’d think that they might lose some detail in printing on material like this, but the detail was great! Colors didn’t bleed, terrain was clear, lettering crisp. Everything was clear and identifiable.

The map I tested runs about 30 bucks and I think it is well worth it, particularly if you hunt certain units extensively. You’re not going to wear it out, you’re not going to damage it. The map is easy to refold/roll up and it comes with a carrying pouch.
I’d definitely recommend these maps!

Review – When Bears Attack
Posted by Desert Rat


A big shout out to Jake Klein from Skyhorse Publishing for sending me a copy of “When Bears Attack – Close Encounters of the Terrifying Kind” for review.

Nearly every outdoor enthusiast has an interest in bears. Whether its a mutual predatory respect, or an awestruck preoccupation, or a flat-out, paralyzing fear – most of us like stories about bears. Lots of us like bear encounters – when they are sane, and safe. Unfortunately, not all encounters end well.
This book, edited by Joseph B Healy is a great compilation of bear attack tales. Here is the release:
Bears are one of nature’s apex predators, gentle and magnificent to watch from a distance, fierce and unpredictable when aroused. If startled or frightened it’s often too late for humans to escape a dangerous, fearsome, or fatal bear encounter. In this collection, we gather the ultimate thrilling and frightening bear-attack stories, including classic stories of the past few decades. 
Joseph B. Healy takes a closer look at some of the notable bear attacks of recent history in order to determine their causes, evaluate what happened, and appreciate the raw power—and danger—of mother nature. He tells tales of hikers enjoying weekend camping trips as well as workers going about their daily routines. Follow along as the victims’ lives are disrupted by bears, and see how survivors were forced to think and act in the moment to stay alive.
As modern life continues to encroach on the wilderness and as bears make a resurgence across North America and due to development are forced to live proximate to mankind, encounters between bears and humans will only increase. And while you’re still less likely to be attacked by a bear than you are to be killed by a lightning strike, any and all outdoorsmen and outdoorswomen will enjoy the raw power and potential lifesaving tips found in this ferocious account.  
________________________________________
About the Editor:
Joseph B. Healy has spent more than two decades in publishing, editing outdoors magazines for much of that time. His editorial career began at Outdoor Life and continued in fly-fishing and lifestyle publishing. He currently is editor of Covey Rise, a magazine covering the lifestyle of international wing shooting. Healy is the author of Training a Young Pointer, and he has edited Jesus on Forgiveness and John Stuart Mill on Liberty. He lives with his wife, son, and bird dog in Vermont.
I enjoyed the book immensely and one of the things I enjoyed most was the diversity of the stories. Some were funny. Some were pretty scary. Some were informative, and some told a bigger story than that just of the bear. There were bears in Maine and bears in Alaska. There were bears in Canada and California.
There was a great tale of an alcoholic bear in Montana. Causing a ruckus, that bear was finally shot stealing beer. There’s a yarn about a fisherman’s wife who had two big fears – bears and bush planes. Her personal nightmare story included both. There are stories of fatalities, stories about cuts and bruises, and stories where someone’s pride was the only thing injured.
Regardless, the stories are all entertaining, all well-written and once you start a new chapter, it is really hard to stop until you finish that particular tale. You can practically smell the pines of the west or the dank forest floor in Maine. You can imagine the rancid breath of a puffing bruin as it chases you up a tree.  It’s likely you’ll learn a thing or two about bears, and maybe a thing or two about people. You’ll probably chuckle a time or two, and maybe – just maybe – you’ll read something that will penetrate to one of those deep, shadowy corners within your brain – and stay there.
If you’re a camper, hiker, fisherman or hunter that is interested in bears – I’d really recommend this book. It’s a great one!

TriClawps Rifle Rest – A Review
Posted by Desert Rat


I grew up in the northeast where most shots at deer or moose were in cedar swamps or across clearcuts. Sure, some folks were adept practitioners of the long shot but realistically most hunters were happy to keep shots at 200 yards or less, and it worked. Hunting the west is a whole different ballgame where I would say many shots are at greater than 200 yards. Most hunters I know regularly shoot big game at 300, 400 even 500 yards – and that’s how they practice. They’re not simply lobbing lead around – they are proficient at the long shot.
Shooting at longer ranges means you need (or should) use every tool at your disposal – rangefinders, scope turrets, good optics, and sturdy shooting platforms. That’s where the TriClawps comes in.

From their website: “The Triclawps adapter clamps to your rifles, shotguns, crossbows, and even some handguns and lets you attach your firearm to any camera tripod. Doing so provides a stable rest regardless of the field conditions you’re hunting or shooting in. Sure, it’s always best to get prone, but in reality, that’s not always possible. Triclawps is the best alternative to situations where prone doesn’t work; and has consistently led to more hunters and shooters hitting more targets in difficult field conditions since we first started offering it.”
Not too long after I started hunting in Arizona, my friends started telling me about Triclawps. Most people hunting in Arizona do a lot of glassing; they already have a tripod. Triclawps offers a device that securely holds your rifle firmly onto your tripod, providing a steady rest for those long shots.
My first real hunting experience with a TriClawps was my daughter’s 1st javelina. It was called The Claw back then, but it’s the same company, same product. My daughter was shooting a single-shot .223 using The Claw. We helped her get set up, got the rifle mostly lined up, and she took over for the shot. After that hunt, I saw it used successfully a number of times.
Since then I have taken a javelina and an elk with mine. The elk in particular was a pretty steep downhill shot. These are very well-made and are also equipped with speed clamps to get them on and off your rifle quickly. I have mine set up on an extra quick-change plate for my tripod. This makes it easy to swap binos for the rifle pretty quickly.

If you are helping new hunters, or are making shots in difficult terrain, or making long shots where you need an extra sturdy rest, I would highly recommend picking up a TriClawps. They retail for about 100 bucks and they are worth every penny. They are a sturdy, precisely made piece of equipment, of a high quality. If you need a tripod, the folks at Tri Clawps can provide those as well.
Again from the TriClawps website : 
Triclawps is made of a high-density, glass-reinforced resin that is light weight, and tough enough to handle the recoil from the largest mangum rifles.
The standard 1/4″ 20 threading ensures your system will work on any camera tripod.
Triclawps comes with a lifetime, no fault, no questions asked warranty.

Replaceable Blade Knife Review – the Vixen from Wiebe
Posted by Desert Rat


I’d like to really thank Glenn Walker from the Providence Marketing Group and also the folks at Wiebe Knives for sending me a Vixen Folding knife to try.

Per the Press Release:
The Vixen Joins the Wiebe Knives Lineup
Lennox, SD — Wiebe Knives®, the replaceable-blade knife category leader in durability and value, has added the Vixen to its extensive and diverse category hunting, field-dressing and skinning knives. 
Every aspect of the Wiebe Vixen is designed under one simple premise: Don’t fight the knife. The Vixen features a folding, replaceable-blade design sporting a surgical-grade scalpel for a long-lasting and consistent edge to work with. And when the blade does become dull, simply dispose of the old blade and insert a new, wicked-sharp blade. 
No more wasted time sharpening afield, and no more messy precision work due to a dull blade. Wiebe’s replacement blades are designed to withstand the toughest field work by the most serious hunters, as well as the lightest precision work done by the most detail-oriented fur skinners. 
When open, the Vixen measures 7.5 inches and sports a featherweight, ergonomic handle for comfortable use on long jobs, and the folding design makes the Vixen the perfect take-anywhere companion. The knife comes with 24 wicked-sharp replacement blades. 
MSRP for the Wiebe Vixen replaceable-blade folding knife is $34.95.
About Wiebe Knives
The entire collection of products from Wiebe Knives—including hunting knives, field-dressing knives, skinning knives and an extensive lineup of fur-handling tools—were developed, tested and proven by hard-use hunters and trappers. Wiebe’s mission is simple: to provide tools of exceptional quality at an unbeatable value. 
The knife comes with extra blades right out of the gate so that’s a good thing. The first thing I noticed is that although the knife is light, the handle is thicker than many of competitor’s knives handles and it is contoured with finger grooves. This handle is well-designed to be easy to hold when covered in blood, wet, cold, etc. The knife feels great in the hand.
The blade changes easily. With some replaceable-blade knives, this is a challenge. Not so with the Vixen. Blade changes are pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Some replaceable blades seem to be brittle and snap at the first bit of twisting. I pushed and twisted on these a fair amount with no blades snapped.

Finally, this knife just plain looks good. The wood handle is attractive, and the whole knife is well-designed. I couldn’t wait to get it into the field.
Typically when I do a review I like to really give it a good going over on my bench or at the table, then I like to use it in the field. This time, I had something happen that hasn’t happened in over 2 decades of outdoor writing. I lost the product. I don’t know if someone moved it, I don’t know if someone took it. I can’t explain it. I came home from a scouting trip and I had 2 knives on my belt, including the Vixen. I took them both off and put them on the counter in the regular spot. A week later one knife was there, the other one wasn’t. I literally tore the house apart trying to find that knife, to no avail. I was heartsick. I did use the knife enough to know that I want one and I will be purchasing one soon from their online store. Replacement blades are about 6 bucks per dozen – a very reasonable price.

If you are in the market for a replaceable blade knife, I strongly suggest you look at the Vixen, or one of the other great models from Wiebe Knives. The price at 35 dollars is reasonable for such a well-designed, sturdy knife. Blades are scalpel-sharp as you would expect, and the knife handles very well. The thick, contoured handle will come in handy when your hands are cold or covered in blood. Well done, Wiebe!
I’ll have another Vixen with me when I head out to chase Javelina in February. I’ll be sure to post a follow-up report, from the field!

Testing the Pine Mountain® ExtremeStart™ Firestarter
Posted by Desert Rat


A shout out to the folks from Pine Mountain Fire for sending me this great firestarter to try out! The ExtremeStart Firestarter seemed like a great addition to any camping trip or backyard bonfire, so I thought I would give it a try!
From the Press Release:
Are you tired of collecting kindling only to have an even harder time starting your fire? Kindling can be a conundrum. Not only can it be difficult to collect and light, but sometimes it’s unclear whether it may cause more harm than good.
Thanks to the *new* ExtremeStart Firestarter from Pine Mountain, you can get the fire started in no time, and without the fear of potential toxins. About the size of a candy bar, the ExtremeStart Firestarter is all natural, portable, and easy-to-use. Simply place one firestarter among your wood or coals and light for a perfect flame. Whether you’re using it for tailgating, hunting/camping trips, or fire pit entertaining the ExtremeStart Firestarter is a must-have for an unforgettable fire this fall.
Enjoy a good fire with the simple strike of a match—anytime, anywhere.
• For indoor or outdoor use—fireplaces, fire pits, charcoal grills, chimineas, wood barbeque grills and smokers
• Clean burning and odorless with less flare-up
• Fits most grates

The first thing I noticed about the firestarters is that they were clean and easy to handle. Best of all – they have a pleasant smell. Most firestarters I have tried had at best – a weird odor.
My first test was in my chimney-style charcoal lighter. Not quite per directions, I broke one in half and put the two pieces in the bottom f the chimney and filled it with charcoal. I lit with a match through the bottom and within 20 minutes, my charcoal was ready. Easy!

For the next test, I wanted to utilize two Guest Reviewers. My co-worker Amy was going camping with her family and I thought her kids Katie and Lucas might like to help me test the firestarters.

According to Katie and Lucas, “The firestarter didn’t work as good as pine needles, but it did work good.” They stated that an added benefit was that Mom didn’t make them go gather tinder, when using the firestarters. Awesome guest review by 8-year old Katie and 11-year old Lucas! They are great kids- active in girl scouts and boy scouts, doing good in school, and more…. I was grateful for their help.

Finally, I was on a hunting trip myself, and we camped in the desert. We had a campfire each night – there is nothing better than steak cooked over mesquite coals! Getting the fire going was super easy! I put a firestarter at the bottom, and arranged the kindling over it, teepee style. Lit the corner of the wrapper and soon we had a crackling fire. These things work great. They would be especially useful if you were trying to start a fire in cold and/or wet conditions.

Pine Mountain makes a number of great products related to making fire in the great outdoors.
Like they say on their homepage:
“Deep in our genetic code burns a desire to be near the warm glow of a flame. Strike a match and feed your soul.”
