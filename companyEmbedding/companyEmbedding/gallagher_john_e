John E. Gallagher’s career included a variety of weed science related topics. He received his B.S. degree in Agronomy from Pennsylvania State University. During the early years of his career John worked for Amchem as a turfgrass weed control specialist. Later his interest turned to aquatic weed control and he became Product Development Manager for aquatic weed control products for the Union Carbide Agricultural Products Company.
John has played an important role in the development of weed science serving as President of the North East Weed Science Society (1968) and the Southern Weed Science Society (1982). He has served on the Board of Directors of the Aquatic Plant Management Society (1965-66), and on committees. He also regularly attends APMS annual meetings. John has written some 20 publications or abstracts dealing with various aspects of weed science.

His expertise has been recognized and he has been a member of US EPA workshops, and an Interagency Taskforce. He was a consultant on international aquatic weed control problems as well. In recognition of his service and contributions, John has received the Southern Weed Science Society Distinguished Service Award and has been elected a fellow of the Weed Science Society of America.

						Electric Fencing
					




HTML 02Electric fence is 50% less expensive to build and maintain than barbed wire according to the 2005 study by Iowa State University on estimated costs for livestock fencing. Perhaps the greatest benefit of all is that electric fencing can be a powerful pasture management tool.Gallagher electric fencing products can play a key role in helping you control the area to be grazed.  We offer both permanent and portable electric fence systems that allow specific areas of the pasture to be grazed, while other pastures are allowed to rest and regrow.
