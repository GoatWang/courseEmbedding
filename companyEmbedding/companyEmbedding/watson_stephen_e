It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View Stephen E.’s Full ProfileStephen E.’s ActivityGreat opportunity at our location in beautiful Colorado...Stephen E. likedSummaryI have transformed Human Capital Management in the Navy by blending interdisciplinary science, information technology and business process reengineering -- saving billions and improving productivity throughout.  I want to apply these paradigms to transform large-scale commercial and public organizations.  I have expertise in Supply Chain Management, Human Capital Science, Behavioral Science, Computer Science, Business Process Reengineering, Rational Analysis, salesmanship, public speaking and leadership of cross-functional and multi-disciplinary organization.  Some examples that can be applied to any large-scale industry-Professional Apprentice Career Track (PACT):  I created the Navy's apprentice program, providing expanded opportunities to 6000 employees per year from diverse backgrounds and educational experiences.-Rating IDentification Engine (RIDE):  I invented the algorithms, processes and software solutions that match every Sailor to the job they find most challenging and rewarding; this has resulted in massive improvement in training efficiency and  job performance, while reducing turnover and costs.-Job Opportunities in the Navy (JOIN):  I invented the algorithms and created the processes and global enabling technologies that guide Sailors (US Navy) and Airmen (USAF) to jobs in which they are most interested.  Combined with RIDE this provides the most powerful job match. Going above and beyond any existing approach (e.g., Holland / RIASEC) JOIN reliably improves training success, promotion rates and retention, in a manner that can be audited and proven in profitability and productivity. My expertise is in problem solving—surveying the problem space, assembling the right team of problem solvers, and building the proper solutions. My skillsets range from engineering, behavioral and computer sciences through public speaking, team building and leadership.ExperienceDirector Selection and ClassificationUS NavyAugust 2005  –  Present (12 years)Human Capital Scientist, Strategist and LeaderSkillsLeadershipMicrosoft OfficeMilitarySecurity ClearanceTrainingU.S. Department of DefenseMilitary OperationsProgram ManagementOperational PlanningDefenseLeadership DevelopmentGovernmentHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!EducationUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignDoctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Engineering PsychologyDoctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Engineering Psychology1991  –  1995Doctorate in Engineering Psychology, with minors in linguistics and multivariate statistics.Southern Illinois University, CarbondaleSuma Cum Laude, B.A., PsychologySuma Cum Laude, B.A., Psychology1989  –  1991Selected to teach undergraduate psychology lab as an undergraduateHonors thesis: Confidence and Uncertainty in Predicting Future EventsUniversity at Albany, SUNYAssociate of Science, Reactor TechnologyAssociate of Science, Reactor Technology1988  –  1989Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyCertification, Business Process ReengineeringCertification, Business Process Reengineering2001  –  PresentProcess Design and Implementation: Reengineering and Change ManagementStudied under Dr. Michael M.

IBM Watson PR Tax Excitement

February 10, 2017

In one eight hour period I noticed these rah rah write ups about IBM Watson doing taxes. How timely? What a coincidence that these publications ran stories about yet another Watson achievement. Everything it seems except sustainable revenue.
Here are the write ups I reviewed:

Fast Company, “H&R Block’s Watson-Powered Robots Are Here To Help With Your Taxes” stating “Block and IBM say Watson has digested 600 million “data points” from past filings to learn tips and tricks.” I bet those IRS analysts love those “tricks.”
TechCrunch, “H&R Block Is Now Using IBM Watson to Find Tax Deductions,” stating “Beginning Sunday, February 5th, H&R Block customers will be able to interact with the new system at the company’s retail locations.” Nifty. Foot traffic for those who want H&R Block to “do” their taxes. In short, no hands on yet, right?
New York Times, “IBM Gives Watson a New Challenge: Your Tax Return,” stating “For IBM, the collaboration with H&R Block underlines its strategy in the emerging market for artificial intelligence technology. Watson will touch consumers, but through IBM’s corporate clients.” You may have to pay to view this apparent chunk of marketing collateral. I love the “touch” thing.

You get the idea. A huge PR push for Watson, H&R Block, a promo for a super bowl commercial, and jargon about how smart Watson because it indexes text.
Revenues? Did anyone mention revenues? Cost? Did anyone mention cost? Competitive technology? Did anyone mention competitors? Editorial rigor? Are you nuts? Rigor. What’s that?
Nah. Watson. Weakly.

IBM on Cognitive Computing Safari in South Africa

February 9, 2017

The article on ZDNet titled IBM to Use AI to Tame Big Data in Its Second African Research Lab discusses the 12th global research unit IBM has opened. This one is positioned in South Africa for data analytics and cognitive computing as applied to healthcare and urban development. Dr. Solomon Assefa, IBM’s Director of Research for Africa, mentions in the article that the lab was opened in only 18 months. He goes on,
Assefa said the facility will combine industrial research with a startup incubator, working closely with Wits’ own entrepreneur accelerator in the same innovation hub, known as the Tshimologong Precinct. Tshimologong is part of a major urban renewal project by Wits and the City of Johannesburg.
Nowhere else in the world is there an innovation hub that houses a world class research lab,” Assefa said. “One thing we agreed on from the start is that we will make the lab accessible to startups and entrepreneurs in hub.
The lab is funded by a ten-year investment program of roughly $60M and maintains an open door policy with the University of the Witswatersrand (Wits), The Department of Trade and Industry, and the Department of Science and Technology. The immediate focuses of several early applications include Cape region forest fire prevention, disease monitoring, and virtual reality.

Presenting Watson as a Service

February 9, 2017

Every now and then, interest in Watson re-emerges. Forbes published a long-read recently entitled How IBM Is Building A Business Around Watson. After gaining press during Watson’s victorious Jeopardy face-off with Ken Jennings, Watson’s first commercial applications took off. IBM sold it to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Wellpoint to design an advisory system for its medical staff. Other medical institutions have purchased it since then. The author asserts,
Still, the potentially is undeniable. Think about how much more effective an ordinary doctor can be with Watson as an assistant. First, even before the patient enters the room, it can analyze their personal medical history, which often runs to hundreds of pages. Then, it can compare the case history with the 700,000 academic papers published every year as well as potentially millions of other patient records. All of this is, of course, beyond the capabilities of human doctors, who typically only get a few minutes to prepare for each examination. So being able to consult with Watson will be enormously helpful.
The real value is offering Watson as a service by providing its API, so that developers in organizations can develop their own applications using its technology. Over 550 partners are utilizing this currently for everything from retail to geolocation to travel agencies. Certainly, with all the hype Watson receives, we can only expect usage to grow.

Free One Year Old, 13 Page IBM Ebook about Cognitive Computing

February 3, 2017

I like short books. But 13 pages? If you are thirsty for knowledge about IBM’s cognitive computing push, you will want to navigate to this link and download The Promise of Cognitive Computing, originally published in February 2016. Timely. My undergraduate honors essay was about five times longer than this IBM ebook.
What’s in the scholarly gem? Here’s a sampling of the topics:

Technology transforms
The opportunity is providing insights
The solution: Businesses built on cognitive computing
The opportunity for start ups
Six real life examples of cognitive computing products
Six steps for developing a cognitive computing product

There are two sidebars filled with useful information; for example, a definition of unstructured information and four reasons to build a cognitive computing business using Watson. There is also a link to a 30 day free trial of Watson.
Interesting. What’s happened in a year of cognitive computing? Not enough to warrant a second edition. Apparently the 19 consecutive quarters of declining revenue has blunted some of the marketing enthusiasm for ebooks.

IBM Watson: Inventing a Distilled Rum

January 29, 2017

I think this write up has some drops of truth in it. I wanted to check with a former MADD volunteer, but the email address wobbled and then fell against a light pole. The title was arresting: “IBM Watson Bottles ‘Holiday Spirit’ with New RUM Created Using Artificial Intelligence.” The source? The “real” news outfit the UK Mirror.
The write up explained that Watson allegedly “produces beverage based on social media posts.” I learned:
“Holiday Spirit” is claimed to be the world’s very first data-distilled rum and was created using IBM Watson. The supercomputer analyzed data from social media posts in order to produce a bespoke rum “that tastes like a holiday”. “In just six hours Watson was able to read 15 million posts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter relating to holidays – and find the predominant emotions and concepts in those posts,” explained Joe Harrods, big data analyst and AI expert, who works closely with Watson.
The idea was that Watson guzzled 5,000 rum reviews. Then Watson demonstrated that it was in control of its faculties by “matching emotions from the reviews with ingredients.” Finally Walked a straight line to a master blender who concocted liquor, hooch, booze, or nectar that
has a subtle vanilla flavor, medium sweetness, hints of coconut and is naturally caressed with cinnamon and allspice.
So what? Here’s the results of the breathalyzer test:
“There’s no reason that this ‘taste sensation’ couldn’t be recreated for all kinds of experiences and emotions. We’ve already seen robot bartenders that can mix custom cocktails for every different punter based on their personality…
I am delighted that I have never had a drink of alcohol. I wonder if the same might be said of Watson or possibly the marketer who blended this knock out punch for artificial intelligence. What was that question? Oh, right. I remember: “Watson, when will you generate enough money to make IBM stakeholders happy.”
After 10 consecutive quarters of declining revenue, Holiday Spirit may be in short supply.

IBM Watson: Now About Generating Big Revenue

January 27, 2017

To IBM’s credit, since the “weather” changed, IBM’s Watson marketing has been less fun for me. I did enjoy reading “Elementary, My Dear IBM: When Will Watson Make Money?” I prefer the concept of substantial, sustainable revenue which generates profits for stakeholders, but the write up’s title is pretty good.
After asking this important question, the write up states:
IBM Watson has taken heat from Wall Street for not adding to Big Blue’s revenue as the company reported a 19th successive quarter of decline.
That’s quite a track record. Nineteen of anything in a row is difficult to pull off. Way to go, IBM.
I highlighted this passage as well:
But quizzing executives following IBM’s financial report on the fourth quarter of 2016, Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty noted that although Watson was getting a “pretty significant share of the press” – to put it mildly – unlike the other businesses that it was cited alongside, Watson was “not contributing to revenue”. Huberty probed when Watson would start bringing in money. IBM admitted to shaving spent a combined $16bn on R&D and acquisitions during 2016, including buying 15 companies such as the $2.6bn acquisition of Truven Health Analytics.
I put a Big Blue exclamation point next to this passage. IBM’s CFO commented about Watson’s payoff this way:
revenue would come through Watson serving IBM’s strategic imperatives and cognitive software. Watson is the “silver thread” running though Watson Health and Financial Services, IBM’s IoT and security, he said. “Watson is firmly, firmly established as the silver thread that runs through those cognitive solutions and you can see all of that in the solution software performance.”
Okay, shareholders, there’s your answer. What can one weave with silver thread? How about some silver thread pants for the executive who needs to slay financial dragons in World of Warcraft.

IBM Explains Buggy Whip to Control Corvettes

January 19, 2017

I love IBM. I enjoy the IBM Watson marketing. I get a kick out of the firm’s saga of declining quarterly revenue. Will IBM make it 19 quarters in a row? I am breathless.
I read “IBM’s Rometty Lays Out AI Considerations, Ethical Principals.” The main idea, as I understand it, is:
artificial intelligence should be used to advance and augment humans not replace them. Transparency of AI development is also necessary.
Since smart software is dependent upon numerical recipes, I am not sure that the many outfits involved in fiddling with procedures, systems, and methods are going to make clear what their wizards are doing. Furthermore, IBM, in my opinion, is a bit of a buggy whip outfit. The idea that a buggy whip can control a bright 18 year old monitoring a drone swarm relying on artificial intelligence to complete a mission. Maybe IBM will equip Watson with telepathy?
The write up explains:
Commonly referred to as artificial intelligence, this new generation of technology and the cognitive systems it helps power will soon touch every facet of work and life – with the potential to radically transform them for the better…As with every prior world-changing technology, this technology carries major implications. Many of the questions it raises are unanswerable today and will require time, research and open discussion to answer.
Okay. What’s DeepMind up to? What about those folks at Facebook, Baidu, Microsoft, MIT, and most of the upscale French universities doing? Are the insights of researchers in Beijing finding their way into the media channel?
Well, IBM is going to take action if the information in the “real” journalistic write up is on the money. Here’s what Big Blue is going to do in its continuing effort to become a plus for stakeholders:

IBM’s systems will augment human intelligence. Sounds good but the direction of some smart software is to make it easy for humans to get a pizza. The digital divide delivers convenience to lots of folks and big paydays to those in the top tier who find a way to sell stuff. Alexa, I need paper towels.
Transparency. Right, that’s a great idea, but how it plays out in the real world is going to be a bit hit and miss. Actually, more miss than hit. The big money folks want to move to “winner take all” plays. Amazon Alexa has partners. Amazon keeps some money as it continues it march to global digital Wal-Mart-ism.
Skills. Yep, the smart software movers and shakers buy promising outfits. Even the allegedly independent folks in Montréal are finding Microsoft a pretty nifty place to work.

Perhaps the folks doing smart software will meet and agree on some rules. Better yet, the US government can legislate rules and then rely on the United Nations or NGOs to promulgate them. Wait. There is a better way. Why not use a Vulcan mind meld?
I understand the IBM has to take the high road, but when a drone swarm makes its own decisions, whipping the rule books may not have much effect. Love those MBA chestnuts like buggy whips.

IBM Does Not Correlate Patents and Revenue

January 12, 2017

I read “IBM Achieves Record Number of U.S. patents in 2016, 24th Straight Year of Patent Dominance.” I learned that Big Blue, the owner of the Watson things, “earned a total of 8,088 U.S. patents last year at a rate of 22 patents per day…” Impressive. I checked IBM’s financial performance and verified that the company has reported its 18th consecutive quarter of declining revenue. It certainly seems that generating top line revenue growth is not correlated with filing patents. What is correlated is the overhead cost of preparing patent documents. Less stressful than making sales I believe. I respond to revenue dominance, not lawyering. But that’s my Harrod’s Creek shortsightedness.

The Dark Web and Surface Web Connection

January 11, 2017

IBM is doing its part to educate about the Dark Web. IBM Big Data and Analytics Hub shared a podcast episode entitled, Should we shut down the Dark Web?, which addresses the types of illegal activities on the Dark Web, explains challenges for law enforcement and discusses the difficulty in identifying Dark Web actors. Senior product manager of cyber analysis with IBM i2 Safer Planet, Bob Stasio, hosts the podcast. We found what one of the guests, Tyler Carbone, had to say quite interesting,

The parts of the internet we’re particularly interested in is where stolen information is posted and traded. What’s interesting is that that’s happening not through Tor…For what we’re interested in, a lot of stolen information is posted (traded and sold) on lite web sites — you can access them in Internet Explorer or Chrome. They’re just hosted in countries that aren’t particularly listed. One of the most well-known carding marketplaces…is hosted on a .cm….That’s not hidden within Tor at all. The problem is that individuals are logging in in an anonymous way so we can’t follow up with the individuals.

The line between the Surface Web and the Dark Web may be blurring or blurred. Ultimately, the internet is rooted in connection, so it’s hard to imagine clear separation between actors and activities being relegated to one or the other. We recommend giving this podcast a listen to ruminate on questions such as whether the Dark Web could and should be shut down.

IBM and Its Five Year Vision: Nothing Like Vision Instead of Revenue

January 9, 2017

I read “IBM’s 5 Year Vision Focuses on New Technology for Visualizing the World.” The author is a Kevin Murnane who is the author of Nutrition for Cyclists: Eating and Drinking Before, During and After the Ride. Seems like excellent preparation for the low fat approach to IBM technology, doesn’t it?
The write up in the capitalist tool Forbes Magazine recycles information from “IBM 5 in 5. Five Innovations That Will Help Change Our Lives within Five Years: The Invisible Made Visible.” Now that’s a title designed for Web search engines.
The IBM write up identifies these technologies as life changers:

Artificial intelligence like IBM Watson
Superhero vision via “hyperimaging”
Macroscopes
Medical labs on a chip
Smart sensors.

What I found interesting was this comment from the nutritionist:
People would be wise to listen when IBM talks about future technology. Their past achievements include the invention of floppy discs and hard drives, the relational database and SQL, Fortran, DRAM, the virtual machine, the ATM machine, magnetic stripe cards and the Universal Bar Code. Their employees have won five Nobel Prizes, six Turing Awards, ten National Medals of Technology, and five National Medals of Science. IBM has a long history of looking forward, thinking big and accomplishing what they set out to do. If their future is like their past, IBM’s 5 in 5 will be more than pie in the sky.
Unfortunately the Nobel Prizes, the Turing Awards, the National Medals for Technology and the five National Medals of Science are not translating to top line revenue growth and juicy profits for stakeholders. IBM’s vision does not include expanding aggressively the i2-type technology at a time when IBM Federal Systems might be in for a a bit of Gotham shock.
Give me that old fashioned revenue growth, please. I am not sure that macroscopes and superhero vision can change how I see the company’s last fifteen quarterly reports. One does not get fit on a low calorie revenue diet, does one?

IBM Watson: Predicting the Future

July 12, 2017

I enjoy IBM’s visions of the future. One exception: The company’s revenue estimates for the Watson product line is an exception. I read “IBM Declares AI the Key to Making Unstructured Data Useful.” For me, the “facts” in the write up are a bit like a Payday candy bar. Some nuts squished into a squishy core of questionable nutritional value.
I noted this factoid:
80 percent of company data is unstructured, including free-form documents, images, and voice recordings.
I have been interested in the application of the 80-20 rule to certain types of estimates. The problem is that the ‘principle of factor sparsity” gets disconnected from the underlying data. Generalizations are just so darned fun and easy. The problem is that the mathematical rigor necessary to validate the generalization is just too darned much work. The “hey, I’ve got a meeting” or the more common “I need to check my mobile” get in the way of figuring out if the 80-20 statement makes sense.
My admittedly inept encounters with data suggest that the volume of unstructured data is high, higher that the 80 percent in the rule. The problem is that today’s systems struggle to:

Make sense of massive streams of unstructured data from outfits like YouTube, clear text and encrypted text messages, and the information blasted about on social media
Identify the important items of content directly germane to a particular matter
Figure out how to convert content processing into useful elements like named entities and relate those entities to code words and synonyms
Perform cost effective indexing of content streams in near real time.

At this time, systems designed to extract actionable information from relatively small chunks of content are improving. But these systems typically break down when the volume exceeds the budget and computing resources available to those trying to “make sense” of the data in a finite amount of time. This type of problem is difficult due to constraints on the systems. These constraints are financial as in “who has the money available right now to process these streams?” These constraints are problematic when someone asks “what do we do with the data in this dialect from northern Afghanistan?” And there are other questions.
My problem with the IBM approach is that the realities of volume, interrelating structured and semi structured data, and multi lingual content is that these bumps in the information super highway Watson seems to speed along are absorbed by marketing fluffiness.
I loved this passage:
Chatterjee highlighted Macy’s as an example of an IBM customer that’s using the company’s tools to better personalize customers’ shopping experiences using AI. The Macy’s On Call feature lets customers get information about what’s in stock and other key details about the contents of a retail store, without a human sales associate present. It uses Watson’s natural language understanding capabilities to process user queries and provide answers. Right now, that feature is available as part of a pilot in 10 Macy’s stores.
Yep, I bet that Macy’s is going to hit a home run against the fast ball pitching of Jeff Bezos’ Amazon Prime team. Let’s ask Watson. On the other hand, let’s ask Alexa.

“She seemed quite nice really.  At least as far as
a weird ghostly spirit that introduces itself in a
dark wood at night can be nice.”

Don't mess with Melia! 

She's a feisty dryad – and she's angry. 
Ever since her ash tree was cut down
to make way for a new road, she's been
out for revenge.  On the whole human race.

But when Melia and fellow tree spirits
Betula and Quercus try to attack
tree-loving Jake and his family, they
find that everything is more complicated
than it seems.  Soon they are working
together - and their plan to save
Nightingale Copse from being splatted
by an airport runway is about to shake
the government...

IBM Watson












			
			
	
		
		
		
			
				Watson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability, representing a new era in computing. Watson analyzes high volumes of data and processes information more like a human than a computer—by understanding natural language, generating hypotheses based on evidence, and learning as it goes.

As organizations work to make more data-driven decisions -- 2.5 billion gigabytes of data being created every single day, they need advanced systems that are able to crunch massive amounts of structured and unstructured data and deliver actionable insights within seconds. Deloitte estimates the cognitive computing market will expand in five years to $50 billion in the U.S. alone.
Since its triumph on the television quiz show Jeopardy! IBM has advanced Watson’s capabilities and made it available via the cloud. Watson now powers new consumer and enterprise services in the health care, financial services, retail and education markets.  IBM has also opened the Watson platform to developers and entrepreneurs, enabling them to build and bring to market their own powered by Watson applications for a variety of industries.
To continue Watson’s advancement, IBM has created two business units: Watson, established for the development and commercialization of cloud-delivered cognitive computing technologies and Watson Health dedicated to improving the ability of doctors, researchers and insurers to surface new insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created daily to deliver personalized healthcare.
