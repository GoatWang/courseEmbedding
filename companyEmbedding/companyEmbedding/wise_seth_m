This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Seth Godin Quotes

This is my collection of Seth Godin quotes.  They’ll make you think and ponder as you wonder around from one idea to the next.
Seth’s sweet spot is marketing but his quotes easily span business, change, greatness, innovation, leadership, mediocrity, and strategy.  Seth’s quotes teach us that the individual is a powerful force, that multiplies when we dare to be different, take action, test our ideas, stay true to our authentic self, tell inspiring stories, make things meaningful, and lead tribes of like minds and shared values.
Perhaps the most important lesson we learn from Seth Godin is this:  Think and do great things.  And do the tough stuff, because it’s worth it.
Enjoy.
Top 10 Seth Godin Quotes
Here are my top 10 favorite quotes by Seth Godin:

“Are you a serial idea-starting person? The goal is to be an idea-shipping person.”
“Change is not a threat, it’s an opportunity. Survival is not the goal, transformative success is.” 
“Don’t try to please everyone. There are countless people who don’t want one, haven’t heard of one or actively hate it. So what?” 
“Go ahead, do something impossible. “
“Ideas in secret die. They need light and air or they starve to death.” 
“If you could do tomorrow over again, would you?” 
“Instead of wondering when your next vacation is, you ought to set up a life you don’t need to escape from.”
“Life is like skiing. Just like skiing, the goal is not to get to the bottom of the hill. It’s to have a bunch of good runs before the sun sets.”
“Why waste a sentence saying nothing? “ 
“You can’t shrink your way to greatness! “ 

Business

“Everyone is not your customer. “ 
“Fire the committee. No great website in history has been conceived of by more than three people. Not one. This is a deal breaker.”

“If your organization requires success before commitment, it will never have either. “ 
“In a world of free, everyone can play.” 
“It’s better to make a decision, even the wrong one, than to be in limbo.”

Change

“Change almost never fails because it’s too early. It almost always fails because it’s too late.” 
“Change is not a threat, it’s an opportunity. Survival is not the goal, transformative success is.” 
“If you want to dig a big hole, you need to stay in one place.” 
“Knowing what to do is very, very different than actually doing it.” 
“Little changes cost you. Big changes benefit you by changing the game, but only if you go first.” 
“No, everything is not going to be okay. It never is. It isn’t okay now. Change, by definition, changes things” 
“Sometimes we spend more time than we should defending the old thing, instead of working to take advantage of the new thing.”

Choice

“If there’s time for an emergency, why isn’t there time for brilliance, generosity or learning? “ 
“If you could do tomorrow over again, would you? “ 
“If you’re not proud of where you work, go work somewhere else. “ 
“Just saying yes because you can’t bear the short-term pain of saying no is not going to help you do the work.” 
“Saying no to loud people gives you the resources to say yes to important opportunities. “ 
“We notice what we choose to notice.”

“’Teamwork’ is the word that bosses use when they actually mean ‘Do what I say’”

“Relying too much on proof distracts you from the real mission–which is emotional connection.” 
“Selling to people who actually want to hear from you is more effective than interrupting strangers who don’t. “

hi,
i tried hard, even pulled out most of my remaining hair but coudn’t get the profound meaning of the quote – “If you could do tomorrow over again, would you?”
if you could explain it over again, would you? 😉
thanks.
PS: a phenomenal collection. seth godin is not just a management guru…. he is a life guru !









@ Gaurav — My take is that it’s a play on the idea that we always wish we had a do over.  
Well, tomorrow hasn’t happened yet.  Will it be the day you want it to be, or will it be yet another day that you wish you could do over?  What if instead, we got intentional, and made the most of our tomorrow through a little bit of mindful planning, and clarity of what we want … and then actually do it when the opportunity of tomorrow presents itself.
Yes, I like when people blend work and life, and live their values.  I think work is a great place for self-expression and an arena for growth and greatness.









Good day, JD!
Man, you loaded this post with some goodies, bud! I had read a couple of Seth’s well known quotes, but had no idea that he had so much awesomeness available. I couldn’t even begin to pick a favorite one here… they’re all great! Thanks for sharing these, bud. Also thanks for stopping by my site to introduce yourself; I’m glad you did. Otherwise, I would’ve missed out on this awesome post! 
All the best to you, JD! I shall indeed be returning back to see more from you. 🙂









@ Deeone — Thank you.  
Yes, Seth has a way to make an old song sound new, as well as shine the light on the right things with a new or interesting twist.









I LOVE reading Seth Godin! I must have 10 of his books and they’re some of the only ones I will read the WEEK it comes out. Love this: “Change almost never fails because it’s too early. It almost always fails because it’s too late.”









Thanks so much for this collection, JD! No wonder Seth Godin is such a powerhouse — he’s just filled with wisdom! And I love how lists of quotes can speak to us in different ways. At this point in time, my favorite is: “Don’t try to please everyone. There are countless people who don’t want one, haven’t heard of one or actively hate it. So what?” That means a lot to me because I was taking social media and others’ reactions too seriously!









@ Bryan — He makes reading a pleasure with his precision and twists with words.
@ Samantha — I think that’s the real power of quotes.  Just like a powerful song, it’s an input, but ultimately we make it meaningful to our situation, and it can be a great inspiration.









Hi JD .. He’s always worth reading .. he’s pithy and relevant and can jab you in the ribs to jog your memory … Pithy and Pertinent .. practises what he preaches ..
Cheers – Hilary









@ Hilary — Perfect phrasing … pithy and pertinent!
