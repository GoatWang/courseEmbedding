CAPITAL INVESTMENT COUNSEL, INC.
Capital Investment Counsel is a money management firm dedicated to serving the specific needs of its clients through individually tailored portfolios positioned in the equity and fixed-income markets. The foundation of our firm is knowledge, integrity and experience. Patience and discipline are the key components of our investment programs.

The Columns - Monthly Newsletter
Form ADV Part 2
PHILOSOPHY AND PROGRAM
Capital Investment Counsel, Inc. follows a very fundamental investment program, conceived by one of the company's founders, E.O. Edgerton, Jr., and has survived the acid test in judging any investment strategy; it has demonstrated consistently over time.
Our philosophy is contrarian by nature. We do not try to predict markets. By looking for financially strong, undervalued securities and adding patience and discipline, we pinpoint those stocks and bonds which suit our investment criteria.
We acquire individual positions in publicly traded companies of all market capitalizations, while focusing on a disciplined process designed to manage risk for the investor while seeking about average returns over time. 
By using some of the best research resources available, Capital Investment Counsel's portfolio approach is best designed to preserve capital and provide above average investment performance over the long run.

How we do it...
Our "5 Point" Common Sense Investment Philosophy features Tax Advantaged Investing and Multiplication of Stocks and Dividends:

We place emphasis on cash-rich, financially strong companies selling at historical lows, when selecting our investment positions in an effort to establish a margin of safety. This practice traditionally experience low position turnover (buys/sells) in our portfolios, which tends to keep expenses relatively low for our clients.
Reinvestment of dividends and interest during the year in order to "dollar cost average" into the market is our standard practice.
Emphasis is placed on contributions or additional savings. Additional funds can also help with "dollar cost averaging". 
Tax efficiencies- our goal is to minimize tax liability by focusing on the long-term capital gains. 
In cases where a current holding has increased significantly beyond the business' intrinsic value, we may elect to "multiply" our holdings by selling that position and reinvesting the proceeds in two, three or four positions for further diversification.


Investment-grade bond holdings may also complement our stock selections, in accordance with the investment objectives of the portfolio. 
We manage four types of portfolios for investors: growth, growth & income, balanced and income.

Capital Counsel Investment










Welcome
Capital Counsel, a registered investment adviser, was founded in 1999 on the belief that fundamental    valuation-based analysis can produce consistently good long-term investment returns. Fundamental analysis is a way of determining what a company is worth and reduces risk if you buy at that valuation. Historically, our patient adherence to a rigorous buy/sell discipline has provided clients with good long-term results and protection in declining markets.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
