A single investment philosophy across all strategies
We are dedicated to the concentrated growth investment philosophy that we have practiced for over 25 years. We strive to reflect that philosophy across all of our strategies. We believe our core strength remains conducting proprietary fundamental, business-focused, criteria-driven research.





Proprietary, criteria-driven fundamental research	
Our research-driven culture is at the heart of executing our investment philosophy. We use our six investment criteria to identify and understand the potential sources, strength, and duration of the long-term growth drivers of what we think are great wealth-creating businesses.





Concentrated, conviction-weighted approach
We believe the best way to add value over a full market cycle is by hand-picking a concentrated portfolio that is conviction-weighted based on the strength of fit with our six criteria. We think this leads to a differentiated and potentially higher-quality portfolio for our clients.





Long-term investment horizon
In our view, successful investing is a long-term endeavor that requires rigorous ongoing due diligence, patience, and discipline. We look beyond short-term stock price volatility, thinking creatively about the key drivers behind a company’s ability to generate sustainable above-average earnings growth over time.





Continuity of investment process and personnel
Collectively, our analysts, global sector heads, and portfolio managers average eight years of experience at the firm and 13 years of industry experience. We think our clients benefit from the collective strength of applying the same philosophy and process over multiple market cycles.





Independence and depth of resources
We are committed to acting solely in the long-term interest of our clients, rather than the short-term interests of external stakeholders. As an independent firm, we can invest significant time, energy, and resources in our effort to ensure that every aspect of our investment management business is fully aligned with our mission of prudently enhancing our clients’ wealth.

Strategies 


At Sands Capital, we believe that innovative businesses, able to sustain growth for many years, are essential building blocks of wealth creation. Accordingly, all of our strategies concentrate investments in what we believe are high-quality businesses that are leaders in their respective industries. Each strategy is committed to executing our single growth philosophy and takes a long-term approach in our effort to deliver on our mission. 













Select Growth

Since 1992, the primarily U.S.-focused Select Growth strategy has provided clients with exposure to the businesses we believe are the best growth opportunities available. Portfolio weightings generally reflect our conviction in each business’s strength of fit with our six investment criteria, as well as their prospects for delivering above-average earnings growth over time.

Learn More >





Global Growth

An unconstrained approach to global investing that applies the same research discipline and  six investment criteria to build a long-term, concentrated portfolio. The Global Growth strategy aims to provide exposure to the highest-quality, longest-duration growth businesses, we can find anywhere in the world.

Learn More >





Global Leaders

A concentrated portfolio that applies our six investment criteria to a global opportunity set. The Global Leaders portfolio seeks to own businesses growing at above average rates, while also emphasizing the stability of that growth as well as the associated free cash generation, returns on capital, and returns of capital.

Learn More >





Emerging Markets Growth

Given the depth and global capabilities of our investment team, the Emerging Markets Growth strategy is a natural extension of our research platform. Fundamental, bottom-up stock selection and the application of our six investment criteria results in a concentrated and conviction-weighted portfolio that is quite different from traditional benchmarks.

Learn More >







Specialty Strategies

Sands Capital manages several specialty strategies, namely, two focused portfolios and a technology innovators portfolio.

Our Focus strategies are designed to magnify investors' exposure to what we think are the businesses that best fit with our six investment criteria. Portfolio holdings for the Focus strategies come from the holdings of all of our four strategies. 

Our Technology Innovators strategy leverages our deep global technology sector research to provide investors with exposure to what we think are the most innovative technology companies around the world, without regard to market capitalization.

Mission 


"We exist to add value and enhance the wealth of our clients with prudence over time. For over two decades our growth-oriented philosophy and proprietary, criteria-driven fundamental research has been at the heart of executing our mission."

Frank M. Sands, CFA
Chief Investment Officer, Chief Executive Officer













We apply a single growth-oriented investment philosophy, rooted in the belief that, over time, stock prices reflect the earnings growth of the underlying business. As growth investors, we believe the earnings power of an asset drives value. To create wealth for our clients, we must concentrate investments in a select number of what we think are high quality businesses that possess the ability to sustainably grow earnings over time. In our view, there are relatively few truly outstanding businesses that can sustain earnings growth while maintaining a leadership position over the long term. To identify these businesses we use a fundamental, bottom-up, business-focused research process that relies heavily on our six investment criteria as our compass.
We think our odds of identifying and owning value-added investments are greatly enhanced when we have a high degree of conviction about how well a business meets these criteria. Our business-owner mindset and long-term perspective allow us to think differently. We focus on finding key insights to identify layers of growth that may be under-appreciated by the market. In addition, we fundamentally believe that providing clients with a concentrated and conviction-weighted portfolio is a powerful way of adding value with prudence over full market cycles. This has been our approach for more than 20 years. It will remain at the heart of what we do at Sands Capital.
