Los Angeles author Christopher J. Lynch has written for numerous local and national publications on a variety of topics including:Interviewing one of the last surviving Buffalo Soldiers, Visiting incarcerated veterans in a maximum security prison who perform fundraisers to raise money for our troops overseas, And telling the story of a Manhattan Beach test pilot who was the first man to survive a supersonic bailout of an aircraft, He also authored the authorized biography of the iconic child actor Ken Osmond, (Eddie Haskell from the TV series Leave it to Beaver.A lover of crime fiction, he has published several short stories, and is the author of the One Eyed Jack series about a professional blackmailer that operates in and around the South Bay area of Los Angeles. The debut novel in the series was a 2013 Shamus Award finalist, and a 2014 Writers Digest honorable mention for genre fiction. A production company has optioned the movie rights to One Eyed Jack, and they plan to adapt it to a feature film.Christopher likes to give back to his community by teaching writing to at-risk youth, and serving as a mentor for the Men For Honor  writing program at the maximum-security prison north of Los Angeles.When he’s not writing, Christopher enjoys mountain climbing and distance cycling. He’s reached the summits of Mount Whitney, Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, as well as a trek to Mount Everest Base Camp. He once trained and led eleven blind hikers to the summit of 10,000-ft. Mount Baldy, the highest point in Los Angeles County, and the third highest point in Southern California. A documentary film is being made of the adventure. His latest adventure was a bicycling trip of Cuba that he completed in March of 2016.
