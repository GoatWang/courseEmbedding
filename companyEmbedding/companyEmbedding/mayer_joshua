Firm Specialties



Child Support

Money from the non-custodial parent, paid to the custodial parent, to provide for the general welfare of the child(ren) involved.
Child support is the right of a child to be supported by both of his/her parents. There are factors that go into determining child support. If you need to establish child support, need to modify child support, or are not receiving your court-ordered child support, call the attorneys at Tyson and Denson, PLLC to help you with your child support case.





Child Custody

In Florida, child custody is an agreement between the custodial and non-custodial parent as to when each will spend time with the child(ren) common to both parents.
Even in the most amicable splits, complex issues can arise regarding the time-sharing agreements between the parents, especially regarding the holidays and summer break. In most situations, an attorney is recommended to make sure your rights are appropriately protected. It is uncommon for even the most responsive set of parents to reach an agreement regrading the custody of their child(ren) without the support of an attorney. The attorneys at Tyson and Denson, PLLC are ready to assist you with all of your child custody needs, whether it be an initial time-sharing agreement or a modification to an existing agreement.





Divorce

When people decide to terminate their marriage, it is never an easy decision. Whether your divorce is simple or complex, we are here to help.
