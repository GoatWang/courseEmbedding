Kaazing Corporation Competitors and Products in the Wall Street & Technology Online Buyer's Guide   Wall Street & Technology Online Buyer's GuideKaazing CorporationKaazing Corporation Rating: 0 -  Write A Review 0888 Villa St, Suite 410,Mountain View, CA 94041About Kaazing CorporationKaazing is the company enabling the Living Web – the dynamic, interactive online world populated by applications that are always on, always connected and always real-time. The Living Web is the successor and antidote to the legacy Web.  At the heart of the legacy Web is HTTP, the 20-year old protocol whose unshakeable request-response model -- while ideal for the document-centric early Web -- is woefully unsuited to the real-time requirements of modern applications and their users. At the heart of the Living Web is Kaazing WebSocket Gateway, the world’s first high-performance Web communication platform. With Kaazing, the Living Web: ■Provides instantaneous data delivery with near-zero latency■Slashes costs for hardware, application server software, and network bandwidth usage■Allows desktop-class applications to run in browsers and on mobile devices■Slashes development costs and time-to-market■Delivers enterprise-grade scalability, reliability, resiliency and security■Is based entirely on Web standards (read more about our benefits) Kaazing’s founders were major contributors to the HTML5 WebSocket specification, the standard that underlies the Kaazing platform. Kaazing WebSocket Gateway is the world's only enterprise solution for full-duplex, high-performance communication over the Web. Kaazing is helping to push the boundaries of Web and mobile application development and deployment by making massively scalable, low latency, real-time Web applications reliable and affordableCompetitors of Kaazing CorporationAlbridge SolutionsAlbridge Solutions Inc., an affiliate of Pershing LLC, is a leading provider of enterprise solutions, custom technology and business consulting services to institutional and retail financial organizations and independent registered investment advisors.

By utilizing Kaazing’s enterprise-grade solutions, customers can securely and cost-effectively respond to digital consumers’ demand for personalized services and support via real-time web and mobile apps. With Kaazing, customers can dramatically reduce the IT costs and time associated with securely connecting systems, and can move their services from on-premise to cloud to containers without requiring changes to their applications.
Organizations of all types and sizes across a wide range of industries are increasingly moving towards hybrid cloud environments, and this shift is creating significant performance issues for CIOs and CISOs, not to mention security concerns.
