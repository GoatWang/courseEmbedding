From 2003 to 2005, Mr. Mitchum served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Sanofi-Aventis Group Japan and was Chief Executive for Aventis Pharma UK from 2000 through 2002. He served in many senior financial roles from 1985 until 1999 with Hoechst Marion Roussel (HMR) and predecessor companies and was the Corporate Controller for HMR from 1997 until 2000. Mr. Mitchum currently serves as a director for NephroGenex Inc., a company developing drugs to treat kidney disease, and is a member of its Compensation Committee and chair of its Audit Committee.
