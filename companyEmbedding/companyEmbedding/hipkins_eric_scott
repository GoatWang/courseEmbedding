About




Our corporations are being attacked. As a result, the strategy for securing their most sensitive information must be as thorough and relentless as the adversary’s pursuit of it. We harness decades of training and experience to protect corporate networks from the inside.

 









      Dept of Defense Roots    

root9B's leadership and technical teams are comprised of cybersecurity professionals who honed their craft securing DoD networks and communications. Along the way, they battled the same adversaries who represent the biggest threat to businesses and government agencies today—advanced, sophisticated nation-state cyber actors. This experience enables us to think like the adversary.

We’re trailblazers, breaking new ground with our unique approach focused on active adversary pursuit and tailored cyber operations.
