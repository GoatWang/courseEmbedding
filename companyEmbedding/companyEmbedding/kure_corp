KURE Corp, Opens First Vaporium Lounge In Gastonia North Carolina

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Jan. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- KURE Corp ("KURE"), announced today that it has successfully opened its first KURE Vaporium & Lounge in Gastonia, North Carolina on December 26, 2014.  KURE Vaporium & Lounge in Gastonia has been under construction since October of last year. It features a custom designed interior that creates a modern yet very welcoming atmosphere for its customers. 
"We wanted a feel that was modern, cool, but most importantly inviting. We set out to build something that would set us apart from all other vape shops in the country. Every aspect of KURE, beginning with our store design that includes a specialty coffee bar, numerous customer plug-in areas and really comfortable chairs, to our selection of premium e-cigarette products and juices, was thoughtfully chosen to elevate the customer experience. All of our cabinets, fixtures, and furniture were designed to give our customers a unique 'vaporium' atmosphere. We knew it was crucial to our distinction from the typical 'vape shop' to openly display our large inventory of products and showcase our large selection of KURE, Juice On Tap, branded juices at our juice bar. We are also proud to remark that the furniture was custom built in North Carolina, home of our corporate headquarters," comments Stephanie Staffieri, Chief Marketing officer for KURE.
KURE currently has three other stores in various stages of construction in the Charlotte area and one in Boca Raton, FL. These stores are scheduled for completion sometime in early spring 2015 and would boast the same attention to detail in design and customer experience. KURE and its financial partner Siskey Capital LLC, plan to aggressively expand the presence of its KURE Vaporium & Lounges throughout the U.S. within the next 24 months, including the start of one European store.
"We are very pleased with the numbers coming from our first location. It's only been less than 30 days since the store has opened and already we are seeing a significant development of customer loyalty and impressive sales growth each week", comments David Peterson, CEO of KURE. 
"This industry is facing explosive growth and consumer adoption, and we are excited to support KURE in becoming an industry leader in this space within a very short period of time", says Martin Sumichrast, Vice Chairman and co-founder of Siskey Capital LLC.

Jonathan Benjamin CEO of KURE Franchise, LLC
 


 

 




 





 


CHARLOTTE, N.C., June 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- KURE Franchise, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of KURE Corp., and one of the fastest growing companies in the premium juice and vaporium category, has named Jonathan Benjamin its new Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Benjamin will lead KURE's aggressive franchise retail store expansion throughout the United States and internationally as the KURE brand continues to set the standard in the vaping industry.
Benjamin's hiring comes just weeks after KURE Corp. announced the completion of $4.7 million in capital financing from institutional and accredited investors to help fund KURE's retail store expansion in the United States. The expansion will be accomplished primarily through franchising and a campaign will soon be under way to attract franchise candidates nationwide.
With a proven track record of more than 20 years of exceptional leadership experience, Benjamin most recently held the title of Chief Development Officer at Huddle House, where he led a national development campaign for the iconic full-service family restaurant chain, reversing its previous decline in image and store count, and significantly increasing its remodel and growth trajectory. 
Prior to Huddle House, Benjamin was Vice President of Franchise Sales with Corner Bakery Cafe where he created a new franchise sales department, and then rapidly implemented new sales systems and processes that led to record-shattering franchise growth of the fast-casual brand. Prior to his tenure at Corner Bakery Cafe, Benjamin was instrumental in leading the growth of several brands of industry-leading companies within the portfolios of Wyndham Worldwide and Global Hyatt.
"We knew we wanted a new CEO with energy, vision and a deep knowledge of franchise development to lead the business into new markets," said KURE Corp. CEO David Peterson. "We all believe Jonathan is the perfect fit for KURE during this exciting time in the evolution of the vaporium industry."
Benjamin said his immediate priority will be to assemble a team to drive and support the anticipated growth of the company. Currently, KURE has successfully opened three KURE Vaporium & Lounge stores in the Charlotte and Boca Raton areas. Three additional Vaporium & Lounge locations are scheduled to open in the Charlotte area within three months. 
"It's an honor to have the opportunity to lead the KURE team as we focus on expanding the company into new markets," Benjamin said. "I'm thrilled to be a part of a rapidly-emerging industry and to have the opportunity to help KURE establish a preeminent position in the premium juice and vaporium category."
KURE has dramatically elevated the meaning of consumer experience in the vaping industry with its unique, up-scale KURE Vaporium & Lounge, featuring "industrial-chic" decor as well as a welcoming and knowledgeable staff of "Kurators." Each location is well-stocked with the most recognized brands and products, including KURE's own premium line of vapor hardware and e-Juices.
About KURE Corp. KURE Corp. ("KURE") is a private company based in Charlotte, North Carolina,that specializes in the global distribution of vaporizing pens, e-Juices, and related accessories.

All KURE products are available online and throughout its many store locations across the United States.

KURE Corp. Weighs In On FDA Vaping Regulations

Franchise Leader Confident About Future Of Vaping Industry




May 5, 2016, 4:50pm EDT














CHARLOTTE, N.C., May 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- KURE Corp., one of the nation's fastest growing retail brands in the vaping industry, responded today to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration deeming of electronic cigarettes and vape products as "tobacco" products. KURE Corp.'s Chairman of the Board, Martin A. Sumichrast said in a statement today:
"KURE Corp. anticipated this outcome and we have been building our business the right way in anticipation of these events. The FDA regulations, such as ID verification and childproof safety caps have always been a standard business practice at KURE. We are confident that our products will stand up to regulatory and legal scrutiny and have every intention of working with FDA, as well as the federal legislative and judicial branches, to maintain our products on the market in compliance with federal and state law. We feel confident that we can meet the technical aspects of the regulations, including the good manufacturing requirements, to which we will be subject. We expect that most of our hardware and other products will fall outside the jurisdiction under which FDA regulates tobacco products."
"With respect to our products not excluded from the FDA's jurisdiction, we expect the FDA to lay out a pathway toward implementation which will give companies like KURE an opportunity to work on the steps needed to maintain compliance with the FDA's new rules. We believe for the FDA to fully establish their regulatory framework, especially on the paperwork and clinical data requirements, it will take significantly more than the two year grace period…maybe even as long as a decade. During this period, we expect to continue to work with FDA, and continue to sell well-manufactured products that comply with other reasonable state and federal guidelines."
"Ultimately, we believe that a transparent and predictable set of regulatory rules is going to improve the consistency, quality and safety of the products sold to our consumers and will enhance our business model."
"We are confident that both the judiciary and legislature will ultimately weigh in on these regulations that have been named the 'Cigarette Protection Act'. We remain in discussions with experts in Washington who will be assisting us with this FDA process so that we stay ready to engage the FDA at the appropriate time to continue to advance our business."
