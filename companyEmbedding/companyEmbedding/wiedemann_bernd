AbstractThe natural antibiotic susceptibility of 139 Escherichia coli strains (including 18 enterohemorrhagic E. coli), 73 Shigella strains (S. sonnei (n = 37), S. flexneri (n = 29), S. boydii (n = 6), S. dysenteriae (n = 1)), 23 E. vulneris, and 20 E. hermannii strains toward 71 antibiotics was examined. MICs were determined using a microdilution procedure. All examined taxa were naturally sensitive/intermediate toward tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, some penicillins (amoxycillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin [with and without tazobactam], mezlocillin, azlocillin), cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, quinolones, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol and were naturally resistant/intermediate toward benzylpenicillin, oxacillin, macrolides, lincosamides, glycopeptides, rifampicin, and fusidic acid.No differences in natural antibiotic susceptibility were seen between enterohemorrhagic and other E. coli strains. Likewise, with one exception, no significant differences in natural antibiotic susceptibility were seen either among the Shigella subgroups or between Shigella and E. coli. The natural population of S. flexneri was slightly more susceptible to chloramphenicol than the natural populations of other taxa within the Shigella-E. coli complex. E. vulneris and E. hermannii showed susceptibility patterns to many antibiotics similar to Shigella and E. coli, but there were other antibiotics toward which there were significant differences in natural susceptibility. E. vulneris and E. hermannii were less susceptible to nitrofurantoin and slightly more susceptible to several aminoglycosides than E. coli and Shigella. E. hermannii was the only species that was naturally resistant/intermediate to ticarcillin and amoxycillin (DIN standard). The addition of clavulanic acid to the latter resulted in a decrease of seven twofold dilution steps (E. vulneris: four twofold dilution steps, E. coli/Shigella: two twofold dilution steps) of the MICs of the natural population. With the exception of cefoperazone and cefepime, E. hermannii was more susceptible to cephalosporins than strains of the other species. E. vulneris was the species most susceptible to ticarcillin and the only species that was highly resistant to fosfomycin (MIC > 256 μg/mL). The antibiotic susceptibility to fosfomycin was also unique for E. hermannii (MIC 32–128 μg/mL), whereas the natural populations of E. coli and Shigella showed lower MIC values.The data of this study represent an assessment of the natural susceptibility of strains of Escherichia spp. and Shigella subgroups to a wide range of antibiotics. These databases can be used for the validation of antibiotic susceptibility test results of Escherichia spp. and shigellae. The conformity of the natural antibiotic susceptibility test results not only among the Shigella subgroups but also between Shigella and E. coli support the status of Shigella as a subgroup of the species E. coli.

Long term outcomes of inappropriate antibiotic therapy for upper urinary tract infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae: a retrospective cohort studyInbal Greenhouse, Frida Babushkin, Talya Finn, Zvi Shimoni, Moran Aliman, Ronen Ben-Ami, Regev CohenDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2017.07.011Publication stage: In Press Accepted ManuscriptPreviewFull-Text HTMLPDFxTo evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes of different antimicrobial treatment options for upper urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae.Relation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutations at katG315 and inhA-15 with drug resistance profile, genetic background, and clustering in ArgentinaJohana Monteserin, Roxana Paul, Cecilia Latini, Norberto Simboli, Noemí Yokobori, Lucrecia Delfederico, Beatriz López, Viviana RitaccoDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2017.07.010Publication stage: In Press Accepted ManuscriptPreviewFull-Text HTMLPDFxWe analyzed 362 isoniazid-resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis obtained countrywide for the presence of mutation at katG315 and inhA-15 in relation to genotype, pattern of phenotypic resistance to other drugs, and ability to spread. We found the following mutation frequencies: katG315MUT/inhA-15wt 53.0%, katG315wt/inhA-15MUT 27.4%, katG315wt/inhA-15wt 19.3%, and katG315MUT/inhA-15MUT only 0.3%. Mutation at katG315 associated with the LAM superfamily; mutation at inhA-15 associated with the S family and the T1 Tuscany genotype; the combination katG315wt/inhA-15wt associated with the T1 Ghana genotype.Comparing Three Treponemal Tests for Syphilis ScreeningSean A. Buono, Hilary A. Godwin, Nicole M. GreenDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2017.07.008Publication stage: In Press Accepted ManuscriptPreviewFull-Text HTMLPDFxWe compared the performance and ease of use for three high-throughput treponemal immunoassays: Phoenix Biotech Trep-Sure Total Antibody EIA, Siemens ADVIA® Centaur Syphilis Assay, and DiaSorin LIAISON® Treponema Assay. One thousand serum samples submitted for routine screening were used in this study. Each assay demonstrated comparable sensitivity, specificity, and percent agreement (98–100%) compared with Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA). Thus, treponemal immunoassays are an acceptable alternative for syphilis screening or confirmatory testing.In Vitro Potency and Fungicidal Activity of CD101, a Novel Echinocandin, Against Recent Clinical Isolates of Candida sppDanielle Hall, Robert Bonifas, Lauretta Stapert, Mary Thwaites, Dean L. Shinabarger, Chris M. PillarDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2017.07.007Publication stage: In Press Accepted ManuscriptPreviewFull-Text HTMLPDFxCandida infections vary in severity and manifestation. Common infections include invasive bloodstream infections among hospitalized/immunocompromised patients and vulvovaginal candidiasis among women. Echinocandins and azoles are commonly utilized to treat Candida infections, although echinocandin use has been restricted to indications amenable to once-daily IV administration. CD101, a novel echinocandin with a long plasma half-life and enhanced stability, is in development for once-weekly IV administration for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis.         Serologic responses of 42 MERS-coronavirus-infected patients according to the disease severityJae-Hoon Ko, Marcel A. Müller, Hyeri Seok, Ga Eun Park, Ji Yeon Lee, Sun Young Cho, Young Eun Ha, Jin Yang Baek, So Hyun Kim, Ji-Man Kang, Yae-Jean Kim, Ik Joon Jo, Chi Ryang Chung, Myong-Joon Hahn, Christian Drosten, Cheol-In Kang, Doo Ryeon Chung, Jae-Hoon Song, Eun-Suk Kang, Kyong Ran PeckDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2017.07.006Publication stage: In Press Accepted ManuscriptPreviewFull-Text HTMLPDFxWe evaluated serologic response of 42 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-infected patients according to four severity groups: asymptomatic infection (group 0), symptomatic infection without pneumonia (group 1), pneumonia without respiratory failure (group 2), and pneumonia progressing to respiratory failure (group 3). None of the group 0 patients showed seroconversion, while the seroconversion rate gradually increased with increasing disease severity (0.0%, 60.0%, 93.8%, and 100% in group 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively; P = 0.001).
