Our daughters and son-in-law has purchased furniture from Woodcrafters multiple times. Our oldest grandson has purchased from Woodcrafters. We've all had a good experience with Woodcrafters Galleries. The staff is friendly and helpful. The products are of high quality and we are now interested in a new recliner and we're going to Woodcrafters Galleries.August Mooncindy.meador.3 ratedUmm They need a new menu! They need to try harder to keep the food fresh. When the food is fresh it is good. But at certain times eww its bad, tough just eww. The water is horrible. and the drinks are not much better. For the price of the food and the way the owner runs the people the food should be better and stay fresher. They are really going to have to step up in order to compete with other food places in Murray.Mary's BistroCindy S. ratedGreat restaurant, great prices.  They offer breakfast full time, also offer a place lunch or you can order off of the menu.  They also offer fine steaks and seafood.  Great food, Great Atmosphere and large servings at a good price.Mary's BistroDawn O. ratedGreat food.. Great service AND lovely atmosphere... Not bad on the pocketbook either...  Well Done!!!  Mary and Company!!!!

							How to Locate Your Murray Model Number						



							If you’re reading this, you probably need some help finding the model number on your Murray product. Murray prints their model number on a sticker or etched plate. So you’ll want to start by trying to find that. If you've already found that, you’re ready to take your model number and start ordering parts. If not, check out some of our suggestions on finding the nameplate below:

If you have a Murray riding lawnmower, then look under the seat for the nameplate. 

If you have a walk-behind mower, check the mower’s deck, usually they place the nameplate in the center of it.

Our Customer Service team is always happy to help you search for your model number, so feel free to call us at (866) 802-6383 if you have trouble finding your tool’s information.







							Need a Hand with Your Murray Repair?						

							Our great relationship with Murray means that you’ll get the best quality OEM parts from our warehouse and the best expert advice from our technicians. So if you need a little help replacing the lawn mower blade on your Murray 30503x11A or repairing an auger shaft on a Murray 1694997, we have you covered with both a big stock of replacement parts and expert advice. 

We encourage visitors to browse our parts lists and Repair Forum to see what we can offer you. We’re confident that with our resources, we can help you through even the toughest situation.
