New Entities

                Naming Capitol Services as Registered Agent on new entity filings is easy. Clients may utilize our Corporate Services department to file the formation or qualification documents, in which case our Client Service Representative will take care of everything. Clients who choose to file documents on their own should first contact our Registered Agent department to verify state address information and obtain any necessary agent signatures, as well as provide their contact information.          
          
Change of Agent

          Capitol Services will prepare the documents to convert representation from an existing agent, and we will pay all required state filing fees to effect the change. As part of our Change of Agent process, we conduct a status check to verify that the entity is in good standing in every jurisdiction where we will be providing representation.
          


E-mail Notification and Courier Delivery

            When an entity is served with legal process, we provide courier delivery of the documents to the primary designated contact.

Profitability & Performance
It is critical to cut through the often conflicting perspectives about your payment product portfolio to truly determine its performance. Functional areas such as Marketing, Finance, and Risk may offer varying views about that performance, but Capital Services brings everything into clarity with ViPRSM, our Vintage Profitability Reporting system. It provides unparalleled visibility into account-level profitability so that you can see what is working in your portfolio and make informed decisions.
ViPRSM enables you to:

Identify and flexibly segment your portfolio composition
Determine when an account vintage will turn profitable
Develop pro formas
Drill down to profitability drivers
View loss reserves



Modeling & Scoring
Our proprietary, market-proven scorecards drive your payment profitability. They accurately identify who is most likely to utilize your payment products and improve your portfolio's performance. Our Data Scientists developed these proprietary scorecards by analyzing massive volumes of customer, payment, and portfolio performance data. Their technology and algorithms ensure precise, consistent segmentation, modeling, and forecasting.

What is an Independent Registered Investment Adivsor (RIA)?

An RIA is in the business of giving advice.
An independent RIA is not owned by another company or institution.
An RIA has a Fiduciary Responsibility to their clients. They are legally required to put the client’s interest first. This is a higher standard that what is required of brokerage firms, which is the suitability of an investment for an individual client.
An RIA is typically compensated by fees for advice, rather than commissions on buying & selling.
An RIA is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the state in which they operate.
