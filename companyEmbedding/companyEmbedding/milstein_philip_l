Early life and education[edit]
Milstein was born to Jewish family[1] in Manhattan and raised in the Bronx.[2] In 1919, his father Morris Milstein, an immigrant from Russia and who started out as a floor scraper, founded the Circle Floor Company, Inc., a wood flooring company,[3] and in 1945, the Mastic Tile Company, a vinyl floor tile manufacturing company.[4]
In 1941, Milstein graduated from New York University. He went to work for Mastic Tile becoming president in 1955 while his brother, Paul Milstein, went to work for Circle Floor becoming president in 1961.[5][2] In 1959, Mastic Tile, was sold to Ruberoid, for $24 million.[5] Circle Floor expanded into floor tiles, acoustical ceilings, and drywall construction[5] and won contracts to install flooring in several New York landmarks including Rockefeller Center, the United Nations Building,[2] and both John F Kennedy Airport and LaGuardia Airport.[6] By 1966, Circle Floor was the nation's largest subcontractor of floor, wall and ceiling construction.[5]
Career[edit]
In the late 1950s, Milstein and his brother Paul founded Milstein Properties and branched out into real estate.[1] Paul was the aggressive frontman and deal-maker while Seymour was the contemplative finance person who preferred to work behind the scenes.[7] This difference is temperament led them to be coined "the diplomat and the barbarian."[8] In 1964, they completed their first large real estate development, the 34-story, 680-unit Dorchester Towers on the Upper West Side.[5][2][1][9] Also in 1964, they sold Circle Floor to Kinney National Company (then run by Steve Ross) for $15 million with Paul remaining as manager of the unit until 1971.[5]
In 1974, the Milsteins entered the mining and energy sectors;[10] and acquired United Brands, the parent company of Chiquita Bananas,[10] after the suicide of its owner Eli M. Black.[5] In 1981, the Milsteins stripped the New York Biltmore Hotel down to its steel structure and reclad the frame in granite - despite the building's landmark status and concerted protests by preservationists - in order to fashion a new headquarters for Bank of America.[11][5] In 1986, the Milsteins acquired the Emigrant Savings Bank,[10] which they built into the largest privately owned bank in the country.[12][10] In 1986, they founded Liberty Cable Co.[10]
In 1989, the Milstein family acquired Douglas Elliman-Gibbons & Ives residential real estate brokerage from Edwin J. Gould and Lawrence O. McGauley.[3] They hired new brokers and expanded its geography from the Upper East Side to the entire city.[3] At the time of purchase Douglas Elliman had 10% of the New York City brokerage market and managed 15,000 apartments. His nephew, Howard Milstein served as Chairman for ten years and built the brand to a 40% share of the brokerage market and over 50,000 apartments managed. Douglas Elliman was sold to Insignia Financial Group in two transactions for a total sum of $85 million:[3] the management division was sold in 1995[13] and the brokerage division was sold in 1999.[10][3] Howard and his father Paul did not inform Seymour about the transaction indicating that they were not required to do so since their side of the family had an aggregate 60% ownership of the partnership (20% by Paul Milstein and 10% with each of Paul's children);[8] this began the deterioration of the relationship between the two elder brothers eventually leading to litigation and the unwinding of their long business partnership.[8]
Through various family controlled entities, the Milsteins built or bought residential properties with more than 50,000 apartments, 8,000 hotel rooms and 20,000,000 square feet (1,900,000 m2) of office space.[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
Milstein funded the Vivian and Seymour Milstein Family Heart Center at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital.[14]
Personal life and death[edit]
In 1945, Milstein married Vivian Leiner.[4] They had two children: Constance Milstein is a general partner at Milstein Properties[15] and is divorced from Count Jean-Christophe de La Haye Saint Hilaire;[16] and Philip L. Milstein,[4] the president of Emigrant Savings Bank[17] and spouse of Cheryl Sue Glicker.[18]
In 2001, Seymour Milstein died of pneumonia.[4] Upon his death, the remaining partnership agreements between him and his brother were unwound.[19] The ownership structure underlying all the partnerships was set up with Paul and Seymour each with a 20% share; and the six nieces and nephews (the four children of Paul and the two children of Seymour) with 10% each.[19] An acrimonious legal tussle resulted between the two sides of the family with Paul's side claiming majority control since the sum of their interest was 60%.

Early life and education[edit]
Milstein was born to Jewish family[1] in Manhattan and raised in the Bronx.[2] In 1919, his father Morris Milstein, an immigrant from Russia and who started out as a floor scraper, founded the Circle Floor Company, Inc., a wood flooring company,[3] and in 1945, the Mastic Tile Company, a vinyl floor tile manufacturing company.[4]
In 1941, Milstein graduated from New York University. He went to work for Mastic Tile becoming president in 1955 while his brother, Paul Milstein, went to work for Circle Floor becoming president in 1961.[5][2] In 1959, Mastic Tile, was sold to Ruberoid, for $24 million.[5] Circle Floor expanded into floor tiles, acoustical ceilings, and drywall construction[5] and won contracts to install flooring in several New York landmarks including Rockefeller Center, the United Nations Building,[2] and both John F Kennedy Airport and LaGuardia Airport.[6] By 1966, Circle Floor was the nation's largest subcontractor of floor, wall and ceiling construction.[5]
Career[edit]
In the late 1950s, Milstein and his brother Paul founded Milstein Properties and branched out into real estate.[1] Paul was the aggressive frontman and deal-maker while Seymour was the contemplative finance person who preferred to work behind the scenes.[7] This difference is temperament led them to be coined "the diplomat and the barbarian."[8] In 1964, they completed their first large real estate development, the 34-story, 680-unit Dorchester Towers on the Upper West Side.[5][2][1][9] Also in 1964, they sold Circle Floor to Kinney National Company (then run by Steve Ross) for $15 million with Paul remaining as manager of the unit until 1971.[5]
In 1974, the Milsteins entered the mining and energy sectors;[10] and acquired United Brands, the parent company of Chiquita Bananas,[10] after the suicide of its owner Eli M. Black.[5] In 1981, the Milsteins stripped the New York Biltmore Hotel down to its steel structure and reclad the frame in granite - despite the building's landmark status and concerted protests by preservationists - in order to fashion a new headquarters for Bank of America.[11][5] In 1986, the Milsteins acquired the Emigrant Savings Bank,[10] which they built into the largest privately owned bank in the country.[12][10] In 1986, they founded Liberty Cable Co.[10]
In 1989, the Milstein family acquired Douglas Elliman-Gibbons & Ives residential real estate brokerage from Edwin J. Gould and Lawrence O. McGauley.[3] They hired new brokers and expanded its geography from the Upper East Side to the entire city.[3] At the time of purchase Douglas Elliman had 10% of the New York City brokerage market and managed 15,000 apartments. His nephew, Howard Milstein served as Chairman for ten years and built the brand to a 40% share of the brokerage market and over 50,000 apartments managed. Douglas Elliman was sold to Insignia Financial Group in two transactions for a total sum of $85 million:[3] the management division was sold in 1995[13] and the brokerage division was sold in 1999.[10][3] Howard and his father Paul did not inform Seymour about the transaction indicating that they were not required to do so since their side of the family had an aggregate 60% ownership of the partnership (20% by Paul Milstein and 10% with each of Paul's children);[8] this began the deterioration of the relationship between the two elder brothers eventually leading to litigation and the unwinding of their long business partnership.[8]
Through various family controlled entities, the Milsteins built or bought residential properties with more than 50,000 apartments, 8,000 hotel rooms and 20,000,000 square feet (1,900,000 m2) of office space.[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
Milstein funded the Vivian and Seymour Milstein Family Heart Center at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital.[14]
Personal life and death[edit]
In 1945, Milstein married Vivian Leiner.[4] They had two children: Constance Milstein is a general partner at Milstein Properties[15] and is divorced from Count Jean-Christophe de La Haye Saint Hilaire;[16] and Philip L. Milstein,[4] the president of Emigrant Savings Bank[17] and spouse of Cheryl Sue Glicker.[18]
In 2001, Seymour Milstein died of pneumonia.[4] Upon his death, the remaining partnership agreements between him and his brother were unwound.[19] The ownership structure underlying all the partnerships was set up with Paul and Seymour each with a 20% share; and the six nieces and nephews (the four children of Paul and the two children of Seymour) with 10% each.[19] An acrimonious legal tussle resulted between the two sides of the family with Paul's side claiming majority control since the sum of their interest was 60%.

All in the Families: Milsteins, Tisches Hand Down a Tradition of Giving

			By Amanda Ostrove • 10/24/13 6:34pm
































Meet the Milsteins
Big-time politicians, real-estate honchos, media moguls and finance billionaires: they all do their part to help the city. But it is especially heartwarming when philanthropy is a family affair. The Milsteins and the Tisches have long histories of charitable endeavors. These families have given for generations, and will continue to do so for generations to come. They donate to medical research and care and the arts. They feed the hungry and support the underprivileged. And both families have provided sustained contributions to two of  the city’s most prestigious universities: Columbia University and New York University. Here are the Milstein and Tisch philanthropic family trees.


Tracing back to Seymour and Vivian Milstein, the Milstein family tree has a long-standing tradition of philanthropy. The late Seymour, who passed away in 2001, and his wife. Vivian, were dedicated to scientific advancement. That interest can be traced back to Vivian’s father, Joshua H. Lenier, a neurologist and the first practicing psychiatrist in Bronx county. Vivian and Seymour had a special interest in supporting New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia Medical Center. Mr. Milstein served as chairman of the board from 1989-96, and following that served as chairman emeritus until his death five years later. The power couple also established the Milstein Awards, “a pinnacle of scientific achievement,” which is annually presented by the International Cytokine and Interferon Society. The awards honor excellence in the interferon and cytokine research field at all levels. That includes a Young Investigator Award, which honors those who have made an impact early in their careers, a Travel Award, which honors those all over the world and an Award for Excellence, which honors highly esteemed Laureates.   Vivian and her children have seen that this legacy of supporting the field of medicine lives on.
Their son Philip and daughter Constance founded and act as principals at Ogden CAP Properties, LLC. Constance Milstein is extremely philanthropically inclined. She has carried on her family’s tradition of aiding scientific advancement, not only through New York-Presbyterian, but also through other channels. She has been a trustee at New York-Presbyterian since 2000, serving on many significant committees. Constance and her husband, Jehan-Christophe de La Haye Saint Hilaire, are longtime benefactors of the American Heart Association and she serves on the board of directors of CURE (Citizens United in Research for Epilepsy), a nonprofit dedicated to finding a cure for the disease. Most notably, Constance began a bakery with the sole intention of supporting philanthropic causes. What started in Mt. Kisco as Connie’s Bakery & General Store, in which all net profits went to six charities each year, has evolved to Connie’s Baking Company, a bakery based in Washington and found online, in which 100 percent of the donations go toward supporting men and women serving in the military. Abigail Elbaum, Constance’s daughter, serves on the board of Lincoln Square and heart center steering committee at New York-Presbyterian.
Philip Milstein and his wife, Cheryl, both attended Columbia University.  Philip attended Columbia College and his wife graduated from Barnard. They are both very active alumni. Their most-recent donation involved $20 million for a new medical and graduate education building. Both believe in the importance of giving to their alma mater and continuing the family’s tradition of supporting science. Cheryl said, “I am so proud to be a strong link in the Barnard College chain. It is a place that shapes young, bright women into strong, confident, well-intentioned leaders in all fields and does so regardless of their socioeconomic background. It is an honor to give these incredible and impressive Barnard women the chance at succeeding by allowing them access to the best education in an environment that promotes confidence, encourages strong ideas and opinions and empowers women.” The family not only gives to their alma mater and the field of medicine, but also to the arts. Tamar Podell, senior vice president of planning and development at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, said, “Cheryl and Phil have been extraordinary partners with Lincoln Center on any number of initiatives, including the Atrium, our 50th anniversary celebration, the Lincoln Center real-estate galas and many other successful efforts that shine a light on Lincoln Center. They are passionate, committed and generous in advancing the arts, never hesitating to roll up their sleeves when it can make a difference.”


Their eldest children, Meredith and Joshua, followed in their parents’ footsteps and continue support of Columbia College. They are also involved in the 92nd Street Y’s Emerging Leadership Council. Joshua, class of Columbia ’10, is also an entrepreneur. He is the CEO and cofounder of a start-up, Doormates, which has refocused its brand on MommyNearest products, which its website says is for “parents on the go.”
Toby, class of Barnard ’14, is already an esteemed philanthropist in her own right. All proceeds from her company, Wear It Don’t Bear It, go to Bereaved Parents of the USA, a nonprofit that offers support to grief-stricken families attempting to rebuild their lives after the loss of a family member. Toby wants to establish the connections between violence and the popularity of the gun culture in fashion. She said, “I couldn’t reconcile Columbine and Rihanna’s Chanel gun earrings. I couldn’t reconcile Virginia Tech and Karolina Kurkova’s gun dress. I can’t make that work. If you let gun violence persist and gun fashion without specific messaging to continue unchallenged, I think that’s a problem.” Wear It Don’t Bear It offers a solution. She knows it won’t happen overnight, but she feels strongly that it is her generation who must stand up and do something about the rise of violence in American culture: “In the ‘60s and ‘70s, they had the war which led to the SDS (Students for a Democratic Society) and the largest student strike in American history in response to the Kent State shootings. This is ours. This is Tucson. This is Fort Hood. This is Aurora. This is Sandy Hook. And I want to do something about it.”
Laurence, a freshman at Yale University, has already gotten his feet wet in the philanthropic world.  Toby said, “He was recognized for his immense volunteer contributions and leadership skills by the Scarsdale Rotary Club for not only founding Scarsdale High School’s student chapter of charity, Water, which he launched as a high school freshman, but also for its great success in raising money to build wells in third-world countries.”


***

Meet the Tisches
The Milsteins are to Columbia as the Tisches are to N.Y.U. Everyone in New York, and many across the world, has heard of the Tisch family. At the very least, they know the name behind N.Y.U.’s prestigious Tisch School of the Arts. The philanthropic roots of the Tisches can be traced to brothers Laurence A. and Preston Robert “Bob” Tisch, who were just two Brooklyn boys who made it big. With the start of a single hotel in 1946 in Lakewood N.J., Bob and Larry Tisch founded Loews Corporation, which is now made up of five subsidiaries: CNA Financial Corporation, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., HighMount Exploration and Production, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners and Loews Hotels & Resorts.
In 1982, the Tisch brothers made a gift to N.Y.U.’s School of Performing Arts, which then became the Tisch School of the Arts. Several years later, in 1989, the university hospital was renamed as Tisch Hospital. Since 1998, James “Jim” Tisch, Jonathan Tisch and Andrew Tisch have headed the Loews Corporation together. The three Tisch men, along with cousins Laurie, Steven, Tom and Dan, and their mothers, Joan Hyman Tisch and Wilma “Billie” Stein Tisch, have assured that their philanthropic tradition has continued, even after the passing of Laurence in 2003 and Preston in 2005.
Bob’s wife, Joan, has carried on the Tisch tradition regarding medical advancement that began with the establishment of the N.Y.U Tisch Hospital. Joan’s husband struggled with a rare form of brain cancer and eventually passed away from the disease. Joan ensured that his legacy would live on by donating $10 million to the Brain Tumor Center at Duke University Medical Center and the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dr. Henry Friedman, the deputy director of The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center, said that the donations from the Tisch family have been “transformative” in nature: “They have enabled a nationally prominent brain center to become an internationally leading brain-tumor center.” According to Dr. Friedman, the donation expanded all aspects of work done at the cancer center, including basic research, translational research and  clinical research. Additionally, in 2011, the Joan H. Tisch Center for Women’s Health, specializing in medical services for women, was founded at N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center. Dr. Friedman said, “[The Tisches] are in tremendous placement in social strata, yet they live with immense moral conscience.”
Steven, the film producer responsible for Forrest Gump and Risky Business, and a stakeholder in the N.F.L.’s New York Giants, like his siblings, gives proof to Dr. Friedman’s words. Through the Steve Tisch Foundation, he has generously contributed his time and resources to organizations such as The H.E.L.P. Group, ERAS Center, The Women’s Cancer Research Foundation and the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. He sits on the board of advisors at the Tisch School of the Arts and is on the board of trustees of The Geffen Theatre in Los Angeles, The Sundance Institute, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art and The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Cancer Center at Duke University.
Jonathan serves as cochairman of the board and chairman of Loews Hotels, one of the three presidents of Loews Corporation. In the past year, with his wife, Lizzie, Jonathan has given a $10 million pledge to construct a new gallery within the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and $40 million for his alma mater, Tufts, to endow the University College of Citizenship and Public Service, and helps pay for interdisciplinary courses, fellowships and programs. Jonathan said, “My wife, Lizzie, and I are in a fortunate position to support causes and institutions that represent our passions and interests. Ranging from the world of art, fashion and culture at The Costume Institute at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, to education at Tufts University in Boston, University of Michigan and New York University, as well as support for our neighbors through Citymeals- on-Wheels, we hope and trust that we are enriching lives while understanding our responsibility to the community.”
Laurie, the only Tisch woman of her generation, has made philanthropy her life’s mission. Founder of the Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Fund, with the mission to improve access and opportunity for all New Yorkers, Laurie said, “How do you get past the trap of having circumstances of birth or even your zip code determine your level of education, health care, food choices and exposure to arts and culture? That’s why I started my foundation and built the mission around the principles of access and opportunity. For me, it’s about finding strategies that help to level the playing field for New Yorkers.” This year, the fund has focused on healthy food initiatives, even making a $15 million pledge to healthy food initiatives. Laurie said, “Communities plagued by high rates of poverty, poor education and unemployment are often the same neighborhoods where these diseases are rampant and access to healthy foods is limited.”
Wilma “Billie” Tisch, Laurence’s wife, has been dedicated to Jewish causes. She is a life trustee of the United Jewish Appeal  of New York, where her late husband is still an honorary officer. UJA has strengthened Jewish communities in New York, Israel and around the globe. Billie was also deeply involved with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, a Jewish humanitarian assistance group. Additionally, Billie is a trustee of her alma mater, Skidmore College, and the September 11th Fund.
Andrew, who serves as cochairman of the board and chairman of the executive committee and one of three presidents of the Loews Corporation, along with his wife, Ann, gave $35 million to Cornell to endow professorships across academic departments this year. He said, “Being involved in the community has always part of the family DNA.  My wife, Ann, and I support a number of educational organizations whether the Young Women’s Leadership Foundation or Cornell or Washington University or other great institutions because we believe that education is the great equalizer.”
Thomas is a chancellor at Brown University and a managing partner of Four Partners, a private investment firm. He and his wife, Alice, continue his family’s tradition at N.Y.U., as both serve as trustees at N.Y.U. Langone. Alice also heads KiDS of N.Y.U, a program that supports children’s services at the hospital through community service and advocacy. She also serves as vice president and executive committee member of the Jewish Board of Family and Children’s Services, an organization that provides mental health and social services in the New York City and Westchester areas.
James serves as the CEO and president, making up one third of the office of the president at Loews Corporation. This year, James, who also serves as chairman of the board at WNET, and his wife, Merryl, have pledged $15 million to be donated over the next 10 years to WNET.org. This donation is meant to inspire, enrich and celebrate the tristate community by creating the Tisch WNET Studios at the Lincoln Center. Merryl also serves as chancellor of the New York State Board of Regents, where her role is to support local innovations in the state’s highest performing school districts as well as giving greater support to struggling districts and as cochair of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, where her son Benjamin also serves as a director.
Daniel serves as a partner on the board of trustees at N.Y.U. He and wife, Bonnie, have donated to what is now called the Tisch MS Research Center. Dr. Saud A. Saduq, the director and senior research scientist at what was formerly known as Multiple Sclerosis Research Center of New York, said, “We are confident the Tisch MS Research Center of New York will continue to perform groundbreaking experiments and provide the rapid progress we strive for in accelerating our approach to finding the cause of MS.” Like Daniel’s mother, Billie, the couple has also been known to support Jewish causes, as they have given support to Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and UJA, where Bonnie sits on the board of directors.

The Milstein Fight: Philip Sues Howard for Diverted Funds

			By Andrew Rice • 09/25/00 12:00am































The nasty power struggle between cousins Philip and Howard Milstein over their family’s real estate and banking empire is getting uglier, with new allegations that Howard Milstein used funds from family assets he controlled-the Douglas Elliman residential real estate brokerage and the Milford Plaza Hotel-to finance ventures into sports, real estate and the Internet.
On the heels of a court-ordered audit of Douglas Elliman’s books, which found more than $90 million in interest-free loans from the company to Howard Milstein’s private ventures, Philip Milstein has asked a Delaware judge to strip his cousin of ownership of the businesses, placing them in the hands of a family trust.
 The lawsuit marks a dramatic escalation of the family feud, which has paralyzed one of the city’s richest families, with holdings worth a reported $5 billion. And along with recent filings in another case over the Milford Plaza, it gives the fullest answer yet to the questions that have lingered over the whole mess since it burst into public view last spring: What caused a long-standing division of power between the two sides of this powerful New York family, headed by brothers Paul and Seymour Milstein, to break down? And why now, with the family’s investments more profitable than ever?


 Philip Milstein, Seymour’s son, says he has gone to war to keep Howard Milstein from doing to the rest of the family businesses what he did to Douglas Elliman. Philip Milstein says Howard Milstein has been attempting to liquidate pieces of the family assets he controls, freeing himself and his younger brother, Edward, to pursue their own business ventures. Howard Milstein sold Douglas Elliman last year for about $70 million, a substantial profit-but not with the permission of the company’s stockholders, all family members, and not before he used the company as a piggy bank, Philip Milstein says. An audit “confirmed Philip Milstein’s growing suspicion that the defendants had been engaged in systematic mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, self-dealing and appropriation of money belonging to the companies for their private ventures,” according to a complaint filed in Delaware Chancery Court in July. A lengthy auditor’s report, filed along with the lawsuit, purports to show that Howard Milstein raided the cash-rich business to finance, among other investments, his personal stake in the New York Islanders hockey franchise, his unsuccessful bids to buy the NFL’s Cleveland Browns and Washington Redskins, and his purchase of a half-share of the Chicago commercial brokerage, Miglin-Beitler.
 Howard Milstein subsequently renamed the Chicago brokerage Douglas Elliman-Beitler and expanded into New York, operating free of his family’s control.
 On paper, all the loans appear to have been paid back, though the auditors said Douglas Elliman’s bookkeeping was so sloppy that it was impossible to know for sure. Philip Milstein is not claiming that any money was stolen. But he has now turned his attention to the Milford Plaza Hotel, where he expects auditors to find similar “misconduct,” according to an affidavit filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.


 “None of the allegations are true,” said James Quinn, an attorney for Howard Milstein. Mr. Quinn has yet to file an answer to Philip Milstein’s complaint and said he had no further comment. In response to previous suits, Howard Milstein has pointed to the flush balance sheets of the companies he controls, and has contended that Seymour and Philip Milstein have thwarted his efforts to sell, develop or otherwise profitably dispose of family assets.
 The lawsuits, he suggests, are part of an effort to smear him and gain leverage in an overall dispute over the control of family assets, including a property on 42nd Street at Eighth Avenue, and Emigrant Savings Bank, which Philip Milstein heads. Howard Milstein and his father, Paul, are suing to have him removed for alleged mismanagement.
 Paul and Seymour Milstein have been meeting periodically to work out a “global resolution” to the disputes, according to court documents. Several sources close to the Milstein family say John Zuccotti-a former deputy Mayor and family lawyer who is now a top developer himself-is mediating the talks.


 Recent developments, however, make a resolution look unlikely. “You may not realize this,” Howard Milstein wrote in a June 21 letter to his cousin, “but two can play the same game you’re playing.”
 Philip Milstein says his suspicions were first aroused in the spring of 1998, when Howard stopped passing on financial information about Douglas Elliman. He asked his cousin to call a board meeting and was ignored. At the end of the year, he says, the company failed to distribute profits to its shareholders.
 The real estate market had just entered its current bull cycle, and Douglas Elliman had netted a profit of $10 million for the year. At the same time, “no doubt related to the increase in available cash,” Philip Milstein’s suit says, Howard and Edward Milstein began chasing their owner’s-box dreams. In February, 1998, they headed a group which bought the Islanders for $195 million. (He unloaded the team this year for a $5 million loss.) Through the spring and summer of 1998, they chased the Browns. Frustrated in Cleveland, they turned their attention late in the year to the Redskins, mounting a league-record $800 million bid for the team.
 After Douglas Elliman was sold, Philip Milstein sued to get access to the company’s books. A Delaware judge ruled that his cousin had “stonewalled” him and ordered the books opened to a forensic audit.
 Auditors from the firm of FTI/Kahn found that while Howard and Edward Milstein were chasing sports teams, they had advanced $24.6 million to the Islanders, $1.2 million to Cleveland Sports Ventures and $5.1 million to Washington Sports Ventures, all from Douglas Elliman accounts.
 Hats and Vases
 The company’s chief financial officer and its office manager were sent to work on these and other projects, the lawsuit says. Everything from travel expenses to Redskins hats to Tiffany vases-wedding presents for Islanders’ players Ken Belanger, Jason Dawe, Scott Lachance and Tom Chorske-were charged to Douglas Elliman, company records show.
 According to the audit, Howard Milstein also loaned company money for a number of other personal business ventures: $23 million for various real estate developments; $5.4 million in venture capital financing for two Internet start-ups, News Alert and Data.bid; $4.8 million toward a now-stalled redevelopment initiative in Niagara Falls N.Y., along with $300,000 for a Boxing Hall of Fame he plans to put there; and $1.5 million towards Douglas Elliman–Beitler.
 Mr. Milstein put a law firm, Wiel, Gotshal and Manges, on a $10,000 a month retainer, though it seems the firm never did any work for Douglas Elliman (before defending the company against Philip Milstein’s lawsuits), according to the audit. And the audit detailed $5.2 million in rent and lease payments on behalf of another law firm, Constantine and Partners, along with $200,000 in payments for unspecified legal services. Mr. Milstein’s wife is a founding partner in the firm. “It is unclear,” the auditors wrote, “how or if these obligations were retired.”
 In fact, the auditors said, “unusual and unconventional accounting practices” made it difficult to figure out exactly who owed what to whom. Even if all the interest-free loans were repaid, however, the auditors estimate that Douglas Elliman could have made $10 million simply by investing the money in the stock market.
 To put the size of the loans in perspective, the auditors noted that over three years, Douglas Elliman paid out a total of $90 million to the brothers’ private ventures. It spent $68 million on everything else.
 Howard and Edward Milstein’s pursuit of the Washington Redskins collapsed in April 1999, amid questions about the solidity of their finances. Around the same time, the brothers’ debts to Douglas Elliman reached about $15 million.
 That May, Howard Milstein closed the deal to sell Douglas Elliman to the Insignia Financial Group. Philip Milstein contends that his cousins lied to Insignia and perjured themselves in forms filed with the Delaware Secretary of State by stating that shareholders had agreed to the sale. He notes that the brokerage has seen a 25 percent increase in revenues since it was sold, and wonders whether it could have secured a higher price if shopped around longer. The sale, the lawsuit says, “had everything to do with [the] need to raise cash quickly.”
 Afterwards, Howard Milstein held onto several million dollars, the auditors said-including Philip Milstein’s $10 million cut-which they continued to plow into their own ventures. In November, the amount of the outstanding loans reached close to $16 million. That’s when Philip Milstein filed suit to get access to the books.
 “In the months subsequent to [Philip Milstein] filing suit in Delaware in November 1999, a novel event for the partnership occurred,” the report said. “The outstanding balances due from the [Howard Milstein] ventures to the partnership were reduced as a result of funds received from unknown sources.”
 Philip Milstein isn’t sure of the source of the funds, but he’s trying to find out. If the Delaware lawsuit goes forward, Howard Milstein’s numerous private ventures will likely be subjected to audits themselves as part of the discovery process. And back in New York, Philip Milstein has sued to get access to the books of the Milford Plaza Hotel.
 Philip Milstein has been trying to get a look at the hotel’s financial records for months, first by asking, then by suing. A scathing exchange of letters over the summer provides an unexpurgated view of the rancor between the two sides of the family.
 Nasty Letters
 “I am sorry you find it necessary to harass us with useless correspondence,” Howard Milstein wrote on June 21. He went on to note that the hotel had doubled in profitability over the past five years, pulling in $21 million a year. “I hope you will think better of this silliness and see if the current initiatives to resolve the friction between our families can bear fruit.”
 On June 23, Philip Milstein responded: “It is not a question of profitability (bank versus hotel or otherwise) but rather a question of accountability to your partners.”
 On July 20, Howard Milstein extended an invitation to review the records “anytime after Labor Day.” Soon after, Philip Milstein sued.
 In an affidavit filed in connection with that suit, Philip Milstein made his suspicions clear. “Given Howard’s pattern of conduct, I am concerned that, absent scrutiny by his partners, he may misuse the partnership’s assets or engage in [unauthorized] transactions.”
 Philip Milstein also elaborated on a series of clashes with his cousin, all of them following the same pattern: Howard trying to develop or divest, Seymour and Philip trying to thwart him. At 42nd Street, Howard’s negotiations with potential tenants for a 35-story office building were quickly followed by letters to the tenants from Seymour, saying Howard was not authorized to develop the site.
 In 1998, Howard negotiated a sale of the Milford Plaza for $253 million to an undisclosed buyer. On Aug. 10 of that year, his father Paul sent a memo reminding him to consult his uncle. “I wouldn’t be in such a rush,” he wrote. The next day, Seymour Milstein sent a memo of his own, written in capital letters: “Please consider this as notice that you do not have my approval.”
 Seymour later relented, but by that time the opportunity had slipped away, according to a counterclaim filed by Howard Milstein. In August 1999, Howard claims, his cousin scuttled another deal, this one to lease the hotel for $18 million a year.
 Howard Milstein claims Philip “maliciously sought to interfere with [the] deal with the intent to harm the partnership and particularly his cousin, Howard Milstein.” He’s asking for $250 million in damages.
 At a hearing held Aug. 10, Howard Milstein’s attorney questioned Philip Milstein’s motives in bringing the suit in the first place. “The purpose of these things is to get these things into the paper, to say negative things about our client,” he argued.
 Supreme Court Justice Barry Cozier ordered that Philip Milstein be allowed access to the financial record within 30 days, but threatened sanctions if he brought more “unnecessary litigation.” Philip Milstein’s auditors are currently examining the hotel’s books. Their report is expected in a few months.
 Barring an unexpected breakthrough, the family now faces a series of long and embarrassing court battles. The damages the fight has  already caused the Milsteins are incalculable. The 42nd Street site, which Paul and Seymour long hoped to develop, will be auctioned off sometime soon in a bidding process overseen by an impartial referee, Manhattan attorney Judah Gribetz. The family name, which Howard Milstein had hoped to burnish with his sports-team purchases, has suffered.
 Worse yet, the battle may have just begun.

It was a spring Saturday in March, but winter lingered in Manhattan, glowering and unwelcome, like a lookout at a street corner.The Dakota on Central Park West — the creepy setting for “Rosemary’s Baby” and the former haunt of the foundational film ghoul Boris Karloff — seemed especially foreboding in the chilly gloom.Outside, tourists took selfies at the site of John Lennon’s murder. But inside, an even stranger celebration of death was unfolding.Larry Milstein, 22, and his sister Toby, 24 — whose family wealth Forbes estimated at $3.1 billion in 2015 — live with their parents, Cheryl and Philip, in a park-facing apartment once occupied by the celebrated composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein.

Inspired by the many artists who have called the Dakota home, and spurred by their own substantial arts philanthropy, these millennial billion-heirs have taken to hosting séances that are attended by their fashionable set of well-connected peers. Continue reading the main story

“I do believe in ghosts,” said Ms. Milstein, who, with her Instagram-ready look and tremendous means, exemplifies a new generation of philanthropist: the social justice warrior princess. “I may have watched far too many ghost TV programs, but I think there’s nothing wrong with believing in ghosts.”Mr. Milstein, a finely curated man, added, “This is an apartment within a building that is so steeped in history that it’s impossible not to acknowledge the past.”At the stroke of 5 p.m., a doorbell announced the arrival of Princess Noor Pahlavi, 24, a daughter of Iran’s exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi, and granddaughter of the late shah. She brought cheese.“Mama Noor! Literally!” Ms. Milstein said, expressing delight at the gift.“I had to get really Persian,” said the princess, who was wearing a short black leather Mugler dress and Saint Laurent heels. “It’s just, like, so controlling to bring food.”

“I think Jews can appreciate that as well,” Ms. Milstein replied.The other guests included two of Ms. Milstein’s former classmates at Barnard College, Sarah Pierce and Julia Pissarro, a great-granddaughter of the Impressionist painter, both 24; Eli Rivkin, 23, Mr. Milstein’s boyfriend and a Yale classmate, who is the son of a former ambassador to France; Maddy Bohrer, 24, an artist; and Ben Piper, 32, and Paul Peglar, 33, who are musicians.The attractive clique was very dressed up, and in the mahogany-paneled drawing room with its brooding Victorian décor the scene resembled a crossover episode of “Gossip Girl” and “The Addams Family.”In hushed tones, the conversation turned to contacting the dead.“Have you guys seen ‘Hollywood Medium’?” asked Princess Noor, referring to the E! network show featuring Tyler Henry, a purportedly psychic 20-year-old. “I believe in this stuff.”

“Not to be, like, really a downer, but there’s a lot of tragic death in my family, after the revolution,” she said, referring to Iran’s revolution of 1979, which dethroned her grandfather. “So I have creepy stories like that, too.”The group nodded thoughtfully. And with the mood established, they took their places around a Steinway piano and prepared to summon the spirit of Mr. Bernstein.The Milstein siblings have been cutting a dash on the city’s junior philanthropy circuit recently, making sizable donations to institutions like the NewYork-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital, and serving as Young Fellows of the Frick Collection.Articulate, with shining brown eyes and a shared interest in fashion, they are not unambitious, professionally or socially. They recently engaged a press agent, R. Couri Hay, to publicize their good will.Ms. Milstein works in business development for Joy, a tech start-up that makes interactive photo albums. For the séance, she wore a pink-and-gray striped halter dress and embroidered lace-up sandal bootees, both by Fendi.Mr. Milstein, who graduated from Yale in May, paired a green Fendi blazer with a Club Monaco top, Rag & Bone trousers and Gucci fur-lined leather slippers, personalized with tiger appliqués. A light coating of tinted foundation smoothed out his cheeks and forehead.

The family fortune can be traced to Morris Milstein, a canny Russian émigré who founded the Circle Floor Company in 1919. Family lore has it that he ran multiple businesses with different names using a single set of stationery, printed “Office of the Undersigned.”His sons, Paul and Seymour, grew the flooring company into a real estate and construction empire, but open warfare broke out in the early 2000s among the next generation. One faction was led by Paul’s son Howard Milstein; the other by Seymour’s son, Philip L. Milstein, who is Larry and Toby’s father.

“It was one of the more legendary family squabbles in the history of New York City real estate,” said Amir Korangy, the publisher of The Real Deal, a real estate trade magazine that covered the legal battle between the cousins. “There was a $5 billion family fortune at stake, and it tore the family in two.”After the schism, the companies Milstein Properties and the Emigrant Bank went to Howard, while Philip and his sister, Constance Milstein, founded Ogden CAP Properties, which owns One Lincoln Plaza and other prime real estate.Such wealth allows Larry and Toby to control personal foundations that disburse up to $1 million each, every year. Beneficiaries include such uncontroversial groups as Charity: Water, New Museum and the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, as well as more socially minded causes like the Coalition for the Homeless and anti-gun-violence campaigns.For some groups, the Milsteins open their home, and it was a gathering for an arts charity, A BroaderWay, that inspired them to try a musical method for connecting with the house spirits.“As young adults celebrating the arts, what better way to pay respect to the presence of the history here than singing a few notes from their favorite songs?” Mr. Milstein said. “It’s a modern séance that’s rooted in the music of the individuals that inhabited this place. You can feel the vibrations of them, and that means they’re there.”The Milsteins’ three-bedroom apartment, which occupies the northeast corner of the second floor and was purchased for $20.5 million in 2008, is a great place to conjure the dead.It is decorated in a style pegged to the Dakota’s 1884 German Renaissance-style architecture, with heavy wooden furniture, brocade drapes with tassels and Victorian allegorical paintings of the type whose eyes move in vintage horror films.

To set the séance mood, a grapefruit-and-cucumber Tocca candle scented the air, as a candelabrum flickered dramatically on the piano. Crystal ice buckets chilled mini-Champagne splits alongside a bottle of Jack Daniel’s and an arrangement of pastel macarons.The mood was simultaneously somber and expectantly gay, like that of a family dressed for the reading of a will in which they were expecting good news.Ms. Pierce, who shed an Adrienne Landau fur to reveal a black tuxedo dress by the Kooples, exuded a midcentury movie-star charisma. She said that friends describe her look as “Lindsay Lohan, but predrugs.”Ms. Pissarro wore an Isabel Marant black shirred cocktail dress; Mr. Rivkin was in Ralph Lauren.They assembled around the piano as if it were a coffin, and Mr. Milstein distributed pages printed with the lyrics of songs associated with the Dakota’s departed talents.Standing by the keys, Ms. Milstein proposed a toast in which she drew a link between Mr. Bernstein’s progressive causes and her own generation’s social activism.“He was also an activist; he brought a lot of activist figures in here,” she said. “Right here, the pink — oh my God, the pink panthers, LOL — the Black Panthers,” she corrected herself. “Like, he’s organized a lot of major activist groups here.”(The composer’s son, Alexander Bernstein, later clarified that no Black Panthers ever visited the Dakota apartment, although an infamous fund-raiser had been held at his family’s previous apartment on Park Avenue.)“To Lenny!” she said, raising a tumbler of whiskey.The group touched glasses, and, accompanied by Mr. Peglar on piano, began a medley that included Mr. Bernstein’s “Maria” from “West Side Story, “Imagine” by John Lennon, and, playing along with the evening’s theme, Taylor Swift’s “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever,” recently popularized by Zayn Malik.In execution, it was more Beyoncé than séance-y.For 20 minutes, the only spirits present appeared to be the Jack Daniel’s. But as the Steinway tinkled and voices filled the room, vibrations rose from deep beneath the earth, like a musical giant shifting in its grave.
