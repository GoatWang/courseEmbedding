Find out who shone and who was shocking during the glamour friendly in California
California dreaming: Manchester United celebrate against Real Madrid (all Getty).
Pre-season’s battles are not only fought between opposing teams, but by team-mates as they scrap for starting spots when the real action gets under way.
This was the case on Sunday night as Manchester United edged a, frankly appalling, penalty shootout against Real Madrid in California’s Levi’s Stadium, following a 1-1 draw within 90 minutes.

Here, we review the players who grasped their chance to impress and the ones will need to improve, sharpish, before 2017/18 kicks off.
TIMOTHY FOSU-MENSAH
The versatile Netherlands youth international did his prospects of carving out more first-team minutes no harm.
Placed in opposition to Gareth Bale at right-back for the first half, the 19-year-old showcased his usual keen competitiveness. But what was most assuring was the presence of composure beyond his years as he kept the Wales superstar deathly quiet.
This had been glaringly absent in the opening 5-2 friendly win against LA Galaxy, in which he was brought on as a half-time substitute then removed by 86 minutes after a number of rash moments.
As an able back-up across the defence or at defensive midfield, the Ajax youth product looks poised to better his four starts from last term.
Timothy Fosu-Mensah
ACHRAF HAKIMI
Another gem appears to have been mined from Madrid’s academy.
Hakimi, 18, curbed the influence of on-song France forward Anthony Martial during the second half, something celebrated Spain right-back Dani Carvajal singularly failed to do during the club’s opening 45 minutes of pre-season.
The Morocco international also exhibited his background as a flying winger with a number of bursts up the pitch.
With the erratic Danilo sold to Manchester City, expect to see far more of Hakimi next season.
Hakimi Achraf
VICTOR LINDELOF
This has not been the start that the highly-rated Sweden international envisaged at United.
Culpable in both LA Galaxy’s goals on debut, his stumbles continued at Levi’s Stadium with the concession of a comically-bad penalty which ensured Ronald McDonald – who led out the teams – wasn’t the only clown on the pitch.
The £31 million (Dh148.4 million) buy from Benfica got his timing all wrong as he swept the on-rushing Theo Fernandez into the air like a rag doll, with the ball several metres away.
The demands of playing at the highest level are eluding him at present. Yet such luminaries as Jaap Stam endured a similarly-suspect pre-season upon his arrival in 1998, before developing into one of the club’s greatest-ever defenders.
Lindelof, and manager Jose Mournho, must hope history repeats itself.
Victor Lindelof (second left).
GARETH BALE
It is hard to believe that all-powerful Madrid president Florentino Perez will make it three-consecutive summers without adding another ‘Galactico’ to his collection.
With Monaco’s prodigious striker Kylian Mbappe believed to be the latest object of his covetous affections, something has to give in the ‘BBC’. Portugal icon Cristiano Ronaldo is untouchable, while France outcast Karim Benzema quality was there for all to see last term.
This is why Bale cannot afford the ineffectual displays to mount up. Despite getting the better of Lindelof to win and then convert a penalty, he was bossed all too easily by the coltish Fosu-Mensah, when the vast difference in standing between the players should have made this a one-sided contest.
He will need to be much improved against Manchester City on Wednesday, when Madrid play their second warm-up fixture.

Chelsea set reasonable price for Nemanja Matic to join Manchester United


July 23, 2017 11:13·





Nemanja Matic
Matic is said to be keen on being reunited with Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford, but any chance of a transfer away from London had been in jeopardy after United beat Chelsea to the signing of Romelu Lukaku at the start of July.
The Guardian reports that United will sign Matic for £50m, as Chelsea president, Roman Abramovich, has sanctioned the sale of the player as he feels at his age, the price is wonderful.

Minnesota Twins close to trade for LHP Jaime Garcia
					Potentially, he could be called up to fill Garcia's spot on the roster and start tomorrow night against the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Shoulder trouble derailed his career with the Cardinals, but he did make 30 starts in 2016 and has had no issues this year.
				The fact that he's been left at home while his teammates are on the pre-season tour suggests that a deal could be in the works, but it remains to be seen whether or not the two clubs reach an agreement on a transfer fee before the deal can progress any further. Chelsea would be prepared to sell for less to a foreign club, with Juventus among the interested parties, but they continue to smart over how United hijacked their move for Lukaku.It is reported that Chelsea would be willing to sell Matic for a lower fee to a foreign club, but they are still thought to be holding a grudge after Man United hijacked their pursuit of Belgium global Romelu Lukaku.

Jaime Garcia trade could fall through
					One baseball official told me that the Braves have not been afraid to trade for pitchers coming off of Tommy John surgeries. Yasmani Grandal led off by squibbing a ground ball up the third-base line. "It was just like it looks", Flowers said.
				The Old Lady had identified Matic as a potential option to bolster their midfield, but the Blues' valuation has proved just too much for the club, who are also on the lookout for a defensive recruit.Managers are now pressing ahead with their plans for the summer transfer window so we'll bring you all the latest news and gossip from around the globe.

Integrated Device Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDTI) Rating Reiterated by Barclays PLC
					It offers products in radio frequency, timing, wireless power transfer, serial switching, interfaces and sensing solutions. Regardless, closing prices are a useful tool that investors use to quantify changes in stock prices over time.
				"I can't say any word about a player that is a Chelsea player, it's hard". He is expected to move Diego Costa on and, despite him signing a contract extension, Kurt Zouma is off to Stoke City on a season-long loan deal.

					Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) signal




					As well as software Counters, Ramps and PIDs




					Programmed with

					Software you'll enjoy using :)




					Graphically program in Flow Charts and/or Ladder Logic to rapidly create custom applications. 

					We simplified the instruction set.  Our function set is comprehensive, easy to use and powerful.

					No hunting for features.  vBuilder’s layout keeps the tools and information you need in plain view.

					Warnings and Errors are presented in real time so there are no surprises at build.

					Tag based PLCs are easier to use than address based ones, but typically cost hundreds of dollars.

					Our entire line, starting at $49, is Tag based.

					Innovative Features

					We’ve developed some great features to help you get things done quicker and more reliably.

					Subroutines:

					Break projects up into manageable chunks, and allow program reuse.

					Objects:

					Isolate data and create logic components to greatly improve development efficiency,

					maintainability and reliability.

					Linked Subroutines:

					Specify that multiple subroutines should use the same Objects.  Maybe you’ve

					got an initialization routine you’d like in one subroutine, and a process you want in another.  

					They can share an object, so you don’t have to pass data between the two.




					View your data and create operator controls with

					Awesome, Free HMI




					We’re serious about delivering the easiest to use, most productive PLC software.

					We could go on about our features, but seeing is believing, so Check out our vBuilder page,

vFactory page or Download vBuilder and vFactory. They're

					FREE




					Meet Branch








					Expansion has a vLink input port instead of USB. 

					Expansions are otherwise physically identical to Branch Main. 

					Your Sensors and Actuators are Branched Out, 

					Your PLC Should Branch With Them! 







					Branch's unique structure beats backplane and brick systems 

					at getting IO where it’s need, helping you run shorter wires and keep an organized system 




					Smarter IO

					Expansion units have full PLC processing power and memory.




					vBuilder’s power shines with Branch 

					Put subroutines inside of IO units to focus processing where it’s most needed. 

					Debug your entire Branch system as a unit.  No need to debug one processor at a time. 

					Lets you view real-time data for your entire system. 













					PLC programming should be fun! 

					We’ve got engaging tutorials to get you up to speed on our PLCs, and more are on the way. 

					Whether you’re new to PLCs, or just new to us, we want your learning experience to be enjoyable. 

					The tutorials aren’t boring or difficult to follow, we promise. 

					FREE Connector Tool 

					For a limited time only, we’re giving away a FREE connector tool with every Order!




					Every order over $48 ships FREE 

					100% of our PLCs qualify for Free US standard shipping.
					We also ship to Canada and Mexico for $19.95.

					100% Satisfaction Guarantee 

					Shop with confidence, knowing that you are free to return any product for a full 30 days after 

					purchase and receive a full refund. 



					Choose your adventure...

					Programming cable




					All Ace and Branch PLCs use a standard USB to Mini-USB cable 
					for programming (like the one in the picture to the left).
					If you’ve already got one, great, it’ll work fine.
					Be careful, this isn't the USB to Micro-USB that comes with many cell phones.
					If not, be sure to add one to your cart.

					DIN Rail Mount

					All Ace and Branch PLCs come standard with a super-strong, 2-sided adhesive strip.
					It bonds well with painted metals, plastics and glass. 
					This stuff is used to attach Sky-Scraper windows to their frames.  We've been impressed with it's strength.




					Adhesive

					(Underside of Ace and Branch PLCs)

					But, what if I want to attach it to a DIN rail, screws, or bolts? You’re in Luck!  

					We’ve got a great add-on that helps you attach your PLC to a 35mm Din rail, or #8 screws or bolts.  




					vMount  

					same thing, just upside down  

					it's got these 2 hooks  

					Ace or Branch underside  

					notice these slots 

					Ace and Branch have four of the slots shown in the image above, to the right. (two aren’t visible). 
					Twist vMount onto your Ace or Branch to attach.  Pick which of the 4 orientations works best for your project.  




					Once attached to your Ace or Branch, rest the topside on your DIN rail. 
					Then press the bottom side down.  It'll snap in place, providing a secure mount.  

					If you'd prefer to mount using #8 screws or bolts, just place you holes 1" apart.

					Simulators



					Simulate Inputs to aid development!

 

					2 Reasons to Use Simulators

					1) Work on software before connecting to your Sensors and Actuators.

					Don’t have all your sensors and actuators yet?

					Can’t afford to take system offline for long?

					Prove it works before connecting to the real thing.

					Want to connect sensors and actuators one piece at a time?

					With the External Port option, connect as many Digital IO sensors and actuators as you’d like
					and simulate all the rest.  
					Switches let you select pin-by-pin which Analog Inputs you want to simulate using knobs
					and which you want to use real signals from input ports.

					2) Learn to use PLCs.

					They’re a great training tool.  All IO can be simulated.

					Compatible with most Embedded PLC we sell

					With a Simulator, an Embedded Branch Main and Embedded Expansions,
					you can simulate an entire Branch System.

					Simulators can be set up to work with 5volt and 10volt analog ranges. 

 

					Simulator - top and side views

 

*Picture Shows an Embedded PLC plugged into Simulator.  Embedded PLCs sold separately

 

 

					Knobs simulate Analog Inputs
					(port f is optional)

 

					Switches simulate Digital Inputs

 

					LEDs display Digital Output state

 

					Jumper sets whether GND to +5V 
					or AV- to AV+ is used for Analog Inputs

 

					Analog Input Port Connector (optional)

 

					Switches let you pin-by-pin to use 
					Knob or signal from Analog 
					Input Port (optional)

 

					Digital Input Port Connector (optional)
					decide pin-by-pin to use Switch or wire 
					plugged into this port for Digital Input

 

					Digital Output Port Connector (optional)
					connect outputs to real hardware


 

 

					Our Embedded PLCs use 0.1” spaced headers 
					that extend from the underside of the PLCs. 
					They’re designed to mate with these Simulators,
					as well as your custom hardware

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
