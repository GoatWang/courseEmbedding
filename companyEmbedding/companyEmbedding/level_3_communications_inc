Welcome from the CEO


My sincerest thanks for considering a career at Level 3 Communications. I’d like to tell you why I think it’s one of the best decisions you could ever make.

As a premier global communications provider and operator of a 200,000-mile fiber network, Level 3 has authored many exciting chapters in the history of communications technology – and we’re poised to write many more. Connectivity has become an indispensable commodity for modern living, and we are in the vanguard of not only interconnecting more and more of our world but also creating solutions that shape how that world lives, learns and works.
Despite its relative infancy, modern communication is already as ingrained in everyday life as running water. It’s a field that can uniquely offer the dynamism of young, disruptive technology, but at the global scale of, say, electricity or cars. What this all means is that at Level 3, you have the uncommon opportunity to sculpt your career, our company and the very evolution of an industry that touches the entire human population.
Level 3 is powered by a global team of more than 13,000 of the brightest minds and biggest imaginations on the planet. We are looking for employees across all areas of expertise to help us build tomorrow’s technology. We commit to providing you with a great work environment, opportunities for career growth and the chance to be part of something extraordinary.
I’ll leave you with our employee value proposition – a promise for which I hold myself personally responsible:
Our winning team is the essence of today and tomorrow’s communications. At Level 3, people combine challenging work with ingenuity to help each other thrive in our global, fast-paced and growing company. We believe that speaking the truth, doing what we say we are going to do and having passion for delivering an exceptional customer experience drives our success. Level 3 makes global communications possible; together with our customers, we are changing the world. Come grow with us and be part of something that’s important and exciting.
We are changing the world for the better. I hope you’ll come change it with us.
— Jeff Storey, Level 3 Chief Executive Officer

Lock Down Essential Resources.
The internet never stops growing in size or importance. It is a critical component for business and ignites communications, sales, marketing and customer service. It also increases risk. Each connection introduces another point for attack or infection.

We help safeguard networks, systems and data. And, we can do it for you.

Level 3® DDoS Mitigation
Stay Up and Running. No Matter What.
Downtime is no longer an inconvenience. It can do serious harm to your brand, your productivity and your bottom line. Every minute your network is down is a minute you can’t connect with colleagues, customers or partners.

Though you will be paying a premium for their network provider services, it's definitely worth it. Though the days of  $20-30Megabit has gone down to about $7 (it is a bad economy after all). Well organized and technically competent, they make it pretty easy to provision network circuits, cdn, and network peering. I don't know if I've had an easier time bringing up several 10gig links and BGP peering in such a short, painless amount of time. 4.5 stars.







Uniquely dreadful; less reliable that Comcast, less responsive than the government, and less interested in customer service than the DMV.

The outages have cost a lot of time and money.

If you have literally any other option, go for that. We finally got out of our internet contract (without penalties) thanks to an astounding number of failures on their part; one week later, our phone system (also with them) crashed.

Do not do business with them.







Avoid, avoid, avoid!!!  Expensive MPLS offering and terrible service to go with it.    We're going on our third day of outages with them.  For the first two days, it was "deny and delay".  Now they are owning the problem, but true resolution is glacially slow in coming.







The worst T1 available in my opinion. Insanely expensive and was never reliable. Also we never got the speed as promised. Also they have a missleading contract. They sign you up and then have a hidden clause that allows them to bill you for in our case 3 years though their service sucks. Also when you call their customer service which is a joke, they cannot find you in their system and constantly tranfer you to even more incompetent people.

We went to Cox who was a fraction of the cost and never down. Avoid level 3 like the plague.







This company is scum, they have misleading contracts to trap you into a long term commitment. Their T1 is garbage it was down lots of time when we had it. The speed was never as sold. When you call their customer service  they cannot find you by name, customer number.....They transfer you around when you need help. This is my opinion it is the worst run company I have ever dealt with. We moved to Cox for a fraction of the cost  4 times the speed and no issues. Then when we canceled 2.5 years into this nightmare of a company, they pull out contract that I never signed or saw and they inform me I owe them 1900 dollars for the remaining of a 3 yr contract which I did not agree to. I called their customer service if you can call it that and they politely tell me to go F myself and pay.  If had the time to sue we would. AVOID I- 3 IT IS THE WORSE T1 OUT THERE.

Though you will be paying a premium for their network provider services, it's definitely worth it. Though the days of  $20-30Megabit has gone down to about $7 (it is a bad economy after all). Well organized and technically competent, they make it pretty easy to provision network circuits, cdn, and network peering. I don't know if I've had an easier time bringing up several 10gig links and BGP peering in such a short, painless amount of time. 4.5 stars.

Uniquely dreadful; less reliable that Comcast, less responsive than the government, and less interested in customer service than the DMV.The outages have cost a lot of time and money.If you have literally any other option, go for that. We finally got out of our internet contract (without penalties) thanks to an astounding number of failures on their part; one week later, our phone system (also with them) crashed.Do not do business with them.

Avoid, avoid, avoid!!!  Expensive MPLS offering and terrible service to go with it.    We're going on our third day of outages with them.  For the first two days, it was "deny and delay".  Now they are owning the problem, but true resolution is glacially slow in coming.

The worst T1 available in my opinion. Insanely expensive and was never reliable. Also we never got the speed as promised. Also they have a missleading contract. They sign you up and then have a hidden clause that allows them to bill you for in our case 3 years though their service sucks. Also when you call their customer service which is a joke, they cannot find you in their system and constantly tranfer you to even more incompetent people.We went to Cox who was a fraction of the cost and never down. Avoid level 3 like the plague.

This company is scum, they have misleading contracts to trap you into a long term commitment. Their T1 is garbage it was down lots of time when we had it. The speed was never as sold. When you call their customer service  they cannot find you by name, customer number.....They transfer you around when you need help. This is my opinion it is the worst run company I have ever dealt with. We moved to Cox for a fraction of the cost  4 times the speed and no issues. Then when we canceled 2.5 years into this nightmare of a company, they pull out contract that I never signed or saw and they inform me I owe them 1900 dollars for the remaining of a 3 yr contract which I did not agree to. I called their customer service if you can call it that and they politely tell me to go F myself and pay.  If had the time to sue we would. AVOID I- 3 IT IS THE WORSE T1 OUT THERE.

BROOMFIELD, Colo., July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Today's IT departments are challenged with helping the enterprise realize the benefits of digital transformation. At the same time, they're working to replace or integrate legacy and siloed collaboration services into more efficient solutions designed to support the evolving needs of a more mobile and global workforce. To help enterprises on this journey, Level 3 Communications, Inc. (NYSE:    LVLT) is unveiling Amazon Chime delivered by Level 3, a global, unified communications offering. 


Learn how Amazon Chime delivered by Level 3 can be leveraged for increased productivity and streamlined operations: http://www.level3.com/en/landing-pages/amazon-chime-and-level-3/. 
Key Facts:

Amazon Chime delivered by Level 3 is a single vendor-managed unified communications solution that runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), with end-to-end customer support provided by Level 3. 
Customers can leverage a pay-as-you-go collaboration tool, without the requirement for long-term commitments or upfront capital investments. 
With Amazon Chime delivered by Level 3, enterprises have access to an adaptable communications platform with Level 3 global service level agreements. 
Amazon Chime delivered by Level 3 is available to Level 3 customers in North America and EMEA. 

Key Benefits:

Amazon Chime delivered by Level 3 helps consolidate multiple tools into one video, voice, chat and screen-sharing tool. 
Level 3 allows customers to implement advanced enterprise solutions without the heavy burden on internal resources for support. 
Throughout the adoption process, Level 3 assists customers with training, implementation and professional services. 

Key Quotes:Carlin Wiegner, General Manager of Amazon Chime, Amazon Web Services"AWS and Level 3 have a solid track record of working together to provide solutions to businesses. Our customers have told us that Amazon Chime takes the frustration out of meetings, with a single tool that helps ensure meetings start on time and gives employees high quality meetings with video, voice and chat. As an Advanced Partner in the AWS Partner Network, Level 3 is well suited to participate with us to deliver Amazon Chime."
Cindy Whelan, Principal Analyst, Global IT Managed and Hosted Services at GlobalData"Despite advances in conferencing technology, all too often online meetings are delayed by common pitfalls like call access coordinates and distractions from background noise. Amazon Chime delivered by Level 3 gives Level 3's enterprise customers a new option for collaboration services, with one click to join meetings and noise cancelling audio that can add up to more productive meeting time."
Anthony Christie, CMO for Level 3"The right communication tools are imperative to the success of any enterprise in the midst of digital transformation. With Amazon Chime delivered by Level 3, customers have the benefit of AWS's agility, coupled with Level 3's highly reliable and secure global network and high-touch support model, so they can focus on what matters most to their business."

Acquisition Enhances Level 3's Security Product Portfolio

BROOMFIELD, Colo., July 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Global telecommunications provider Level 3 Communications, Inc. (NYSE: LVLT), announced it acquired privately held Black Lotus, a provider of global Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation services. The acquisition of Black Lotus represents another step in Level 3's continued commitment to provide leading security product capabilities. Level 3 noted the increase in frequency, volume and complexity of DDoS attacks in a recent research report, Safeguarding the Internet: Level 3 Botnet Research Report, substantiating the need to invest in the DDoS market. 
New DDoS CapabilitiesThe acquisition of Black Lotus will add additional capabilities to Level 3's existing DDoS service, which launched earlier in the year, including adding extra scrubbing centers. The Level 3 DDoS Mitigation service provides an enhanced network-based detection and mitigation scrubbing solution alongside network routing, rate limiting and IP filtering abilities. Black Lotus adds proxy-based DDoS mitigation services to the portfolio providing additional capabilities for application layer attacks, along with advanced behavioral analytics technology. The application layer is a prime target for DDoS attacks that often impact Web servers and Web hosting providers.
Quote "At Level 3, we value security and are committed to protecting our customers and our network," said Chris Richter, senior vice president of managed security services at Level 3. "Black Lotus' proxy and behavioral technologies, combined with their experienced team of DDoS experts, perfectly complements Level 3's DDoS mitigation and threat intelligence capabilities. With this acquisition, Level 3 continues its commitment of investing in a comprehensive portfolio of services that enhance the growth, efficiency and security of our customers' operations, helping enterprises combat the cybersecurity challenges they face every day."

  Amazon CloudFront 













  Highly secure global content delivery network (CDN)

  Product Details 










  Pricing 










  Getting Started 










  Resources 










  Case Studies 
























Amazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to your viewers with low latency and high transfer speeds. CloudFront is integrated with AWS – both physical locations that are directly connected to the AWS global infrastructure, as well as software that works seamlessly with services including AWS Shield for DDoS mitigation, Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing or Amazon EC2 as origins for your applications, and AWS Lambda to run custom code close to your viewers.
You can get started with CloudFront in minutes, using the same AWS tools you are already familiar with – APIs, AWS Management Console, AWS CloudFormation, CLIs, and SDKs. CloudFront offers a simple, pay-as-you-go pricing model with no upfront fees or required long-term contracts, and support for CloudFront is included in your existing AWS Support subscription.

Slack Uses Amazon CloudFront for Secure API Acceleration



















  Amazon CloudFront Benefits 


























Global, Growing Network 




Amazon CloudFront is built on the expanding global AWS infrastructure that includes 44 Availability Zones within 16 geographic regions today, with announced plans for 14 more Availability Zones and five more Regions in China, France, Hong Kong, Sweden, and a second AWS GovCloud Region in the US. Amazon CloudFront also has 79 edge locations and 11 regional edge cache locations across 21 countries and 48 cities, helping ensure your applications deliver high availability, scalability, and performance for all of your customers from anywhere in the world. 















Secure Content at the Edge 




Amazon CloudFront is a highly secure CDN that provides both network and application level protection. CloudFront infrastructure and processes are all compliant with PCI, DSS, HIPAA, and ISO to ensure secure delivery of your most sensitive data. You can deliver your secure APIs or applications via SSL/TLS, and advanced SSL features are enabled automatically. You can use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to easily create as many custom SSL certificates as needed and immediately deploy them to your CloudFront distributions at no additional charge. ACM automatically handles certificate renewal, eliminating the overhead and costs of a manual renewal process. CloudFront is also integrated with AWS WAF and AWS Shield to help protect your applications from sophisticated threats and DDoS attacks.















Deep Integration with Key AWS Services 




In addition to integration with key security services, Amazon CloudFront is also deeply integrated and optimized to work with popular AWS services including Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), and Elastic Load Balancing as back-end origin resources and Amazon Route 53 to help speed up DNS resolution of applications delivered by CloudFront. Integration with AWS Lambda allows you to execute custom logic across the AWS global network without provisioning or managing servers, and integration with Amazon API Gateway helps further accelerate the delivery of your APIs.



















High Performance 




Amazon CloudFront is optimized for low latency and high data transfer speeds. CloudFront’s intelligent routing is based on real-world latency measurements continuously gathered from popular Internet sites including Amazon.com. CloudFront is directly connected with hundreds of end-user ISPs and uses the AWS backbone network to accelerate the delivery of your content end-to-end. CloudFront also offers regional edge cache locations as part of the standard offering to ensure consistently high cache hit ratios across the globe.















Cost Effective 




Amazon CloudFront’s pricing is simple – you pay only for the data transfer and requests used to deliver content to your customers. With CloudFront, there are no upfront payments or fixed platform fees, no long-term commitments, no premiums for dynamic content, and no requirements for professional services to get started. If you use AWS origins such as Amazon S3 or Elastic Load Balancing, you don’t pay for any data transferred between these services and CloudFront. And best of all, you can get started with CloudFront for free.















Easy To Use 




All Amazon CloudFront features can be easily and programmatically configured using APIs or through the AWS Management Console. Deep integration with popular AWS security, storage, compute, and networking services allows you to easily leverage the full power of the AWS Cloud. Like other AWS services, CloudFront automatically scales to meet your needs and works with your existing AWS tools and resources such as AWS CloudFormation, AWS CLIs and SDKs, and AWS CloudWatch to monitor the performance of your Amazon CloudFront distributions.

  Amazon CloudFront Use Cases 



















Static Asset Caching 




Amazon CloudFront can speed up the delivery of your static content (e.g., images, style sheets, JavaScript, etc.) to viewers across the globe. CloudFront offers a multi-tier cache by default, with regional edge caches that improve latency and lower the load on your origin servers when the object is not already cached at the edge. Caching static content gives you the performance and scale you need to give your viewers a fast and reliable experience when visiting your website.  








Live and On-Demand Video Streaming 




Amazon CloudFront offers multiple options for streaming your media – both pre-recorded files and live events – at sustained, high throughput required for 4K delivery to global viewers. For on-demand streaming, you can use CloudFront for multi-bitrate adaptive streaming in Microsoft Smooth, HLS, HDS, or MPEG-DASH formats to any device. To broadcast a live stream, you can use CloudFront to cache the media fragments at the edge and collapse multiple requests for the manifest file to reduce load to your origin. 








Security and DDoS Mitigation 




Security is our top priority. CloudFront integrates seamlessly with AWS Shield for Layer 3/4 DDoS mitigation and AWS WAF for Layer 7 protection. In addition, CloudFront negotiates TLS connections with the highest security ciphers, and authenticates viewers with signed URLs. You can use as many custom SSL certificates as you need at no additional charge. CloudFront also integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access, with AWS CloudTrail to log access to your configuration, and with Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) for automated certificate renewals. 












Dynamic and Customized Content 




Amazon CloudFront has built-in network optimizations that help improve the performance, reliability, and global reach of the dynamic portions of your application that update frequently as well as content personalized to each viewer. CloudFront works seamlessly with your existing webservers running in Amazon EC2 or in your own datacenter, without the need to change your architecture or domain name. You can also offload custom logic as Lambda functions you execute globally in line with CloudFront requests or responses. Learn more about Lambda@Edge. 








API Acceleration 




Amazon CloudFront can be used to secure and accelerate your API calls. CloudFront supports proxy methods (POST, PUT, OPTIONS, DELETE, and PATCH) and is already integrated with Amazon API Gateway by default. With CloudFront, TLS connections with clients terminate at a nearby edge location, then CloudFront uses optimized AWS-backbone network paths to securely reach your API servers. Learn more about API Acceleration with CloudFront. 








Software Distribution




Amazon CloudFront scales automatically as globally-distributed clients download software updates. You can make your software available right at the edge where your users are. CloudFront’s high data transfer rates speed up the delivery of your binaries, improving customer experience while lowering your costs.

Together, the solution can automatically scale to millions of users by leveraging the global reach of CloudFront and the auto scaling capability of AWS cloud. In this talk, we introduce you to various design patterns and best practices to build a massively scalable solution using CloudFront. We discuss how this scale can be achieved without compromising on availability, security or cost.
Learning Objectives: • Learn how to use CloudFront dynamic delivery features
• See a live demo and learn how to take advantage of Cloud Front newest features

  Key Features 









Dynamic and Customized Content 




You can use Amazon CloudFront to deliver all of your content, including the dynamic portions of your site that change for each end-user. With CloudFront, you can configure multiple origin servers and multiple cache behaviors based on URL path patterns on your website. You can also configure a minimum expiration period (also known as “time-to-live” or TTL) to as short as 0 seconds, detect user requests based on the device used and the country where the end user is accessing your content from (geo targeting), and specify which query string parameters, cookies, or standard HTTP request headers you want to forward to your custom (non-S3) origin server. In addition, the integration with Lambda@Edge allows you to customize or personalize content for your end users close to where they’re located by writing AWS Lambda functions deployed to the global CloudFront network and execute these functions in response to CloudFront events. 








Security Features 




You can configure Amazon CloudFront to enforce end-to-end HTTPS connections from your viewer to your origin. The integration between CloudFront and AWS Certificate Manager allows you to create free custom SSL certificates or bring your own and deploy them in minutes. CloudFront supports advanced protocols and ciphers, and advanced SSL features, such as Session Tickets, OCSP Stapling, and Perfect Forward Secrecy. With CloudFront, you can also securely serve private content by using signed URLs, signed cookies (trusted signers), and use Origin Access Identity (OAIs) to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket. CloudFront also integrates with AWS WAF, a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits, and AWS Shield, a managed DDoS protection service that safeguards web applications running on AWS. CloudFront is a PCI DSS compliant and HIPAA eligible service and allows you to log configuration changes to your distributions through AWS CloudTrail for auditing purposes. 












Streaming Features 




Amazon CloudFront supports multiple protocols for media (audio and video – both on-demand and live) streaming. You can use CloudFront to deliver on-demand video using the Microsoft Smooth Streaming or the HLS formats without the need to setup or operate any media servers. You can also use CloudFront to deliver live media using Adobe Media Server, Window Media Services, or Wowza Media Server. CloudFront integrates with AWS Elemental Cloud’s video processing and delivery services, including Amazon Elastic Transcoder, a service that allows you to convert your mezzanine (or master) media files stored in Amazon S3 to various formats depending on the devices your viewers will be using to play it. 








Reporting and Analytics 




Amazon CloudFront offers a variety of solutions for your reporting needs, whether it's receiving detailed cache statistics reports, monitoring your CloudFront usage in near real-time with Amazon CloudWatch, tracking your most popular objects, setting alarms on operational metrics, or learning more about your end users and which domains referred them to your website. You can also choose to receive information about traffic delivered by your CloudFront distribution by enabling CloudFront access logs for no additional cost.

  General 





Q. What is Amazon CloudFront?
Amazon CloudFront is a web service that gives businesses and web application developers an easy and cost effective way to distribute content with low latency and high data transfer speeds. Like other AWS services, Amazon CloudFront is a self-service, pay-per-use offering, requiring no long term commitments or minimum fees. With CloudFront, your files are delivered to end-users using a global network of edge locations.
Q. What can I do with Amazon CloudFront?
Amazon CloudFront provides a simple API that lets you:
Distribute content with low latency and high data transfer rates by serving requests using a network of edge locations around the world.
Get started without negotiating contracts and minimum commitments.
Q. How do I get started with Amazon CloudFront?
Click the “Create Free Account” button on the Amazon CloudFront detail page. If you choose to use another AWS service as the origin for the files served through Amazon CloudFront, you must sign up for that service before creating CloudFront distributions.
Q. How do I use Amazon CloudFront?
To use Amazon CloudFront, you:

For static files, store the definitive versions of your files in one or more origin servers. These could be Amazon S3 buckets. For your dynamically generated content that is personalized or customized, you can use Amazon EC2 – or any other web server – as the origin server. These origin servers will store or generate your content that will be distributed through Amazon CloudFront.
Register your origin servers with Amazon CloudFront through a simple API call. This call will return a CloudFront.net domain name that you can use to distribute content from your origin servers via the Amazon CloudFront service. For instance, you can register the Amazon S3 bucket “bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com” as the origin for all your static content and an Amazon EC2 instance “dynamic.myoriginserver.com” for all your dynamic content. Then, using the API or the AWS Management Console, you can create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that might return “abc123.cloudfront.net” as the distribution domain name.
Include the cloudfront.net domain name, or a CNAME alias that you create, in your web application, media player, or website. Each request made using the cloudfront.net domain name (or the CNAME you set-up) is routed to the edge location best suited to deliver the content with the highest performance. The edge location will attempt to serve the request with a local copy of the file. If a local copy is not available, Amazon CloudFront will get a copy from the origin. This copy is then available at that edge location for future requests.

Q. How does Amazon CloudFront provide higher performance?
Amazon CloudFront employs a global network of edge locations and regional edge caches that cache copies of your content close to your viewers. Amazon CloudFront ensures that end-user requests are served by the closest edge location. As a result, viewer requests travel a short distance, improving performance for your viewers. For files not cached at the edge locations and the regional edge caches, Amazon CloudFront keeps persistent connections with your origin servers so that those files can be fetched from the origin servers as quickly as possible. Finally, Amazon CloudFront uses additional optimizations – e.g. wider TCP initial congestion window – to provide higher performance while delivering your content to viewers.
Q. How does Amazon CloudFront lower my costs to distribute content over the Internet?
Like other AWS services, Amazon CloudFront has no minimum commitments and charges you only for what you use. Compared to self-hosting, Amazon CloudFront spares you from the expense and complexity of operating a network of cache servers in multiple sites across the internet and eliminates the need to over-provision capacity in order to serve potential spikes in traffic. Amazon CloudFront also uses techniques such as collapsing simultaneous viewer requests at an edge location for the same file into a single request to your origin server. This reduces the load on your origin servers reducing the need to scale your origin infrastructure, which can bring you further cost savings.
Additionally, if you are using an AWS origin (e.g., Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.), effective December 1, 2014, we are no longer charging for AWS data transfer out to Amazon CloudFront. This applies to data transfer from all AWS regions to all global CloudFront edge locations.
Q. How does Amazon CloudFront speed up my entire website?
Amazon CloudFront uses standard cache control headers you set on your files to identify static and dynamic content. Delivering all your content using a single Amazon CloudFront distribution helps you make sure that performance optimizations are applied to your entire website or web application. When using AWS origins, you benefit from improved performance, reliability, and ease of use as a result of AWS’s ability to track and adjust origin routes, monitor system health, respond quickly when any issues occur, and the integration of Amazon CloudFront with other AWS services. You also benefit from using different origins for different types of content on a single site – e.g. Amazon S3 for static objects, Amazon EC2 for dynamic content, and custom origins for third-party content – paying only for what you use.
Q. How is Amazon CloudFront different from Amazon S3?
Amazon CloudFront is a good choice for distribution of frequently accessed static content that benefits from edge delivery—like popular website images, videos, media files or software downloads.
Q. How is Amazon CloudFront different from traditional content delivery solutions?
Amazon CloudFront lets you quickly obtain the benefits of high performance content delivery without negotiated contracts or high prices. Amazon CloudFront gives all developers access to inexpensive, pay-as-you-go pricing – with a self-service model. Developers also benefit from tight integration with other Amazon Web Services. The solution is simple to use with Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and Elastic Load Balancing as origin servers, giving developers a powerful combination of durable storage and high performance delivery. Amazon CloudFront also integrates with Amazon Route 53 and AWS CloudFormation for further performance benefits and ease of configuration.
Q. What types of content does Amazon CloudFront support?
Amazon CloudFront supports all files that can be served over HTTP. This includes dynamic web pages, such as HTML or PHP pages, any popular static files that are a part of your web application, such as website images, audio, video, media files or software downloads. For on-demand media files, you can also choose to stream your content using RTMP delivery. Amazon CloudFront also supports delivery of live media over HTTP.
Q. Does Amazon CloudFront support delivery of dynamic content?
Amazon CloudFront supports all files that can be served over HTTP. This includes dynamic web pages, such as HTML or PHP pages, any popular static files that are a part of your web application, such as website images, audio streams, video streams, media files or software downloads. For on-demand media files, you can also choose to stream your content using RTMP delivery. Amazon CloudFront also supports delivery of live media over HTTP.
Q. Does Amazon CloudFront work with non-AWS origin servers?
Yes. Amazon CloudFront works with any origin server that holds the original, definitive versions of your content, both static and dynamic. There is no additional charge to use a custom origin.
Q: Does Amazon CloudFront offer a Service Level Agreement (SLA)?
Yes. The Amazon CloudFront SLA provides for a service credit if a customer’s monthly uptime percentage is below our service commitment in any billing cycle. More information can be found here.
Q: Can I use the AWS Management Console with Amazon CloudFront?
Yes. You can use the AWS Management Console to configure and manage Amazon CloudFront though a simple, point-and-click web interface. The AWS Management Console supports most of Amazon CloudFront’s features, letting you get Amazon CloudFront’s low latency delivery without writing any code or installing any software. Access to the AWS Management Console is provided free of charge at https://console.aws.amazon.com.
Q: What tools and libraries work with Amazon CloudFront?
There are a variety of tools for managing your Amazon CloudFront distribution and libraries for various programming languages available in our resource center.
Q. Can I point my zone apex (example.com versus www.example.com) at my Amazon CloudFront distribution?
Yes. By using Amazon Route 53, AWS’s authoritative DNS service, you can configure an ‘Alias’ record that lets you map the apex or root (example.com) of your DNS name to your Amazon CloudFront distribution. Amazon Route 53 will then respond to each request for an Alias record with the right IP address(es) for your CloudFront distribution. Route 53 doesn't charge for queries to Alias records that are mapped to a CloudFront distribution. These queries are listed as "Intra-AWS-DNS-Queries" on the Amazon Route 53 usage report. 





  Edge Locations 





Q. What is CloudFront Regional Edge Cache?
A default CloudFront feature that brings more of your content close to your viewers, even when the content is not popular to stay at a particular edge location. This helps improve performance for your viewers while lowering the operational burden and cost of scaling your origin resources.
Q. How does regional edge cache work?
Amazon CloudFront has added several regional edge cache locations globally, at close proximity to your viewers. These locations sit in between your origin webserver and the global edge locations that serve traffic directly to your viewers. As the popularity of your objects reduce, individual edge locations may evict those objects to make room for more popular content. Regional Edge Caches have larger cache width than any individual edge location, so objects remain in cache longer at these regional edge caches. This helps keep more of your content closer to your viewers, reducing the need for CloudFront to go back to your origin webserver and improving overall performance for viewers. For instance, our edge locations in Europe now go to the regional edge cache in Frankfurt to fetch an object before going back to your origin webserver. Regional Edge Cache locations are currently utilized only for requests that need to go back to a custom origin; i.e. requests to S3 origins will skip regional edge cache locations.
Q. Is regional edge cache feature enabled by default?
Yes. You do not need to make any changes to your CloudFront distributions; this feature is enabled by default for all new and existing CloudFront distributions. There are no additional charges to use this feature.
Q. Where are the edge network locations used by Amazon CloudFront located?
Amazon CloudFront uses a global network of edge locations and regional edge caches for content delivery. You can see a full list of Amazon CloudFront locations here.
Q. Can I choose to serve content (or not serve content) to specified countries?
Yes, the Geo Restriction feature lets you specify a list of countries in which your users can access your content. Alternatively, you can specify the countries in which your users cannot access your content. In both cases, CloudFront responds to a request from a viewer in a restricted country with an HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden).
Q. How accurate is your GeoIP database?
The accuracy of the IP Address to country lookup database varies by region. Based on recent tests, our overall accuracy for the IP address to country mapping is 99.8%.
Q. Can I serve a custom error message to my end users?
Yes, you can create custom error messages (for example, an HTML file or a .jpg graphic) with your own branding and content for a variety of HTTP 4xx and 5xx error responses. Then you can configure Amazon CloudFront to return your custom error messages to the viewer when your origin returns one of the specified errors to CloudFront.
Q. How long will Amazon CloudFront keep my files at the edge locations?
By default, if no cache control header is set, each edge location checks for an updated version of your file whenever it receives a request more than 24 hours after the previous time it checked the origin for changes to that file. This is called the “expiration period.” You can set this expiration period as short as 0 seconds, or as long as you’d like, by setting the cache control headers on your files in your origin. Amazon CloudFront uses these cache control headers to determine how frequently it needs to check the origin for an updated version of that file. For expiration period set to 0 seconds, Amazon CloudFront will revalidate every request with the origin server. If your files don’t change very often, it is best practice to set a long expiration period and implement a versioning system to manage updates to your files.
Q. How do I remove an item from Amazon CloudFront edge locations?
There are multiple options for removing a file from the edge locations. You can simply delete the file from your origin and as content in the edge locations reaches the expiration period defined in each object’s HTTP header, it will be removed. In the event that offensive or potentially harmful material needs to be removed before the specified expiration time, you can use the Invalidation API to remove the object from all Amazon CloudFront edge locations. You can see the charge for making invalidation requests here.
Q. Is there a limit to the number of invalidation requests I can make?
If you're invalidating objects individually, you can have invalidation requests for up to 3,000 objects per distribution in progress at one time. This can be one invalidation request for up to 3,000 objects, up to 3,000 requests for one object each, or any other combination that doesn't exceed 3,000 objects.
If you're using the * wildcard, you can have requests for up to 15 invalidation paths in progress at one time. You can also have invalidation requests for up to 3,000 individual objects per distribution in progress at the same time; the limit on wildcard invalidation requests is independent of the limit on invalidating objects individually. If you exceed this limit, further invalidation requests will receive an error response until one of the earlier request completes.
You should use invalidation only in unexpected circumstances; if you know beforehand that your files will need to be removed from cache frequently, it is recommended that you either implement a versioning system for your files and/or set a short expiration period.





  Compliance 





Q. Is Amazon CloudFront PCI compliant?
Yes, Amazon CloudFront is included in the set of services that are compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Merchant Level 1, the highest level of compliance for service providers. Please see our developer's guide for more information.
Q: Is Amazon CloudFront HIPAA eligible?
Yes, AWS has expanded its HIPAA compliance program to include Amazon CloudFront as a HIPAA eligible service. If you have an executed Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with AWS, you can use Amazon CloudFront to accelerate the delivery of protected health information (PHI). For more information, see HIPAA Compliance and our developer's guide.





  HTTP and HTTP/2 





Q. What types of HTTP requests are supported by Amazon CloudFront?
Amazon CloudFront currently supports GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS requests.
Q. Does Amazon CloudFront cache POST responses?
Amazon CloudFront does not cache the responses to POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests – these requests are proxied back to the origin server. You may enable caching for the responses to OPTIONS requests.
Q. How do I use HTTP/2?
If you have an existing Amazon CloudFront distribution, you can turn on HTTP/2 using the API or the Management Console. In the Console, go to the “Distribution Configuration” page and navigate to the section “Supported HTTP Versions.” There, you can select "HTTP/2, HTTP/1.1, or HTTP/1.0". HTTP/2 is automatically enabled for all new CloudFront distributions.
Q. What if my origin does not support HTTP/2?
Amazon CloudFront currently supports HTTP/2 for delivering content to your viewers’ clients and browsers. For communication between the edge location and your origin servers, Amazon CloudFront will continue to use HTTP/1.1.
Q. Does Amazon CloudFront support HTTP/2 without TLS?
Not currently. However, most of the modern browsers support HTTP/2 only over an encrypted connection. You can learn more about using SSL with Amazon CloudFront here.





  Security 





Q. Can I configure my CloudFront distribution to deliver content over HTTPS using my own domain name?
By default, you can deliver your content to viewers over HTTPS by using your CloudFront distribution domain name in your URLs, for example, https://dxxxxx.cloudfront.net/image.jpg. If you want to deliver your content over HTTPS using your own domain name and your own SSL certificate, you can use one of our Custom SSL certificate support features. Learn more.
Q. What is the difference between SNI Custom SSL and Dedicated IP Custom SSL of Amazon CloudFront?
Dedicated IP Custom SSL allocates dedicated IP addresses to serve your SSL content at each CloudFront edge location. Because there is a one to one mapping between IP addresses and SSL certificates, Dedicated IP Custom SSL works with browsers and other clients that do not support SNI. Due to the current IP address costs, Dedicated IP Custom SSL is $600/month prorated by the hour.
SNI Custom SSL relies on the SNI extension of the Transport Layer Security protocol, which allows multiple domains to serve SSL traffic over the same IP address by including the hostname viewers are trying to connect to. As with Dedicated IP Custom SSL, CloudFront delivers content from each Amazon CloudFront edge location and with the same security as the Dedicated IP Custom SSL feature. SNI Custom SSL works with most modern browsers, including Chrome version 6 and later (running on Windows XP and later or OS X 10.5.7 and later), Safari version 3 and later (running on Windows Vista and later or Mac OS X 10.5.6. and later), Firefox 2.0 and later, and Internet Explorer 7 and later (running on Windows Vista and later). Older browsers that do not support SNI cannot establish a connection with CloudFront to load the HTTPS version of your content. SNI Custom SSL is available at no additional cost beyond standard CloudFront data transfer and request fees.
Q. What is Server Name Indication?
Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This mechanism identifies the domain (server name) of the associated SSL request so the proper certificate can be used in the SSL handshake. This allows a single IP address to be used across multiple servers. SNI requires browser support to add the server name, and while most modern browsers support it, there are a few legacy browsers that do not. For more details see the SNI section of the CloudFront Developer Guide or the SNI Wikipedia article.
Q. Does CloudFront Integrate with AWS Certificate Manager?
Yes, you can now provision SSL/TLS certificates and associate them with CloudFront distributions within minutes. Simply provision a certificate using the new AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and deploy it to your CloudFront distribution with a couple of clicks, and let ACM manage certificate renewals for you. ACM allows you to provision, deploy, and manage the certificate with no additional charges.
Note that CloudFront still supports using certificates that you obtained from a third-party certificate authority and uploaded to the IAM certificate store.
Q. Does Amazon CloudFront support access controls for paid or private content?
Yes, Amazon CloudFront has an optional private content feature. When this option is enabled, Amazon CloudFront will only deliver files when you say it is okay to do so by securely signing your requests. Learn more about this feature by reading the CloudFront Developer Guide.
Q. How can I safeguard my web applications delivered via CloudFront from DDoS attacks?
As an AWS customer, you get AWS Shield Standard at no additional cost. AWS Shield is a managed service that provides protection against DDoS attacks for web applications running on AWS. AWS Shield Standard provides protection for all AWS customers against common and most frequently occurring Infrastructure (layer 3 and 4) attacks like SYN/UDP Floods, Reflection attacks, and others to support high availability of your applications on AWS.
AWS Shield Advanced is an optional paid service available to AWS Business Support and AWS Enterprise Support customers. AWS Shield Advanced provides additional protections against larger and more sophisticated attacks for your applications running on Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront and Route 53.
Q. How can I protect my web applications delivered via CloudFront?
You can integrate your CloudFront distribution with AWS WAF, a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from attacks by allowing you to configure rules based on IP addresses, HTTP headers, and custom URI strings. Using these rules, AWS WAF can block, allow, or monitor (count) web requests for your web application. Please see AWS WAF Developer Guide for more information. 





  Caching 





Q. Can I add or modify request headers forwarded to the origin?
Yes, you can configure Amazon CloudFront to add custom headers, or override the value of existing headers, to requests forwarded to your origin. You can use these headers to help validate that requests made to your origin were sent from CloudFront; you can even configure your origin to only allow requests that contain the custom header values you specify. Additionally, if you use multiple CloudFront distributions with the same origin, you can use custom headers to distinguish origin request made by each different distribution. Finally, custom headers can be used to help determine the right CORS headers returned for your requests. You can configure custom headers via the CloudFront API and the AWS Management Console. There are no additional charges for this feature. For more details on how to set your custom headers, you can read more here.
Q. How does Amazon CloudFront handle HTTP cookies?
Amazon CloudFront supports delivery of dynamic content that is customized or personalized using HTTP cookies. To use this feature, you specify whether you want Amazon CloudFront to forward some or all of your cookies to your custom origin server. Amazon CloudFront then considers the forwarded cookie values when identifying a unique object in its cache. This way, your end users get both the benefit of content that is personalized just for them with a cookie and the performance benefits of Amazon CloudFront. You can also optionally choose to log the cookie values in Amazon CloudFront access logs.
Q. How does Amazon CloudFront handle query string parameters in the URL?
A query string may be optionally configured to be part of the cache key for identifying objects in the Amazon CloudFront cache. This helps you build dynamic web pages (e.g. search results) that may be cached at the edge for some amount of time.
Q. Can I specify which query parameters to use in the cache key?
Yes, query string whitelisting feature allows you to easily configure Amazon CloudFront to only use certain parameters in the cache key, while still forwarding all the parameters to the origin.
Q. Is there a limit to the number of query parameters that can be whitelisted?
Yes, you can configure Amazon CloudFront to whitelist up to 10 query parameters.
Q. What parameter types are supported?
Amazon CloudFront supports URI query parameters as defined in section 3.4 of RFC3986. Specifically, it supports query parameters embedded in an HTTP GET string after the ‘?’ character, and delimited by the ‘&’ character.
Q. Does CloudFront support gzip compression?
Yes, CloudFront will automatically compress your text or binary data. To use the feature, simply specify within your cache behavior settings that you would like CloudFront to compress objects automatically and ensure that your client adds Accept-Encoding: gzip in the request header (most modern web browser do this by default)..For more information on this feature, please refer to our developer guide.





  Streaming 





Q. What is streaming? Why would I want to stream my content?
Generally, streaming refers to delivering audio and video to end users on the internet without having to download the media file prior to playback. The protocols used for streaming include proprietary ones such as Adobe’s Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) and those that use HTTP for delivery such as Apple’s HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), Adobe’s HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS) and Microsoft’s Smooth Streaming. These protocols are different than the delivery of web pages and other content because streaming protocols deliver content in real time – the viewers watch the bytes as they are delivered. Streaming content has several potential benefits for you and your end-users:

Streaming can give viewers more control over their viewing experience. For instance, it is easier for a viewer to seek forward in a video using streaming than using traditional download delivery.
Streaming can give you more control over your content, as no file remains on the viewer's computer when they finish watching a video.
Streaming can help you reduce your costs, as it only delivers portions of a media file that the viewers actually watch. In contrast, with traditional downloads, frequently the whole media file will be downloaded by the viewers, even if they only watch a portion of the file.

Q. Does Amazon CloudFront support on-demand streaming protocols?
Yes, Amazon CloudFront provides you with multiple options to deliver on-demand content. If you have media files that have been converted to either HLS format or Microsoft Smooth Streaming format prior to storing in Amazon S3 (or a custom origin), you can use an Amazon CloudFront web distribution to stream in that format without having to run any media servers. In addition you can also run a third party streaming server (e.g. Wowza Media Server available on AWS Marketplace) on Amazon EC2 which can convert a media file to the required HTTP streaming format. This server can then be designated as the origin for an Amazon CloudFront web distribution. Another option, if you want to stream using RTMP, is to store your media files on Amazon S3 and use it as the origin for an Amazon CloudFront RTMP distribution.
Q. Does Amazon CloudFront support live streaming to multiple platforms?
Yes. Amazon CloudFront provides you three options to easily and cost-effectively deliver live events over HTTP to multiple platforms:
Live Streaming using Wowza Media Server 3.6: Using Amazon CloudFront with Wowza Media Server combines the benefits of Wowza Media Server with the reliability, scalability, low latency and cost-efficiency of Amazon CloudFront to stream live events to multiple streaming formats, including Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS) and Microsoft Smooth Streaming. We've made this simple for you by creating an AWS CloudFormation template that handles all of the provisioning and sequencing for all the AWS resources you need for this live streaming stack. Amazon CloudFront provides you the scale and flexible pay-as-you-go pricing model, while the use of HTTP protocols for streaming your live event offers your viewers easy access to your live content. Using Amazon CloudFront for live streaming also gives you full control of your Wowza origin server so you can configure it to best work with the specific nature of your event. In addition, you can choose the Amazon EC2 instance type and AWS region that best meet the needs of your live event. A detailed tutorial for setting-up live HTTP streaming using Amazon CloudFront is available here.
Live Streaming using Adobe Media Server 5.0: Amazon CloudFront can be used with Amazon EC2 running Adobe Media Server (AMS 5.0) for live HTTP streaming to both Flash Player and Apple iOS devices. Amazon EC2 (running AMS 5.0) must be configured as the origin for a CloudFront web distribution. Similar to our other live streaming solutions we have setup an AWS CloudFormation template to make it easy for you to setup your pay-as-you-go streaming stack while providing you with full control of the AMS server running in the Amazon EC2 instances provisioned. A detailed tutorial (which also points to the AWS CloudFormation templates) for setting-up live HTTP streaming using CloudFront and AMS 5.0 is available here.
Live Streaming using Windows Media Services: You can also use Amazon CloudFront and Amazon EC2 running Windows Media Services for live streaming. With this solution, you can deliver live media over HTTP to both Microsoft Silverlight clients and Apple iOS devices. We've made it simple to get started by creating a tutorial and an AWS CloudFormation template to automate the provisioning of AWS resources for your live streaming stack. You only pay for the AWS resources you consume, and have full control over the origin server (Amazon EC2 instance running Windows Media Services) so you can configure additional IIS Live Smooth Streaming functionality.





  Limits 





Q. Can I use Amazon CloudFront if I expect usage peaks higher than 10 Gbps or 15,000 RPS?
Yes. Complete our request for higher limits here, and we will add more capacity to your account within two business days.
Q: Is there a limit to the number of distributions my Amazon CloudFront account may deliver?
For the current limit on the number of distributions that you can create for each AWS account, see Amazon CloudFront Limits in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. To request a higher limit, please go to the CloudFront Limit Increase Form. 
Q: What is the maximum size of a file that can be delivered through Amazon CloudFront?
The maximum size of a single file that can be delivered through Amazon CloudFront is 20 GB. This limit applies to all Amazon CloudFront distributions.





  Logging and Reporting 





Q: Can I get access to request logs for content delivered through Amazon CloudFront?
Yes. When you create or modify a CloudFront distribution, you can enable access logging. When enabled, this feature will automatically write detailed log information in a W3C extended format into an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. Access logs contain detailed information about each request for your content, including the object requested, the date and time of the request, the edge location serving the request, the client IP address, the referrer, the user agent, the cookie header, and the result type (for example, cache hit/miss/error).
Q: Does Amazon CloudFront offer ready-to-use reports so I can learn more about my usage, viewers, and content being served?
Yes. Whether it's receiving detailed cache statistics reports, monitoring your CloudFront usage, seeing where your customers are viewing your content from, or setting near real-time alarms on operational metrics, Amazon CloudFront offers a variety of solutions for your reporting needs. You can access all our reporting options by visiting the Amazon CloudFront Reporting & Analytics dashboard in the AWS Management Console. You can also learn more about our various reporting options by viewing Amazon CloudFront's Reports & Analytics page.
Q: Can I tag my distributions?
Yes. Amazon CloudFront supports cost allocation tagging. Tags make it easier for you to allocate costs and optimize spending by categorizing and grouping AWS resources. For example, you can use tags to group resources by administrator, application name, cost center, or a specific project. To learn more about cost allocation tagging, see Using Cost Allocation Tags. If you are ready to add tags to you CloudFront distributions, see Amazon CloudFront Add Tags page.
Q: Can I get a history of all Amazon CloudFront API calls made on my account for security, operational or compliance auditing?
Yes. To receive a history of all Amazon CloudFront API calls made on your account, you simply turn on AWS CloudTrail in the CloudTrail's AWS Management Console. For more information, visit AWS CloudTrail home page.
Q: Do you have options for monitoring and alarming metrics in real time?
You can monitor, alarm and receive notifications on the operational performance of your Amazon CloudFront distributions within just a few minutes of the viewer request using Amazon CloudWatch. CloudFront automatically publishes six operational metrics, each at 1-minute granularity, into Amazon CloudWatch. You can then use CloudWatch to set alarms on any abnormal patterns in your CloudFront traffic. To learn how to get started monitoring CloudFront activity and setting alarms via CloudWatch, please view our walkthrough in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide or simply navigate to the Amazon CloudFront Management Console and select Monitoring & Alarming in the navigation pane.





  Lambda@Edge 






Q: What is Lambda@Edge?

Lambda@Edge allows you to run code at global AWS edge locations without provisioning or managing servers, responding to end users at the lowest network latency. You just upload your Node.js code to AWS Lambda and configure your function to be triggered in response to Amazon CloudFront requests (i.e., when a viewer request lands, when a request is forwarded to or received back from the origin, and right before responding back to the end user). The code is then ready to execute at every AWS edge location when a request for content is received, and scales with the volume of requests across CloudFront edge locations. Learn more in our documentation.
Q. How do I customize content with Lambda@Edge?
Once you have identified a content delivery decision you would like to make at the CloudFront edge, identify which cache behaviors, and what point in the request flow the logic applies to (i.e., when a viewer request lands, when a request is forwarded to or received back from the origin, or right before responding back to the end viewer). Next, write a Node.js Lambda function using the Lambda console or API, and associate it with the selected CloudFront trigger event for your distribution. Once saved, the next time an applicable request is made to your distribution, the function is propagated to the CloudFront edge, and will scale and execute as needed. Learn more in our documentation.
What events can be triggered with Amazon CloudFront?
Your functions will automatically trigger in response to the following Amazon CloudFront events:

Viewer Request - This event occurs when an end user or a device on the Internet makes an HTTP(S) request to CloudFront, and the request arrives at the edge location closest to that user.
Viewer Response - This event occurs when the CloudFront server at the edge is ready to respond to the end user or the device that made the request.
Origin Request - This event occurs when the CloudFront edge server does not already have the requested object in its cache, and the viewer request is ready to be sent to your backend origin webserver (e.g. Amazon EC2, or Application Load Balancer, or Amazon S3).
Origin Response - This event occurs when the CloudFront server at the edge receives a response from your backend origin webserver.






  IPv6 





Q. What is IPv6?
Every server and device connected to the Internet must have a numeric Internet Protocol (IP) address. As the Internet and the number of people using it grows exponentially, so does the need for IP addresses. IPv6 is a new version of the Internet Protocol that uses a larger address space than its predecessor IPv4. Under IPv4, every IP address is 32 bits long, which allows 4.3 billion unique addresses. An example IPv4 address is 192.0.2.1. In comparison, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits, which allow for approximately three hundred and forty trillion, trillion unique IP addresses. An example IPv6 address is: 2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:0370:7334
Q. What can I do with IPv6?
Using IPv6 support for Amazon CloudFront, your applications can connect to Amazon CloudFront edge locations without needing any IPv6 to IPv4 translation software or systems. You can meet the requirements for IPv6 adoption set by governments - including the U.S. Federal government – and benefit from IPv6 extensibility, simplicity in network management, and additional built-in support for security.
Q. Should I expect a change in Amazon CloudFront performance when using IPv6?
No, you will see the same performance when using either IPv4 or IPv6 with Amazon CloudFront.
Q: Are there any Amazon CloudFront features that will not work with IPv6?
All existing features of Amazon CloudFront will continue to work on IPv6, though there are two changes you may need for internal IPv6 address processing before you turn on IPv6 for your distributions.

If you have turned on the Amazon CloudFront Access Logs feature, you will start seeing your viewer’s IPv6 address in the “c-ip” field and may need to verify that your log processing systems continue to work for IPv6.
When you enable IPv6 for your Amazon CloudFront distribution, you will get IPv6 addresses in the ‘X-Forwarded-For’ header that is sent to your origins. If your origin systems are only able to process IPv4 addresses, you may need to verify that your origin systems continue to work for IPv6.

Additionally, if you use IP whitelists for Trusted Signers, you should use an IPv4-only distribution for your Trusted Signer URLs with IP whitelists and an IPv4 / IPv6 distribution for all other content. This model sidesteps an issue that would arise if the signing request arrived over an IPv4 address and was signed as such, only to have the request for the content arrive via a different IPv6 address that is not on the whitelist.
To learn more about IPv6 support in Amazon CloudFront, see “IPv6 support on Amazon CloudFront” in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.
Q: Does that mean if I want to use IPv6 at all I cannot use Trusted Signer URLs with IP whitelist?
No. If you want to use IPv6 and Trusted Signer URLs with IP whitelist you should use two separate distributions. You should dedicate a distribution exclusively to your Trusted Signer URLs with IP whitelist and disable IPv6 for that distribution. You would then use another distribution for all other content, which will work with both IPv4 and IPv6.
Q. If I enable IPv6, will the IPv6 address appear in the Access Log?
Yes, your viewer’s IPv6 addresses will now be shown in the “c-ip” field of the access logs, if you have the Amazon CloudFront Access Logs feature enabled. You may need to verify that your log processing systems continue to work for IPv6 addresses before you turn on IPv6 for your distributions. Please contact Developer Support if you have any issues with IPv6 traffic impacting your tool or software’s ability to handle IPv6 addresses in access logs. For more details, please refer to the Amazon CloudFront Access Logs documentation.
Q: Can I disable IPv6 for all my new distributions?
Yes, for both new and existing distributions, you can use the Amazon CloudFront console or API to enable / disable IPv6 per distribution.
Q: Are there any reasons why I would want to disable IPv6?
In discussions with customers, the only common case we heard about was internal IP address processing. When you enable IPv6 for your Amazon CloudFront distribution, in addition to getting an IPv6 address in your detailed access logs, you will get IPv6 addresses in the ‘X-Forwarded-For’ header that is sent to your origins. If your origin systems are only able to process IPv4 addresses, you may need to verify that your origin systems continue to work for IPv6 addresses before you turn on IPv6 for your distributions.
Q: I enabled IPv6 for my distribution but a DNS lookup doesn’t return any IPv6 addresses. What is happening?
Amazon CloudFront has very diverse connectivity around the globe, but there are still certain networks that do not have ubiquitous IPv6 connectivity. While the long term future of the Internet is obviously IPv6, for the foreseeable future every endpoint on the Internet will have IPv4 connectivity. When we find parts of the Internet that have better IPv4 connectivity than IPv6, we will prefer the former.
Q: If I use Route 53 to handle my DNS needs and I created an alias record pointing to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, do I need to update my alias records to enable IPv6?
Yes, you can create Route 53 alias records pointing to your Amazon CloudFront distribution to support both IPv4 and IPv6 by using “A” and “AAAA” record type respectively. If you want to enable IPv4 only, you need only one alias record with type “A”. For details on alias resource record sets, please refer to the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.  





  Billing 





Q. How will I be charged for my use of Amazon CloudFront?
Amazon CloudFront charges are based on actual usage of the service in four areas: Data Transfer Out, HTTP/HTTPS Requests, Invalidation Requests, and Dedicated IP Custom SSL certificates associated with a CloudFront distribution.
With the AWS Free Usage Tier, you can get started with Amazon CloudFront for free. Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive 50 GB Data Transfer Out and 2,000,000 HTTP and HTTPS Requests for Amazon CloudFront each month for one year. 

Data Transfer Out to Internet You will be charged for the volume of data transferred out of the Amazon CloudFront edge locations, measured in GB. If you are using other Amazon Web Services as the origins of your files, you will be charged separately for use of those services, including for storage, compute hours, GET requests and data transfer out of that service to Amazon CloudFront’s edge locations. Usage tiers for data transfer are measured separately for each geographic region. You can see the rates for Amazon CloudFront data transfer to the Internet here.
Data Transfer Out to Origin You will be charged for the volume of data transferred out, measured in GB, from the Amazon CloudFront edge locations to your origin (both AWS origins and other origin servers). You can see the rates for Amazon CloudFront data transfer to Origin here.
HTTP/HTTPS Requests You will be charged for number of HTTP/HTTPS requests made to Amazon CloudFront for your content. You can see the rates for HTTP/HTTPS requests here.
Invalidation Requests You are charged per path in your invalidation request. A path listed in your invalidation request represents the URL (or multiple URLs if the path contains a wildcard character) of the object you want to invalidate from CloudFront cache. You can request up to 1,000 paths each month from Amazon CloudFront at no additional charge. Beyond the first 1,000 paths, you will be charged per path listed in your invalidation requests. You can see the rates for invalidation requests here.
Dedicated IP Custom SSL You pay $600 per month for each custom SSL certificate associated with one or more CloudFront distributions using the Dedicated IP version of custom SSL certificate support. This monthly fee is pro-rated by the hour. For example, if you had your custom SSL certificate associated with at least one CloudFront distribution for just 24 hours (i.e. 1 day) in the month of June, your total charge for using the custom SSL certificate feature in June will be (1 day / 30 days) * $600 = $20. To use Dedicated IP Custom SSL certificate support, upload a SSL certificate and use the AWS Management Console to associate it with your CloudFront distributions. If you need to associate more than two custom SSL certificates with your CloudFront distribution, please include details about your use case and the number of custom SSL certificates you intend to use in the CloudFront Limit Increase Form. 

Usage tiers for data transfer are measured separately for each geographic region. The prices above are exclusive of applicable taxes, fees, or similar governmental charges, if any exist, except as otherwise noted. 
Q: Does your prices include taxes?
Except as otherwise noted, our prices are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including VAT and applicable sales tax. For customers with a Japanese billing address, use of AWS services is subject to Japanese Consumption Tax. Learn more.
Q: How am I charged for 304 responses?
A 304 is a response to a conditional GET request and will result in a charge for the HTTP/HTTPS request and the Data Transfer Out to Internet. A 304 response does not contain a message-body; however, the HTTP headers will consume some bandwidth for which you would be charged standard CloudFront data transfer fees. The amount of data transfer depends on the headers associated with your object.
Q. Can I choose to only serve content from less expensive Amazon CloudFront regions?
Yes, "Price Classes" provides you an option to lower the prices you pay to deliver content out of Amazon CloudFront. By default, Amazon CloudFront minimizes end user latency by delivering content from its entire global network of edge locations. However, because we charge more where our costs are higher, this means that you pay more to deliver your content with low latency to end-users in some locations. Price Classes let you reduce your delivery prices by excluding Amazon CloudFront’s more expensive edge locations from your Amazon CloudFront distribution. In these cases, Amazon CloudFront will deliver your content from edge locations within the locations in the price class you selected and charge you the data transfer and request pricing from the actual location where the content was delivered.
If performance is most important to you, you don’t need to do anything; your content will be delivered by our whole network of locations. However, if you wish to use another Price Class, you can configure your distribution through the AWS Management Console or via the Amazon CloudFront API. If you select a price class that does not include all locations, some of your viewers, especially those in geographic locations that are not in your price class, may experience higher latency than if your content were being served from all Amazon CloudFront locations.
Note that Amazon CloudFront may still occasionally serve requests for your content from an edge location in a location that is not included in your price class. When this occurs, you will only be charged the rates for the least expensive location in your price class.
You can see the list of locations making up each price class here.

  Amazon CloudFront - Dynamic Content Delivery 










Deliver personalized, dynamic web content at no additional cost without writing new code 




A typical website generally contains a mix of static and dynamic content. Static content includes images or style sheets; dynamic or application generated content includes elements of your site that are personalized to each viewer. Previously, developers who wanted to improve the performance and reliability of their dynamic content had limited options, as the solutions offered by traditional CDNs are expensive, hard to configure and difficult to manage.  








  Deliver Dynamic Content With Amazon CloudFront

With Amazon CloudFront, there are no additional costs for serving dynamic content beyond Amazon CloudFront’s existing low prices for data transfer and requests, and no required long term commitments for use. There are also no up-front fees, no monthly platform fees, and no need to hire expensive consultants to help with configuration.

  Deliver Your Dynamic Content Globally With Amazon CloudFront 





Amazon CloudFront offers a simple, cost-effective way to improve the performance, reliability and global reach of your entire website for both static content and the dynamic portions of your site that change for each end user.
Amazon CloudFront works seamlessly with dynamic web applications running in Amazon EC2 or your origin running outside of AWS without any custom coding or proprietary configurations, making the service simple to deploy and manage. You can use a single Amazon CloudFront distribution to deliver your entire website, including both static and dynamic (or interactive) content. This means that you can continue to use a single domain name (e.g., www.example) for your entire website without the need to separate your static and dynamic content or manage multiple domain names on your website.
Amazon CloudFront enables you to include query string parameters or cookies to help customize your web pages for each viewer. You can also configure multiple cache behaviors for your web distribution based on URL patterns on your website. These cache behaviors give you granular control over how you want Amazon CloudFront to cache different portions of your website.
These features are described in more detail below: 





  Cache Behaviors 





A cache behavior is the set of rules you configure for a given URL pattern based on file extensions, file names, or any portion of a URL path on your website (e.g., *.jpg). You can configure multiple cache behaviors for your web distribution. Amazon CloudFront will match incoming viewer requests with your list of URL patterns, and if there is a match, the service will honor the cache behavior you configure for that URL pattern. Each cache behavior can include the following Amazon CloudFront configuration values: origin server name, viewer connection protocol, minimum expiration period, query string parameters, cookies, and trusted signers for private content. 





  Device Detection 





Amazon CloudFront edge locations can look at the value of the User Agent header to detect the device type of all the incoming requests. Amazon CloudFront can determine whether the end user request came from a Desktop, Tablet, Smart TV, or Mobile device and pass that information in the form of new HTTP Headers to your origin server - Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, or your custom origin server. Your origin server can use the device type information to generate different versions of the content based on the new headers. Amazon CloudFront will also cache the different versions of the content at that edge location. 





  Geo Targeting 





Amazon CloudFront can also detect the country where the end users are accessing your content from. Amazon CloudFront can then pass the information about the country in a new HTTP header to your custom origin server. Your origin server can generate different versions of the content for users in different countries and cache these different versions at the edge location to serve subsequent users visiting your website from the same country. 





  Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) 





Amazon CloudFront may be configured to forward the Origin header value so your origin server (Amazon S3 or a custom origin) can support cross-origin access via CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). CORS defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. 





  Origin Servers 





You can configure one or more origin servers for your Amazon CloudFront download distribution. Origin servers can be an AWS resource, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, or a custom origin server outside of AWS. Amazon CloudFront will request content from each origin server by matching the URLs requested by the viewer with rules you configure for your distribution. This feature allows you the flexibility to use each AWS resource for what it’s designed for – Amazon S3 for storage, Amazon EC2 for compute, etc. – without the need to create multiple distributions and manage multiple domain names on your website. You can also continue to use origin servers you already have set-up without the need to move data or re-deploy your application code. 





  Low TTLs 





Amazon CloudFront uses the expiration period you set on your files (through cache control headers) to determine whether it needs to check the origin for an updated version of the file. If you expect that your files will change frequently, you can set a short expiration period on the file. Amazon CloudFront accepts expiration periods as short as 0 seconds (in which case Amazon CloudFront will revalidate each viewer request with the origin). Amazon CloudFront also honors special cache control directives such as private, no-store, etc.; these are often useful when delivering dynamic content that may not be cached at the edge. 





  Query String Parameters 





Query string parameters are often used to return customized content generated by a script running on the origin server. You can optionally configure query strings to be forwarded to the origin servers and be included in the unique identity of the cached object. This feature can be enabled separately for each unique cache behavior you configure. Query string parameters can thus help you customize your web pages for each viewer while still taking advantage of the performance and scale benefits offered by caching content at Amazon CloudFront edge locations.  





  HTTP Cookies 





Amazon CloudFront supports delivery of dynamic content that is customized or personalized using HTTP cookies. To use this feature, you specify whether you want Amazon CloudFront to forward some or all of your cookies to your custom origin server. You may also specify wildcard characters in the cookie name to forward multiple cookies matching a string format. Amazon CloudFront then considers the forwarded cookie values when identifying a unique object in its cache. This way, your end users get both the benefit of content that is personalized just for them with a cookie and the performance benefits of Amazon CloudFront. 





  Forward Headers to Origin 





You can use Amazon CloudFront to forward all (or a whitelist of) request headers to your origin server. These headers contain information such as the device used by your visitors or the country from which they accessed your content. You can configure CloudFront to cache your content based on the values in the headers, so you can deliver customized content to your viewers. For example, if you are hosting multiple websites on the same web server, you can configure Amazon CloudFront to forward the Host header to your origin. When your origin returns different versions of the same object based on the values in the Host header, Amazon CloudFront will cache the objects separately based on those values. 





  Custom SSL 





Custom SSL certificate support lets you deliver content over HTTPS using your own domain name and your own SSL certificate. This gives visitors to your website the security benefits of CloudFront over an SSL connection that uses your own domain name in addition to lower latency and higher reliability. You can also configure CloudFront to use HTTPS connections for origin fetches so that your data is encrypted end-to-end from your origin to your end users. Configuring Custom SSL certificate support is easy; you don’t need to learn any proprietary code or hire any consultants to configure it for you. Get started by visiting the CloudFront Custom SSL detail page and choosing the Custom SSL feature that best fits your needs.
You can provision SSL/TLS certificates and associate them with CloudFront distributions within minutes. Simply provision a certificate using the new AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and deploy it to your CloudFront distribution with a couple of clicks, and let ACM manage certificate renewals for you. ACM allows you to provision, deploy, and manage the certificate with no additional charges. 





  Zone Apex Support 





You can use CloudFront to deliver content from the root domain, or "zone apex" of your website. For example, you can configure both http://www.example.com and http://example.com to point at the same CloudFront distribution, without the performance penalty or availability risk of managing a redirect service. To use this feature, you create an Amazon Route 53 Alias record to map the root of your domain to your CloudFront distribution. 





  Protocol Detection 





You can configure Amazon CloudFront to include the protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS) of your end user’s request as part of the cache key to uniquely identify an object in cache. This allows you to customize your content based on the protocol your end users are using to access your content. 





  HTTP Verb Support 





Amazon CloudFront supports the following HTTP methods: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, and PATCH. This means you can improve the performance of dynamic websites that have web forms, comment and login boxes, “add to cart” buttons or other features that upload data from end users. It also means you can now use a single domain name to deliver your whole website through CloudFront thereby accelerating both the download and upload parts of your website. By default, the response to GET and HEAD methods will be cached at CloudFront edge locations. You may choose to configure your Amazon CloudFront distribution to cache the response for the OPTIONS request. Other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH) are not cached and simply proxied to the origin by Amazon CloudFront edge locations. You may need to enable support for these additional HTTP methods for you existing CloudFront distributions using the AWS Management Console or the CloudFront API. 
In addition, the full suite of Amazon CloudFront’s capabilities is available for you to use when configuring Amazon CloudFront to deliver a dynamic website. These capabilities include serving private content, secure delivery of content, object versioning and cache invalidation, access logs for usage reporting and monitoring, etc. To learn more about all Amazon CloudFront features, please refer to the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.
Amazon CloudFront also offers a Service Level Agreement (SLA) which provides for a service credit if a customer’s monthly uptime percentage is below our service commitment in any billing cycle. More information can be found on the Amazon CloudFront SLA page.
In addition to this page, other pages that you might find of interest include the Amazon CloudFront product page and the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. 










  Amazon CloudFront Performance 





Amazon CloudFront has implemented several performance optimizations that accelerate the delivery of your entire website (including both dynamic and static content) from the origin to your end users. These performance improvements include maintaining persistent connections with the origin and other network path optimizations to speed up the delivery of dynamic content. Specifically, each of your end users is routed to the Amazon CloudFront edge location closest to them, in terms of internet latency. Then, their requests are carried back to your origin server running in AWS on connections that Amazon monitors and optimizes for performance. 
 Amazon CloudFront also reuses existing connections between the Amazon CloudFront edge and the origin server reducing connection setup latency for each origin request. Other connection optimizations are also applied to avoid internet bottlenecks and fully utilize available bandwidth between the edge location and the viewer. This means that Amazon CloudFront can speed-up the delivery of your dynamic content and provide your viewers with a consistent and reliable, yet personalized experience when navigating your web application. Amazon CloudFront also applies the same performance benefits to upload requests as those applied to the requests for downloading dynamic content.
 Frost & Sullivan White Paper on Amazon CloudFront performanceAWS recently commissioned Frost & Sullivan to write a white paper on Amazon CloudFront performance compared to other top-tier CDNs. The paper, authored by CDN expert Dan Rayburn, provides comparative performance data that concludes that Amazon CloudFront is fastest among top CDNs in several latency tests and beats the average latency of other top CDNs in all tests. The paper also presents results of tests run on the Amazon.com site (which runs performance testing on several top CDNs) and notes why the vast majority of CDN traffic on the Amazon.com site is currently served by Amazon CloudFront Download the paper. 










  Amazon CloudFront Ease of Use 





Amazon CloudFront works seamlessly with dynamic web applications running in Amazon EC2 or your origin running outside of AWS without any custom coding or proprietary configurations, making the service simple to deploy and manage. You can use a single Amazon CloudFront distribution to deliver your entire website, including both static and dynamic or interactive content. This means that you can continue to use a single domain name (e.g., www.example) for your entire website without the need to separate your static and dynamic content or manage multiple domain names on your website. 
 You can interact with Amazon CloudFront through the AWS Management Console’s simple graphical user interface. Or, a single API call lets you get started distributing content from your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EC2 instance or other origin server through the Amazon CloudFront network. Any changes you make to your existing configuration take effect across the entire global network within minutes. Plus, since there’s no need to negotiate with a sales person, you can get started quickly and begin delivering your entire website using Amazon CloudFront. 




Configuring Amazon CloudFront in the AWS Management Console 











Amazon CloudFront is also designed for use with other Amazon Web Services. When using Amazon EC2 as your Amazon CloudFront origin server, you get the benefit of working with the same set of tools to configure and manage the delivery of your entire web application. In addition, Amazon EC2 offers the same pay-as-you-go and pay-for-use pricing model as Amazon CloudFront. Plus, the routes between Amazon CloudFront edge locations and Amazon EC2 data centers are constantly monitored and optimized for performance and availability. Any issues with these network routes are quickly detected and fixed or viewers are automatically routed to another Amazon monitored network route, minimizing impact to viewers of your applications. 










  Amazon CloudFront Dynamic Content Use Cases 






  E-Commerce/Travel 





Web applications here are highly personalized (e.g. recommendations) and fast discovery of products (via search and browse) is critical. Performance improvements for applications here translate directly into revenue and end user loyalty.  





  News & Sports 





With shorter attention span of end users, news and sports applications need to be customized to each end user. Yet, this content can be cached for short periods of time (e.g. a few seconds) to help scalability and improve performance for end users. 





  Local/Weather 





Web applications here have a geographic focus in customizing content for end users. Content can be cached at edge locations for varying lengths of time depending on type of content. For example, hourly weather updates can be cached for up to an hour, while urgent weather alerts may only be cached for a few seconds so end users always have the most up to date information available to them. 





  Advertising 





Targeted ads are computed on-the-fly based on cookie or query string data, and advertisers generally need low latency in serving ads. Amazon CloudFront can help meet the performance and personalization needs for such applications. 





  Social Media 





Applications here also have personalized and interactive content integrating user profiles, preferences, friends and activities. The result of these features is long-tail content that requires frequent trips to the origin servers. CloudFront’s network and path optimizations can help make the delivery of such content faster, helping social media applications perform better. 





  Earth Networks 









Earth Networks provides consumers and businesses weather and atmospheric data. Millions of users turn to the company’s WeatherBug products, which include mobile and desktop apps and the website www.weatherbug.com.
Earth Networks uses a CDN so that they can provide dynamic and personalized web based content quickly to their users with very low latency and high performing response times. Specifically, they need to be able to provide local information to the end user, in near real time, and need a CDN that allows them to adjust things like time to live, query strings, and cookie information so that they can pass all that information back to the origin to pull just what the user needs. 
“As a provider of weather information at the neighborhood level, there’s no way we could use a CDN that did not provide us with both dynamic content and the ability to optimize under things such as query strings, cookies and low TTLS. Our use case spans the entire array of features that CloudFront provides,” says Andy Rosenbaum, Director of Web and Desktop Development at Earth Networks - WeatherBug. “One of the challenges we had with our previous CDN is that we needed to have code written that was specific to that CDN, which caused our development costs to be higher. We were able to achieve the same level of performance without having to write customized code. We’re seeing about a 50% reduction in cost with an equivalent baseline in performance that we saw with our previous CDN and ultimately we’re anticipating about 20% reduction in Amazon EC2 origin instances under CloudFront.”

  Amazon CloudFront delivers Mars on Earth 









On August 5, 2012, NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity landed on the Red Planet and the entire landing experience was made available to viewers around the world via the mars.jpl.nasa.gov website. NASA JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) delivered the entire landing website experience using Amazon CloudFront. This included the regular HTTP website content with blogging and status updates, the static images with pictures from Mars, and the interactive unity gaming engine downloads where visitors could participate at home by driving the Mars rover and interact with real data from Mars in near real time. 
 Performance and scalability were very important to JPL and they utilized Amazon CloudFront features such as query strings, low TTLs, multiple origins and multiple cache behaviors to help speed up the delivery of the entire http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/ website while continuing to use different AWS services as origin servers for different types of content on the website. 
 Tom Soderstrom, CTO of NASA/JPL said that because of so many unknowns, they ended up using many of the CloudFront scalability and real-time tuning features. He further said that during the landing, the Curiosity landing was more popular than the Olympics based on the traffic served, so the tuning features were indeed needed and worked well.
 You can visit the website at http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/.  











 














  Amazon CloudFront Pricing 





Amazon CloudFront is helping make premium and innovative content delivery features that other CDNs sell at high prices much less expensive and much easier to use. There are no additional costs for serving dynamic content beyond Amazon CloudFront’s existing low prices for data transfer and requests, and no required long-term commitments for use. There are also no up-front fees, no monthly platform fees, and no need to hire expensive consultants to help with configuration.
You can get started by simply signing-up on this website and creating an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve your static and dynamic content within minutes. If you prefer, you can also speak with a member of the Amazon CloudFront sales team to discuss your usage and ways you can save further by using the option to commit to a monthly usage level for 12 months or longer. You can contact the Amazon CloudFront sales team by submitting this form: http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/aws-sales/.
Amazon CloudFront also offers a Service Level Agreement (SLA) which provides for a service credit if a customer’s monthly uptime percentage is below our service commitment in any billing cycle. More information can be found on the Amazon CloudFront SLA page.
Pay only for what you use. There is no minimum fee. Estimate your monthly bill using the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator.

History[edit]
1985 to 2000[edit]
In 1985, Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc created a subsidiary named Kiewit Diversified Group to manage the corporation's business that was not related to construction. The division was spun off as a separate entity and changed its name to Level 3 Communications in 1998 to signify an increased focus on communication services. That same year saw it make an IPO on NASDAQ. According to Level3's own history, it continued to build its telecommunications network after going public.[7]
2001 to 2010[edit]
According to Level3's own history, in 2003, the company acquired Genuity, and, between 2005 and 2007, it purchased several other companies including former rivals WilTel Communications, Broadwing Corporation, Looking Glass Networks, Progress Telecom, and Telcove (formerly Adelphia Business Solutions).[7] In 2004, Level 3 acquired ICG Communications' wholesale dial-up business for $35 million. Then, in 2006, Level 3 purchased the rest of ICG Communications for $163 million, taking over ICG's fiber network and nationwide Points of Presence (PoPs). It then integrated these companies through 2010.
2010 to present[edit]
On April 11, 2011, Level 3 announced a tender offer had been made to acquire fellow Tier 1 provider Global Crossing[8] in an all-stock transaction,[9] which was approved by shareholders On August 5.[10] and completed on October 4, 2011. On October 20, 2011, Level 3 Communications reduced its total shares and transferred its stock listing from NASDAQ to the larger New York Stock Exchange.[11]
On May 14, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by European content provider Voxility to provide 250 Gbit/s or more to Voxility's three main data centers in North America and Europe.[12] On May 7, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency to provide fiber-cable operations and maintenance, and IP-based infrastructure under a ten-year, indefinite contract with a maximum value of approximately $411 million.[13]
On June 16, 2014, Level 3 acquired TW Telecom, a business Internet connection provider, for about $5.7 billion.[14]
In July 2015, Level 3 acquired Black Lotus, a provider of protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS).[15]
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced its intent to acquire Level 3 in a deal valued at around $25 billion.[16]
Operations[edit]
Network[edit]

Level 3 Communications operates a large network Internet. This includes 46 states in the continental United States,[17][18] South America, Western Europe,[4][19] and some cities in Asia. It uses transatlantic cables,[20] including "Yellow" /AC-2 (on which it owned two of the four fiber pairs after Viatels 2001 bankruptcy).[21] Level 3 Communications has also purchased 300 Gbit/s of capacity on the Apollo (cable system).[22]
It is the current owner of AS1[23] (following the acquisition of Genuity, from BBN Technologies ), but it uses AS3356 for operations. AS3356 as of 2007[update] consistently had one of the highest ranked connectivity degrees on the Internet.[24][25] It also operates the former Global Crossing network (AS3549) following the company acquisition in 2011.
Level 3 Communications delivers Netflix and Apple music and video content over the Internet.[26] The company runs a content delivery network which it acquired from Savvis in 2006.[27]
In 2006, Level 3 Communications announced with Internet2, an academic network, that they would deploy a next generation nationwide research network.[28]
Sales organization[edit]
Level 3 distributes and sells its services through a mix of six independent sales channels: large enterprise, wholesale, federal, content and media, midmarket, and indirect. All six sales channels report to the president of sales Andrew Crouch.[29] The top performing Level 3 indirect sales agencies in 2010 include Intelisys, Microcorp, CDW/AVANT Communications, PlanetOne, Advantage Communications Group, Telarus, and Presidio.[30]
Comcast Dispute[edit]
On November 11, 2010 a dispute arose between Level 3 and Comcast, when Level 3 announced that they were "selected to serve as a primary content delivery network (CDN) provider for Netflix, Inc. to support the company's streaming functionality."[31] Apparently, as a result of this distribution agreement, Comcast sought to renegotiate the peering agreement with Level 3 and sought a recurring fee for carrying the increased Level 3 internet traffic to and from Comcast broadband customers. Claims[32] and counter-claims[33] were made as the two companies sought to renegotiate the contract. In December 2010, the New America Foundation submitted information concerning the dispute to the FCC.[34]
On July 16, 2013, Level 3 Communications and Comcast seemingly ended their three-year dispute by issuing a statement that "Level 3 and Comcast have resolved their prior interconnect dispute on mutually satisfactory terms. Details will not be released."[35] On May 21, 2015, Level 3 and Comcast announced a new multi-year bilateral agreement to "enhance their existing network capacity while extending their mutual interconnection agreements, ensuring that both maintain ample capacity to exchange Internet traffic between their networks."[36][37]
Other Disputes[edit]
In July 2013, the NSA was accused of wiretapping large parts of data on the German Internet Exchange Point DE-CIX which was denied by Level 3,[38] and a few months later, was accused of tapping connections between Google and Yahoo data centers.[39]

It operates a Tier 1 network.[4] The company provides core transport, IP, voice, video, and content delivery for medium-to-large Internet carriers in North America, Latin America, Europe, and selected cities in Asia.[5] Level 3 is also the largest competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) and the 3rd largest provider of fiber-optic internet access (based on coverage) in the United States.
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced an agreement to acquire Level 3 Communications in a cash and stock transaction.[6]

History[edit]
1985 to 2000[edit]
In 1985, Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc created a subsidiary named Kiewit Diversified Group to manage the corporation's business that was not related to construction. The division was spun off as a separate entity and changed its name to Level 3 Communications in 1998 to signify an increased focus on communication services. That same year saw it make an IPO on NASDAQ. According to Level3's own history, it continued to build its telecommunications network after going public.[7]
2001 to 2010[edit]
According to Level3's own history, in 2003, the company acquired Genuity, and, between 2005 and 2007, it purchased several other companies including former rivals WilTel Communications, Broadwing Corporation, Looking Glass Networks, Progress Telecom, and Telcove (formerly Adelphia Business Solutions).[7] In 2004, Level 3 acquired ICG Communications' wholesale dial-up business for $35 million. Then, in 2006, Level 3 purchased the rest of ICG Communications for $163 million, taking over ICG's fiber network and nationwide Points of Presence (PoPs). It then integrated these companies through 2010.
2010 to present[edit]
On April 11, 2011, Level 3 announced a tender offer had been made to acquire fellow Tier 1 provider Global Crossing[8] in an all-stock transaction,[9] which was approved by shareholders On August 5.[10] and completed on October 4, 2011. On October 20, 2011, Level 3 Communications reduced its total shares and transferred its stock listing from NASDAQ to the larger New York Stock Exchange.[11]
On May 14, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by European content provider Voxility to provide 250 Gbit/s or more to Voxility's three main data centers in North America and Europe.[12] On May 7, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency to provide fiber-cable operations and maintenance, and IP-based infrastructure under a ten-year, indefinite contract with a maximum value of approximately $411 million.[13]
On June 16, 2014, Level 3 acquired TW Telecom, a business Internet connection provider, for about $5.7 billion.[14]
In July 2015, Level 3 acquired Black Lotus, a provider of protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS).[15]
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced its intent to acquire Level 3 in a deal valued at around $25 billion.[16]
Operations[edit]
Network[edit]

Level 3 Communications operates a large network Internet. This includes 46 states in the continental United States,[17][18] South America, Western Europe,[4][19] and some cities in Asia. It uses transatlantic cables,[20] including "Yellow" /AC-2 (on which it owned two of the four fiber pairs after Viatels 2001 bankruptcy).[21] Level 3 Communications has also purchased 300 Gbit/s of capacity on the Apollo (cable system).[22]
It is the current owner of AS1[23] (following the acquisition of Genuity, from BBN Technologies ), but it uses AS3356 for operations. AS3356 as of 2007[update] consistently had one of the highest ranked connectivity degrees on the Internet.[24][25] It also operates the former Global Crossing network (AS3549) following the company acquisition in 2011.
Level 3 Communications delivers Netflix and Apple music and video content over the Internet.[26] The company runs a content delivery network which it acquired from Savvis in 2006.[27]
In 2006, Level 3 Communications announced with Internet2, an academic network, that they would deploy a next generation nationwide research network.[28]
Sales organization[edit]
Level 3 distributes and sells its services through a mix of six independent sales channels: large enterprise, wholesale, federal, content and media, midmarket, and indirect. All six sales channels report to the president of sales Andrew Crouch.[29] The top performing Level 3 indirect sales agencies in 2010 include Intelisys, Microcorp, CDW/AVANT Communications, PlanetOne, Advantage Communications Group, Telarus, and Presidio.[30]
Comcast Dispute[edit]
On November 11, 2010 a dispute arose between Level 3 and Comcast, when Level 3 announced that they were "selected to serve as a primary content delivery network (CDN) provider for Netflix, Inc. to support the company's streaming functionality."[31] Apparently, as a result of this distribution agreement, Comcast sought to renegotiate the peering agreement with Level 3 and sought a recurring fee for carrying the increased Level 3 internet traffic to and from Comcast broadband customers. Claims[32] and counter-claims[33] were made as the two companies sought to renegotiate the contract. In December 2010, the New America Foundation submitted information concerning the dispute to the FCC.[34]
On July 16, 2013, Level 3 Communications and Comcast seemingly ended their three-year dispute by issuing a statement that "Level 3 and Comcast have resolved their prior interconnect dispute on mutually satisfactory terms. Details will not be released."[35] On May 21, 2015, Level 3 and Comcast announced a new multi-year bilateral agreement to "enhance their existing network capacity while extending their mutual interconnection agreements, ensuring that both maintain ample capacity to exchange Internet traffic between their networks."[36][37]
Other Disputes[edit]
In July 2013, the NSA was accused of wiretapping large parts of data on the German Internet Exchange Point DE-CIX which was denied by Level 3,[38] and a few months later, was accused of tapping connections between Google and Yahoo data centers.[39]

It operates a Tier 1 network.[4] The company provides core transport, IP, voice, video, and content delivery for medium-to-large Internet carriers in North America, Latin America, Europe, and selected cities in Asia.[5] Level 3 is also the largest competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) and the 3rd largest provider of fiber-optic internet access (based on coverage) in the United States.
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced an agreement to acquire Level 3 Communications in a cash and stock transaction.[6]

History[edit]
1985 to 2000[edit]
In 1985, Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc created a subsidiary named Kiewit Diversified Group to manage the corporation's business that was not related to construction. The division was spun off as a separate entity and changed its name to Level 3 Communications in 1998 to signify an increased focus on communication services. That same year saw it make an IPO on NASDAQ. According to Level3's own history, it continued to build its telecommunications network after going public.[7]
2001 to 2010[edit]
According to Level3's own history, in 2003, the company acquired Genuity, and, between 2005 and 2007, it purchased several other companies including former rivals WilTel Communications, Broadwing Corporation, Looking Glass Networks, Progress Telecom, and Telcove (formerly Adelphia Business Solutions).[7] In 2004, Level 3 acquired ICG Communications' wholesale dial-up business for $35 million. Then, in 2006, Level 3 purchased the rest of ICG Communications for $163 million, taking over ICG's fiber network and nationwide Points of Presence (PoPs). It then integrated these companies through 2010.
2010 to present[edit]
On April 11, 2011, Level 3 announced a tender offer had been made to acquire fellow Tier 1 provider Global Crossing[8] in an all-stock transaction,[9] which was approved by shareholders On August 5.[10] and completed on October 4, 2011. On October 20, 2011, Level 3 Communications reduced its total shares and transferred its stock listing from NASDAQ to the larger New York Stock Exchange.[11]
On May 14, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by European content provider Voxility to provide 250 Gbit/s or more to Voxility's three main data centers in North America and Europe.[12] On May 7, 2012, Level 3 was contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency to provide fiber-cable operations and maintenance, and IP-based infrastructure under a ten-year, indefinite contract with a maximum value of approximately $411 million.[13]
On June 16, 2014, Level 3 acquired TW Telecom, a business Internet connection provider, for about $5.7 billion.[14]
In July 2015, Level 3 acquired Black Lotus, a provider of protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS).[15]
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced its intent to acquire Level 3 in a deal valued at around $25 billion.[16]
Operations[edit]
Network[edit]

Level 3 Communications operates a large network Internet. This includes 46 states in the continental United States,[17][18] South America, Western Europe,[4][19] and some cities in Asia. It uses transatlantic cables,[20] including "Yellow" /AC-2 (on which it owned two of the four fiber pairs after Viatels 2001 bankruptcy).[21] Level 3 Communications has also purchased 300 Gbit/s of capacity on the Apollo (cable system).[22]
It is the current owner of AS1[23] (following the acquisition of Genuity, from BBN Technologies ), but it uses AS3356 for operations. AS3356 as of 2007[update] consistently had one of the highest ranked connectivity degrees on the Internet.[24][25] It also operates the former Global Crossing network (AS3549) following the company acquisition in 2011.
Level 3 Communications delivers Netflix and Apple music and video content over the Internet.[26] The company runs a content delivery network which it acquired from Savvis in 2006.[27]
In 2006, Level 3 Communications announced with Internet2, an academic network, that they would deploy a next generation nationwide research network.[28]
Sales organization[edit]
Level 3 distributes and sells its services through a mix of six independent sales channels: large enterprise, wholesale, federal, content and media, midmarket, and indirect. All six sales channels report to the president of sales Andrew Crouch.[29] The top performing Level 3 indirect sales agencies in 2010 include Intelisys, Microcorp, CDW/AVANT Communications, PlanetOne, Advantage Communications Group, Telarus, and Presidio.[30]
Comcast Dispute[edit]
On November 11, 2010 a dispute arose between Level 3 and Comcast, when Level 3 announced that they were "selected to serve as a primary content delivery network (CDN) provider for Netflix, Inc. to support the company's streaming functionality."[31] Apparently, as a result of this distribution agreement, Comcast sought to renegotiate the peering agreement with Level 3 and sought a recurring fee for carrying the increased Level 3 internet traffic to and from Comcast broadband customers. Claims[32] and counter-claims[33] were made as the two companies sought to renegotiate the contract. In December 2010, the New America Foundation submitted information concerning the dispute to the FCC.[34]
On July 16, 2013, Level 3 Communications and Comcast seemingly ended their three-year dispute by issuing a statement that "Level 3 and Comcast have resolved their prior interconnect dispute on mutually satisfactory terms. Details will not be released."[35] On May 21, 2015, Level 3 and Comcast announced a new multi-year bilateral agreement to "enhance their existing network capacity while extending their mutual interconnection agreements, ensuring that both maintain ample capacity to exchange Internet traffic between their networks."[36][37]
Other Disputes[edit]
In July 2013, the NSA was accused of wiretapping large parts of data on the German Internet Exchange Point DE-CIX which was denied by Level 3,[38] and a few months later, was accused of tapping connections between Google and Yahoo data centers.[39]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
