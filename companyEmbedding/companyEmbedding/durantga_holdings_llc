Since solutions are what we are all about, here are some  helpful hints to keeping your life in order.

 

Be it a New year's resolution, spring cleaning or just  because, organizing your space is always rewarding.
          Make organizing less of a chore by tackling one area at a  time.

Weeding out all the clothes in the closet you will  never wear is as easy as 1-2-3. Although this can seem like a daunting task an organized closet will save you time in the long run.
1. Take everything out of your closet, working in sections if needed. 
2. Put back the items that you wear, that  fits, and that makes you look and feel good about yourself.  Organize your items as you return them to the closet so you can see what you have. Group like items together. Maintain this order each time you put your clothes away. This will keep  your closet tidy and help prevent your things from getting damaged.  Adding an under-shelf  storage basket gives you more space for small things such  as shoe accessories, or scarves.  Insert  On the Hook™ through the bottom of the basket and hang your boots that have  been held together with strong clothes clips such as clever clips or tree boot clips.
3. If there is an item you can't quite decide if you are ready to part with, try this  trick; put the item on a hangar and hang it with the hook coming back over the  rod toward you instead of going over the rod away from you.  This will be a reminder of whether or not it  has been worn.  Give yourself a time  limit.  3 months, 6 months, a year,  whatever you feel comfortable with.  When your pre-determined time has passed any garment on a backwards facing hanger needs to go. 
 On the Hook™ works great in closets with wire shelf  systems.  The hooks add space below  shelves for hanging lightweight items such as scarves, belts or hats and heavy  items such as boots, purses, bags and coats.   Even luggage can be stored On the Hook™.
Donate, sell, or recycle items no longer of use to you.
 





 
Get the most of your wire  shelf units in the kitchen.  Storing items above and below shelves can  double your storage space.  Hang pots and  pans, coffee mugs, cooking utensils and more. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 






 
Create a beverage station to make your mornings easier.  With On the Hook™ you can have all the  fixings for your favorite beverage all in one place and your bananas too.            

 
 
 





On the Hook™ adds customizable storage in the laundry room. 
Keep floors free of clutter by hanging dry cleaning bags, re-usable shopping bags, brooms, mops, dusters and more. The hooks can be rotated in any direction to store items efficiently.
Perfect for rentals, they won't damage the walls and you can take the hooks with you. 




 
Set On the Hook™ down through the bottom of a wire basket for added storage space. Use outdoors, in the garage, in the mud room, kid's playroom, closets, pantry and more. 








 
 
 
 
 
A wire shelf unit placed over a heater vent is perfect for drying outdoor winter gear. Hang bags, coats, scarves from the top shelf using On the Hook™ and line the bottom shelves with gloves boots and shoes.
