Undergraduate Degree 


Florida State University

                  The Florida State University (commonly referred to as Florida State or FSU)[9] is a space-grant and sea-grant public research university located in the state capital city of Tallahassee, Florida, United States. It is a comprehensive doctoral research university with medical programs and very high research activity as determined by the Carnegie Foundation.[10] The university comprises 16 separate colleges and more than 110 centers, facilities, labs and institutes that offer more than 300 programs of study, including professional programs.[11] Florida State is home to Florida's only National Laboratory – the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and is the birthplace of the commercially viable anti-cancer drug Taxol. Florida State University also operates The John & Mable Ringling Museum of Art, the State Art Museum of Florida and one of the largest museum/university complexes in the nation.[12] Florida State University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools as a Level VI public institution.[13]

Florida State was officially established in 1851 and is located on the oldest continuous site of higher education in the state of Florida.[2][3] In 1905 Florida State earned Florida's first Rhodes Scholar.[14][15] In 1935 Florida State University was awarded the first chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in Florida and is among the ten percent of American universities to have earned a chapter of the national academic honor society.[16][17] In 1977 Florida State University earned the first female Rhodes Scholar in Florida.[18] In 2007, the Florida Legislature permitted Florida State and the University of Florida to charge 40% higher tuition than other institutions in the State University System of Florida.[19] In 2010 Florida State University was named a "Budget Ivy" university by the Fiske Guide to Getting into the Right College.[20] In 2012 U.S. News & World Report ranked Florida State the most efficient National University in the United States.[21]

Florida State University is one of two Florida public universities to immediately qualify as a "preeminent university" by law under Florida Senate Bill 1076, signed by Governor Rick Scott in 2013.[22][23] As a result of this legislation, preeminent universities receive additional funding that is intended to improve the academics and national reputation of higher education within the state of Florida.[24] As one of Florida's primary graduate research universities,[25] Florida State University awards approximately 3,000 graduate and professional degrees each year.[26]

The Florida State University is also home to nationally ranked programs in many academic areas, including the sciences, engineering, social policy, film, music, theater, dance, visual art, business, political science, psychology, social work, medicine, and law.[27] The university is also known for its undergraduate study abroad options: according to Uni in the USA, "the large numbers of students that study abroad nicely compliment the students that study here from abroad."[28]

Florida State University athletics programs are favorites of passionate students, fans and alumni across the United States, which often appear in conjunction with the Marching Chiefs of the FSU College of Music. Florida State is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference and has won thirteen national athletic championships as well as multiple individual competitor NCAA championship awards                




Master of Business Administration 


Emory University - Goizueta Business School

                  On February 18, 1919, the dean of Emory College, Howard Odum, recommended the creation of a “school of economics and business administration” to the Board of Trustees. Thus, in the fall of 1919, the new school worked with Emory College to offer courses in economics, accounting, and business law. By 1925, there was one faculty member and full-time assistant, five staff members and 145 students. In 1926, eight students received the Bachelor of Business Administration degree. Two decades after the school awarded degrees in business administration, the school accepted its first female student in 1954. In the same year, the MBA program commenced, with 19 registered students.
Goizueta Business School

In 1992, the evening MBA program was introduced. At the same time, the school was achieving greater validation for its programs. When the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business began accrediting master’s programs, Emory’s program was one of the first to be approved. Four years later, Emory appeared on the list of the top American colleges and universities producing U.S. executives. This newfound acclaim accompanied new programs, such as the concentration within the MBA program for professional accounting and, in 1979, the Executive MBA program. Also at this time, the school created a plan to allow students to complete both the MBA and Juris Doctor degree within four years. Rankings of the school’s programs highlight the results of thoughtful and steady expansion. In 1986, the Executive MBA program was ranked in the top 15 in a Business Week survey.

In 1994, the school was renamed for Roberto C. Goizueta, a much admired and successful business leader. More than providing a namesake for the school, Roberto C. Goizueta placed his philosophical stamp on the school’s academic and financial development. Goizueta proclaimed, “Business schools today cannot just reflect business the way it is. They must teach business the way it will be.” The millennium brought about a new PhD program in business administration and a new program in Real Estate. Goizueta Business School installed its current dean, Professor Larry Benveniste, in 2005

The Florida Council of 100

                  The Florida Council of 100 is a private, nonprofit, nonpartisan organization of business leaders, which exists to promote the economic growth of Florida and improve the economic well-being and quality of life of its citizenry.  Representing more than 100 companies with over 600,000 employees, Council members have achieved a high degree of success and recognition in their business or profession; have demonstrated involvement in Florida public policy issues; and possess the personal qualities of character, personality, and leadership ability.

The Council works closely with the Governor and the state agencies, the Legislature, the judicial branch, and other private organizations, to effect positive change in the state and achieve quality of life improvements for the citizens of Florida.  Through our reports, position statements, policy letters, issue advocacy, and public relations, we keep state leaders and policy makers apprised of key topics relevant to today’s Florida and make recommendations for enhancing state policies and programs in ways beneficial to all Floridians.

Helping us fulfill this mission are high-level civic leaders from around the state who assist the Council in an ex officio capacity.  They include executive branch agency officials, the Chairman of the State Board of Education, the Commissioner of Education, presidents of public and private state colleges and universities, school district superintendents, the President of Enterprise Florida, Inc., and senior active duty military officers.

The groundwork for these efforts was laid in 1961 when the Council, the first of its kind in the United States, was formed at the request of Governor Farris Bryant to provide advice to him on key Florida issues from a business perspective.  To the right, you may watch Governor Bryant explain his vision for the Council.

As business leaders, the members of the Council feel responsibility and have the determination, to improve Florida.  The Council mission statement, adopted in 1998, sums up the goals of the members.
