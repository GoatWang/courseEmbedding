Workhorse Group Incorporated is an American manufacturing company based in Ohio, currently focused on manufacturing electrically powered delivery and utility vehicles. The company was founded in 1998 by investors who took over the production of General Motors' P30/P32 series stepvan and motorhome chassis.[1] By 2005 they were taken over by Navistar International, which had been selling them diesel engines since before.[2] Navistar then shuttered the plant in 2012, to cut costs after having suffered heavy losses.[1] In March 2015 AMP Electric Vehicles took over Workhorse Custom Chassis, changing the company name to Workhorse Group Incorporated, and began offering a range of electrically powered delivery vans.

Lineup[edit]

A Workhorse LF72 bus chassis with Startrans President LF (low-floor) bodywork


As of 2016, the company offers the familiar W62 chassis and a newer, narrow-tracked version called the W88. Their first product was the P-series, based on the Chevrolet/GMC P30-series stepvan/mobile home chassis. An earlier version was the W42 chassis, and they were also managerially involved with the construction of Navistar's eStar electric van, until it too was cancelled in early 2013.[2] Workhorse also briefly offered an integrated chassis/body model called the MetroStar, hearkening back to the long-lived International Harvester Metro Van line.
There were also the low-floor bus chassis (LF72), as well as a rear-engined recreational vehicle chassis called the UFO.
Pickup truck[edit]
In November 2016, Workhorse announced that they were working on an electrically powered pickup truck, called the W-15. North Carolina's Duke Energy has stated that it will buy 500 of the vehicles, and the city of Orlando is also interested.[3] It is scheduled to have 460 horsepower and a battery range of 80 miles. A gasoline range extender supplies further range.[4]

Workhorse Group Inc. Commences Development of Plug-In Electric Pickup Truck with Range Extender For Fleets

CINCINNATI, Nov. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Workhorse Group Inc. (NASDAQ:   WKHS), an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of battery-electric vehicles, today announced that it has commenced development of an electric pickup work truck with range extender for fleet usage. 










 







							 		Concept of Workhorse W-15 Electric Pickup Truck with Extended Range
							  



 

 
 



Expected to be in production 2018, the new Workhorse W-15 light duty platform design is an extension of the E-Gen electric technology used in Workhorse medium-duty delivery trucks.  With an expected 80 mile battery range using Panasonic 18650 Li-ion batteries, the Workhorse W-15 light duty design expects to provide economical, clean and powerful performance.  
The expected 80-mile range from the battery pack of the Workhorse pickup truck is expected to cover the vast majority of miles driven in a day by fleet owners of locally driven trucks. If needed, the gasoline generator will then operate after battery power has been depleted, allowing the driver unlimited range to complete the days' tasks. 
As many fleet operators are committed to the "greening" of their fleet, the Workhorse W-15 electric truck will be designed to dramatically lower emissions.  Lower fueling and maintenance costs are expected to deliver lower total cost of ownership (TCO) for fleet managers. Workhorse has already received non-binding letters of interest from Duke Energy as well as the City of Orlando municipal fleet.
For a number of years, Duke Energy, along with other electric utilities in the country, has been asking manufacturers to build plug-in electric vehicles that could replace the highest volume vehicle types within our fleet.  The Workhorse truck does exactly that, in a manner that is expected  to reduce fuel consumption as well as significantly lowering fleet emissions.  Including proven components such as the range-extending generator package in the design, is expected to ease many of the concerns companies have when introducing new and innovative products into their fleets.
Millions of Pickup trucks are sold in the United States each year and pickup trucks are a leading vehicle platform of choice for fleets.  The electric powered W-15 represents an opportunity to bring tremendous fuel savings and emissions reduction to the streets of America without sacrificing functionality.  Additionally, the W-15 's goal is to be the safest Pickup truck on the market with its large frontal crumble zone and low center of gravity. 
"We believe this will be the first plug-in range-extended electric pickup truck built from the ground up by an OEM in America. It's not a conversion vehicle," said Steve Burns, Workhorse CEO. "We feel the extended range capability from the combination of Panasonic batteries and an on-board generator, will deliver the performance that fleet managers expect from a work truck."
Fleet managers who would like additional information are directed to contact Jeff Esfeld at jeff.esfeld@workhorse.com  or 206-228-5400. 
About Workhorse Group Inc.

(NASDAQ:   WKHS), is a U.S. – based original equipment manufacturer of medium duty EPA-approved battery-electric delivery vehicles and fully integrated truck-launched, FAA compliant unmanned aerial systems (UAS) delivery drones.

Workhorse Group Incorporated is an American manufacturing company based in Ohio, currently focused on manufacturing electrically powered delivery and utility vehicles. The company was founded in 1998 by investors who took over the production of General Motors' P30/P32 series stepvan and motorhome chassis.[1] By 2005 they were taken over by Navistar International, which had been selling them diesel engines since before.[2] Navistar then shuttered the plant in 2012, to cut costs after having suffered heavy losses.[1] In March 2015 AMP Electric Vehicles took over Workhorse Custom Chassis, changing the company name to Workhorse Group Incorporated, and began offering a range of electrically powered delivery vans.

Lineup[edit]

As of 2016, the company offers the familiar W62 chassis and a newer, narrow-tracked version called the W88. Their first product was the P-series, based on the Chevrolet/GMC P30-series stepvan/mobile home chassis. An earlier version was the W42 chassis, and they were also managerially involved with the construction of Navistar's eStar electric van, until it too was cancelled in early 2013.[2] Workhorse also briefly offered an integrated chassis/body model called the MetroStar, hearkening back to the long-lived International Harvester Metro Van line.
There were also the low-floor bus chassis (LF72), as well as a rear-engined recreational vehicle chassis called the UFO.
Pickup truck[edit]
In November 2016, Workhorse announced that they were working on an electrically powered pickup truck, called the W-15. North Carolina's Duke Energy has stated that it will buy 500 of the vehicles, and the city of Orlando is also interested.[3] It is scheduled to have 460 horsepower and a battery range of 80 miles. A gasoline range extender supplies further range.[4]

Workhorse Group Inc. Unveils SureFly™ Helicopter Concept at Paris Air Show, Releases Specifications, Opens Pre-Orders
Jun 19 17
Workhorse Group Inc. unveiled its Surefly helicopter concept at the Paris Air Show (Static display B10) and released specifications. SureFly is a personal helicopter/VTOL aircraft, designed to be safer and more stable than a typical helicopter due to its redundant design, which includes four propeller arms, two fixed contra-rotating propellers on each arm, a backup battery to drive the electric motors in the event of engine failure and a ballistic parachute that safely brings down the craft if needed. SureFly's hybrid design leverages Workhorse's platform battery packaging, management systems and controls utilized in its currently commercialized medium-duty, range-extended battery electric vehicles. It features a gas combustion engine generating electricity and a parallel battery pack offering a redundant backup power source, eliminating the need for long battery charging periods between flights. SureFly is designed to be easy to pilot, and is expected to be capable of carrying pilot and passenger or cargo up to 70 miles. After a quick refill, SureFly is ready for the next hop. Early models will be pilot-operated. The goal is to introduce future models featuring autonomous flight capable of carrying payloads of up to 400 pounds. Anticipated markets for the SureFly are precision agriculture, emergency responders, city commuters and military. Specifications include: Vertical take off and landing. Onboard GPS navigation system. Static ports and a heated pitot tube for altimeter and air speed measurements. Detect-and-avoid sensors. Maximum flight distance: 70 miles. Maximum altitude: 4,000 feet flight ceiling. Maximum payload: 400 pounds. 200 horsepower at 6,000 RPM aviation gasoline engine. Battery backup system with max theoretical battery power of 20.8 amp hours. 8 propellers, 4 propeller arms. Carbon fiber fuselage, propeller arms and propellers. Fuel: premium unleaded 90 octane gasoline.

Workhorse Group Incorporated is an American manufacturing company based in Ohio, currently focused on manufacturing electrically powered delivery and utility vehicles. The company was founded in 1998 by investors who took over the production of General Motors' P30/P32 series stepvan and motorhome chassis.[1] By 2005 they were taken over by Navistar International, which had been selling them diesel engines since before.[2] Navistar then shuttered the plant in 2012, to cut costs after having suffered heavy losses.[1] In March 2015 AMP Electric Vehicles took over Workhorse Custom Chassis, changing the company name to Workhorse Group Incorporated, and began offering a range of electrically powered delivery vans.

Lineup[edit]

As of 2016, the company offers the familiar W62 chassis and a newer, narrow-tracked version called the W88. Their first product was the P-series, based on the Chevrolet/GMC P30-series stepvan/mobile home chassis. An earlier version was the W42 chassis, and they were also managerially involved with the construction of Navistar's eStar electric van, until it too was cancelled in early 2013.[2] Workhorse also briefly offered an integrated chassis/body model called the MetroStar, hearkening back to the long-lived International Harvester Metro Van line.
There were also the low-floor bus chassis (LF72), as well as a rear-engined recreational vehicle chassis called the UFO.
Pickup truck[edit]
In November 2016, Workhorse announced that they were working on an electrically powered pickup truck, called the W-15. North Carolina's Duke Energy has stated that it will buy 500 of the vehicles, and the city of Orlando is also interested.[3] It is scheduled to have 460 horsepower and a battery range of 80 miles. A gasoline range extender supplies further range.[4]

AMP Electric Vehicles was established in 2007 as a developmental-stage vehicle electrification company. We first experimented with adding battery-electric power to two-seat roadsters.

				
In 2009/2010, Progressive Insurance sponsored a rigorous nation-wide competition for clean, “production-capable” vehicles. Our 100% electric GM Sky was the only mass-produced vehicle in the competition. All other vehicles were primarily prototypes or concept vehicles not suitable for driving on public roads. We were one of eight finalists in the Side-by-Side seating category. Our Sky achieved four times the fuel efficiency of an internal combustion equivalent with zero emissions (96 MPGe vs.19/24 city/highway for ICE version).

				
We followed the electrification of the Sky Roadster with the design and implementation of systems capable of powering larger vehicles. This led to the creation of electrification packages for the Chevrolet Equinox SUV, the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Mercedes Benz ML350. These development activities resulted in the successful execution of the concept for SUVs.

				
AMP Electric Vehicles went public in 2010 trading on the OTC market under the AMPD symbol. When the economic benefits of conversion became less certain, we pivoted away from passenger vehicles and began to focus on electrifying commercial vehicles. This led to a development agreement with Navistar, a major U.S. truck OEM. Under the development agreement, the initial project was to re-power a 1,000 cubic foot delivery van.

				
The first vehicle was delivered to them in August of 2012 and successfully passed Navistar’s requirements and performance test. Navistar’s top management changed at precisely the same time the project vehicle passed its performance test and Navistar tabled the electrification project. They did however, introduce us to their client and AMP began to work directly with the end-user. As part of the end-user’s requirement, the battery-electric test truck successfully passed a 4,000-mile durability test at TRC, Inc.’s automotive test facility in East Liberty, OH.

				
AMP acquired the Workhorse brand and the Workhorse Custom Chassis assembly plant in Union City, IN in March of 2015. The asset acquisition made the company an OEM and enables the company to manufacture new, medium-duty truck chassis in the 14,500 to 23,500 GVW class.

				
In addition to the plant assets, our exclusive arrangement with UpTime Parts, Inc. for logistical and spare parts support and our 400+ network of dealers provides AMP with unequaled nationwide support for our vehicles.

				
In March of 2015, AMP formally changed its name to Workhorse Group Incorporated (NASDAQ: WKHS).

AMP Electric Vehicles was established in 2007 as a developmental-stage vehicle electrification company. We first experimented with adding battery-electric power to two-seat roadsters.

				
In 2009/2010, Progressive Insurance sponsored a rigorous nation-wide competition for clean, “production-capable” vehicles. Our 100% electric GM Sky was the only mass-produced vehicle in the competition. All other vehicles were primarily prototypes or concept vehicles not suitable for driving on public roads. We were one of eight finalists in the Side-by-Side seating category. Our Sky achieved four times the fuel efficiency of an internal combustion equivalent with zero emissions (96 MPGe vs.19/24 city/highway for ICE version).

				
We followed the electrification of the Sky Roadster with the design and implementation of systems capable of powering larger vehicles. This led to the creation of electrification packages for the Chevrolet Equinox SUV, the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Mercedes Benz ML350. These development activities resulted in the successful execution of the concept for SUVs.

				
AMP Electric Vehicles went public in 2010 trading on the OTC market under the AMPD symbol. When the economic benefits of conversion became less certain, we pivoted away from passenger vehicles and began to focus on electrifying commercial vehicles. This led to a development agreement with Navistar, a major U.S. truck OEM. Under the development agreement, the initial project was to re-power a 1,000 cubic foot delivery van.

				
The first vehicle was delivered to them in August of 2012 and successfully passed Navistar’s requirements and performance test. Navistar’s top management changed at precisely the same time the project vehicle passed its performance test and Navistar tabled the electrification project. They did however, introduce us to their client and AMP began to work directly with the end-user. As part of the end-user’s requirement, the battery-electric test truck successfully passed a 4,000-mile durability test at TRC, Inc.’s automotive test facility in East Liberty, OH.

				
AMP acquired the Workhorse brand and the Workhorse Custom Chassis assembly plant in Union City, IN in March of 2015. The asset acquisition made the company an OEM and enables the company to manufacture new, medium-duty truck chassis in the 14,500 to 23,500 GVW class.

				
In addition to the plant assets, our exclusive arrangement with UpTime Parts, Inc. for logistical and spare parts support and our 400+ network of dealers provides AMP with unequaled nationwide support for our vehicles.

				
In March of 2015, AMP formally changed its name to Workhorse Group Incorporated (NASDAQ: WKHS).

                            Workhorse Custom Chassis has created a “Select” Service Center network 
                            consisting of Authorized Workhorse Service Centers that are prepared to handle a 
                            large volume of Campaign 51101-C’s for our customers. Select Service Centers 
                            will receive their brake caliper assemblies and miscellaneous parts in bulk as 
                            opposed to singular orders. Contact your local Authorized Workhorse Select 
                            Service Center for additional information.
