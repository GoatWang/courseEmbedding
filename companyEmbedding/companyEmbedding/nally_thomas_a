 Educational Background



Undergraduate Degree in Finance 


Rider University

                  From its beginnings as a private business college nearly a century and a half ago, Rider University has consistently thrived as a home for students seeking a timely, relevant and thorough curriculum and an environment to satisfy their intellectual curiosity.

Founded in 1865 as Trenton Business College, the institution was established to train leaders in the booming, industrialized post-Civil War economy. Today, while Rider still produces some of today’s leading executives, it has also evolved into a diverse, comprehensive university with vibrant and expansive programs in the arts, sciences and education.

Gradually growing in size and scope through the first half of the 20th century, Rider began its move to a more spacious, suburban campus in 1959, when the first offices and classes moved to a 280-acre tract of land on Route 206 in Lawrence Township, N.J. Today, Rider’s Lawrenceville campus is home to its College of Business Administration; College of Liberal Arts, Education, and Sciences; College of Continuing Studies, School of Education; and shares the Westminster College of the Arts with the Westminster Choir College of Rider University in Princeton, N.J.

As a united entity, Rider University is a student-centered institution firmly grounded in a continued standard of excellence that is the hallmark of the Westminster and Lawrenceville programs, regardless of discipline, across the entire academic spectrum.                




Securities Industry Institute Program 


University of Pennsylvania - The Wharton School

                  The Wharton School is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Wharton was the world’s first collegiate business school and the first business school in the United States. It was established in 1881 through a donation of Joseph Wharton.

Go Back >   The Crossing, conducted by Donald Nally, gives an extraordinary performance of Thomas Lloyd's choral work. Bonhoeffer was conceived as a concert work in a theatrical context by composer Thomas Lloyd. Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906-1945) was one of the most influential Christian theologians of the 20th Century. He returned to Germany from the United States to become an active leader of the Confessing Church, which actively resisted the capitulation of the establishment Lutheran and Catholic churches to the fascist leadership of Adolf Hilter. He was involved in the unsuccessful plot to assassinate Hitler and suffered imprisonment and death, being hanged at Flossenb�rg Concentration Camp a few weeks before Germany's surrender. He fell in love with Maria von Wedemeyer and was engaged to her shortly before his arrest. The text for Bonhoeffer is adapted from the writings of both Bonhoeffer and von Wedemeyer. Thomas Lloyd is on the faculty at Haverford College; the artistic director of the Bucks County Choral Society; and director of music at the Philadelphia Episcopal Cathedral. His music has been performed by many choirs � professional, collegiate, community, and high school. The Crossing is a professional chamber choir based in Philadelphia conducted by Donald Nally and dedicated to the commissioning and performance of new music. They have collaborated with the Los Angeles Philharmonic; the International Contemporary Ensemble, Bang on a Can, and the American Composers Orchestra, among many others.
