KSS OBTAINS STAKE IN ACTIVEPROTECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES INC.


Sterling Heights, MI January 20, 2016 – Key Safety Systems (KSS), a leading global supplier of advanced engineered safety products for automotive and non-automotive markets, is pleased to announce its completion of an equity investment in ActiveProtective Technologies, Inc (ActiveProtective).  KSS is now a minority shareholder with rights to appoint one director to the company’s board.  A development agreement has also been signed whereby KSS will provide technical support and in particular contribute inflator, inflatable device and systems expertise as a collaborative partner with ActiveProtective.
Hip fractures among older adults can be a devastating event that frequently leaves the injured person permanently debilitated and, too often, unable to recover.  In the United States alone, it is estimated that 1 in 3 people over the age of 65 experience a fall each year, resulting in annual medical costs of ~$30 Billion.  Considering the shifting demographics and increasing global life expectancy, these injuries and costs will continue to rise unless new advancements and safety products are made available to those most at risk.  ActiveProtective, with the on-going support of KSS, has developed a revolutionary Smart Belt designed to mitigate fall severity and protect the hip during falls.  The lightweight Smart Belt, which can be worn by men and women, automatically deploys a personal airbag over the hip when a fall is detected, thus reducing impact forces by as much as 90%.  More information on ActiveProtective and the revolutionary new Smart Belt can be found at http://activeprotective.com.
“We are excited about expanding our partnership with ActiveProtective,” said Tony Nardone, President – KSS Specialty Products Division.  “This investment in the personal protection sector is well aligned with KSS’ commitment to expand our addressable market and our ‘We Save Lives!’ corporate ideology.”
“With this collaboration, we’ve strengthened our ability to bring advanced wearable protection to the market quickly, reliably, and effectively,” said Drew Lakatos, CEO of ActiveProtective.

About ActiveProtective
ActiveProtective is a privately held wearable consumer device company using 3D sensors to determine what are allowable human motions, versus dangerous and injury indicating ones. Using their issued-patent methodology, they can intervene prior to injury via special clothing that deploys micro-airbags during a fall or crash, immediately prior to impact. Their clothing is focused on reducing the most damaging, life-altering, and expensive human injuries with applications for medical, sport, moto and military.
