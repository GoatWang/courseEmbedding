Targa Resources Partners LP Continues to Expand Terminal and LPG Export Capabilities




HOUSTON, Jan. 8, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Targa Resources Partners LP (NYSE:NGLS) ("Targa" or the "Partnership") today announced that it has acquired additional property on the Houston Ship Channel ("Targa Patriot Marine Terminal" or "Patriot Terminal") that provides expansion potential for both its Petroleum Logistics clean fuels business and its propane/butane export capabilities.

	Targa Patriot, which is located about two miles from the Partnership's Galena Park Marine Terminal, includes an existing dock, acreage for expansion build-out, an existing rail siding, and nearby access to the Colonial/Explorer refined products pipeline interconnect hub. The proximity of the Patriot Terminal to Targa's existing petroleum logistics business at Channelview and to our LPG exports facilities at Galena Park offers Targa cost effective future options to meet growing customer and market demands for both product services.

	The Patriot Terminal can be readily connected to Galena Park and to Targa's Mount Belvieu complex including the Cedar Bayou Fractionator facilities, and is complementary to Targa's propane/butane export business. LPG exports have grown rapidly with significant volumes of domestic grade propane (HD5) and butane, and the Partnership's previously announced major capital program will create significant incremental capability for export of international grade propane. The international export project will come on line in two phases in 3Q 2013 and 3Q 2014, and Targa has largely contracted its anticipated capacity. If the need for propane/butane export capacity continues to grow, the Patriot Terminal provides Targa and its customers with economically attractive interconnected expansion potential.  The initial investment including acquisition of the property and dock upgrade and refurbishment 
is approximately $25 million.  Further plans for clean fuels and/or propane/butane export activity are being developed and could significantly increase growth capital expenditures over time.About Targa Resources Partners

Certain statements in this release are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this release that address activities, events or developments that the Partnership expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, factors and risks, many of which are outside the Partnership's control, which could cause results to differ materially from those expected by management of the Partnership. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, weather, political, economic and market conditions, including a decline in the price and market demand for natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil, the timing and success of business development efforts; and other uncertainties. These and other applicable uncertainties, factors and risks are described more fully in the Partnership's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. The Partnership does not undertake an obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.        









This release is intended to be a qualified notice under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b). Brokers and nominees should treat one hundred percent (100.0%) of Targa Resources Partners LP's distributions to foreign investors as being attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, Targa Resources Partners LP's distributions to foreign investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate.

Certain statements in this release are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this release that address activities, events or developments that the Partnership expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, factors and risks, many of which are outside the Partnership's control, which could cause results to differ materially from those expected by management of the Partnership. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, weather, political, economic and market conditions, including a decline in the price and market demand for natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil, the timing and success of business development efforts; and other uncertainties. These and other applicable uncertainties, factors and risks are described more fully in the Partnership's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. The Partnership does not undertake an obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.        









This release is intended to be a qualified notice under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b). Brokers and nominees should treat one hundred percent (100.0%) of Targa Resources Partners LP's distributions to foreign investors as being attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, Targa Resources Partners LP's distributions to foreign investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate.

Targa Resources Partners LP, incorporated on October 23, 2006, is a provider of midstream natural gas and natural gas liquid (NGL) services in the United States with a presence in crude oil gathering and petroleum terminaling. The Company is engaged in the business of gathering, compressing, treating, processing and selling natural gas; storing, fractionating, treating, transporting and selling NGLs and NGL products, including services to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) exporters; gathering, storing and terminaling crude oil, and storing, terminaling and selling refined petroleum products. The Company operates in two divisions: Gathering and Processing, and Logistics and Marketing. The Gathering and Processing division consists of two segments: Field Gathering and Processing, and Coastal Gathering and Processing. The Logistics and Marketing division consists of two segments: Logistics Assets, and Marketing and Distribution.Gathering and Processing DivisionThe Company's Gathering and Processing Division consists of gathering, compressing, dehydrating, treating, conditioning, processing, and marketing natural gas and gathering crude oil. The gathering of natural gas consists of aggregating natural gas produced from various wells through small diameter gathering lines to processing plants. The Field Gathering and Processing segment's assets are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico; the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Barnett Shale in North Texas; the Anadarko, Ardmore, and Arkoma Basins in Oklahoma and South Central Kansas, and the Williston Basin in North Dakota. The natural gas processed in this segment is supplied through the Company's gathering systems, which in aggregate consist of approximately 23,630 miles of natural gas pipelines and include over 28 owned and operated processing plants. The Company processes an average of 2,344.2 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas and produces an average of 223.6 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) of NGLs. In addition to natural gas gathering and processing, the Company's Badlands operations include a crude oil gathering system and over four terminals with crude oil operational storage capacity of approximately 125 thousand barrels (MBbl).The Company's Field Gathering and Processing segment's operations consist of SAOU, WestTX, Sand Hills, Versado, SouthTX, North Texas, SouthOK, WestOK and Badlands. SAOU includes approximately 1,650 miles of pipelines in the Permian Basin that gathers natural gas for delivery to the Mertzon, Sterling, Conger and High Plains processing plants. SAOU is connected to thousands of producing wells and over 840 central delivery points. SAOU's processing facilities are refrigerated cryogenic processing plants with an aggregate processing capacity of approximately 369 MMcf/d. The WestTX gathering system has approximately 4,050 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines located across over nine counties within the Permian Basin in West Texas. The WestTX system includes over five separate plants: the Consolidator, Driver, Midkiff, Benedum and Edward processing facilities. The WestTX processing operations have an aggregate processing name-plate capacity of approximately 660 MMcf/d.The Company's North Texas includes over two interconnected gathering systems in the Fort Worth Basin, including the Barnett Shale and Marble Falls plays, with approximately 4,550 miles of pipelines gathering wellhead natural gas for the Chico, Shackelford and Longhorn natural gas processing facilities. The Chico gathering system consists of approximately 2,550 miles of gathering pipelines located in the Montague, Wise and Clay Counties in North Texas. Wellhead natural gas is either gathered for the Chico or Longhorn plants located in Wise County, Texas, and then compressed for processing, or it is compressed in the field at numerous compressor stations and then moved through one of several high-pressure gathering pipelines to the Chico or Longhorn plants. The Chico plant has an aggregated processing capacity of approximately 265 MMcf/d and an integrated fractionation capacity of over 15 MBbl/d. The Longhorn plant has a capacity of approximately 200 MMcf/d. The Shackelford gathering system includes approximately 2,000 miles of gathering pipelines and gathers wellhead natural gas for the Shackelford plant in Albany, Texas.

The Badlands assets also includes approximately 180 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and the Little Missouri natural gas processing plant with a gross processing capacity of approximately 90 MMcf/d.The Company's Coastal Gathering and Processing segment's assets are located in the onshore region of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, accessing natural gas from the Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. The Coastal Gathering and Processing segment's assets consist of Louisiana Operating Unit (LOU) and the Coastal Straddles. The Company processes an average of approximately 897.0 MMcf/d of plant natural gas inlet and produces an average of over 41.8 MBbl/d of NGLs. LOU consists of approximately 900 miles of onshore gathering system pipelines in Southwest Louisiana. The gathering system is connected to various producing wells, central delivery points and/or pipeline interconnects in the area between Lafayette and Lake Charles, Louisiana. The gathering system is a high-pressure gathering system that delivers natural gas for processing to either the Acadia or Gillis plants through over three main trunk lines. The processing facilities include the Gillis and Acadia processing plants, both of which are cryogenic plants. The Big Lake plant, also cryogenic, is located near the LOU gathering system. These processing plants have an aggregate processing capacity of approximately 440 MMcf/d. In addition, the Gillis plant has integrated fractionation with operating capacity of approximately 11 MBbl/d, which is interconnected with the Lake Charles Fractionator. The LOU gathering system is also interconnected with the Lowry gas plant, allowing receipt or delivery of gas.The Company's Coastal Straddles process natural gas produced from shallow-water central and western Gulf of Mexico natural gas wells and from deep shelf and deep-water Gulf of Mexico production through connections to third-party pipelines or through pipelines owned by the Company. Coastal Straddles has access to markets across the United States through the interstate natural gas pipelines to which they are interconnected. The Company operates the Venice gas plant, which has an aggregate processing capacity of over 750 MMcf/d and the Venice Gathering System (VGS) that is approximately 150 miles in length and has a nominal capacity of approximately 320 MMcf/d. Its Other Coastal Straddles consist of over two operated gas processing plants and approximately three plants, which are not operated by the Company. These plants, having an aggregate processing capacity of approximately 3,255 MMcf/d, are situated on mainline natural gas pipelines near the coastline and process volumes of natural gas collected from multiple offshore gathering systems and pipelines throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Coastal Straddles owns interest in the Pelican and Seahawk gathering systems, which has a combined length of approximately 200 miles and a combined capacity of approximately 230 MMcf/d. These systems gather natural gas from the shallow waters of the central Gulf of Mexico and supply a portion of the natural gas delivered to the Barracuda and Lowry processing facilities.Logistics and Marketing DivisionThe Company's Logistics and Marketing Division is also referred to as the Downstream Business. It includes the activities necessary to convert mixed NGLs into NGL products and provide certain value-added services, such as the fractionation, storage, terminaling, transportation, exporting, distribution and marketing of NGLs and NGL products; the storing and terminaling of refined petroleum products and crude oil, and certain natural gas supply and marketing activities in support of the Company's other businesses. These products are delivered to end users through pipelines, barges, ships, trucks and rail cars. End users of NGL products include petrochemical, refining companies, export markets for propane and butane, and propane markets for heating, cooking or agricultural applications.The Company's Logistics Assets segment uses its platform of integrated assets to receive, fractionate, store, treat, transport and deliver NGLs typically under fee-based arrangements. Its logistics assets are generally connected to and supplied in part by its gathering and processing assets and are primarily located at Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas and in Lake Charles Louisiana. This segment also contains refined petroleum product and crude oil storage and terminaling facilities in Texas (the Channelview and Patriot Terminals; both on the Houston Ship Channel), Maryland (the Baltimore Terminal), and Washington (the Sound Terminal, located in Tacoma). After being extracted in the field, mixed NGLs, referred to as Y-grade or raw NGL mix, are transported to a centralized facility for fractionation where the mixed NGLs are separated into discrete NGL products: ethane, ethane-propane mix, propane, normal butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline. Its fractionation assets include ownership interests in over three standalone fractionation facilities that are located on the Gulf Coast, approximately two of which it operates, over one at Mont Belvieu, Texas and the other at Lake Charles, Louisiana.The Company's NGL storage assets provide warehousing of mixed NGLs, NGL products and petrochemical products in underground wells , which allows for the injection and withdrawal of such products at various times in order to meet supply and demand cycles. Its terminaling operations provide the inbound/outbound logistics and warehousing of mixed NGLs, NGL products and petrochemical products in above-ground storage tanks. Its NGL underground storage and terminaling facilities serve single markets, such as propane, as well as multiple products and markets. In addition, some of its facilities are connected to marine, rail and truck loading and unloading facilities that provide services and products to its customers. The Company provides long and short-term storage and terminaling services, and throughput capability to third-party customers for a fee. Its Petroleum Logistics business owns and operates storage and terminaling facilities in Texas, Maryland and Washington. These facilities not only serve the refined petroleum products and crude oil markets, but also include liquefied petroleum gases (LPGs) and biofuels. Across the Logistics Assets segment, the Company owns or operates a total of approximately 40 storage wells at its facilities with a net storage capacity of approximately 64 million barrels (MMBbl), the usage of which may be limited by brine handling capacity, which is utilized to displace NGLs from storage. The Company operates its storage and terminaling facilities to support its fractionation facilities at Mont Belvieu and Lake Charles for receipt of mixed NGLs and storage of fractionated NGLs to service the petrochemical, refinery, export and heating customers/markets, as well as its wholesale domestic terminals that focus on logistics to service the heating market customer base. Its fractionation, storage and terminaling business is supported by approximately 900 miles of company-owned pipelines to transport mixed NGLs and specification products.The Company's Marketing and Distribution segment transports, distributes and markets NGLs through terminals and transportation assets across the United States. It owns or commercially manages terminal facilities in a number of states, including Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arizona, Nevada, California, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, New Jersey and Washington. The Marketing and Distribution segment consists of NGL Distribution and Marketing, Wholesale Domestic Marketing, Refinery Services, Commercial Transportation, Natural Gas Marketing and Terminal Facilities. The Company markets its own NGL production and also purchases component NGL products from other NGL producers and marketers for resale. The wholesale propane marketing operations primarily sell propane and related logistics services to multi-state retailers, independent retailers and other end users. Its propane supply primarily originates from both its refinery/gas supply contracts and its other owned or managed logistics and marketing assets.The Company's refinery services business provides NGL balancing services through contractual arrangements with refiners to purchase and/or market propane and to supply butanes. The Company's NGL transportation and distribution infrastructure include a range of assets supporting both third-party customers and the delivery requirements of its marketing and asset management business. The Company provides fee-based transportation services to refineries and petrochemical companies throughout the Gulf Coast area. The Company's transportation assets include approximately 700 railcars that it leases and manages, and approximately 80 owned and leased transport tractors and over 20 company-owned pressurized NGL barges. The Company also markets natural gas available from the Gathering and Processing segments, purchases and resells natural gas in selected the United States markets, and manages the scheduling and logistics for these activities.The Company competes with Kinder Morgan, Inc., WTG Gas Processing, L.P., DCP Midstream Partners LP, Devon Energy Corporation, Enbridge Inc., Enlink Midstream Partners LP, Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., ONEOK, Inc., Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP, Hanlon Gas Processing, Ltd., J-W Operating Company, Louisiana Intrastate Gas Company L.L.C., Crestwood Equity Partners LP, Great Northern Midstream LLC, Caliber Midstream Partners, L.P., Bridger Pipeline LLC, Enterprise Products Partners L.P., BP p.l.c. and LoneStar NGL LLC.

Why Targa Resources Is a Target
Targa Resources and its MLP Targa Resources Partners were rumored to be involved in a takeover deal. It’s the company’s similarities to Enterprise Products Partners that made it targeted for takeover. 











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Jun 21, 2014 at 8:00AM
            
            





According to a report Thursday by Bloomberg, Targa Resources (NYSE:TRGP) and its MLP, Targa Resources Partners (NYSE:NGLS), were being targeted for a takeover. While Targa Resources issued a press release saying the takeover talks have ceased without a deal, it's no surprise to see that the company was targeted in the first place. Further, while Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) wasn't the rumored buyer, it's Targa Resources Partners' similarities to Enterprise Products Partners that made it an ideal takeover target in the first place. 
Strong platform As the following slide points out Targa Resources Partners owns a very diverse portfolio of midstream assets.

Source: Targa Resources Partners Investor Presentation (Link opens a PDF) 
As that map shows the company has field gathering and processing assets in both the Bakken Shale region as well as in the Permian Basin. Both of these areas are important oil rich growth areas that are currently in need of infrastructure assets. Because of that Targa Resources Partners' assets are in high demand and it has steady growth prospects.
Further, the company owns gathering and processing assets along the Gulf Coast as well as logistic assets in the Gulf. It also has a leading position in the Mont Belvieu NGL hub as it owns the second largest fractionation position in Mont Belvieu trailing only Enterprise Products Partners. Given that the Gulf Coast is home to America's petrochemical industry, these assets are also well positioned.





One often overlooked asset In addition to its strong footprints in leading shale basins and a leading position in Mont Belvieu, Targa Resources Partners has one asset that's often overlooked. The company owns one of the two commercially operating NGL export facilities on the Gulf Coast that's linked to Mont Belvieu. The other NGL export facility just happens to be operated by Enterprise Products Partners.
As the following slide notes Targa Resources Partners' Galena Park Marine Import/Export Terminal is very strategically well positioned in the Gulf Coast.

Source: Targa Resources Partners
Because of this Targa Resources Partners is in the midst of expanding its Galena Park Marine Terminal to take advantage of its strategic position to increase its capacity to export propane and other NGLs out of the facility. The facility can currently export about 4 million barrels per month, but once its second expansion phase is complete in the third quarter the company will be able to export 6 million barrels per month.





While that's a far cry from Enterprise Products Partners' plan to grow its export capacity from 7.5 million barrels per month to 16 million by the end of next year, its a vitally important asset to Targa Resources Partners. In fact, by already having an operational export facility Targa Resources Partners is well ahead of other planned facilities as its peers reposition for energy exports making the company a valuable target for a company looking to access the export market.
Investor takeaway Clearly Targa Resources Partners has the asset base that would make it a prime takeover target. In acquiring Targa Resources a rival to Enterprise Products Partners would gain access to the second largest fractionation capacity in Mont Belvieu as well as the only other NGL export facility connected to that NGL hub. While Targa Resources Partners' recently rumored deal is said to have fallen apart, its strong asset base is likely to bring another suitor very soon. In fact an ideal candidate, in my opinion, is Enterprise Products Partners as it could really consolidate its position at Mont Belvieu as well as in energy exports while at the same time adding Bakken Shale assets to its portfolio. With Targa Resources' now back on the market, it might be time for Enterprise Products Partners to take a look.
