Bagels and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, in addition to JDE and Keurig Green Mountain, all in partnership with JAB, the investment vehicle of the Reimann family from Germany.[16]
From an advisory standpoint, BDT & Company has advised many leading business-owning families and their companies, including Alberto-Culver, Carlson, Cox Enterprises, EXOR, Guardian Industries, Guthy-Renker, Hyatt, JAB, Mars, Molex, S. C. Johnson & Son, and Wrigley.[16][17]
Personal life[edit]

Bagels and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, in addition to JDE and Keurig Green Mountain, all in partnership with JAB, the investment vehicle of the Reimann family from Germany.[16]

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, BMO Capital Markets Corp., and Bank of America, N.A. acted as financial advisors to Alliance.  Bank of America, N.A. and BMO Capital Markets Corp. acted as joint lead arrangers for a senior secured credit facility.  Debevoise & Plimpton LLP acted as legal advisor to Alliance and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP acted as legal advisor to BDT.  Completion of the transaction is expected in the third quarter of 2015.  Additional terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Weber Grill family donates $10 million to U of C neonatal unit


The family that founded the Weber Grill donated $10 million to the University of Chicago hospital's neonatal-care unit.“We got to know David Gozal, who heads the neonatal unit and learned about his vision to really help these young lives,” Jim Stephen, chairman of Palatine-based Weber-Stephen Products Co., told me yesterday before news of the big donation was announced.Mr. Stephen, his nine siblings, mother, Marge Stephen, and a niece each donated about $800,000 to come up with the donation. The neonatology center's new name is the Margaret M. and George A. Stephen Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), named in honor of Mr. Stephen's father, who died in 1993.Weber-Stephen Products was acquired by BDT Capital Partners LLC three years ago, though Mr. Stephen's family still runs the grill-making company.The family's gift will support research into treatments for premature newborns and genetic studies of childhood diseases. The donation also enables the hospital to hire a neonatologist who will become the new Stephen Family Professor of Pediatrics, the hospital said in a statement.Mr. Stephen told me the gift's origins began more than a decade ago when he and his family first learned about the work being done at the hospital. Then the family started taking part in a picnic at the hospital.“We're in the barbecue business so we thought we'd help with the picnic,” he said.That participation grew into serious discussions among family members to donate, said Mr. Stephen, adding it was his sister, Barb Rapp, who organized the effort.

 Educational Background



BA in Economics with Honors, Phi Beta Kappa 


The Johns Hopkins University

                  The Johns Hopkins University opened in 1876, with the inauguration of its first president, Daniel Coit Gilman. "What are we aiming at?" Gilman asked in his installation address. "The encouragement of research ... and the advancement of individual scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and the society where they dwell."

The mission laid out by Gilman remains the university's mission today, summed up in a simple but powerful restatement of Gilman's own words: "Knowledge for the world."

What Gilman created was a research university, dedicated to advancing both students' knowledge and the state of human knowledge through research and scholarship. Gilman believed that teaching and research are interdependent, that success in one depends on success in the other. A modern university, he believed, must do both well. The realization of Gilman's philosophy at Johns Hopkins, and at other institutions that later attracted Johns Hopkins-trained scholars, revolutionized higher education in America, leading to the research university system as it exists today.

After more than 130 years, Johns Hopkins remains a world leader in both teaching and research. Eminent professors mentor top students in the arts and music, the humanities, the social and natural sciences, engineering, international studies, education, business and the health professions. Those same faculty members, and their research colleagues at the university's Applied Physics Laboratory, have each year since 1979 won Johns Hopkins more federal research and development funding than any other university.

The university has nine academic divisions and campuses throughout the Baltimore-Washington area. The Krieger School of Arts and Sciences, the Whiting School of Engineering, the School of Education and the Carey Business School are based at the Homewood campus in northern Baltimore. The schools of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing share a campus in east Baltimore with The Johns Hopkins Hospital. The Peabody Institute, a leading professional school of music, is located on Mount Vernon Place in downtown Baltimore. The Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies is located in Washington's Dupont Circle area.

The Applied Physics Laboratory is a division of the university co-equal to the nine schools, but with a non-academic, research-based mission. APL, located between Baltimore and Washington, supports national security and also pursues space science, exploration of the Solar System and other civilian research and development.

Johns Hopkins also has a campus near Rockville in Montgomery County, Md., and has academic facilities in Nanjing, China, and in Bologna, Italy. It maintains a network of continuing education facilities throughout the Baltimore-Washington region, including centers in downtown Baltimore, in downtown Washington and in Columbia.

When considered in partnership with its sister institution, the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System, the university is Maryland's largest employer and contributes more than $10 billion a year to the state's economy
