SolarWindow™ Accelerates Product-Durability Testing Following Promising Early Results










Columbia, MD – March 10, 2015 – SolarWindow™ Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB:NENE; SOLW – Pending), developer of see-through electricity-generating coatings for glass, confirmed encouraging test results from efforts to meet or exceed warranty periods for commercial-grade window products. As a result of favorable degradation and stability outcomes, the Company will direct resources to accelerate important durability and product-lifecycle testing efforts, effective immediately.
SolarWindow™ products, under development, include rapid-payback electricity-generating windows for installation on the estimated 85 million tall towers and detached homes in the United States.
Dr. Scott Hammond, Principal Scientist, SolarWindow Technologies, Inc., Setting Up for SolarWindow™ Mini-Module Performance Measurement
According to latest power and financial modeling, SolarWindow™ systems boast the industry’s fastest known financial return, and could achieve payback within one year. To produce the equivalent amount of power with conventional solar systems would require at least 5-11 years for payback and at least 10-12 acres of valuable urban land.
“Our SolarWindow™ products are being developed to performance standards which give real estate developers, engineers, architects, building designers, and future customers plenty of financial incentive. Of course, we also want to instill the confidence that comes with industry-duration warranties,” explained Mr. John A. Conklin, President and CEO of SolarWindow™ Technologies, Inc.
SolarWindow™ devices have been undergoing testing of their durability in an effort to meet or exceed warranty periods for commercial-grade insulated glass units (IGUs) installed on tall towers. Durability determines product-lifecycle, an important feature to the commercial adoption of SolarWindow™ products for generating electricity on glass windows.
Among tests conducted by researchers have been measurements to evaluate the durability, degradation, and performance of SolarWindow™ coatings. These liquid coatings are organic and generate electricity while remaining see-through. Researchers validated the electromechanical stability and performance of these coatings.
Additional tests were conducted to include packaging; a series of technical processes being developed by the Company for applying special sealants to SolarWindow™ devices.
These tests measured factors related to durability, reliability, degradation, integrity and performance of seals. These special seals are applied along areas where moisture or weather elements could potentially create wear and tear. Moisture can cause erosion, an especially important factor to the lifecycle of window products.
“I’m pleased that durability tests of SolarWindow™ coatings and their associated sealants have generated a level of performance we believe is essential to commercial warranty standard. Our next important steps will address efficiency, lifetime and cost for future product commercialization,” concluded Mr. Conklin.
 




About SolarWindow Technologies, Inc.



 SolarWindow Technologies, Inc. is a developer of next generation, transparent electricity-generating SolarWindow™ coatings.
SolarWindow™ coatings generate electricity on see-through glass and flexible plastics with colored tints popular to skyscraper glass. Unlike conventional systems, SolarWindow™ can be applied to all four sides of tall towers, generating electricity using natural and artificial light conditions and even shaded areas. SolarWindow™ uses organic materials, which are dissolved into liquid, ideal for low-cost high-output manufacturing; and is the subject of a patent pending technology.
The company’s Proprietary Power Production & Financial Model (Power & Financial Model) uses photovoltaic (PV) modeling calculations that are consistent with renewable energy practitioner standards for assessing, evaluating and estimating renewable energy for a PV project. The Power & Financial Model estimator takes into consideration building geographic location, solar radiation for flat-plate collectors (SolarWindow™ irradiance is derated to account for 360 degree building orientation and vertical installation), climate zone energy use and generalized skyscraper building characteristics when estimating PV power and energy production, and carbon dioxide equivalents. Actual power, energy production and carbon dioxide equivalents modeled may vary based upon building-to-building situational characteristics and varying installation methodologies.

        I have attempted to contact management, but have not heard back yet.
        Background
SolarWindow Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB:WNDW) is a development-stage company that claims to be developing see-through solar panels that can be used in place of standard glass windows as a source of renewable energy. The company claims that these products can be used as an alternative-energy solution which can be used to replace conventional glass in buildings. It sounds like an intriguing concept, but if one examines the company's public filings and history, and compares them with the statements presented by the company, it's clear that there is a discontinuity between the information presented on the company's website at solarwindow.com and what its filings disclose.
SolarWindow Technologies, Inc. was originally incorporated in Nevada in 1998 under the name Octillion Corp. It changed its name to New Energy Technologies, Inc. in December of 2008 and again changed its name to SolarWindow Technologies, Inc. on March 9, 2015.
Business and Corporate Website
As mentioned before, SolarWindow Technologies is engaged in developing see-through solar panels that can replace standard glass windows and be used as a source of power generation. From page 15 of the company's most recent 10-K, WNDW describes its business as follows,

We are a pre-revenue developer of transparent electricity-generating SolarWindow™ coatings. Our SolarWindow™ technology provides the ability to harvest light energy from the sun and artificial sources and generate electricity from a see-through, semi-transparent, coating of OPV solar cells applied to glass and plastics. Our SolarWindow™ technology is the subject of a patent pending technology. Our MotionPower™ technology harvests "kinetic" or "motion" energy from vehicles when they slow down before coming to a stop and converts this captured energy into electricity. Our MotionPower™ technology is the subject of fifty-nine (59) patent filings.
We do not currently have any commercial products and there is no assurance that we will successfully be able to design, develop, manufacture, or sell any commercial products in the future.
Our product development programs involve ongoing research and development ("R&D") and product development efforts, and the commitment of significant resources to support the extensive invention, design, engineering, testing, prototyping, and intellectual property initiatives carried-out by our contract engineers, scientists, and consultants.
Ultimately, we plan to market any SolarWindow™ technology products through co-marketing, co-promotion, licensing and distribution arrangements with third party collaborators. We believe that this approach could provide immediate access to pre-existing distribution channels, therefore potentially increasing market penetration and commercial acceptance of our products and enabling us to avoid expending significant funds for development of a large sales and marketing organization.
We cannot accurately predict the amount of funding or the time required to successfully commercialize our SolarWindow™ technology. The actual cost and time required to commercialize our SolarWindow™ technology may vary significantly depending on, among other things, the results of our R&D efforts, the cost of developing, acquiring, or licensing various enabling technologies, changes in the focus and direction of our R&D programs, competitive and technological advances, the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing claims with respect to patents, the regulatory approval process and manufacturing, marketing and other costs associated with commercialization of these technologies. Because of this uncertainty, even if financing is available to us, we may secure insufficient funding to effectuate our business plan.


From this description, the company tells us that they are currently developing the technology, and that it has filed for patents, but it's clear that any production-ready product is a long way off, and the company readily admits that they have no timetable or funding estimates to complete its projects.
With respect to MotionPower, very little detail is given about this product -- it seems extremely similar to what hybrid cars are doing right now with regenerative braking and there is no detail about what makes it unique. While the company boasts of 59 patent filings, it is unclear whether there is any possibility of these becoming monetized, and the company does not explain why it switched from working on this technology to solely investing in its SolarWindow product.
The company's corporate website is slick and polished with an aesthetically pleasing presentation. However, there is little factual material information there - there are a lot of references to the company's press releases and pictures of people in white lab coats gawking at tinted glass, but no hard details or data about any progress that the company has made on its product. Additionally, there is no Careers section on the website - I'd expect that a company that is still developing a product would be in need of scientists, researchers, and skilled craftsmen in order to make its vision a reality, but there is no information about getting a job there.
Financials
The company's financials indicate that the company is operating on a shoestring budget, and is quickly running out of cash. Additionally, management's compensation seems extremely generous for a publicly traded company that is in such poor financial shape.
Balance Sheet
From the company's most recent 10-Q filed on April 14, 2015, the company has $167,068 in cash and cash equivalents, and total assets of $382,057. It's important to note that of these assets, only $35,967 constitute "equipment." On the liabilities side, the company has $239,452 in accounts payable, $303,955 in interest payable, and convertible debt in the amount of $193,268 totaling $1,347,675 in current liabilities. Not looking too good…how's the income statement look?

Income Statement
The company's most recent income statement lists a net loss of $1.52 million, zero revenue (no surprise, as it doesn't have a marketable product yet) and operating expenses of $815,832 of which $662,473 constitute Selling, General, and Administrative, and $153,359 are Research and Development.
If we scroll further down to Page 17 of the 10-Q, the Results of Operations section lists $466,623 in SG&A, $143,901 in R&D, and $205,308 in Stock Compensation for the three months ended February 28, 2015, which lets us know that some of the expense for SG&A and R&D was paid in stock. While it's nice that the company disclosed this, it really highlights WNDW's cash shortfall if they feel the need to pay for things this way.
Cash Flow
The cash flow statement for the six months ended February 28, 2015 is rather interesting -- it shows that the company used $1.1 million in its operations, but only spent $15,560 on equipment which seems like a minimal sum for a company that claims to be developing cutting-edge technology. Additionally, the cash flow statement shows that the company also received $501,242 in proceeds from issuance of stock.
Given that the company has only just over $167k in the bank, and its operations used over $1.1 million in six months, it's clear that it can't continue down the current path, and the company's auditors agree with me. On Page 8 of the 10-Q, there is a Going Concern notice which reads,

The Company does not have any commercialized products and has not generated any revenue since inception. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $25,726,465 as of February 28, 2015, and does not have positive cash flow from operating activities. Included in the deficit are non-cash expenses totaling $9,208,014 relating to the issuance of stock for services, compensatory stock options, warrants granted for value and accretion of debt discounts. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern, which is dependent upon the Company's ability to establish itself as a profitable business.
In its report with respect to the Company's financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2014, the Company's independent auditors expressed substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue operations as a going concern. Because the Company has not generated revenues from its operations and does not expect to do so in the near future, its ability to continue as a going concern is wholly dependent upon its ability to obtain additional financing. Currently, the Company is seeking additional financing but has no commitments to obtain any such financing, and there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.
As of February 28, 2015, the Company had cash of $167,068. On March 4, 2015, subsequent to its quarter end, the Company entered into a bridge loan agreement pursuant to which the Company borrowed $600,000. Based upon its current and near term anticipated level of operations and expenditures, the Company believes that cash on hand should be sufficient to enable it to continue operations through June 2015.
If adequate funds are not available on reasonable terms, or at all, it would result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. In particular, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or terminate its research programs, sell rights to its SolarWindow™ technology and/or MotionPowerTM technology or other technologies or products based upon such technologies, or license the rights to such technologies or products on terms that are less favorable to the Company than might otherwise be available.
In view of these conditions, the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations and on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. These consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments which will be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements."


This seems pretty bleak -- only enough cash to continue operations until June. In the Liquidity and Capital Resources section on page 18 of the 10-Q, it states,
Management recognizes that in order for us to meet our capital requirements, and continue to operate, additional financing will be necessary. We expect to raise additional funds through private or public equity investment in order to maintain and/or expand the range and scope of our business operations.
Indicating that management's plan to remedy the situation is to go further into debt and to issue more stock, thereby diluting current shareholders even further.
Management compensation and major shareholders
The company's most recent 10-K states that for 2014, the President, CEO, CFO, and Director received a salary of $214,325 in cash, $29,000 in stock awards, $1,862,000 in option awards, and $25,702 in "all other compensation", totaling $2,137,245.
It seems troubling that a company which admits that it will have enough cash to carry its operations for a few months would be so generous with its compensation -- the CEO's salary alone exceeds the company's current cash holdings of $167,068, and all of the additional stock and option compensation make it look like the CEO is more concerned with immediate financial rewards than long-term success. How is the company supposed to pay for R&D and additional employees if so much is being spent on the CEO's compensation?
Beyond the outrageous executive compensation, it's important to note that there are several significant shareholders of the company's common stock beyond the executives and/or directors. These include two entities identified as Kalen Capital Corporation, which owns 24.05 million shares, or 62.3%, and 1420524 Alberta, Ltd., which owns 4.4 million shares or 17.1% on a fully-diluted basis. If one looks at the most recent 10-Q, there are 24.9 million shares outstanding, indicating that there are shares from the company's convertible note that have not been converted to common shares yet. If one looks at page 46 of the most recent S-1/A, it explains that an additional 14.29 million shares would become outstanding following the conversion of the Convertible Note.

Kalen Capital Corporation
A quick Google search for Kalen Capital Corporation yields an interesting result -- the first hit is for http://harmelrayat.com/, a website which reads, "Harmel Rayat is an investor, entrepreneur and business owner based in Vancouver, Canada. He is the owner of and Kalen Capital Corporation."
The second is a wikipedia page for Harmel S Rayat, which appears to be directly copy-and-paste of the content of the harmelrayat.com website mentioned previously.
Interesting, but it gets even more intriguing. Looking deeper into Harmel S Rayat, there is an SEC order imposing a cease-and desist action from 2003 which names him; he was charged with running EquityAlert.com, which the SEC identified as a stock promotion email list.
Remember when we noted that the company was founded as Octillion? If we dig a bit deeper, further there is some decent investigative coverage on it from another Seeking Alpha writer covering the company's previous involvement with Mr. Rayat, among other issues.
1420524 Alberta, Ltd
On page 52 of the company's most recent 10-K filed on August 31, 2014 it reads, "3,101,304 shares beneficially owned by 1420524 Alberta Ltd. for the benefit of Kalen Jai Rayat. Kalen Jai Rayat is Mr. Rayat's son (see footnote 7 for additional information), or (2) the 933,334 shares beneficially owned by 1420468 Alberta Ltd., a private Alberta corporation, wholly owned by Jasbinder Chohan, as the trustee under the TJR Family Trust dated August 28, 2008, for the benefit of Talia Jevan Rayat, Mr. Rayat's daughter. Mr. Rayat is not a beneficiary or trustee of the aforementioned trusts and disclaims beneficial ownership of all shares owned by each of his children's trusts.
So it appears that over 79% of the company's stock is controlled by Harmel Rayat or his family, someone who has previously been accused of the SEC by wrongdoing.
In looking for greater detail regarding the company and its past, looked through all of the company's Form 10-K's filed with the SEC going back to 2008. Through all of these filings, there were several major consistencies between them. The employee count has always been extremely low (the maximum number of employees that the company has ever disclosed in any of them is four) and executive compensation has always been extremely high, typically being at least six figures in salary and millions in stock and/or options for the top executive. And yet, all the company has to show for it is a $25 million accumulated deficit and no material progress beyond an abandoned project.

Employees and Business Location
Additionally, the company disclosed that as of August 31, 2014, it only has three full-time employees and is operating out of an office which it shares with a law firm at 10632 Little Patuxent Parkway, Suite 406 Columbia, Maryland 21044.
The company does list an additional office in Tampa, Florida. A Google search for the address (8875 Hidden River Parkway, Suite 300, Tampa, Florida 33637) reveals several different tenants and businesses, but no reference to SolarWindow Technologies or its predecessor, New Energy Technologies, Inc.
Beyond the ambiguous tenant situation, the office is described as being 600 square feet, and pictures show that it appears to be a standard office which appears to have insufficient workspace and equipment and space for conducting the research that WNDW claims to be doing, at least without major renovations which would likely cost far more than the amount that the company spent on equipment.
While management states, "We believe that our office facilities are sufficient and adequate for our purposes given our present staff and research objective" It seems incredibly limited for a $52 million publicly-traded company that claims to be developing cutting-edge technology. The company makes no other mention of any other significant workspaces in its filings.
While the company does have one post-doc research employee, I find it difficult to believe that he alone is capable of designing, developing, and testing such cutting-edge technology in an office shared with a law firm, and with such a limited amount of funding for equipment.
Recent publicity
On April 8, 2015, the company issued a press release announcing that an "Independent Validation Confirms One-Year SolarWindow Financial Payback." However, there is little given as proof that the company's technology works or is even close to being ready -- the entire "financial model" in the press release appears to be based on assumptions from an undeveloped and untested product. Given this context, the press release reads as if it is begging potential shareholders to buy stock rather than a material update on the company's development progress. Claim such as,

Compared to conventional rooftop solar systems, SolarWindow™ technology installed on a 50-story building could generate up to 50-times greater power while delivering 15-times the environmental benefits, according to Company engineers. For conventional solar systems to produce the equivalent amount of power as SolarWindow™ would require at least 10-12 acres of valuable urban land at least 5-11 years for payback.
Sound great, but are not given any context and are not backed by any data in the press release.
Conclusion
Given the company's financial situation, past history, and current resources, it is my opinion that WNDW's current valuation of over $52 million at the time of this writing is not justified. The company is burning through cash at an untenable rate, and its workforce is too limited in experience and manpower to achieve its goals. The company has been issued a Going Concern notice by its auditors, and management admits that it plans to raise capital through equity issuances which will lead to further dilution of current shareholders.
The fact that management has, for years, been extremely generous with their own compensation in cash, stock, and warrants (shareholders' money, in effect) while spending little on equipment needed for research is a major problem, and they have little to show for it except for a massive accumulated deficit. While the company's principal scientist does have a PhD in Organic/Materials Chemistry, the company has been investing very little in equipment that he could use to advance its projects.
Beyond the material woes and excessive executive compensation, the biggest red flag is the company's largest shareholder has previously been involved in stock promotions and was even previously fined by the SEC for $20,000.
Ironically, the only red flag that I haven't seen from this company is a series of promotional emails in an attempt to boost the stock price, but it would not surprise me at all if I were to see some hit my inbox in the future.

If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect our actual results may vary materially from those expected or projected.  Except where the context otherwise requires and for purposes of this Form 10-Q only, "we," "us," "our," "Company," "our Company," and "SolarWindow" refer to SolarWindow Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Overview  We are a pre-revenue company developing our proprietary SolarWindow(TM) transparent electricity generating coatings. Our SolarWindow(TM) technology provides the ability to harvest light energy from the sun and artificial sources and generate electricity from a transparent, coating of organic photovoltaic ("OPV") layers applied to glass, flexible glass and plastic surfaces and could potentially be used on any of the more than 85 million commercial and residential buildings in the United States alone. Our SolarWindow(TM) technology is the subject of 14 pending patents.  The development of our SolarWindow(TM) technology continues to advance under the Stevenson-Wydler Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (the "NREL CRADA") with the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (the "Alliance for Sustainable Energy"), which is the operator of The National Renewable Energy Laboratory ("NREL").  Table of Contents  We have achieved numerous important milestones and overcome major technical challenges in the development of our SolarWindow(TM) technology, including the ability to generate electricity on glass while remaining transparent and the application of our coatings on to glass at room temperature and pressure.  A brief list of some of our more important milestones includes:  � entered into the NREL CRADA which is still in effect.  � filed fourteen patent applications for our electricity-generating coating and SolarWindow(TM) technology development efforts that are independent of both the USF sponsored research and NREL CRADA research.  expanded the use of our SolarWindow(TM) coatings to include two new product  determined the correct combination of compounds to create a single solar  scaled-up from a single solar cell to a one-inch by one-inch "array". An  � developed a method for spraying our see-through electricity-generating coatings onto glass surfaces at room temperature and pressure, a significant technical achievement which may provide a manufacturing advantage over expensive and cumbersome high temperature-specific and high positive or negative pressure-sensitive manufacturing methods common to conventional solar PV manufacturing.  � invented and fabricated novel contacts that conduct electricity on SolarWindow(TM), yet remain see-through. Conventional contacts for conducting electricity use materials which generally block visibility and inhibit transparency, sometimes otherwise creating visible lines on or "in" the window.  � engineered new methods for absorbing light energy to improve the flow of electrons (negatively charged particles), a process fundamental to generating electricity necessary for power appliances and fixtures. In principle, this advancement increases the efficiency of the solar cell and hence its ability to create more electricity from a given level of solar irradiation.  � discovered new, solution-based compounds that successfully mobilize the electrons necessary for generating electricity on SolarWindow(TM) and eliminated the use of other materials that could be prone to breakdown or failure. We have been able to produce these compounds from comparatively in-expensive starting materials, and have discovered methods that allow for reproducibility.  � created methods for increasing power output by maximizing the number of solar-cells present in our SolarWindow(TM) array for a defined surface area.  � successfully scaled-up SolarWindow(TM) prototypes from a one-inch square to a twelve-inch square (144 square inches in surface area).  � generated electricity on flexible plastic using novel see-through SolarWindow(TM) coatings.  � developed new SolarWindow(TM) coatings with increased transparency and improved color.  � successfully fabricated the latest working window prototype using a faster, rapid scale-up process for applying solution-based coatings.  � produced the largest OPV device ever fabricated at NREL in the institute's history.  � successfully collected and transported electricity using a virtually 'invisible' conductive wiring system developed for SolarWindow(TM).  completed performance tests of the transparent electricity-generating  � successfully processed SolarWindow(TM) transparent electricity generating glass through rigorous high pressure and temperature processing of a commercial autoclave system in order to create a laminated window pane at a window fabricator, and demonstrated that the SolarWindow(TM) coatings continued to perform after the autoclave processing..  Table of Contents  We are currently developing products (collectively, the "SolarWindow(TM) Products") derived from our SolarWindow(TM) technology designed to address several potential markets, including:  � SolarWindow(TM) - Commercial - A flat glass product for installation in new commercial towers under construction and replacement windows;  � SolarWindow(TM) - Structural Glass - Structural glass walls and curtains for tall structures;  � SolarWindow(TM) - Architectural Glass - Textured and decorative interior glass walls, room dividers, etc.;  � SolarWindow(TM) - Residential - A window glass for installation in new residential homes under construction and replacement windows;  � SolarWindow(TM) - Flex - Flexible films which may be applied directly onto "previously installed (window) glass, similar to aftermarket window tint films, for retrofit to existing commercial towers, buildings, and residential homes; Note these flexible films can also be applied to new construction windows;  � SolarWindow(TM) Retrofit Veneer - Transparent, tinted, and flexible veneers that installers can apply directly on to existing windows.  Our focus is on the development and deployment of SolarWindow(TM)-Commercial, Structural, and Architectural products. Our product development efforts have produced early working prototypes for these applications, which we are sharing with potential commercialization partners. Commercialization of the SolarWindow(TM) technology will require significant further capital, research, development and testing. This additional work should enable us to ascertain whether the SolarWindow(TM) technology can form the basis for a commercially viable technology or product and which products will be first to market.  SolarWindow(TM) Retrofit Veneer products are being developed as transparent, tinted, flexible veneers that can be applied directly on to existing windows. This expanded product line broadens our market reach beyond new and replacement installations, to include windows currently installed on the estimated five million commercial buildings constructed in the U.S. alone. This retrofit veneer product will be developed in parallel to the other SolarWindow(TM) Products currently undergoing further development.  Recently, we have developed the capability to integrate transparent SolarWindow(TM) coatings on to flexible glass. This presents new product opportunities for curved and non-flat surfaces in automotive, aircraft, and military applications. By applying SolarWindow(TM) coatings on to flexible glass we can develop products with the flexibility of plastic and yet maintain the durability, scratch-resistance, and ease of maintenance of rigid glass.  We do not currently have any commercial products and there is no assurance that we will successfully be able to design, develop, manufacture, or sell any commercial products in the future. Our product development programs involve ongoing R&D and product development efforts, and the commitment of significant resources to support the extensive invention, design, engineering, testing, prototyping, and intellectual property initiatives carried-out by our contract engineers, scientists, and consultants.  Table of Contents  We plan to market any SolarWindow(TM) Products we commercialize through co-marketing and co-promotion, licensing, and distribution arrangements with third party collaborators. To advance the technical development and subsequent commercialization of our SolarWindow(TM) products, we are actively seeking technology and product licensing and joint venture arrangements and manufacturing process integration relationships with commercial partners and industry, and organizations which have established technical competencies, market reach, and mature distribution networks in the solar PV, building-integrated PV, and alternative and renewable energy market industries and further research institutions. We believe that this approach could provide immediate access to pre-existing distribution channels which can increase the market penetration and commercial acceptance of our products, and enable us to avoid expending significant funds for development of a large sales and marketing organization. We have not yet entered into any such arrangements.  We cannot accurately predict the amount of funding or the time required to successfully commercialize our SolarWindow(TM) technology. The actual cost and time required to commercialize our SolarWindow(TM) technology may vary significantly depending on, among other things, the results of our R&D efforts; the cost of developing, acquiring, or licensing various enabling technologies; changes in the focus and direction of our R&D programs; competitive and technological advances; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing claims with respect to patents; the regulatory approval process; and manufacturing, marketing and other costs associated with commercialization of these technologies. Because of this uncertainty, even if financing is available to us, we may secure insufficient funding to effectuate our business plan.  As of May 31, 2017, we had a working capital deficit of $3,621,169 and cash of $270,875. Subsequent to May 31, 2017, the Company received proceeds of $301,860 from the exercise of 129,000 Series M Warrants. Based upon current and near term anticipated level of operations and expenditures, we believe that cash on hand should be sufficient to enable us to continue operations through October 2017.  Management recognizes that in order for us to meet our capital requirements, and continue to operate, additional financing will be necessary. We expect to raise additional funds through private or public equity investment in order to expand the range and scope of our business operations. We will seek access to private or public equity markets but there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for us to finance our operations on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate positive cash flow, it is unlikely that we will be able to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  Research and Related Agreements  We are a party to certain agreements related to the development of our SolarWindow(TM) technology.  Stevenson-Wydler Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the Alliance for Sustainable Energy  On March 18, 2011, we entered into the NREL CRADA with Alliance for Sustainable Energy, the operator of the NREL under its U.S. Department of Energy contract to advance the commercial development of the SolarWindow(TM) technology. Under terms of the NREL CRADA, NREL researchers will make use of our exclusive intellectual property ("IP"), newly developed IP, and NREL's background IP in order to work towards specific product development goals. Under the terms of the NREL CRADA, we agreed to reimburse Alliance for Sustainable Energy for filing fees associated with all documented, out-of-pocket costs directly related to patent application preparation and filings, and maintenance of the patent applications.  On January 16, 2013, we entered into a modification to the NREL CRADA for the purpose of extending the date pursuant to which NREL's researchers will make use of our exclusive IP and NREL's background IP.  Table of Contents  On March 6, 2013, we entered into Phase II of our NREL CRADA with Alliance for Sustainable Energy. Under the terms of the agreement, researchers will additionally work towards:  � further improving SolarWindow(TM) technology efficiency and transparency;  � optimizing electrical power (current and voltage) output;  � optimizing the application of the active layer coatings which make it possible for SolarWindow(TM) coatings to generate electricity on glass surfaces;  � developing improved electricity-generating coatings by enhancing performance, processing, reliability, and durability;  � optimizing SolarWindow(TM) coating performance on flexible substrates; and  � developing high speed and large area roll-to-roll (R2R) and sheet-to-sheet (S2S) coating methods required for commercial-scale BIPV products and windows.  On December 28, 2015, we entered into another modification of the CRADA (the "Modification") to the NREL CRADA with Alliance for Sustainable Energy, previously entered into between us and NREL. The purpose of the Modification was to extend the date pursuant to which NREL's researchers work towards specific product development goals. Specifically, we are preparing to commercialize our OPV-based SolarWindow(TM) transparent electricity-generating coatings for BIPV, and glass and flexible plastic applications. Under Modification, NREL and the Company will work jointly towards achieving specific commercialization goals and objectives. As of May 31, 2017, the Company made $90,495 of advances to Alliance for Sustainable Energy for work to be performed under the NREL CRADA, which is reflected as an asset on our balance sheet.  Results of Operations Three and Nine Months Ended May 31, 2017 Compared with the Three and Nine Months Ended May 31, 2016 Operating Expenses A summary of our operating expense for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 and 2016 follows: Three Months Ended May 31, Increase / 2017 2016 (Decrease) % Change Operating expense Selling, general and administrative $ 493,790 $ 363,911 $ 129,879 36 Research and development 283,096 253,673 29,423 12 Stock compensation 34,562 65,380 (30,818 ) -47 Total operating expense $ 811,448 $ 682,964 $ (128,484 ) 19 Nine Months Ended May 31, Increase / 2017 2016 (Decrease) % Change Operating expense Selling, general and administrative $ 1,671,533 $ 1,209,381 $ 462152 38 Research and development 743,137 505,575 237,562 47 Stock compensation 565,124 590,055 (24,931 ) -4 Total operating expense $ 2,979,794 $ 2,305,011 $ 674,783 29  Selling, General and Administrative  Selling, general and administrative costs include all expenditures incurred other than research and development related costs, including costs related to personnel, professional fees, travel and entertainment, public company costs, insurance and other office related costs. During the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2016, we experienced an increase in investor communications related fees, legal fees and professional fees offset by decreases in patent related fees and travel and administrative costs.  Table of Contents  Research and Development  Research and development ("R&D") costs represent costs incurred to develop our SolarWindow(TM) technology and are incurred pursuant to our research agreements and agreements with other third party providers and certain internal R&D cost allocations. Payments under these agreements include salaries and benefits for R&D personnel, allocated overhead, contract services and other costs. R&D costs are expensed when incurred, except for non-refundable advance payments for future research and development activities which are capitalized and recognized as expense as the related services are performed. R&D costs increased during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2016 as a result of increased R&D related to improving SolarWindow(TM) technology efficiency and transparency; optimizing electrical power (current and voltage) output; and improving performance, processing, reliability, and durability of SolarWindow(TM) coatings.  Stock Compensation  Expense associated with equity based transactions is calculated and expensed in our financial statements as required pursuant to various accounting rules and is non-cash in nature. Stock compensation represents the expense associated with the amortization of our stock options and issuance of common stock. Stock compensation expense decreased during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2016 due to fewer vesting stock options offset by higher expense related to the issuance of 90,000 shares of common stock to our directors valued at $337,500 in 2016 compared to a similar issuance of 120,000 shares to our directors valued at $393,600 in 2017.  Other Income (Expense) A summary of our other income (expense) for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 and 2016 follows: Three Months Ended May 31, 2017 2016 Change Other income (expense) Interest expense $ (79,162 ) $ (78,931 ) $ 231 Accretion of debt discount (311,727 ) (683,574 ) (371,847 ) Change in fair value of derivative liability - (89,010 ) (89,010 ) Loan conversion inducement expense - (565,406 ) (565,406 ) Total other income (expense) $ (390,889 ) $ (1,416,921 ) $ (1,026,032 ) Nine Months Ended May 31, 2017 2016 Change Other income (expense) Interest expense $ (231,626 ) $ (233,370 ) $ (1,744 ) Accretion of debt discount (999,718 ) (1,967,895 ) (968,177 ) Change in fair value of derivative liability - (161,235 ) (161,235 ) Loan conversion inducement expense - (565,406 ) (565,406 ) Total other income (expense) $ (1,231,344 ) $ (2,927,906 ) $ (1,696,562 )  "Interest expense" relates to the stated interest of our convertible promissory notes and bridge note. "Accretion of debt discount" represents the accretion of the discount applied to our notes as a result of the issuance and modification of detachable warrants and the beneficial conversion feature contained in our notes. The "change in derivative liability" results from the accounting impact of the features included in the sale of Units pursuant to our Offering. The "loan conversion inducement expense" is the result of issuing PPM Units in exchange for repayment of the December 2015 Loan Agreement which terms were more favorable compared to the original conversion terms of the December 2015 Loan Agreement. See "NOTE 2 - Debt" and "NOTE 3 - Private Placements" to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-Q.  Table of Contents  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We have a retained deficit of $37,887,465 through May 31, 2017. Included in the deficit are non-cash expenses totaling $16,098,457 relating to the issuance of stock for services, compensatory stock options, warrants granted for value and accretion of debt discount. Due to the "start-up" nature of our business, we expect to incur losses as we continue development of our technologies.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management recognizes that in order for us to meet our capital requirements, and continue to operate, additional financing will be necessary. We expect to raise additional funds through private or public equity investment in order to maintain and/or expand the range and scope of our business operations; however, there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for us on a timely basis or acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed or generate positive cash flow, it is unlikely that we will be able to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  Our principal source of liquidity is cash in the bank. On May 31, 2017, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $270,875. Subsequent to May 31, 2017, the Company received proceeds of $301,860 from the exercise of 129,000 Series M Warrants. We have financed our operations primarily from the sale of equity and debt securities. We currently do not have any agreements with any third party regarding a potential financing.  Net cash used in operating activities was $2,174,647 during the nine months ended May 31, 2017, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2,019,734 during the nine months ended May 31, 2016. Cash used in operating activities increased during the nine months ended May 31, 2017 due to more cash used for R&D and investor communications fees.  Net cash used in investing activities was $45,547 during the nine months ended May 31, 2017, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $2,300 during the nine months ended May 31, 2016. Cash used in investing activities increased during the nine months ended May 31, 2017 due to the purchase of R&D related equipment.  Net cash used by financing activities was $18,146 during the nine months ended May 31, 2017, compared to cash provided of $1,917,110 during the nine months ended May 31, 2016. Cash used by financing activities during the nine months ended May 31, 2017 was from the payment of the bridge loan whereas cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended May 31, 2016 was from the proceeds of the $550,000 Bridge Loan and sale of Units from our Offering.  Other Contractual Obligations  In addition to our contractual obligations under the research agreements, as of May 31, 2017, we have lease payments of $1,165 each month under our month-to-month corporate office operating lease.  Table of Contents  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

stocks




Solarwindow Technologies Inc (OTCMKTS:WNDW) is making a spectacular move up on big volume in recent months after dripping to $1.10 lows in September of last year. WNDW has a long history of huge volatility and big moves.
WNDW is the new ticker symbol for NENE which also recently changed its name to Solarwindow Technologies Inc from New Energy Technologies, Inc.
Solarwindow Technologies Inc (OTCMKTS:WNDW) is a developer of next generation electricity-generating SolarWindow™ coatings that generate electricity on see-through glass and flexible plastics with colored tints popular to skyscraper glass.
Unlike conventional systems, SolarWindow™ can be applied to all four sides of tall towers, generating electricity using natural and artificial light conditions and even shaded areas. SolarWindow™ uses organic materials, which are dissolved into liquid, ideal for low-cost high-output manufacturing; and is the subject of a patent pending technology.
The Company’s proprietary, patent-pending technologies and products are the subjects of 101 patent-filings, and have been invented, designed, engineered, and prototyped in preparation for further field testing, product development and eventual commercial deployment.
WNDW Proprietary Power Production & Financial Model (Power & Financial Model) uses photovoltaic (PV) modeling calculations that are consistent with renewable energy practitioner standards for assessing, evaluating and estimating renewable energy for a PV project.
The Power & Financial Model estimator takes into consideration building geographic location, solar radiation for flat-plate collectors (SolarWindow™ irradiance is derated to account for 3600 building orientation and vertical installation), climate zone energy use and generalized skyscraper building characteristics when estimating PV power and energy production, and carbon dioxide ()2) equivalents. Actual power, energy production and CO2 equivalents modeled may vary based upon building-to-building situational characteristics and varying installation methodologies.
Engineers estimate that SolarWindow™ systems could generate up to 50-times the power of conventional rooftop solar systems while delivering 15-times the environmental benefits. To produce the equivalent amount of power with conventional solar systems would require at least 5-11 years for payback and at least 10-12 acres of valuable urban land.

WNDW CEO Mr. John Conklin said “Our most recent payback breakthrough marks a very significant boost for eventual commercialization of SolarWindow™ products. Moving forward, we are devoting all development efforts exclusively to SolarWindow™ products using our see-through electricity-generating coatings,”
Solar is a great place to be right now, the industry is growing by leaps and bounds. In the first three quarters of 2014, 3,966 megawatts of solar capacity were installed in the U.S., compared to 2,647 MW in the first three quarters of 2013. Solar deployment is not only expanding, but the pace at which it’s growing keeps accelerating. In 2014, according to a new report from the Solar Foundation, an independently funded think tank, the solar industry added workers almost 20 times faster than the overall U.S. economy, accounting for almost 1.3 percent of all jobs created.
On March 10 WNDW confirmed encouraging test results from efforts to meet or exceed warranty periods for commercial-grade window products. As a result of favorable degradation and stability outcomes, the Company will direct resources to accelerate important durability and product-lifecycle testing efforts, effective immediately.
SolarWindow™ products, under development, include rapid-payback electricity-generating windows for installation on the estimated 85 million tall towers and detached homes in the United States.
According to latest power and financial modeling, SolarWindow™ systems boast the industry’s fastest known financial return, and could achieve payback within one year. To produce the equivalent amount of power with conventional solar systems would require at least 5-11 years for payback and at least 10-12 acres of valuable urban land.

Currently trading at a $58 million market valuation WNDW has $255,000 in the treasury, manageable debt and no revenues to date. But this is an exciting story developing in small caps and there is a ton of excitement on WNDW as the stock races up the charts. The stars are aligning for WNDW and we will be updating on the stock as more details emerge so make sure you are subscribed to Microcapdaily so you know what’s going on with WNDW.
