Tecnoglass Acquires Assets of Glasswall, LLC

 BARRANQUILLA, Colombia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Tecnoglass, Inc. (NASDAQ:TGLS; OTCBB:TGLSW) ("Tecnoglass" or the

      "Company") today announced that it acquired selected assets of

      Glasswall, LLC, a Miami, Florida-based manufacturer of impact-resistant

      windows and door systems used in high-rise commercial and residential

      buildings.

    


      As part of the transaction, Tecnoglass acquired: a 160,000 square foot

      warehouse / manufacturing /office facility in Miami; manufacturing and

      assembly equipment; and Miami-Dade Notice of Acceptance (NOA) for

      products manufactured and sold by Glasswall. Total consideration

      consisted of $4.0 million in Tecnoglass stock and a 15-year, $5.0

      million term loan that Tecnoglass secured to acquire the facilities.

    

José M. Daes, Chief Executive Officer of Tecnoglass, commented, "We

      expect that this transaction will generate considerable near- and

      long-term benefits for Tecnoglass. We immediately broadened our product

      portfolio and client base. We have also consolidated the south Florida

      market, as Glasswall was a competitor known for its quality products,

      exciting design, and client service. Tecnoglass's U.S. sales continue to

      rise, and we remain committed to expanding our presence in this country.

      The acquired facilities will help support this growth by establishing a

      U.S. base for Tecnoglass. Although we will continue to manufacture at

      our 2.3 million square foot facility in Barranquilla, Colombia, we can

      now perform select manufacturing and light assembly in the U.S., which

      will enhance client service and create certain cost efficiencies."

    


      Glasswall was founded in 2002 by Ugo Colombo, a south Florida

      residential and commercial real estate developer. In 1986, Mr. Colombo

      founded CMC Group, a fully-integrated real estate development company

      focused on residential, commercial, and retail properties. CMC Group has

      developed more than 10 million square feet of commercial and luxury

      residential real estate, including landmark projects in Brickell, South

      Beach, Aventura, Miami Beach, and Coconut Grove.

    

Mr. Daes continued, "From a business development perspective, we expect

      that Tecnoglass will supply impact-resistant windows and doors for four

      south Florida properties being developed by CMC Group. These commercial

      and residential projects, which will be similar in scope to CMC Group's

      previously-developed properties, are expected to commence at various

      times during 2015, 2016, and 2017. We anticipate entering into our

      initial agreement with CMC Group by mid-2015."

    

Mr. Colombo stated, "Tecnoglass has been a respected competitor of

      Glasswall for many years. I have come to know the quality of its

      products and service, and the vision of its management team. I am

      pleased to have become a shareholder, and look forward to a long,

      mutually-beneficial working relationship."

    

Mr. Daes concluded, "Through CMC Group, Ugo Colombo has helped redefine

      the south Florida skyline and rejuvenate communities. We are excited at

      the prospect of working together."
