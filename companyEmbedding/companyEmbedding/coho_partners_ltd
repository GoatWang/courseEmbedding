Investment Process
The investment process begins by defining the investable universe of approximately 250 companies from a starting universe of about 1,300 large and midcap companies. We utilize a broad combination of tools including quantitative analysis and focused fundamental research. The quantitative screening process utilizes a proprietary multi-factor model that identifies companies over $3 billion in market capitalization which have the following characteristics:

Strong relative earnings stability and predictability across various economic cycles
Sustainable and reasonable earnings growth over all time horizons
Shareholder focus with respect to dividend growth, payout ratio, and net stock repurchases
High quality balance sheets with low debt to capital and a high S&P rating
Above average profitability with low capital intensiveness, large recurring revenue streams, strong ROE, and high free cash flow
Low relative beta

The quantitative process is augmented by experience and common sense to arrive at the final list of eligible companies for consideration. The group of roughly 250 securities, which emerge from the screening process, is what we call the "Coho 250".
It is at this point where the valuation discipline begins.  We build a customized dividend discount model with realistic, normalized, historic based inputs to each of these companies. This arrays the universe in order of attractiveness in terms of expected return. This, combined with our own experience and judgment, effectively culls the universe further. Much greater research effort is applied following this stage by focusing on management contacts, detailed financial analysis, conferences, qualitative analysis and more.
Buy Discipline:
A stock is chosen for the portfolio when:

A stock meets our earnings, dividend, and cash flow growth and stability criteria
We have met/talked with relevant management, competitors, customers and suppliers
Our proprietary dividend discount model shows at least 600 basis points of annualized expected excess return over the risk-free alternative (5-10 year Treasury)
We have completed our "Position Paper" to objectively identify and monitor major operating and financial metrics that we expect the company to maintain or achieve at specific points in time

The Position Paper incorporates operating metrics such as: new product introduction, earnings quality, market share gains, end market expansion, and elimination of non-core business.  Financial metrics include: organic revenue growth, balance sheet integrity, share reduction, cash flow generation, margin targets and trends, dividend payout ratio and policy and capital intensiveness.
Sell Discipline:
A stock is eliminated from the portfolio when:

It reaches its performance target and the expected return falls to 200 basis points versus the risk free alternative
Position Paper metrics are violated
A better investment idea displaces the current holding

Before you invest in Coho Funds, please refer to the statutory prospectus for important information about the investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.  You may obtain a hard copy of the prospectus by calling 866.COHO.234 or 866.264.6234 or by clicking here.  The prospectus should be read carefully before you invest or send money.
Mutual fund investing involves risk.  Principal loss is possible.  The Fund may have a relatively high concentration of assets in a single or small number of issuers, which may reduce its diversification and result in increased volatility.  Investments in securities of foreign issuers involve risks not ordinarily associated with investments in securities and instruments of U.S. issuers, including risks relating to political, social and economic developments abroad, differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory and accounting requirements, tax risks, and market practices, as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies.  The market price of the shares of an ETF will fluctuate based on changes in the net asset value as well as changes in the supply and demand of its shares in the secondary market.  It is also possible that an active secondary market of an ETF's shares may not develop and market trading in the shares of the ETF may be halted under certain circumstances.  The fund will bear its share of expenses and the underlying risks of investments in ETFs and other investment companies.  Investments in mid-cap securities involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies.
The Coho Relative Value Equity Fund is offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons.  Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
The Coho Relative Value Equity Fund is distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.

As of June 30, 2017, total combined assets including model advisement, discretionary, and non-discretionary were approximately $8.2 billion (preliminary).  Coho focuses on generating a specific, asymmetric pattern of returns that offers strong protection in down markets and very competitive returns in up markets.

"We firmly believe that the best method to create and sustain long-term wealth is to protect principal in down markets and generate competitive returns in all but the most speculative of up markets."
Peter Thompson
CIO

 
Coho Partners, Ltd. is the Adviser to the Coho Relative Value Equity strategy and mutual fund. Our investment approach focuses on providing downside protection during difficult equity market environments first and foremost, and also capturing reasonable upside participation during bull markets.  We seek stable companies with market capitalizations over $3 billion that consistently grow their revenues, earnings, and dividends. The resulting portfolio is comprised of 25 to 30 equity securities with which the investment team has established comfort with the long-term fundamental aspects of each investment. The Coho Relative Value Equity strategy is available to investors via separate accounts, mutual fund, and some UMA (model) platforms.



Behind the Coho Name
Peter Thompson, founder of Coho Partners, Ltd., is an avid fly fisherman.  He named the company after his favorite sport fish, the Coho salmon.  The life of this species, particularly during its migration, demonstrates resoluteness in spite of adversity and peril.  They are highly prized by anglers for their strength, tenacity, and fight.  Our coat of arms is flanked by a pair of these trophy fish because they represent the rigor of our selection process and the vigorous attributes inherent in the companies that are carefully chosen for our portfolios.  We are more interested in tenacity, endurance, and navigation skills, than pure speed.
