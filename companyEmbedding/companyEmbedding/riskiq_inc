RiskIQ launched a Community Edition of its RiskIQ PassiveTotal® and RiskIQ Digital Footprint products at no cost to security analysts.

Community Knowledge – harnesses the collective intelligence of the global security community by showcasing projects featuring adversary investigations, compromised sites, phishing campaigns, malware and ransomware infrastructure as curated by RiskIQ and third party researchers.

RiskIQ has been named Grand Prize Winner in the Security Product category of Interop’s Best of Show awards. 
Interop





SAN FRANCISCO, June  14, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RiskIQ, the leader in digital threat management, today announced that it has been named Grand Prize Winner in the Security Product category of Interop’s Best of Show awards. The Best of Show awards, judged at this year’s Interop Tokyo, recognize exhibitors who demonstrate significant innovation and technological advancements in their respective categories. A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/1a53f44a-8816-4001-93fa-1aa34c207337 Business reliance on digital channels to engage with users presents a broad attack surface to obtain sensitive information, gain access credentials, and propagate malware. Through its regional distribution partner Macnica Networks, RiskIQ is rapidly expanding its customer base in Japan and Asia-Pacific, helping organizations protect their digital presence from exploits that originate from outside the firewall. The RiskIQ Digital Threat Management Platform and application suite provide unified visibility and control for enterprises, ensuring that their public-facing web, social, and mobile digital assets are continuously monitored and kept safe from unsanctioned use, impersonation, and abuse by malicious threat actors. “Enterprises are looking to solution vendors such as RiskIQ to help them account for and protect their digital assets, many of which sit outside the corporate network and beyond the protection offered by traditional security solutions,” said Jenna Raby, vice president of APAC at RiskIQ. “We are very honored to receive this award and would like to recognize the dedication and technical excellence of our Japanese distributor, Macnica Networks, in helping us grow within the region and support our mutual customers.” “Macnica represents best-in-class technologies and best practices that help our customers progress their security programs, improve investments, and manage risk. One considerable enterprise security gap is a lack of capabilities to effectively identify and remediate threats that originate beyond their firewall and affect their business,” said Hirayama, sales director at Macnica. “We are pleased to see RiskIQ products being distinguished during Interop. RiskIQ exemplifies the innovation that can be applied to protect a company’s digital assets and proactively extend defenses across web, social, and mobile threats.” The RiskIQ SaaS-based application suite gives an organization’s security teams and their services providers means to optimize a broad range of investigation, analysis, and mitigation tasks. Three core applications are: RiskIQ Digital Footprint: A digital footprint discovery, generation, and management solution able to discover, map, and monitor the external web infrastructure and assets associated with an organizationRiskIQ PassiveTotal: A tool that expedites cyberthreat investigation and research, benefiting security analysts and incident responders through comprehensive, correlated internet data sets and collaboration capabilitiesRiskIQ External Threats: An integrated threat detection and response solution that allows companies to automate identification, triage, and mitigation of active exploits and adversaries targeting their business Join more than 20,000 security analysts using RiskIQ. Entry-level access to the Digital Threat Management Platform and applications are available for free through RiskIQ Community Edition by visiting https://www.riskiq.com/community/. About RiskIQRiskIQ is the leader in digital threat management, providing the most comprehensive discovery, intelligence, and mitigation of threats associated with an organization’s digital presence.
