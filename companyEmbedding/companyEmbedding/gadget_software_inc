      1.) What is your favorite part about working at Gadget Software?My favorite part of working is definitely the people. I get to work alongside so many passionate and intelligent individuals all working towards the same goal of creating something that could potentially change how people interact with media. It’s always inspiring, and everyone in the office is always so energetic so it creates a good positive atmosphere to work in. ​2.) What has working in the Gadget Software environment taught you?Gadget Software gave me one of my first looks into the real working world. Starting my internship at Gadget Software almost directly after graduating from high school gave me a clear picture on the difference between school and the real world. No more hand holding, no more precise set of instructions to follow, and no room for slacking. But that also means more freedoms, as a member of the team you are treated as an adult capable of doing your work without anyone watching over you. Everyone is still capable of lending a helping hand once in a while but the environment really teaches you how to truly be independent. ​3.) How would you describe the culture of Gadget Software?​The culture at Gadget Software is a very interesting mix. There are people here from all different backgrounds, and what really stands out is the personality of the individuals. Everyone here has their own unique sense of humor, style, or taste and it makes for really interesting people to interact with. Its fine to be able to agree on most things, and the team at Gadget can usually agree on certain matters, but I believe it is the difference in opinion that we all share that allows for such an intellectual and progressive environment and culture.

Reworking the Modern Paragraph



		3/15/2017
	



		0 Comments
	


 

The shift from printed page to mobile screen presents fascinating challenges for writers and designers. A printed page is fixed, and can be designed with some confidence that the reader will experience the text in order, from top to bottom. In a mobile reading experience like the Gadget Software vPub™, readers have control. Readers can choose a nearly infinite variety of pathways through the material. How do you write and design content when you do not control the order in which a reader chooses to engage with it?I have been wrestling with this question as an author in the process of developing a new textbook composed and designed specifically for the vPub™ platform. One of the side effects of this experience has been a change in the way I think about and write paragraphs.Writing for the medium of print, an author has a degree of control over the reader’s experience, and can write paragraphs knowing that a reader will come upon them in a linear fashion. For many years, writers have been trained to organize paragraphs in a sequence, one after another, to develop an idea or build an argument. We have been taught to write transitions to link paragraphs one to another, in a kind of chain. Transitional phrases like “on the other hand” or “in contrast” are designed to be used as links in the chain, clarifying for readers how one paragraph is connected to the previous paragraph.       Mobile readers can choose their own pathways through the paragraphs—they, not the author, have control of the organization of the text. In the visual representation here, the conventional model of organizing paragraphs in print is on the left, and on the right is an image of one of many possible paths a reader might take to read through a sequence of paragraphs in a vPub™.The Gadget Software Atomic Reading Structure (ARS) model combines linear and non-linear reading strategies. Authors can organize content in a variety of ways, defining a sequence or learning path that we imagine readers will follow. My project, for example, is organized around three main units, arranged in a roughly chronological order. Within each unit, short scenes are presented in a sequence I designed to develop ideas and guide readers through the material. Readers certainly may choose to follow along with the path I have designed for them. At the same time, the vPub™ experience offers them other ways to move through the content. They can choose a particular medium, for example, focusing on videos, or on audio podcasts, skipping past the text-based sections. Readers can also navigate content by focusing on historical figures, or on key technologies. We have defined several categories of content, and readers can choose to focus on any one of those, rather than following the main chronological path.       The physical form factor of the mobile devices readers use to interact with a vPub™ also shapes the way authors define and create content. A typical mobile screen displays between 150 and 250 words at a time. Thus, a paragraph composed on a desktop monitor may not look that long, but once I have a chance to view it in the live preview, I recognize that I need to shorten it, or divide it into two or three smaller units. Being able to see my work in the live application has been an immense help in guiding me to define and shape smaller, more modular units of content.As an author, once I began to see how my paragraphs looked in the vPub™, I became aware of the number of explicit links I had built into them; I quickly realized I could no longer begin a paragraph with “on the other hand,” because I had no way of knowing what a reader would have just read. So I began thinking about writing paragraphs that could stand completely on their own, and that would make sense in any order. As you can imagine, this presents a challenge as well as an opportunity to reimagine the kind of work a paragraph might do.​The basic concept of a paragraph as a unit of thought does not change. In the vPub™, the paragraph becomes the primary unit of text. Each paragraph (or “scene”) is designed as a mini-essay in itself. What does change is the way I think about each paragraph. Instead of thinking in terms of links on a chain, I imagine each paragraph as an episode or story in itself—self-contained, independent of what may come before or after. In practical terms, this means that I have to work to edit out any linking transitions at the beginning or end of each paragraph. It also means that I aim to compose each paragraph so that it has a kind of narrative arc, twist, or surprise. In short, each paragraph has to do more work to inform and engage a reader, because it cannot depend on its neighboring paragraphs for support.Here is an example of one of these “new paragraphs” written for The Technology of the Book: Few technologies have flourished for as long as the book. Even if we limit ourselves to printed (as opposed to handwritten) books, we are left with a historical span of nearly 600 years. How many other fifteenth-century technologies remain in daily use today? If you were to pick up an antique book, a copy of the First Folio, for example—the first printed collection of Shakespeare’s works, published in 1623—you would immediately recognize its form, and you would be able to use it, read it, and enjoy it, just as you would any modern book. You might want to wear gloves to protect the priceless old pages, but you would have no difficulty knowing how to open the book, navigate its contents, and read the text. You would not need a tutorial or user’s guide, because the technology and form factor of the First Folio is, for all practical purposes, identical to any book you might find on a shelf today. Scanning the long history of the printed book, it is the resilience and longevity of the book as a technology that is perhaps the most remarkable theme in the story.       In this example, the paragraph builds toward the final reveal—that the story of the book is about persistence, as opposed to change. If the paragraph works, it does so by creating a bit of tension or drama by quietly upending some of a reader’s expectations.In addition to changing the way I think about and compose paragraphs, the ARS model also provides other ways to develop and organize content. Most notably, the platform makes available a wide range of reinforcing media. Authors can add images, video, and audio to help extend and clarify ideas presented in written text. In the case of audio, I record my own audio narration, offering readers the option of reading, listening, or both. Further, being able to add images and videos provides a way to anchor paragraphs in visual examples. A map of medieval Mainz, Germany, for example, can be presented as part of a discussion about Gutenberg and his use of metalsmithing skills to develop the first successful movable type. Each paragraph of text is usually accompanied by at least one image, one audio file, and one video. These new paragraphs thus evolve into fully developed learning modules in their own right.Does writing paragraphs this way mean that the content is being fragmented or watered down? Not necessarily. It does mean that, as an author, I have to be willing to give the reader more control. A reader may design a way to connect and build ideas, paragraph to paragraph, that I might not have imagined. That may be the hidden power of the new paragraph.​In my case, I will give readers even more control: students using my Technology of the Book vPub™ will be invited to become contributors and authors in their own right. Students will research and compose case studies, focusing on important historical figures, technologies, or events that are significant in the history of books and communication. Once edited and revised, these case studies will be uploaded into the authoring console where they can be read by other students and readers around the world. Inviting students to become content co-creators is an exciting idea for me as a teacher. In a course on the evolution of printing and publishing technology, students will be able to experience the process of creation and authoring for themselves, gaining firsthand experience with writing and designing content for readers using one of the most innovative new technologies available. Their hands-on exploration of a new approach to writing will go far beyond anything they might experience by reading a traditional textbook chapter. ​

The Evolution of Mobile Software Towards Deep Functionality



		2/17/2017

Cosmetics and Aesthetics  Continuing our discussion about Mobile software in 2017, I think about it in many different aspects as shown in the chart below. In this installment, I’d like to tackle cosmetics and aesthetics. Cosmetically and aesthetically, mobile apps continue to be an emerging art form, with trends that wax and wane. And as to be expected in something as subjective as beauty, no 2 people can agree on what looks good. In the past few years, the term “Beautiful App” wedged its way into the broader discussion, which of course, creates even more opinions. I’ve seen many of  what pundits call “beautiful apps”, and while many may be attractive on the surface, often, they are either very difficult to use, or its nearly impossible to actually find what you’re looking for in them. I did a completely non-scientific bit of research here, and looked at a number of “Beautiful Apps of the Year” articles on many popular tech websites, awards given from broader industry groups, etc. (the usual suspects, TechCrunch, Business Insider, Apple’s awards, etc).  Out of respect for each developer and publisher, I won’t specify what the apps are because I’m really more interested in the study, and I never want to call out anyone who didn’t succeed (you can look at all the beautiful app awards in the past few years and figure it out). I eliminated a handful of apps that are published by giant companies (like Twitter, Yahoo, Facebook, etc), as they will likely get lots of attention anyway from their gigantic user bases.  And even though I’m a huge gamer, I also eliminated games from my non-scientific analysis as games have a very specific audience, and an incredibly short half life anyway (pun intended). I wanted to focus on functional apps and see if there’s any relationship between “beauty” and success (certainly in my own case, clearly there is NOT!) The end sample set, which is statistically a small sample, ended up being a 16 total apps.I looked at the App, then went to their respective App stores, and looked at how well they appeared to have done using App Annie, Sensor Tower, and others, read reviews, looked at the date of the most recent reviews, estimates on annual revenue, etc. I used a spreadsheet and some level of averaging to figure out if whether the software in general has succeeded, (which admittedly, is fairly subjective). Review counts are interesting statistically I believe, because if a customer actually invests their time to write something positive, that is fantastic. If LOTS of customers do it, you’re doing amazing.  We know that negative reviews seem to come easier than positive.What I found ultimately didn’t surprise me. Out of 16 total apps, that in the last 18 months were hailed as “beautiful” and “amazing” by all sorts of industry pundits, 8 (50%), are either completely out of business, or appear abandoned (ie, no updates in more than a year, with the developer seeming to have moved on). The remaining 50% had a variety of success across my twisted matrix of metrics. Four out of the remaining eight had very low download counts, nearly no reviews,  and nearly no estimated revenue. Two of these were actually acquired by larger companies (interestingly, the two that had pretty negative reviews and low review counts)Out of the four remaining apps, three seem to be prospering.  They have wonderful statistics from review counts, downloads, a continuous string of updates, revenue projections, and an enthusiastic following.  The other one seems to be trucking along, with a decent amount of activity, but seriously low “projected revenue”, which is derived from fees, in app purchases, etc. So what did I learn from my completely unscientific analysis as to whether beautiful apps succeed?  As the 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume famously wrote in 1742, ” Beauty in things exists merely in the mind which contemplates them”.  And as mobile software matures,  becomes more purposeful, and permeates more aspects of our lives, what constitutes beauty will likely shift.  Beauty in software is clearly ephemeral.  Trends shift, and with the ever increasing desire for more and more functionality in our pockets running on our mobile devices, it’s clearly more important to balance design trends with practicality and usability as we cram more things into the limited real estate of our small screens.  ​At some point, I’m going to explore “absolute relevance” and how it might relate to true longevity in future mobile software.  In my next post though, we’ll focus on functionality and usefulness.

Developing a mobile textbook: A case study in collaborative authoring



		2/1/2017
	



		1 Comment
	


 

For the past two years, I have been exploring ways to make educational materials accessible to students on mobile phones. In my online courses, for example, I have moved away from Blackboard, which is not well designed for mobile users. Much of my course content now lives instead on websites I have built with Weebly or Google Sites. These platforms provide responsive templates that work well for students on any size screen. While grades, administrative announcements, and discussions still take place on Blackboard (which is institutionally mandated and required for FERPA compliance), the majority of the text, audio, and video content for the courses is now housed on fully responsive sites outside of the LMS. Students can access the course materials from their phones at any time, without needing to log in to the cumbersome LMS system. More than half of my students now report that they do most of their course reading on their phones.But what about textbooks? Most major textbook publishers now offer mobile apps with some degree of functionality. For the most part, however, this is content that was not originally designed for mobile users. The mobile ebook experience for most textbooks is not good, and many students do not purchase required course texts as a result. Faced with this dilemma, I wrote a TAA blog post in May 2016 about the challenge of making learning mobile (“How educators and authors can make learning mobile”). Through a wonderful chain of events, that blog post led to meeting a team of people at a new company called Gadget Software, who have developed a publishing platform called vPub™ (virtual publication) specifically for students on mobile devices.Since the fall of 2016, I have been working with the folks at Gadget Software to develop a new product designed from the start for mobile users. We are working together to take all of the materials for a course called “The Technology of the Book” and re-imagine them specifically to take advantage of the vPub™ platform. I can summarize that experience so far by saying that it has prompted me to re-think just about everything I know about composing and designing educational texts. Authoring for mobile is not simply a matter of breaking content into smaller units, or using reflowable text to make long passages readable on a phone. Instead, the process requires a deeper exploration of the reader experience, a new approach to content development, and a more deeply collaborative process.Reading on mobile devicesReaders on mobile devices generally want to direct their own reading experience. Following along a linear pathway through long passages of text (as with traditional textbook chapters) is not effective. Students increasingly want some control in defining their own learning path, building their own process for reading text and engaging media. So how do you compose and design educational texts when you do not have control over the order in which readers may approach specific sections?That question presented the first major design challenge for my work with Gadget Software. Our approach has been to give students several options in choosing how they want to work through the content. Students can choose to work through a traditional chapter menu, or they can start with specific types of media (listening to audio, viewing videos) based on their own situation and learning preferences, or they can use an alternative contents to focus on technologies, or case studies, or key figures. In fact, we have begun to think in terms of a game-like metaphor: Instead of chapters or units, students embark on learning quests. The outcome or goal is defined (“explain the significance of the development of steam-powered printing presses in the nineteenth century,” for example), but students have the option to choose how they want to work through the material toward that goal.A new approach to content developmentTraditionally, textbooks are developed through a long process in which writing, development, revising, and design are separate steps—often separated by months of time. Working on the Technology of the Book project with Gadget Software has been completely different. In most cases, as the author, I am writing short units or sections of text at a time. Everything I write is also recorded (by me) as an audio podcast, and in many cases the text is in turn converted into an animated video segment as well. I post files in a shared folder that can also be accessed by my partners at Gadget Software—Max Riggsbee, chief product officer, and Patricia Alvarez, product manager. Max and Patricia take my raw files and import them into their authoring platform, so we can see a live preview of how the content looks and behaves on a mobile phone. This kind of rapid iteration and revision cycle has allowed us to re-think and re-define our approach as we go along.We meet weekly to review new material and reflect on what we are seeing and learning as we build. This rapid revision cycle is similar to the approach used by many software developers, but it is a radically new process for textbook authors. The advantage of this process is that it allows us to design and build as we go along, rather than waiting nine months (or more) to write all the content first.CollaborationIn some ways, Max and Patricia play the role that a development editor would play in a traditional publishing scenario. They provide feedback on the writing, help to conceptualize the architecture of the product as a whole, and so forth. But it goes far deeper than that. Because they are actively building and designing in real time, they are in effect co-creators. Design in textbooks has always been important, but in a mobile process it is even more integral to the process of content development. For them, I am one of the first authors to work in this process to develop content specifically for their platform. We have merged writing, design, and software engineering into a single workflow.The motivation for learning an entirely new process on a new platform is simple: to provide students with learning materials and experiences that work for them. It has become clear that retrofitting long-form textbooks into mobile apps is only a short-term solution. Working with my creative partners at Gadget Software, we are forging a path toward what we hope will become the textbook of the future.​Michael will be co-presenting a session at the 2017 TAA Conference on Textbook & Academic Authoring in June, entitled, “Bringing Textbooks to Life: Strategies for Developing and Designing Content for a Mobile Generation”.*Originally  posted on:http://blog.taaonline.net/2017/01/developing-a-mobile-textbook-a-case-study-in-collaborative-authoring/

      Joseph has worked on publishing his culinary class as a vPub™ with the Gadget Software team.  The vPub™ includes recipes that help different illnesses and health complications. Besides working on this, he checks that the newest product requests and updates are functionally properly.What school do you attend and what year are you in?-Bergen County Technical High SchoolWhat is your major or area of study?-Culinology (Culinary)What has been your favorite part of your internship?-My favorite part of my internship is coordinating with other interns to solve problems and connecting my work at Gadget Software to my schoolwork. When I am working on a product update and I have a problem, I am able to ask my fellow interns for help all the time. Some updates can be extremely tedious and to have someone else to work with makes the process simpler, and therefore more efficient. Additionally, Gadget Software has allowed me to publish my culinary class's project as a vPub™. Every year, the graduating culinary class has to create a product that helps others. Our class decided we wanted to help a vast majority of people and not just a specific group, which led us to design a cookbook with recipes that help multiple different illnesses and health complications. With the help of Maxwell and Patricia, we designed a vPub™  for the cookbook that was not only user-friendly and easily accessible but gave more people access to our class's recipes.What is your favorite app?-GmailHow often are you on the phone everyday?-A few times every hourWhat digital tools do you use to learn inside and outside of the classroom?​-Online textbooks, calculators and study guides

From iOS to Mac.
Music production software to help your musical imagination become reality.
KORG Gadget is a completely new type of music production software that provides more than 30 small synthesizers and drum machines called "gadgets," and lets you freely combine these to produce anything from powerful electronic music to rock music. Following the worldwide success of the award-winning Gadget for iPad/iPhone we now announce the new Gadget for Mac. Building on the smooth operability and intuitive user interface of the iOS version, "KORG Gadget for Mac” provides a new dimension of inspiration for every creative artist. The Mac version also comes with the "Gadget Plug-In Collection," a magnificent collection of plug-ins that support AU, VST, AAX, and NKS. With KORG Gadget, you can use the Mac version at home and the iOS version when you are mobile, letting you enjoy a seamless workflow and ideal music production experience. The care that KORG has paid to hardware instruments over more than 50 years of experience has been channeled into the powerful cutting-edge musical software that is KORG Gadget. Now, the ultimate all-in-one music production studio extends its scope to a new platform and brings a new level of music making for Mac users everywhere.




















KORG Gadget - Introduction Movie








Click here for YouTube videos featuring KORG Gadget.









 














A collection of more than thirty Gadgets
KORG Gadget comes with more than 30 gadgets that include our wide range of synthesizers, drum machines, and samplers. Each gadget delivers incredible range of sounds, and provides carefully selected parameters that let you easily achieve the sound you're looking for. This powerful group of gadgets provides complete support not only for electronic music but also for rock, pop, and jazz band sounds. Don't worry if you're not a skilled instrumentalist; Gadget’s intuitive sound and sequencing software we'll help you make great music regardless of the level of your musical knowledge. Simply get started with your favorites from the numerous gadgets that are provided to sound great quickly.

















Long-awaited audio track support
Two new gadgets propel KORG Gadget to a new level as an audio-compatible all-in-one production environment. Newly added to the collection are the Zurich gadget for general-purpose recording and the Rosario gadget that's optimized for guitar recording. In addition to the audio gadgets, your sound-creating possibilities are further expanded by Recife, a new type of drum gadget with built-in high-quality samples.




















Use as plug-ins

All gadgets will work in any DAW environment as the "Gadget Plug-in Collection," a gigantic collection of plug-ins. This collection is included with the Mac version, providing numerous distinctive and powerful sounds that you can shape by adjusting carefully selected parameters, and use with DAW software (*1) other than KORG Gadget.


*1 Please check the  

here for Operability confirmed DAW software.

















An intuitive music production workflow
The greatest feature of KORG Gadget is its user interface. It provides an easily understandable layout that divides the fundamentals of music production into four processes - sounds, phrases, sequences, and mix - and lets you perform these tasks intuitively and seamlessly. The iOS version provides two screens that could be switched vertically and horizontally, while the Mac version takes advantage of the large display to let you browse everything in a single screen. We've also been among the first to support the "Touch Bar" that's featured on the new MacBook Pro. You can use the gadget keyboard to perform with Touch Bar. With workflow that lets you move flexibly between different platforms such as Mac, iOS, and the plug-in collection, you'll be guided toward completing your songs without interrupting your musically creative flow.














Also ideal as a second DAW
KORG Gadget is an ideal second DAW for creative artists who are already taking advantage of their main DAW. With KORG Gadget, you can move rapidly through sound design and song production without being distracted by extraneous tasks, letting you access your creativity directly. Since projects can be synchronized in real time via iCloud, you can use the iOS version when you're mobile and the Mac version in your home studio. Demos created using KORG Gadget can be exported to your main DAW. Powerful interoperability with Ableton Live is also a feature. KORG Gadget is destined to become an important key to expressing your ideas within your music production workflow.














Collaborate with creators around the world
KORG Gadget is linked directly to numerous music sharing services around the world. It's among the first to support Allihoopa, which lets users arrange and remix each other's songs. Allihoopa is a service by which songs you've created using applications such as Allihoopa Corporation's Figure and Take, or Propellerhead's Reason, can be shared online. Songs can be sent between musicians anywhere in the world, helping you to improve your own creative skill and letting you enjoy communicating beyond barriers of language.














Make it come alive with new MIDI controllers
To customize your needs, you can freely choose a MIDI controller that complements the KORG Gadget. For example if you're using a nanoKEY Studio or nanoKONTROL Studio, you can record and mix wirelessly. Native support for these controllers means that setup happens automatically. By partnering with a MIDI controller that inspires you, you can improve the quality of your music production.














Experience KORG Gadget with a lite version
You can get a glimpse of the amazing power of KORG Gadget by downloading the free of charge KORG Gadget Le - a lite version of the Mac / iOS. Although there are limitations to the number of gadgets and tracks that you can use, you can experience the seamless and intuitive music production possibilities of KORG Gadget.

Press








"A fresh take on iPad synthesis and sequencing from Korg. Simple enough to use but powerful and fun, with some excellent sounds."


MusicTech





"If you have an iPad buying Korg Gadget is a no-brainer. If you don't, maybe it's time to bite the bullet!"


Musicrader





"From the moment I fired it up, Gadget completely blew me away. It’s the single best iPad electronic music tool I’ve ever used, hands down. Its 15 synths are so specialized, but collectively cover so much ground, that even newcomers can quickly find exactly the sounds they’re seeking. The sequencing and arrangement functions are absolute best of breed for iOS."
