      loans/Total loans 0.50% 0.61% -0.11% -18.0%


      During the first quarter of 2017, the Company earned $287 thousand, a $69 thousand increase over the first quarter of 2016. Increased earnings were driven be a $164 thousand decrease in net noninterest expense compared to the first quarter of 2016. Earnings per share of common stock outstanding over the respective periods grew by $0.10 per share, an increase of nearly 30%. The resulting increase in book value per share was 7.1%, or $1.87 per share outstanding.
    

      Loans increased by 5.6% over the twelve month period, ending the first quarter of 2017 at a level $8.3 million more than in the first quarter of 2016. Much of this growth was in the Bank's Home Equity product featuring an interest only payment tied to the prime rate. The popularity of the "Meet It or Beat It" deposit campaign is reflected in the significant deposit growth quarter over quarter. Deposits at quarter end in March 2017 were $5.1 million more than those of quarter end 2016.
    

      Management's continued focus on loan quality is reflected in the reduced number of nonperforming loans in 2017. At March 31, 2017, 0.50% of total loans were nonperforming, down from 0.61% at March 31, 2016.
    

      All are encouraged to review the Bank's detailed financials for the first quarter under the Investor Relations tab of our website: TCBOL.COM. Shareholders are invited to our Annual Shareholders' Dinner Meeting at the Old Dutch on SR-664, Tuesday, May 9. Doors open at 5:30, with dinner at 6:00, and the meeting at 7:00 PM.
