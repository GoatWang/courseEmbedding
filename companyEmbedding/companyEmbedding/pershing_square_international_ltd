All investments involve the possibility of profit and the risk of loss, including the loss of principal. This document does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to purchase any security or investment product. All information is current as of the date hereof and is subject to change in the future.     (1) Performance results are presented on a gross and net-of-fees basis. Net returns reflect the deduction of, among other expenses, management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative fees, and accrued and/or crystallized performance fees, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. Net returns reflect the performance of the Company’s Public Shares. Depending on the timing of an individual investor’s specific investment, net performance for an individual investor may vary from the net performance as stated herein. Gross returns reflect the performance of the Company’s shares in the aggregate and are presented before the deduction of management fees and performance fees, if any. On May 2, 2017, the Company began its share buyback program whereby its buyback agent began to repurchase Public Shares subject to certain limitations. Any positive impact on performance due to these share buybacks is reflected herein. Performance data and other information contained herein are estimated and unaudited. Net performance is a geometrically linked, time-weighted calculation.  (2) Reflects the number of positions in issuers in which the Company has previously publicly disclosed an investment, which occurs after the Company has completed its accumulation. Cash, cash equivalents, direct or indirect currency or other hedges and income/expense items are excluded. Multiple financial instruments (for example, common stock and derivatives on common stock) associated with one (1) issuer count as one (1) position. A position that is included in the number of positions will be removed from the table only if the investment becomes 0.0% of the portfolio.   (3) For the purpose of determining the equity and debt exposures, investments are valued as follows: (a) equity or debt is valued at market value, (b) options referencing equity or debt are valued at market value, (c) long call options and short put options (or vice-versa, short call options and long put options) held on the same underlying issuer and with the same strike and same expiry are grouped together and treated as synthetic equity positions, and are valued at the market value of the equivalent long equity position (or vice-versa, the equivalent short equity position), and (d) swaps or forwards referencing equity or debt are valued at the market value of the notional equity or debt underlying the swaps or forwards. Whether a position is deemed to be long or short is determined by whether an investment has positive or negative exposure to price increases or decreases. For example, long puts are deemed to be short exposure.   (4) Includes all issuer equity, debt, and derivatives related to issuer equity and debt, and associated currency hedges. Cash, cash equivalents, direct or indirect currency or other hedges and income/expense items are excluded. The market values of associated currency hedges are included as part of the associated investment. In the event that there is a change in market cap category with respect to any non-publicly disclosed position, this information is not updated until such position is publicly disclosed.   (5) Portfolio composition is reflective of the publicly disclosed portfolio positions as of the date of this report. A position in an issuer is only assigned to a sector once it has been publicly disclosed.   (6) “Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd. AUM” equals the assets under management of Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd. Any performance fees crystallized as of the end of the year will be reflected in the following period’s AUM.   (7) “Total Strategy AUM” equals the aggregate assets under management of Pershing Square, L.P., Pershing Square International, Ltd., Pershing Square II, L.P. and Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd. Redemptions effective as of the end of any period (including redemptions attributable to crystallized performance fees/allocations, if any) will be reflected in the following period’s AUM.            Note: Each Public Share in the Company carries at all times one vote per share. The total voting rights in the Company ("Total Voting Rights") may vary over time given the capital and voting structure of the Company. As of June 30, 2017, Total Voting Rights were 497,053,655. There are 239,086,229 Public Shares, 8,500,796 Management Shares and 1 Special Voting Share (held by VoteCo) outstanding (the share classes have 1 vote, 1.0521 votes and 249,023,881 votes per share, respectively).           Under the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht), anyone who, directly or indirectly, acquires or disposes of shares in the Company and holds voting rights reaching, exceeding or falling below certain thresholds (including 3%, 5% and 10%) of the Total Voting Rights is required to notify the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (Stichting Autoriteit Financële Markten).      In addition, under the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, a person is required to notify the Company of the number of the Public Shares it holds or is deemed to hold (through such person’s direct or indirect holding of financial instruments) if this number reaches, exceeds or falls below 3%, 4%, 4.25%, 4.50%, 4.75% or 5% of the total number of outstanding Public Shares.            As of the date of the placing of the Public Shares, the total offset amount, which is part of the performance fee calculation, was $120M. As of June 30, 2017, the offset amount was reduced by approximately $19.2M to $100.8M. The performance fee that may be charged from time to time on fee-bearing shares equals 16% of NAV appreciation minus the “additional reduction.” The additional reduction is equal to 20% of the aggregate performance allocations/fees earned by the investment manager on the gains of certain other funds managed by the investment manager plus any amount of additional reduction carried forward from the previous period ($2.9M as of June 30, 2017), and is calculated after giving effect to the offset amount. The offset amount offsets the additional reduction until it is fully reduced to zero. As of the date of the placing, the total offset amount was set by reference to the sum of the fees and other costs of the placing and admission of the Public Shares, as well as commissions paid to placement agents and other formation and offering expenses prior to admission that had been borne by the investment manager. The investment management agreement between PSH and the investment manager was amended on December 1, 2016 to remove any accretion in the computation of the offset amount.              About Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd.Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd. (PSH.AS) (PSH.AS) is an investment holding company structured as a closed-end fund that makes concentrated investments principally in North American companies.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170703005648/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFrank Ocean captivates at FYF Fest with the help of Brad PittEntertainment WeeklyKesha Overcomes Tears to Deliver Powerful Performance of New Song 'Woman'Entertainment TonightMissy Elliott FYF review – technical blips can't ruin a Supa Dupa Fly returnThe GuardianHere’s the next ‘FANG’ stock that’s set to explodeCNBCA 'big fall' in markets is coming as traders put record cash to workBusiness InsiderHow 2 life-threatening events changed how Aetna's CEO views health careYahoo FinanceAetna CEO Bertolini: How tech plays into the future of healthcareYahoo Finance VideoAetna's CEO Mark Bertolini on the future of the health care systemYahoo Finance64 years after Korean War, North still digging up bombsAssociated PressBlue Apron just got a flood of bullish ratings from Wall Street, and its shares are flyingBusiness InsiderAmazon Is Going Underwater.

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. 
          All investments involve the possibility of profit and the risk of 
          loss, including the loss of principal. This document does not 
          constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to 
          purchase any security or investment product. All information is 
          current as of the date hereof and is subject to change in the future.
        



          (1) Performance results are presented on a gross and net-of-fees 
          basis. Net returns reflect the deduction of, among other expenses, 
          management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative fees, and 
          accrued and/or crystallized performance fees, if any, and include 
          the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. Net 
          returns reflect the performance of the Company’s Public Shares. 
          Depending on the timing of an individual investor’s specific 
          investment, net performance for an individual investor may vary from 
          the net performance as stated herein. Gross returns reflect the 
          performance of the Company’s shares in the aggregate and are 
          presented before the deduction of management fees and performance 
          fees, if any. On May 2, 2017, the Company began its share buyback 
          program whereby its buyback agent began to repurchase Public Shares 
          subject to certain limitations. Any positive impact on performance 
          due to these share buybacks is reflected herein. Performance data 
          and other information contained herein are estimated and unaudited. 
          Net performance is a geometrically linked, time-weighted calculation.

          
            (2) Reflects the number of positions in issuers in which the 
            Company has previously publicly disclosed an investment, which 
            occurs after the Company has completed its accumulation. Cash, 
            cash equivalents, direct or indirect currency or other hedges and 
            income/expense items are excluded. Multiple financial instruments 
            (for example, common stock and derivatives on common stock) 
            associated with one (1) issuer count as one (1) position. A 
            position that is included in the number of positions will be 
            removed from the table only if the investment becomes 0.0% of the 
            portfolio.
          

            (3) For the purpose of determining the equity and debt exposures, 
            investments are valued as follows: (a) equity or debt is valued at 
            market value, (b) options referencing equity or debt are valued at 
            market value, (c) long call options and short put options (or 
            vice-versa, short call options and long put options) held on the 
            same underlying issuer and with the same strike and same expiry 
            are grouped together and treated as synthetic equity positions, 
            and are valued at the market value of the equivalent long equity 
            position (or vice-versa, the equivalent short equity position), 
            and (d) swaps or forwards referencing equity or debt are valued at 
            the market value of the notional equity or debt underlying the 
            swaps or forwards. Whether a position is deemed to be long or 
            short is determined by whether an investment has positive or 
            negative exposure to price increases or decreases. For example, 
            long puts are deemed to be short exposure.
          

            (4) Includes all issuer equity, debt, and derivatives related to 
            issuer equity and debt, and associated currency hedges. Cash, cash 
            equivalents, direct or indirect currency or other hedges and 
            income/expense items are excluded. The market values of associated 
            currency hedges are included as part of the associated investment. 
            In the event that there is a change in market cap category with 
            respect to any non-publicly disclosed position, this information 
            is not updated until such position is publicly disclosed.
          

            (5) Portfolio composition is reflective of the publicly disclosed 
            portfolio positions as of the date of this report. A position in 
            an issuer is only assigned to a sector once it has been publicly 
            disclosed.
          

            (6) “Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd. AUM” equals the assets under 
            management of Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd. Any performance fees 
            crystallized as of the end of the year will be reflected in the 
            following period’s AUM.
          

            (7) “Total Strategy AUM” equals the aggregate assets under 
            management of Pershing Square, L.P., Pershing Square 
            International, Ltd., Pershing Square II, L.P. and Pershing Square 
            Holdings, Ltd. Redemptions effective as of the end of any period 
            (including redemptions attributable to crystallized performance 
            fees/allocations, if any) will be reflected in the following 
            period’s AUM.
          




           
        



          Note: Each Public Share in the Company carries at all times one vote 
          per share. The total voting rights in the Company ("Total Voting 
          Rights") may vary over time given the capital and voting structure 
          of the Company. As of June 30, 2017, Total Voting Rights were 
          497,053,655. There are 239,086,229 Public Shares, 8,500,796 
          Management Shares and 1 Special Voting Share (held by VoteCo) 
          outstanding (the share classes have 1 vote, 1.0521 votes and 
          249,023,881 votes per share, respectively).
        



           
        



          Under the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel 
          toezicht), anyone who, directly or indirectly, acquires or disposes 
          of shares in the Company and holds voting rights reaching, exceeding 
          or falling below certain thresholds (including 3%, 5% and 10%) of 
          the Total Voting Rights is required to notify the Netherlands 
          Authority for the Financial Markets (Stichting Autoriteit Financële 
          Markten).

          
             
          

            In addition, under the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, a 
            person is required to notify the Company of the number of the 
            Public Shares it holds or is deemed to hold (through such person’s 
            direct or indirect holding of financial instruments) if this 
            number reaches, exceeds or falls below 3%, 4%, 4.25%, 4.50%, 4.75% 
            or 5% of the total number of outstanding Public Shares.
          




           
        



          As of the date of the placing of the Public Shares, the total offset 
          amount, which is part of the performance fee calculation, was $120M. 
          As of June 30, 2017, the offset amount was reduced by approximately 
          $19.2M to $100.8M. The performance fee that may be charged from time 
          to time on fee-bearing shares equals 16% of NAV appreciation minus 
          the “additional reduction.” The additional reduction is equal to 20% 
          of the aggregate performance allocations/fees earned by the 
          investment manager on the gains of certain other funds managed by 
          the investment manager plus any amount of additional reduction 
          carried forward from the previous period ($2.9M as of June 30, 
          2017), and is calculated after giving effect to the offset amount. 
          The offset amount offsets the additional reduction until it is fully 
          reduced to zero. As of the date of the placing, the total offset 
          amount was set by reference to the sum of the fees and other costs 
          of the placing and admission of the Public Shares, as well as 
          commissions paid to placement agents and other formation and 
          offering expenses prior to admission that had been borne by the 
          investment manager. The investment management agreement between PSH 
          and the investment manager was amended on December 1, 2016 to remove 
          any accretion in the computation of the offset amount.

For hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a publicly traded
    permanent capital vehicle must have been eminently desirable.
    And, as of Monday, when Pershing Square Holdings went public on
    the Euronext Amsterdam, Ackman has one.
It is clear why retail investors and others might want a
    piece of the Ackman mojo: His New Yorkbased Pershing
    Square limited partnership has delivered an annualized return
    of more than 20 percent since its 2004 inception. What is less
    clear, however, is whether the IPO, which raised roughly $2.7
    billion, is good news for investors in the activist
    managers existing hedge fund vehicles, which have $9.9
    billion in assets, as of June 30, mostly in Pershing Square,
    Pershing Square II and the offshore Pershing Square
    International.
If Pershing Square investors want to redeem, it will take
    them two years to get all their money back. In the meantime,
    according to the terms of the IPO prospectus, they could end up
    effectively subsidizing the lower-fee-paying investors in
    Pershing Square Holdings.
Unlike many hedge fund managers today, Ackman is not content
    to hit investment singles and doubles. He is more of a Go
    big, or go home kind of guy. Sometimes, such as when he
    took the real estate holding company General Growth Properties
    into and out of bankruptcy, his trades can be phenomenally
    successful. Other times, as in his 2009 shareholder activism
    campaign against retailer Target, they flame out horribly. All this makes
    for good copy, and Ackman woos the press as adeptly as he
    wields a PowerPoint presentation. But whereas his overall track
    record is strong, his strategy can make for a white-knuckle
    ride for investors.
Exactly how hairy that ride can get has been obvious since
    Ackmans notorious short of Herbalife (HLF). Much has been
    written and said about Ackman and HLF, but for anyone who has
    somehow been oblivious over the past two years (yep, its
    been going on that long) or is in need of a quick refresher,
    the story is this: In December 2012 Ackman busted out a
    342-slide PowerPoint presentation arguing that the Cayman
    Islandsdomiciled herbal supplement seller was nothing
    more then a Ponzi scheme. HLF, which operates through a
    director-selling approach not dissimilar from, say, Avon or
    Tupperware, fought back vigorously. Ackman announced he had a
    massive, 20 million-shareplus short on the company. Other
    fund managers, in particular Dan Loeb and Carl Icahn, jumped on
    the other side of the trade. The result has been an
    entertaining battle, including a live CNBC shouting match between Ackman and
    Icahn and one of the most
    awkward bro hugs in human history.
For Pershing Square investors, the ride has been less fun.
    Herbalife shares have careened from $26 to a high of more than
    $80 to trading in the $45 range today. Interestingly,
    annualized returns of Pershing Square have remained strong; the
    fund is up 31.83 percent year-to-date and returned 9.3 percent
    in 2013, owing to successful bets elsewhere. Nonetheless, the
    Herbalife trade made some investors nervous, and Ackman
    experienced some redemptions.
According to the prospectus, Pershing Square Holdings
    currently has, and is expected to have going forward, very
    similar if not identical exposures to Pershing Square. But
    investors in Ackmans main fund, however, can withdraw
    only one eighth of their assets per quarter. So, investors who
    redeemed from Pershing Square in September 2014 would only be
    able to get all of their money back by September 2016.
What the publicly traded closed-end fund does is allow
    Ackman the flexibility to have the courage of his convictions
    without having to worry that investors will get cold feet.
    Pershing Square Holdings $3.07 billion in assets (which
    includes money that existing investors rolled into the new
    vehicle) is his to invest as he pleases. Investors in the
    holding company who dont like what Ackman is doing can
    sell their shares; they have daily liquidity.
Pershing Square Holdings also offers better fees than most
    hedge funds, including Pershing Square. According to the
    prospectus, investors in Pershing Square Holdings will pay a
    1.5 percent management fee and a performance fee of up to 16
    percent. Although Pershing Squares limited partners also
    pay a 1.5 percent management fee, they pay a 20 percent
    performance fee. What might really stick in their craw is that
    the more limited-partner money Pershing Square has, the less
    the holding company investors pay.
Here is how it works. Under the terms of the deal, Pershing
    Square Holdings gets an additional reduction in
    fees, which is based off how much the investment manager 
    that is, the parent money management firm  makes off the
    other funds it manages. So, if Pershing Square Holdings makes
    up 100 percent of the funds Ackman is managing, it pays a 16
    percent performance fee. If it makes up 20 percent or less of
    the total assets, the holding company investors pay no
    performance fee. Right before the IPO Pershing Square Holdings
    made up 23.5 percent of the aggregate fee-paying assets, though
    that number was expected to increase as a result of the
    IPO.
The IPO document helpfully provides an example of what a fee
    deduction might look like. Assuming $9 billion in other
    fee-paying assets, which is what the firm had as of the end of
    June, and a net return before performance fee of 26 percent,
    the holding company investors would receive an additional fee
    reduction of $94 million.
Pershing Square Holdings is relying on the same investment
    team, the same research resources, the same office space and
    Bloomberg terminals as the rest of Pershing Squares
    funds. So the locked-up investor assets  as opposed to
    the permanent capital of the IPO  are effectively
    subsidizing the publicly traded shareholders, who can sell
    their stock at any time. Pershing Square International
    investors were offered the option to roll over the assets into
    the holding company.
Pershing Square Holdings, then, is just one example of how
    extremely frustrating the hedge fund fee issue is for long-term
    asset owners. If I am a provider of long-term capital, I should
    be paid a premium for that. Instead, increasingly, the benefit
    of long-term money comes at a cost to the investors providing
    it. The same is true of 40 Act vehicles, as hedge fund
    firms are charging a 2 percent management fee and 20 percent
    performance fee for their main funds while offering a
    discounted liquid 40 Act version. The frustration is all
    the greater when the long-term asset owners are large
    institutional investors, such as 
    pensions and 
    sovereign wealth funds, which are giving millions, and
    sometimes even billions, of dollars to one manager.
Although Pershing Square Holdings shares dropped
    after their debut, I actually think the publicly traded
    model makes a great deal of sense for Ackman. He has said he
    hopes to mimic Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. And its
    hardly a surprise that he is looking to the Sage of Omaha for
    inspiration and not, say, Phil Falcone  another
    controversial hedge fund manager who has found the holding
    company to be a viable structure for his ambition. (Although in
    Falcones case, he had little or no
    other option.) And Ackman has done well by Pershing Square
    limited partners. But aside from the tax benefits, hedge fund
    investors must be scratching their heads and wondering just
    when they became the suckers at the card table with their one
    eighth redemption schedule and 20 percent performance fee.
