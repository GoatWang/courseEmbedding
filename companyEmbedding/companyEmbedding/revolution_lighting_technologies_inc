Revolutionary New Product From Revolution Lighting Technologies - Revolution Lighting Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:RVLT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGOÂ»Revolutionary New Product From Revolution Lighting TechnologiesMar.26.13 | About: Revolution Lighting (RVLT) The Focused Stock Trader Newsletter provider, growth at reasonable price, small-cap, medium-term horizonThe Focused Stock TraderOn March 25, 2013, Revolution Lighting Technologies (NASDAQ:RVLT) announced that they have produced a breakthrough product in the tube lighting market. Tube lights are the most commonly used lighting type in buildings around the world. RVLT's new "Seesmart Tube Light" produces the highest light output while using the lowest wattage in the tube light category. RVLT, previously known as Nexxus Lighting has been under the radar thus far, but is poised to breakout.
RVLT specializes in LED lighting technology, an industry that has seen huge growth over the last five years and shows potential to grow even faster in the next five. Current projections show the LED lighting industry growing 34% annually in the future, reaching $159 billion by 2020. With an industry experiencing strong growth and showing exciting potential, the answer to the question of who will be the benefactor of this transitioning market will offer some investors exponential returns.
RVLT's Leadership and Their Prior Successes
The most important, fundamental aspect of a growing company, is leadership. RVLT rises above the competition because it has one of the most capable CEO's in the technology industry. Led by Robert LaPenta, the management team of RVLT brings the necessary leadership to Nexxus Lighting.
Robert LaPenta, CEO of RVLT, has a remarkable history for not only leading but investing in companies that produced remarkable returns. LaPenta started as Vice President of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and used his experience to start several technology companies in industries that he felt would have great future growth.
In 1997, the market for intelligence and communications was pinpointed by LaPenta as a possible future growth industry. Based on this foresight, in 1997 Robert LaPenta cofounded a company called L-3 Communications Holdings (NYSE:LLL). Today, has become an industry leading, $7.23 billion company specializing in communications, intelligence, and other types of aircraft modernization for the militaries of the US and its allies. LLL boasts over 51,000 employees and $13 billion in sales, which illustrates LaPenta's expertise in effectively building a company.

In 2005, LaPenta's skill was proven once again as he founded L-1 Identity Solutions which specialized in defense contracts concerning individual identity recognition and other recognition devices. This proved to be a growth industry as well, as Safran, a French security company, saw the potential in L-1, and bought out the company for $1.6 billion just six years later.
Charles Schafer, president and CFO of RVLT has followed LaPenta from Loral Corporation, to Lockheed Martin, to L-3, and finally to RVLT. Schafer was President of Tactical Defense Systems while at Lockheed Martin, and was Senior Vice President during his time at L-3. In addition to Schafer, LaPenta brought several other members to RVLT's board of directors from his previous business endeavors. Robert Basil and James DePalma, are partners in LaPenta's private investment group Aston Capital, and both served with LaPenta on the boards of L-1 Identity Solutions and LLL. In addition, William Ingram is a director on RVLT's board who currently works alongside LaPenta on the board of Leap Wireless (LEAP).
RVLT's Recent Investors
Aston Capital's investment in RVLT confirms Robert LaPenta's confidence in RVLT's success. Aston Capital is a private equity firm headed by Robert LaPenta, based in Stamford, Connecticut. Aston Capital has a history of investment in RVLT starting in September of 2012 with an initial $6 million investment. Additionally, on February 21 of this year, RVLT announced that Aston Capital had invested another $5 million.
The only investment in RVLT outside of LaPenta or his affiliates was on March 11, 2013, when an additional $5 million was invested by an unnamed "highly regarded Midwest financial institution" recently revealed as Great American Insurance Company. Great American Insurance Company's investment should raise excitement as it shows RVLT has gained attention from an institutional investor.
RVLT's Acquisition of Seesmart Technologies
On December 20, 2012, RVLT acquired Seesmart Technologies, a company that is an LED solutions provider, for $10 million plus 10 million shares. Seesmart brought more than its current business to the RVLT team. It has been reported that they have more than 50 exclusive distributors throughout the U.S. and a pipeline of business in excess of $50 million. Seesmart provides the connections for future distributions and expands RVLT's target market. The distributors bring with them 300 agents who are able to educate and train the end users in LED technology and its benefits.

Robert LaPenta describes Seesmart as having a "unique and extensive distributor network" as well as having a "large pipeline for potential business prospects." In January, Seesmart validated their worth by receiving an order that could be worth as much as $10 million in the near future.
Why the LED Market is Expected to Grow
The most exciting aspect of new LED technology is how much more energy efficient it has become compared to traditional lighting. LED lighting is 80%-90% more efficient than traditional lighting and is being utilized as a way to not only "Go Green" but also to save money on electric bills. Most LED lighting is 100% recyclable and when combined with its 80%-90% greater efficiency, LED lighting has become the new standard for companies and individuals around the world. The lighting market has only begun evolving as only 20% of the market is using by LED lighting.
US Legislation such as the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, mandates more energy efficient lighting as an effort to encourage consumers to use less energy and to consume fewer fossil fuels. Specifically, the legislation prohibits the use of fluorescent tube lighting after June 2013. Scheduled to be voted on in 2014, additional legislation concerning even stricter energy efficiency requirements may be placed on the lighting industry. These requirements may force the US lighting market to turn exclusively to LED lighting as traditional lighting methods have not been remotely as efficient as LED lighting.
Technical Outlook By Harry Boxer
The following technical analysis of the Company's shares is by the renowned Harry Boxer, who has published The Tech Trader for 25 years.

Low priced and thinly traded RVLT has emerged since last September when it exploded on heavy relative volume, moving from just $0.11 to $1.08, a nearly 10 fold move in just 2 weeks! A move of those proportions is very often followed by a long period of consolidation and that's exactly what occurred over the following 3 months as the stock got very quiet before the next move which was triggered late January when it nearly tripled from $0.65 to $1.74 in just 8 sessions.
By now you can see how explosive this stock can be when it does move. Since then the stock has consolidated bullishly in a wedge type pattern as underlying technicals held up very well, actually improving! The stock is now in a 4th wave consolidation that has lasted 3 weeks and action last week in particular got very quiet as the stock price movement narrowed substantially with volume decreasing to a low ebb, perhaps a precursor to an imminent move.
We often see just this type of action before another move takes place which could be a substantial 5th wave up. Price resistance appears to be near the $1.75-.85 zone, but a move over that especially with volume could trigger the next leg up we are looking for. Price projections/targets going forward are $2.50, $3.65 & $4.40.

Conclusion
According to RVLT's November 14, 2012 press release, the market for LED lighting is projected to control 70% of the lighting market by 2020. With an industry sector growing so rapidly, the best way to find the greatest returns is to focus on the company whose operations are focused solely on the growth industry itself. In RVLT's case, their operations are focused solely on the development and production of LED lighting and will see growth proportional to the LED market growth at the very least.
The growing market for LED technology plus a strong, growth driven management team, makes RVLT a potentially huge 2013 breakout company. Headed by Robert LaPenta, RVLT has a management team unmatched in the industry that has chosen RVLT as their next project to make into a multi-billion dollar industry powerhouse.

(NASDAQ: RVLT) ("Revolution Lighting"), a global provider of advanced LED lighting solutions, today announced that since the opening of its state of the art Simi Valley production and warehouse facility in March 2017, the Company continues to penetrate the federal and military sector through energy savings performance contract wins (ESPC), producing more than 205,000 (BAA) and Trade Agreements Act (TAA) compliant LED tubes for federal and military lighting projects. Revolution Lighting works closely with many of the super energy services companies (ESCO) throughout the U.S. to provide its high performance BAA/TAA LED tubes for ESPCs. Recent contract wins include projects with the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Marine Corps facilities, including the Parris Island Marine Corps Base. The 8,095-acre military facility, located in Port Royal, South Carolina, is the primary location for Marine Corps recruit training. Revolution Lighting's high-efficiency LED tubes will replace existing fluorescent lighting within the marine barracks on base. The lighting retrofit portion of the project is expected to achieve a payback of less than two years. The Company currently produces our industry leading LED tubes at this location and is in the process of adding thin panels, linear high bay, and wall pack fixtures to meet the growing demand from sectors including education, municipal and notably, U.S. federal and military lighting retrofit programs. These solutions deliver superior efficiency to reduce lighting energy use by more than 65%, while increasing light output for enhanced safety. Additionally, LED lighting lasts three times longer than conventional fluorescent lighting, combined with Revolution Lighting's market leading 10-year warranty, to provide significant long-term operational and maintenance cost savings."We are excited to expand the presence of our LED solutions, including key federal and military retrofit markets, to drive continued growth and incremental revenue for the company," said Robert V. LaPenta, CEO and Chairman, Revolution Lighting. "Since the opening of our state-of-the-art Simi Valley production facility, we continue to experience increased demand not only for military and federal customers, but also for municipalities, hospitals and schools that prefer U.S.-manufactured products, including our industry-leading BAA and TAA compliant LED tubes, to aid them in achieving energy efficiency goals." The Buy American Act and Trade Agreements Act were both put in place to require federal agencies to first consider American-made products over foreign ones. Since 1975, almost 20% of the federal government's annual energy expenditures and use has been on electricity, representing a significant market opportunity for Revolution Lighting to provide its energy efficient LED solutions.About Revolution Lighting Technologies, Inc.Revolution Lighting Technologies, Inc. is a leader in the design, manufacture, marketing, and sale of LED lighting solutions focusing on the industrial, commercial and government markets in the United States, Canada, and internationally.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
