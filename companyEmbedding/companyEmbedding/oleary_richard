Rich O'Leary’s practice is concentrated in commercial litigation and products liability. In his thirty-two years of practice he has tried more than 50 cases to verdict in federal and state courts in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and has also litigated matters in Florida. He has argued numerous appeals in federal and state courts in New York and New Jersey. He has handled matters in bankruptcy court in New York and Florida. 
Rich’s trial experience includes cases involving contract claims, products liability, construction claims, fraud and telecommunications issues. Rich has represented the New York Football Giants, Inc. in connection with litigation relating to the construction of its new stadium and its Personal Seat License program. Rich has also had substantial experience in the area of defending corporations against allegations of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Representative of this work is: a Y2K case for Ericsson, Inc. involving allegations of product defects, breach of warranty and fraud in connection with the manufacture and design of emergency radio communications systems for a municipal government (in this case, Rich defeated a motion to have the action certified as a class action); a case for Jiffy Packaging Corporation which involved allegations of fraudulent representations in connection with an asset sale; a case for Sealed Air Corporation involving allegations of fraud in a bulk sale transaction; a case for ENSR involving alleged misrepresentations in the sale of a business; a case for GE involving the termination of a franchisee for alleged misrepresentations and fraud; a case for the New York Football Giants, Inc. involving alleged fraud; a case for New Jersey Realty Company involving allegations of fraud in connection with a tender offer; and a case for Press Broadcasting Corporation involving allegations of fraud and misrepresentations in connection with the acquisition (and construction) of a radio station from a bankruptcy estate.

In connection with this litigation, Rich represents several companies in the automotive industry. Among those companies is a manufacturer of automotive friction brake products and an after-market automotive parts manufacturer and distributor. 
In addition, Rich has counseled many clients on risks and litigation issues affecting their businesses. Representative of this, Rich has counseled Sulzer Holding, Inc. with respect to risks attendant to corporate acquisitions it was considering. Another facet of his counseling involves his work for Princeton University. Over the years Rich has consulted with and advised Princeton University’s General Counsel with respect to First Amendment issues, employment issues, alleged discrimination issues, litigation risks, potential liabilities relating to conditions at some of the University’s facilities, possible toxic tort liabilities and he has counseled the University with respect to real estate tax issues. Similarly, Rich has counseled UrbanTech, an engineering firm, on a variety of contract and litigation matters.
Among the clients he has represented are: Forbes, Inc., Princeton University, Ericsson, Inc.; the General Electric Company; the Associated Press; Stolt Tankers; United Press International; Owens-Illinois, Inc.; the New York Football Giants; Inc.; ENSR; the Asbury Park Press, Inc.; Press Broadcasting Company; Bristol- Myers Squibb; Sealed Air Corporation; Standard Motor Products, Inc; Parker-Hannifin Corporation; Hercules, Inc; Mestek, Inc; The Quikrete Companies; Sulzer Pumps, Inc; Blue Bird Body Company; Milacron, Inc., Tamko Roofing Products, Inc., Velan Valve Corp., Sea Tow, Inc., Lawyers Title Insurance Company, Ashland Chemical Company, Nest Fragrances and UrbanTech.

	                            New York, NY – October 21, 2013 - Troutman Sanders LLP is pleased to announce that Richard P. O'Leary has joined the firm’s New York office as a partner in the business litigation practice. 
O'Leary, who was a partner at McCarter & English LLP, practices in the areas of commercial litigation and product liability. During his more than 30 years of practice, he has tried a broad range of product liability cases and has significant experience in the area of asbestos litigation. O’Leary has also represented manufacturers in the life sciences industry in high profile product liability litigation. He has served as local counsel, as well as national counsel in multi-district litigation. O’Leary has tried more than 50 cases to verdict in federal and state courts in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and has also litigated matters in Florida. He litigated Malcolm v. National Gypsum Co., a Second Circuit case which set the standard for consolidating cases for trial in state and federal courts in New York. 
“Rich is a great addition to our expanding New York business litigation practice,” said William Withrow, Chair of the firm’s Litigation Department. “He brings proven experience with product liability and mass tort cases. His background handling all phases of complex litigation, including multiparty and multijurisdictional cases, will be of significant value to clients.” 
O’Leary has also tried cases involving contract claims, bankruptcy, construction claims and telecommunications issues. In addition, he has substantial experience defending corporations against allegations of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. He has counseled many clients on risks and litigation issues affecting their businesses, including in the context of M&A transactions. 
“Rich has an impressive track record in high-stakes litigation,” said David Dantzler, Managing Partner of the firm’s New York office. “He adds valuable depth and breadth to our litigation practice, because of his years of experience trying diverse commercial and product liability cases, his navigation of highly technical issues and the strategic perspective he provides clients with regard to litigation risk.” 
“Troutman Sanders provides a great foundation for my practice, because of the firm’s recognized litigation strength and the opportunity to collaborate with partners who provide valuable technical and substantive experience,” said O’Leary. “In addition, because of the diverse needs of my clients, the firm’s corporate and regulatory capabilities, as well as its national and international reach, provide tremendous value.” 
O'Leary earned a J.D., cum laude, and an A.B., magna cum laude, from Georgetown University Law Center. He is admitted to practice in New York, New Jersey, Florida and Pennsylvania.

Richard P. O’Leary Joins Troutman Sanders’ New York Office Expands Product Liability and Commercial Litigation Experience

Wednesday, October 23, 2013








Troutman Sanders LLP is pleased to announce that Richard P. O’Leary has joined the firm’s New York office as a partner in the business litigation practice.
  
O’Leary, who was a partner at McCarter & English LLP, practices in the areas of commercial litigation and product liability. During his more than 30 years of practice, he has tried a broad range of product liability cases and has significant experience in the area of asbestos litigation. O’Leary has also represented manufacturers in the life sciences industry in high profile product liability litigation. He has served as local counsel, as well as national counsel in multi-district litigation. O’Leary has tried more than 50 cases to verdict in federal and state courts in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and has also litigated matters in Florida. He litigated Malcolm v. National Gypsum Co., a Second Circuit case which set the standard for consolidating cases for trial in state and federal courts in New York.
“Rich is a great addition to our expanding New York business litigation practice,” said William Withrow, Chair of the firm’s Litigation Department. “He brings proven experience with product liability and mass tort cases. His background handling all phases of complex litigation, including multiparty and multijurisdictional cases, will be of significant value to clients.”
O’Leary has also tried cases involving contract claims, bankruptcy, construction claims and telecommunications issues. In addition, he has substantial experience defending corporations against allegations of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. He has counseled many clients on risks and litigation issues affecting their businesses, including in the context of M&A transactions.
“Rich has an impressive track record in high-stakes litigation,” said David Dantzler, Managing Partner of the firm’s New York office. “He adds valuable depth and breadth to our litigation practice, because of his years of experience trying diverse commercial and product liability cases, his navigation of highly technical issues and the strategic perspective he provides clients with regard to litigation risk.”
“Troutman Sanders provides a great foundation for my practice, because of the firm’s recognized litigation strength and the opportunity to collaborate with partners who provide valuable technical and substantive experience,” said O’Leary. “In addition, because of the diverse needs of my clients, the firm’s corporate and regulatory capabilities, as well as its national and international reach, provide tremendous value.”
O’Leary earned a J.D., cum laude, and an A.B., magna cum laude, from Georgetown University Law Center. He is admitted to practice in New York, New Jersey, Florida and Pennsylvania.
