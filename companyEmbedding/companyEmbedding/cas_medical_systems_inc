CASMED Sells Non-invasive Blood Pressure Monitoring Product Line to SunTech Medical
Marks divestiture of final, non-core legacy assets and allows sole focus on FORE-SIGHT® tissue oximetry products



















July 26, 2017 08:00 ET

 | Source: CAS Medical Systems, Inc.






BRANFORD, Conn., July  26, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CAS Medical Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASM) (CASMED), a leader in non-invasive cerebral oximetry technology, announces the sale of its non-invasive blood pressure monitoring product line for $4.5 million in cash to SunTech Medical Inc. (“SunTech”), a subsidiary of Halma plc.  CASMED will be eligible to receive up to an additional $2.0 million in cash based on the achievement of certain sales criteria through June 2019.  CASMED will provide transition services as necessary to ensure continuous customer satisfaction throughout the product line transition to SunTech.  SunTech will also purchase the related product inventory at the end of that short transition period. The non-invasive blood pressure monitoring product line includes MAXNIBP® and MAXIQ™ technology, which are supplied by CASMED through OEM agreements to various companies throughout the world.  Sales of these products totaled $3.6 million in 2016 and $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Sales from CASMED’s continuing operations, excluding the non-invasive blood pressure products, were $18.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, for those periods. FORE-SIGHT® disposable sensor sales comprised more than 85% of the revised total net sales from operations during each of those periods. The Company will reclassify the non-invasive blood pressure monitoring results to discontinued operations when it reports its overall financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. “With the divestiture of these final non-core legacy assets, we can now direct full attention to our FORE-SIGHT tissue oximetry products and use proceeds from this transaction to support our ongoing growth initiatives,” said Thomas M. Patton, President and Chief Executive Officer of CASMED.  “We estimate the worldwide cerebral oximetry market will ultimately reach $800 million annually and, given the accuracy and reliable readings from our FORE-SIGHT tissue oximeter, believe we are in an excellent competitive position.” SunTech is the world’s largest supplier of OEM advanced blood pressure monitoring products and technology for customers and patients. “This proprietary non-invasive blood pressure product line has the ability to accurately and reliably produce measurement results in high-motion environments and rounds out our product offering,” said Robert Sweitzer, President of SunTech.  “This is an important advantage especially in the most challenging clinical situations where measurements can be difficult to obtain, making this product line an ideal fit for SunTech and our worldwide customer base.” About CASMED® – Monitoring What's Vital CASMED FORE-SIGHT® Cerebral Oximeters provide a highly accurate, non-invasive measurement of tissue oxygenation in the brain.  Direct monitoring of tissue oxygenation can provide a superior and powerful tool to alert clinicians to otherwise unrecognized and dangerously low levels of oxygen in the brain and empower them to improve patient care.  For further information regarding CASMED, visit the Company's website at www.casmed.com.

     (1)   Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information    The historical financial statements have been adjusted in the pro forma financial statements to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the divestiture of the NIBP Business, 2) factually supportable and (3) with respect to the pro forma statement of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the results following the divestiture. The pro forma financial statements do not necessarily reflect what the Company's financial condition or results of operations would have been had the divestiture occurred on the dates indicated. The statements also may not be useful in predicting the future financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The actual financial position and results of operations may differ from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors. The pro forma financial information does not reflect the realization of any expected cost savings or other synergies from the divestiture of the NIBP Business. The pro forma adjustments are based on our preliminary estimates and assumptions that are subject to change.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The risks associated with desaturations are very real. Only one cerebral oximeter can give you the confidence of knowing your patient is being monitored in real time with the highest level of accuracy and precision available. LEARN MORE >

Real Value in Monitoring






The Facts

The risks associated with desaturations are very real, and can include complications like nausea, vomiting, and cognitive decline as well as irreparable consequences like stroke, organ/respiratory failure, and even death.
Studies have shown that even relatively less serious hypoxic events may lengthen the duration on mechanical ventilation, time spent in the ICU, or overall stay.
All of these outcomes contribute to higher cost of care; and with studies showing desaturations happening in up to 80 percent of some procedures, can you afford not to deploy this technology in your OR?
