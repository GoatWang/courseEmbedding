To use the mCig to burn your herb is general but those who want a pleasant vaping experience should head on over to Mark Linkhorsts tweet which I will provide the link below. The goal is to pack herb on one side of the chamber but drop the glass cylinder/chamber inside with the herb facing away from the heating spiral coil so that it can not burn but instead provide vapor! You can even use the mCig's cartridge screw part to push in the herb in the glass chamber!/photo/1

I ordered the Vitacig on a whim really.  Been so focused on the flagship product possibilities that the Vita was flying under my radar.  What a pleasant surprise doesn't really capture it.  OK here goes:1.  What I liked most about it:  Open the package, do what's intuitively obvious (take a draw) and it works.  No learning curve, great novelty factor (I'm smoking without smoking?), fun, can't wait to show friends, etc. etc.  Thoughts:  wow, I can just order more of these for three bucks a pop, I get 500 draws off it, great value for the money, enough choices, but not too many, could get the three for a reasonable price and try them all.  2.  I didn't have one thing I didn't like.  Maybe a coupon code for reduced shipping for 1st time buyers as a teaser.  People are always checking retail-me-not for those things.  Also ebates is good.  Then again, those sites may be a little soccer mom for their target demographic.

I would like a different tip for the Vitacig. Something thinner and flatter. Just my own personal preference other than that I love the Vitacigs I puff on them everyday.

So, I'll finally give my review of the vitacig...I ordered it online on 25th May, electronic shipping info took 4 days to process, and overall, it took 3 weeks from online order for me to receive the vitacigs in my hand.  My package of 3 vitacig multipacks was shipped from Pennsylvania.  I live and work in the Netherlands, though, and for a reason unknown to me, my package was in Dutch customs for 7 days. Overall, the individual packaging looks clean, but almost *too* clean.  There's no language on the front or sides to indicate what the flavor is, or what the vitacig actually is.  Only on the back, does it tell you that it's called the "Relax" or the "Refresh" or the "Energize", and all the wording is actually quite small... And nowhere on the outside of the package does it say that it is "non-nicotine." NOT A SINGLE PLACE.  The only place where it says that the vitacig is non-nicotine is on the inside of the package (it is possible to see the wording without opening the package, but that is difficult).It is very possible that the simplicity of the packaging -- not mentioning cigarette names or flavors or its non-nicotine nature, on the front or sides -- is deliberate.  Both smokers and non-smokers will pick up the vitacig in retail spots, out of curiosity.  I imagine that many smokers who encounter vitacig for the first time in a retail store, will buy it thinking that it has nicotine in it.The packaging is not easy to open.  It's very childproof.  In fact, it's almost adult-proof, LOL.  You need nails or strong fingertips to push in the black tabs that open the package.  I can't see many 7-year-old's opening this by themselves.  They'd try and then get frustrated.I'd like to see, in the long run, a box of 10 "loose" vitacigs, each shrinkwrapped. Then, you can hand them out really easily to friends and strangers.  You just pull one out of your pocket, and people can remove the shrinkwrap.  Currently, that's not possible.  You're stuck giving them either an "opened" vitacig, or the entire box.  And that's not as "safe" as giving a single shrinkwrapped vitacig.The vitacigs currently come in 3 flavors, approximately as follows: blueberry (Relax), lemon (Energize), and mint/menthol (Refresh).The Relax, to me, has the weakest flavor.  There's a Youtube video where a reviewer is saying that the Relax is "flavorful." I'm not sure I agree.  While there is a bit of a tea-like after-taste, I would hope that vitacig considers bumping the flavor concentration up maybe 10%, or even 15%, on the Relax.The Energize is nice and tart.  If you take a good-sized draw, you can taste the lemon.  But I'd bump the flavor concentration on this up maybe 5%.The Refresh, for me, is the clear winner.  Wow.  It's a lot of fun to vape this one.  The mint/menthol flavor is really quite powerful.  I wouldn't change anything about it.I'd like to see, in the future, different minty flavors.  Peppermint, spearmint, cinnamon, "cool mint"... these would all be nice additions to the product line.  Maybe, down the line, they should attempt some kind of joint venture or partnership with Tic Tac.As for the vapor, you can get quite a cloud if you sit there puffing for 10 seconds before a draw.  And of course, that's when you can taste most of the flavor.I'd have to agree with GVinvestments that the tip is a bit too clunky for me.  However, at the same time, when the tip is the same cylinder shape as the rest of the vitacig, it looks like a pen.  Very very stealth.  So I have mixed feelings about it.I will say, though, that the rubber cap that it comes with is a bit flimsy in the pocket.  I have read at least one other reviewer complain that the rubber cap falls off when he puts his vitacig in his pocket.  I have had the same experience.Overall, I can definitely see the potential of the vitacig.  Even though I'm a non-smoker, I understand the coolness factor.  I also understand the simplicity of the vitacig.  You open the package and you're ready to go... unlike these relatively complex e-cigarettes where you have to mix or fill liquids.  Non-smokers like me have absolutely zero interest in that ritual/routine.

I would like a different tip for the Vitacig. Something thinner and flatter. Just my own personal preference other than that I love the Vitacigs I puff on them everyday.

Post by jcshay56 on Jun 23, 2014 0:58:47 GMT -7
So, I'll finally give my review of the vitacig...I ordered it online on 25th May, electronic shipping info took 4 days to process, and overall, it took 3 weeks from online order for me to receive the vitacigs in my hand.  My package of 3 vitacig multipacks was shipped from Pennsylvania.  I live and work in the Netherlands, though, and for a reason unknown to me, my package was in Dutch customs for 7 days. Overall, the individual packaging looks clean, but almost *too* clean.  There's no language on the front or sides to indicate what the flavor is, or what the vitacig actually is.  Only on the back, does it tell you that it's called the "Relax" or the "Refresh" or the "Energize", and all the wording is actually quite small... And nowhere on the outside of the package does it say that it is "non-nicotine." NOT A SINGLE PLACE.  The only place where it says that the vitacig is non-nicotine is on the inside of the package (it is possible to see the wording without opening the package, but that is difficult).It is very possible that the simplicity of the packaging -- not mentioning cigarette names or flavors or its non-nicotine nature, on the front or sides -- is deliberate.  Both smokers and non-smokers will pick up the vitacig in retail spots, out of curiosity.  I imagine that many smokers who encounter vitacig for the first time in a retail store, will buy it thinking that it has nicotine in it.The packaging is not easy to open.  It's very childproof.  In fact, it's almost adult-proof, LOL.  You need nails or strong fingertips to push in the black tabs that open the package.  I can't see many 7-year-old's opening this by themselves.  They'd try and then get frustrated.I'd like to see, in the long run, a box of 10 "loose" vitacigs, each shrinkwrapped. Then, you can hand them out really easily to friends and strangers.  You just pull one out of your pocket, and people can remove the shrinkwrap.  Currently, that's not possible.  You're stuck giving them either an "opened" vitacig, or the entire box.  And that's not as "safe" as giving a single shrinkwrapped vitacig.The vitacigs currently come in 3 flavors, approximately as follows: blueberry (Relax), lemon (Energize), and mint/menthol (Refresh).The Relax, to me, has the weakest flavor.  There's a Youtube video where a reviewer is saying that the Relax is "flavorful." I'm not sure I agree.  While there is a bit of a tea-like after-taste, I would hope that vitacig considers bumping the flavor concentration up maybe 10%, or even 15%, on the Relax.The Energize is nice and tart.  If you take a good-sized draw, you can taste the lemon.  But I'd bump the flavor concentration on this up maybe 5%.The Refresh, for me, is the clear winner.  Wow.  It's a lot of fun to vape this one.  The mint/menthol flavor is really quite powerful.  I wouldn't change anything about it.I'd like to see, in the future, different minty flavors.  Peppermint, spearmint, cinnamon, "cool mint"... these would all be nice additions to the product line.  Maybe, down the line, they should attempt some kind of joint venture or partnership with Tic Tac.As for the vapor, you can get quite a cloud if you sit there puffing for 10 seconds before a draw.  And of course, that's when you can taste most of the flavor.I'd have to agree with GVinvestments that the tip is a bit too clunky for me.  However, at the same time, when the tip is the same cylinder shape as the rest of the vitacig, it looks like a pen.  Very very stealth.  So I have mixed feelings about it.I will say, though, that the rubber cap that it comes with is a bit flimsy in the pocket.  I have read at least one other reviewer complain that the rubber cap falls off when he puts his vitacig in his pocket.  I have had the same experience.Overall, I can definitely see the potential of the vitacig.  Even though I'm a non-smoker, I understand the coolness factor.  I also understand the simplicity of the vitacig.  You open the package and you're ready to go... unlike these relatively complex e-cigarettes where you have to mix or fill liquids.  Non-smokers like me have absolutely zero interest in that ritual/routine.

WHY VITASTIK ?
Looking at social media, it’s easy to see people around the world absolutely love Aromatherapy, Supplements, Vaporizing, Diffusing, Holistic Wellness Herbs, and Essential Oils.  But who has the time or money required to figure out what works best for him or herself?  There are so many products on the market, some affordable, some very overpriced, and many with less than satisfactory results.  
“I am a firm believer that human beings should attempt to get all their needed vitamins, minerals and nutrients from a well rounded diet, exercise and …lifestyle.  Lifestyle is the key.  However most people do not have the time or money needed to properly educate themselves to lead perfectly healthy lifestyles. 
Health is life …and a healthy lifestyle is the first step to a happy life!   This is the reason we named our Company VitaStik.  “Vita”, translates to “Life” in several languages.  Vita-Stick aka VitaStik = Life Stick", says our Founder.
VitaStik was established over three years ago in early 2014 to capture a healthy and happy lifestyle experience.  It was specifically designed to create an Instant Mood Enhancement Experience.  We like to call it #InstaMood.  We designed our Life Stick to be the world's only organic hand-held mood enhancement aromatherapy stick.  
We further enhance each stick with vitamins, therapeutic essential oils, and various holistic herbs crafted to provide the health aspect, or wellness factor necessary for a healthy and happy lifestyle.  Thus our Trademarked name Vita-Stick or VitaStik®. 
In essence, VitaStik® is an experience product, or lifestyle company, which focuses on organic health and wellness to help others live a happier life.  Our Life Stick …or Vita Stick will surely improve your mood and overall well being ...instantly.  InstaMood Vitamin Aromatherapy.  
The clearn water vapor generated by our organic VitaStik is created from “Just Vitamins + Therapeutic Essential Oils + Organic Flavor Waters”.  Our Flavor Waters are created from USDA certified organic crushed flowers, fruits, herbs, their extracts, and their essential oils.  They are designed to be 100% Edible, Kosher Food Grade.  Our motto is "if you wouldn't eat it, you shouldn't inhale it".  Zero Chemicals, Zero Sugar, Zero Calories, Zero PG (the toxic ingredient found in other products).   Each of our twelve formulas are made in the USA at cGMP FDA compliant labs.  Beware of foreign fake knockoff brands, there are several, and their ingredients are NOT the same no matter what they say, they are made in China, read their boxes, not their websites.  Be smart, buy Direct, from the Creator of the World Famous Vitamin Essential Oil Stick www.VitaStik.com 













                    HOW TO CHOOSE WHICH STICK?

How to use VitaStik the Vitamin Aromatherapy Stick ?
We recommend taking short, shallow, and slow inhalations.  Each inhalation should be exhaled via the nose for maximum aromatherapy effect.  We recommend pausing about one minute between each inhalations, to enjoy the moment, and allow the aromatherapy to work.  Our organic diffuser will instantly fill the air in the room around you with healing organics for up to 30 minutes with an improved wellness air.  We call this organic wellness air (the output of the VitaStik) "Enhanced Air".  There is no smoke, no chemicals and no calories in this Enhanced Air.  It is pure water vapor similar to water vapor in the air when taking a shower.  The water vapor is created from subtlety heating the organic waters in each vitamin diffuser stick which creates a refreshing pure inhalable water vapor.  Our formulas are heat stable because they are heat derived in a steam distillation process.  Furthermore we use specific low level heat components to power our Enhanced Air diffuser.  We make it our business to be the best, and the healthiest product in this space, and we challenge you or any other company to find or create something better than our Organic VitaStik!

The Doctors TV Show Features VitaStik
At first review, Dr Travis coverage seemed a bit negative about our Organic Vitamin Stick.  But after watching the show a second time, his point of view is clear.  He is negative against "All Vitamin Supplements", as a whole class of products.  He discusses this further in his new book.  To this point, we agree with Travis.  People should always try to get their vitamins from a healthy well rounded diet.  But for those people with an active lifestyle, this is not always easy, and this is where VitaStik can help fill the gap as the world's only Inhalable Vitamin and Essential Oil Stick.  Even after some negative statements, Dr. Travis's ending statements about VitaStik are Very Positive, and Dr Drew clearly loves VitaStik, as he inhales it over and over again, saying "I think I'm in love".   Take a look by watching the video below.

VITACIG: Much more than just an e-cigarette
Vitacig? What is it? VitaCig® is an innovative tobacco-free, nicotine-free vitamin and essential oil inhalation, aromatherapy device. Instead of containing harmful substances, VitaCig® delivers vapor that is rich in taste, vitamins, natural aroma and organic plant constituents. VitaCig® embodies what you enjoy about smoking, but without the bad aftertaste, the tobacco smoke and the cigarette smell.
No harmful tar. Just natural ingredients + vapor. Furthermore, VitaCig® is visually appealing with its modern and clear design. It is far ahead of conventional e-cigarettes and provides natural aroma, water vapor, plant constituents and valuable vitamins. Below you can learn more about VitaCig®
Smoke-free

Pure, clean vapor. With VitaCig® you only vaporize vitamins as well as natural and organic ingredients. VitaCig® is a great alternative to your classic cigarette. Just give it a try!
Application

Classy design, vitamins and no unpleasant odour. VitaCig® can be used nearly everywhere – whether you find yourself in a club or a restaurant (please check with the establishment). It provides you with up to 500 puffs (depending upon the user) and afterwards can simply be disposed of. You need a break and don’t want to use it all the time? No problem at all – simply put it down and pick it up again whenever you want.
Design

Each VitaCig® is made out of high-quality stainless steel and comes in five unique colors: Boisterous Berry (purple), Marvelous Mint (green), Cool Citrus (yellow), Vintage Vanilla (white), Charming Cherry (gold). Through special offers we will also be introducing new editions and flavors to our customers. VitaCig® combines a classy design with a modern touch – a colorful LED light comes on when you take a puff!
Flavors

The six main flavors are blueberry (Boisterous Berry), eucalyptus/mint (Marvelous Mint), orange/grapefruit (Cool Citrus), green tea/vanilla (Vintage Vanilla) cherry/mint (Charming Cherry), and strawberry/mint (Succulent Strawberry). VitaCig® was developed in the US. All flavors are naturally obtained, which is reflected in the pleasant aroma of the vapor.

Provides Shareholder UpdateMarketwiredFebruary 22, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareBEVERLY HILLS, CA--(Marketwired - Feb 22, 2016) - VitaCig, Inc. (  OTC PINK :  VTCQ ), a technology company that is harnessing mobile vaporization technology for multiple delivery applications, as well as a leader in the development, marketing, and sale of ultra-pure CBD tinctures, Edibles, and E-Liquids, is pleased to offer a corporate update from CEO Paul Rosenberg.To our valued shareholders:I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your investment, patience, and the ongoing support of our Company as we have transitioned from a lengthy quiet period to aggressively rolling out a campaign to re-launch the Company's products and brands.It should be evident that since our December 10th corporate update, I have spent nearly every waking moment looking for ways to create lasting value for both mCig® Inc. (  OTCQB :  MCIG ), and of course, VitaCig, Inc. I wish to take this opportunity to recount our recent corporate actions and business activities, as well as update their progress.Immediately following the announcement VitaCig Company and brand would be re-launched, I decided to build the VitaCBD™ CBD Division. We brought to market several ultra-pure, high-quality CBD product offerings such as our VitaCBD™ CBD Tincture Oil, VitaCBD™ CBD E-juice, and VitaCBD™ CBD European Gourmet Chocolate. This new line of products began to generate revenues for the company right out of the gate, and found great traction with our network of existing wholesale and distribution accounts. We are currently in the process of launching our core-four, Black and Gold Label VitaCBD™ product line. This new high-end, premium VitaCBD™ CBD line will include Tincture Oil, multi-flavored CBD E-juice, delicious CBD Gummie Edibles, and a concentrated CBD Wax. Our new VitaCBD™ high end CBD product line is expected for release early next month and will feature a new high-quality and redesigned corporate website.January was a big month for us as we announced a landmark royalty and CBD distribution deal with our Vitastik European partner, as well as launching the Vitastik product in Japan, and we couldn't be happier on how the product has been received. Since then, we are pleased to report Vitastik EU has placed their announced Vitastik order through VitaCig, and VitaCig collected their first royalty payment under this new agreement. Vitastik EU is expected to place their second large order later this week. Also a note to add, Vitastik EU CEO Johannes Luis has recently launched Vitastik Spain, as well as Vitastik Australia and is expected to place another 20k unit order next week. We expect more international product orders in March, and look to expand deeper into Asia over the coming months.Less than two weeks ago we re-launched our world famous VitaCig® disposable vitamin vaporizer line. It now features a fully mobile responsive, interactive, newly redesigned corporate website, new logo and product design, as well as new and exciting name changes for the flavors. The results of our re-launch in the last two weeks have been nothing short of amazing. We have had over 500 product pre-orders from individual customers, several significant wholesale pre-orders, and wholesale/distribution leads from all over the globe. We will announce the close of some of these larger accounts in the near future. Due in part to our VitaCig re-launch, the Company has generated more revenue since we re-launched in December, than we generated in the first 11 months of last year.Just last week, we announced VitaCig closed a partnership agreement with a major Chinese e-cig manufacturer, Surpass International Technology Ltd. Under the terms of the agreement, Surpass has agreed to provide VitaCig with disposables, rechargeable e-cigs, the latest vaporizers and technology they are producing, and also related accessories. The fruit of this relationship continues to grow. Next Quarter, as part of this new agreement, VitaCig will be rolling out a special VitaCig® Allstar Rechargeable unit, which uses pre-filled liquid capsules and will be available in all of our amazing VitaCig® flavors.In moving forward from here, many of you know mCig Inc, is VitaCig's largest shareholder, and as owner of a 47% equity stake in VitaCig Company, no one has a more vested interest in building value for VitaCig then mCig does. To demonstrate our long-term commitment and reaffirm our unwavering confidence in VitaCig's future, mCig has agreed to lock up its shares for a period of one year. Following the end of the lock up period, we will evaluate our position and likely extend the agreement, barring any unforeseen necessity not to do so. I sincerely hope our shareholders, and potential investors alike see this decision by mCig and its management team as a sign of good things to come and demonstrate our commitment to reduce any harmful dilution toward our shareholders at such an early stage in VitaCig's development. I pride myself in putting shareholders first. I always have, and always will. I understand full well that most other companies in our position and in our space would not prioritize their shareholders, which is what this decision has made obvious.Read MoreIn closing, we have narrowed our pick of potential candidates for the new CEO of VitaCig to three. We will make an announcement when a decision has become finalized. At that time, we will encourage the new CEO, following meeting QB status qualifications, to immediately put in paperwork to file for OTCQB status. Our VitaCBD™ CBD Beverage Division and new VitaCig flavors and products are also expected to be unveiled this fiscal year.On behalf of the entire VitaCig management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support. In closing, I wholeheartedly believe that we have the best talent, expertise, and strategic approach necessary to create dominance and value in everything that we are setting out to accomplish, and we look forward to reporting on our progress as we continue to execute these ambitious business plans.About VitaCig, Inc.VitaCig, Inc.

mCig Inc.’s VITACIG Division Signs New Continents and Expands Brand Rights in Europe, Increasing VitaCig Total Revenue Outlook to over $2 Million in FY2018










 mCig Inc. (MCIG) a leading distributor of technology, products, and services in the Cannabis sector is pleased to announce its VitaCig division’s new exclusive partnership contract for the territories of Australia and New Zealand, valued at approximately $1.0 million in guaranteed orders over three years. In addition, our Japanese partner’s success has been tremendous since their official launch almost one year ago, and has committed to an additional $1.0 million investment into the VitaCig brand to expand their original contract to also include East and Southeast Asia. These expanded terms adds an additional $1.5 million in guaranteed orders over the next three years and increases VitaCig division’s total revenue outlook to over $2 million in FY2018.





















During the last few months, MCIG’s VitaCig division has reclaimed non-performing franchises to enhance shareholder value. As a result, the sole corporation operates under the VitaCig name and management with full control and ownership of all European distribution channels, the previous branding for VitaStik, EU Trademark (which includes all member states of the EU), 14 domain names (including vitastik.de, vitastikofficial.com), and all other European trade secrets of the Vitastik brand in all the member states of the European Union; with additional trademark protection in Australia, Mexico, and Turkey. MCIG will continue to aggressively defend its enterprise value of VitaStik as a brand in addition to bringing low-performing divisions into compliance with our contractual terms.
MCIG’s focus on aggressive international expansion for VitaCig continues to pay off and enables control of its future in Europe while moving forward to work with other franchisers to develop and expand the company.
Plans for MCIG’s next target market regarding international distribution for its VitaCig product line are focused in the Middle East, where the company is currently in talks with potential partners from Israel, Iran, Lebanon, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and India.
“MCIG continues to add to its IP and asset portfolio, and is working aggressively to protect its VitaCig brand and role as the industry leader in the disposable vitamin, essential oil, and e-cig industry. With the FDA and International regulatory agencies taking a strong stance on nicotine and tobacco related products, we are more confident than ever in the value and potential of our nicotine and tobacco free VitaCig brand and product line. Our VitaCig brand and reputation continues to expand throughout the world, and remains to be a significant revenue driver for MCIG. Our decision to take control of VitaCig, and roll the company and assets into a subsidiary of MCIG, continues to prove that it was the right decision to make for the company and our shareholders,” said Paul Rosenberg, CEO of mCig.
