Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

Legacy Venture











































WE TAP VENTURE CAPITAL TO HELP OUR MEMBERS

AMPLIFY THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT IN THE WORLD





About Us

Founded in 1999, Legacy aggregates over $1.5 billion from over 500 investors who intend that all returns, both principal and gains, will be used for their individual philanthropic interests. Thus Legacy investors leverage venture returns to make an even more significant impact for good in the world.
Legacy Venture manages a series of fund-of-funds. We invest in a select group of premier venture capital firms who in turn invest in companies that have included Facebook, LendingClub, Fitbit, YouTube, Skype, Xiaomi, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Airbnb. These venture firms are often highly sought after and in many cases are not accessible to new investors. Legacy has gained access to these venture funds by virtue of its philanthropic mission and its well-connected management team.
 












Meet The TeamLegacy Venture’s executive team is comprised of seasoned leaders in venture capital, finance and philanthropy who have more than 50 years of combined experience in the field. Their deep insights and personal networks are a key part of what makes Legacy Venture attractive to such elite and successful funds, and what empower our investors to strive to maximize their philanthropy.

A Community of Innovative PhilanthropistsBased in Silicon Valley, and global in reach, Legacy is honored to support the philanthropy of over 500 investors in the existing Legacy funds. Among our investors are founders, CEOs and senior executives from prominent technology companies, including Apple, Facebook, eBay, Pinterest, Google, Yahoo, Cisco and Amazon, as well as private equity, real estate, hedge and venture firm executives. Those individual philanthropists are joined by a select group of private foundations, community foundations, and a few nonprofit organizations. Legacy connects investors with each other, encouraging them to share ideas, insights and expertise that amplify their impact.












The following gallery illustrates some of the organizations that have benefited from our community’s generous philanthropy.
