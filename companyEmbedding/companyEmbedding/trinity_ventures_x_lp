Trinity Ventures Closes $300 Million Trinity X Fund



Share Article

















Trinity Ventures, an investor in early-stage information technology companies, today announced the closing of Trinity Ventures X.  The fund was oversubscribed and was limited to $300 million in LP commitments, consistent with Trinity's three previous funds.







We kept the fund the same size as our prior funds, so we can continue our strategy of investing selectively in capital-efficient, early stage companies and our commitment to being accessible and responsive board members


Menlo Park, Calif. (PRWEB)
April 23, 2009
 Trinity Ventures, an investor in early-stage information technology companies, today announced the closing of Trinity Ventures X.  The fund was oversubscribed and was limited to $300 million in LP commitments, consistent with Trinity's three previous funds.  Trinity X will invest in the software, IT infrastructure and services sectors.  Target investment areas include business and consumer online services, virtualization and cloud computing, digital media and online advertising platforms, software as a service, energy efficiency solutions and mobile technology.  
"We were pleased with the strong support from our investors, which enabled us to close our target amount on schedule, despite turmoil in the markets," said Fred Wang, general partner at Trinity Ventures. The fund is comprised primarily of commitments from returning investors, though it also includes a select number of new investors.  "We see their support as a confirmation that we have a unique strategy that is appropriate to invest in these markets in these times."
"We kept the fund the same size as our prior funds, so we can continue our strategy of investing selectively in capital-efficient, early stage companies and our commitment to being accessible and responsive board members," stated Wang.  The fund will invest between $2 million and $20 million in approximately 30 companies.
The Trinity team has worked together for many years.  Trinity X will be managed by general partners Ajay Chopra, Noel Fenton, Tim McAdam, Patricia Nakache, Larry Orr, Gus Tai, and Fred Wang, principals Dan Scholnick and Jim Tybur, and CFO and administrative partner Kathy Murphy.
For more information contact Fred Wang or Larry Orr at 650-854-9500, or refer to Trinity's web site at  http://www.trinityventures.com
