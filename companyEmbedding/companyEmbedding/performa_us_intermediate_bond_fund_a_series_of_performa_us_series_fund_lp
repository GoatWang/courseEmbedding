What Are the Best Bond Funds?
Author: admin | Apr122016 Posted in Bond Funds  No comments




Before buying or selling bond funds, it’s important to know something about the current status of the market for these securities. An assessment of bond funds in today’s market can help you answer the question, “What are the best bond funds?” 





Diversification is one of the best ways to minimize investment risks associated with any asset class. If you’d like to invest in bonds but don’t want to build and manage a portfolio of individual issues, bond funds can help you gain exposure in corporate taxable bonds, municipal tax-free bonds, high yield bonds or the highest yielding junk debt securities. Choose from mutual funds, closed-end unit trusts (UITs), and exchange traded funds (ETFs).
Bond funds are perhaps the best known way to invest in an existing portfolio of bond securities. A bond mutual fund pays dividends based on portfolio interest earned. The bond fund’s value rises and falls as the securities in the portfolio change in value according to investor demand, interest rates, and other factors.
Top Bond Funds
Top bond funds may include many different issues, maturities, and coupon rates. It’s also wise to diversify your funds across bond fund types, such as tax-free municipal bond funds, international bond funds, U.S. government bond funds, corporate bond funds, and high yield corporate bond funds.
The top bond funds in terms of assets under management (AUM) offer different bond fund types. Let’s take a look at the top five taxable bond funds according to The Wall Street Journal:

Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Admiral (VBTLX) tracks U.S. investment grade bonds (Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index). This is a passive fund. VBTLX has more than USD 151 billion AUM. Over a five year holding period, an original USD 10,000 investment would have grown to USD 11,953. Over 10 years, the investment would have grown to USD 15,764.
PIMCO Total Return Fund Institutional (PTTRX) is a core bond investment fund for institutional investors. The initial purchase is USD 1,000, 000. PTTRX once had USD 300 billion AUM (2013) and now has about USD 89 billion AUM. This is an actively managed fund. An initial investment in PTTRX would have grown to USD 11,865 in five years and USD 17,477 in 10 years.
Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund Investor (VTBIX) is a passive core bond index fund that tracks the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Float-Adjusted Index. The fund has more than USD 89 billion AUM. Over five years, an initial USD 10,000 investment would have grown to USD 11,898.
Metropolitan West Total Return Bond Fund I (MWTIX) is an actively managed intermediate-term bond fund with more than USD 71 billion AUM. The fund invests in mid to moderate credit quality taxable bond issues such as Agency MBS pass-through securities, asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, and U.S. Treasuries. An initial USD 10,000 investment in MWTIX would have grown to USD 12,519 in five years and to USD 18.336 in 10 years.
Templeton Global Bond Fund Advisor (TGBAX)is an actively managed world bond fund that typically invests in short-duration, lower credit quality bonds from international issuers, such as Mexico USD Mex St 7.75 percent, Federative RepublikBrasilien Bras 10 percent, United Mexican States 7.62435 percent, and Hungary Republic 6.375 percent bonds. The fund may keep a large percentage of AUM in cash at any time. TGBAX has more than USD 53 billion AUM. The goal of the fund is to achieve a higher current yield in fixed income securities by investing assets in international bonds. An initial USD 10,000 investment in TGBAX would have returned USD 10,685 in five years and USD 18,944 in ten years.

Top 10 Bond Funds
The Wall Street Journal’s top 10 bound funds include:

Two additional Vanguard funds (Vanguard Short-Term Investment Grand Fund Admiral VFSUX with almost USD 53 billion AUM; and Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund Investor VTIBX with more than USD 52 billion AUM).
A second PIMCO bond fund (PIMCO Income Fund Institutional PIMIX with more than USD 53 billion AUM).
DoubleLine Total Return bond fund I DBLTX with more than 55 billion AUM.
Dodge & Cox Income bond fund DODIX with more than USD 43 billion AUM.

Tax-Free Income Bond Funds
Not all investors need tax-free income but, if you’re searching for a way to maximize your net return on investment after taxes, a tax-free income bond fund might be right for you. Some of the top funds in this category include:

Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt Fund VWITX has more than USD 47 billion AUM. The minimum investment in the fund is just USD 3,000. VWITX has performed a bit better than the Barclays Municipal TR USD it traces. An initial USD 10,000 investment would have grown to USD 12,761 in five years and USD 15,423 in 10 years.VWITX income is free from federal taxes only. Examples of holdings include Central Plans Energy Proj (Nebraska) Rev Ref 5 percent, University of California Revs for Prev Rev Bonds 5 percent, California State GO (General Obligation) Bonds 5 percent, California State GO Bonds 5.75 percent, and Maryland State GO Bonds 5 percent. The fund invests in state/local government obligations, education, transportation, health, and advanced refunded issues.

According to U.S. News & World Report, other top 10 tax exempt funds in the municipal intermediate-term category include:

Wells Fargo CoreBuilder Shares Series M (WTCMX) with more than USD 386 million AUM. WTCMX generates a federally tax-free income stream. Current holdings include municipal bonds of state/local governments (GO), transportation, industrial, and water & sewer issues. This fund may deploy assets in inverse floaters in search of higher returns.
Vanguard High Yield Tax Exempt Fund (VWAHX) with almost 10 billion AUM generates federally tax-fee income by investing in middle-moderate credit quality municipal issues of state/local governments (GO), transportation, health, education, and industrial revenue bonds. This fund takes on addition risk in search of better than average returns.
State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (SFBDX) has more than USD 697 million AUM. The fund invests in state/local governments (GO), education, water & sewer, advanced refunded, and transportation issues among others. At least 70 percent of the portfolio is invested in A-rated or better municipal securities (S&P, Moody’s). Up to 30 percent of the portfolio can be invested in med to lower-credit quality muni bonds.
USAA Tax Exempt Intermediate Term Fund (USATX) has more than USD 4 billion AUM. The fund invests in state/local governments (GO), health, transportation, industrial, and education municipal bond sectors. The fund invests in municipal credit quality of BBB or better.

Top 10 Tax-Free Bond Funds
According to U.S. News & World Report, the remaining five intermediate tax-free funds in the top ten include: T. Rowe Price Summit Municipal Intermediate Fund PRSMX; Dreyfus Municipal Bond Fund DRTAX and Dreyfus AMT-Free Municipal Bond Fund DMUAX; BMO Intermediate Tax-Free Fund MITFX; BNY Mellon National Intermediate Municipal Bond Fund MPNIX; and Federated Intermediate Municipal Trust (FIMTX).
If you’re in search of tax-free income and you live in a state with an income tax, compare state tax-free bond funds with federally tax-free bond funds to identify the best returns. If you’re subject to AMT tax, compare funds that offer relief.
Ultimately, the best bond funds help you achieve financial goals and earn a consistent return on your money. Not all bond funds are created equal. The bond funds explored in this article are different but all share a common feature: the costs to own them are low. In a low interest rate environment, it’s especially important to minimize the cost of owning bond funds. The money you save is just as important as the money you make.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

THE FUND Performa International Convertible Bond Fund Ltd. (the Fund ), was incorporated under the laws of Bermuda on March 21, 1997, as an open-ended limited liability investment company. The year end of the Fund is the last Thursday in December. The Fund is organized into distinct classes of shares. The Accumulation Share class was the only class of Common Share outstanding during the year ended December 27, 2007 and December 28, The Fund seeks superior returns while providing liquidity in short-term, low risk, fixed income securities. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a. Basis of accounting: The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Bermuda and Canada. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. b. Investments: Trading activity is recorded on a trade date basis. Securities that are listed on a national securities exchange are valued at their last sales prices on the date of valuation on the largest national securities exchange on which such securities have traded on such date.

Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.The "After Tax Held" represents total return after taxes on distributions and assumes shares have not been sold. "After Tax Sold" represents total return after taxes on distributions and the sale of Fund shares. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. After-tax returns are based on NAV.

            Barclays Composite Rating: A  blend of a security's Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings. If all three agencies rate the security, the middle rating is taken. If only two agencies rate a security, the lower rating is taken. If only one agency rates a security, that rating is used. Not rated indicates that a security is rated by fewer than one of the three rating agencies. This composite is not intended to be a credit opinion.
