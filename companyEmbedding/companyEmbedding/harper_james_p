Top record matches for James P Harper






Surname meaning for "Harper"
English, Scottish, and Irish: occupational name for a player on the
harp, from an agent derivative of Middle English, Middle Dutch
harp ‘harp’. The harper was one of the most important figures
of a medieval baronial hall, especially in Scotland and northern
England, and the office of harper was sometimes hereditary. The
Scottish surname is probably an Anglicized form of Gaelic Mac
Chruiteir ‘son of the harper’ (from Gaelic cruit ‘harp’,
‘stringed instrument’). This surname has long been present in Ireland.

Summary





                                Because the law of torts governs a wide spectrum of social and economic issues, new challenges and precedents arise constantly. This preeminent work on torts is the most complete, authoritative resource analyzing the latest developments in this turbulent field of practice.  Harper, James and Gray on Torts, Third Edition, newly revised and updated in a six-volume set, gives you detailed, up-to-date information and expert guidance on such rapidly changing areas as:   Health care liability   Standards for damages   Product liability   Defamation   Assumption of risk   Business torts   Liability for emotional distress   Pure economic loss   Privacy   Family torts   Comparative and contributory negligence   Governmental liability   Duties of owners and occupiers of land   Misrepresentation and nondisclosure   Malicious prosecution and abuse of process   Liability for abnormally dangerous activities   Wrongful death    Harper, James and Gray on Torts (formerly Law of Torts ) includes complete analysis of the Restatement (Third) of the Law of Torts , as well as comprehensive tables of cases, statutes and uniform acts.

Research AreasSyllabiVideo

Research.
The primary research goal in our laboratory is the NMR characterization of structure in solids that are difficult or impossible to examine by more conventional techniques.  The relevance of our methods is, perhaps, best demonstrated by our recent characterization of the complete crystal structure of (+)-catechin, a ubiquitous and extensively studied antioxidant that had defied characterization for nearly a century.1  This NMR work emphasizes 13C and 15N shift tensor measurements and relies on computational chemistry methods to tie these results to structure.  A secondary area of emphasis involves the search for novel bioactive fungal products with a special focus on identifying unusual antioxidants.  Work is each of these areas is described below.
1)   NMR crystallography – prediction of complete crystal structures for intractable materials.  Conventional crystallographic techniques are often unable to provide structure in materials.  The typical limitation lies in difficulty in growing suitable crystals.  We have recently demonstrated that accurate crystal structure can often be established without single crystals or even diffraction data if a combination of solid-state NMR and a theoretically crystal structure prediction process are used.2  Remarkably, the structures now being solved in our lab with this methodology and powdered solids rival or surpass the accuracy of single crystal diffraction data.3  This approach promises to open new areas of structural analysis in challenging materials and studies are underway with the goal of characterizing high profile pharmaceuticals that have long defied traditional analysis.
2)   Design of superior free radical scavengers.  Some effort in our lab involves searching for bioactive fungi within higher plants (i.e. endophytic fungi).  These “bioprospecting” studies have now identified several fungal products that have superb antioxidant activity.4  Some of these molecules have unique modes of action as indicated by mechanistic studies involving computational modeling.  Presently the products we have examined are unsuited for pharmaceutical use, but it appears that the structural features creating the activity can be reproduced in more favorable products.  Computational testing is now underway on a wide variety of candidate antioxidants with the goal of identifying superior radical scavengers with more favorable biocompatibility.
