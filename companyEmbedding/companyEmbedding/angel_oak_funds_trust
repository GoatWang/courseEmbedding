Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Funds can make short sales of securities, which involves the risk that losses in securities may exceed the original amount invested. Leverage, which may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of securities in a Fund’s portfolio on the Fund’s Net Asset Value and therefore may increase the volatility of a Fund. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are increased for emerging markets. Investments in fixed income instruments typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. Derivatives involve risks different from and, in certain cases, greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. Investments in asset backed and mortgage‐backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of, such as credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. Investments in lower‐rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher‐rated securities. A non‐diversified fund may be more susceptible to being adversely affected by a single corporate, economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund. Funds will incur higher and duplicative costs when it invests in mutual funds, ETFs and other investment companies. There is also the risk that the Funds may suffer losses due to the investment practices of the underlying funds. For more information on these risks and other risks of the Funds, please see the Prospectus.

**As of 6/30/17, the Angel Oak Multi-Strategy Income Fund (ANGLX) received a Morningstar rating based on risk-adjusted returns of 5 stars overall, 4 stars for the three-year period & 5 stars for the five-year period among 233, 233, and 190 multisector bond funds, respectively. The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history, without adjustment for sales loads. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Angel Oak Multi-Strategy Income Fund (ANGLX)


















































Multi-Strategy Income Fund

Overview
Focus on Non-Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities
The Fund seeks the best risk-adjusted opportunities in fixed income that offer the potential for both stable, monthly dividends and price appreciation.  The Fund employs a top-down strategy to identify relative valuation opportunities within the structured credit markets and a bottom-up credit selection process to selecting individual issues. The managers will invest opportunistically across a wide range of credits and issuer types based on relative value within fixed income. Specifically, the Fund targets opportunities in:

Non-Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (NA RMBS)
Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS)
Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLO)
Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)
Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS)

Currently, the Fund has a bias towards credit and low duration assets to manage interest rate risk. This bias is not set for the long-term and may change over time as the managers’ view on the global economy, interest rates and capital market conditions change. The team does not manage the portfolio’s asset allocation to resemble the Fund’s benchmark in a relative sense, but instead positions the portfolio with a focus on absolute return.

Standard Deviation: A statistical measure of portfolio risk used to measure variability of total return around an average, over a specified period of time.  The greater the standard deviation over the period, the wider the variability or range of returns and hence, the greater the fund’s volatility. The standard deviation has been calculated since inception.
Sharpe Ratio: A statistical measure that uses standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. A higher Sharpe ratio implies a better historical risk-adjusted performance. The Sharpe ratio has been calculated since inception using the 3-month LIBOR for the risk-free rate of return.
Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index: An unmanaged index that measures the performance of the investment-grade universe of bonds issued in the United States. The index includes institutionally traded U.S. Treasury, government sponsored, mortgage and corporate securities. Please note that an investor cannot invest directly in the index; therefore its performance does not reflect a reduction for fees or expenses incurred in managing a portfolio.

Read press release



 
The Fund may make short sales of securities, which involve the risk that losses in securities may exceed the original amount invested. The fund may use leverage, which may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of securities in the Fund’s portfolio on the Fund’s Net Asset Value and therefore may increase the volatility of the Fund. Derivatives involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. Investments in debt securities typically decrease when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in lower rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. The Fund will incur higher and duplicative expenses when it invests in mutual funds, ETFs, and other investment companies. For more information on these risks and other risks of the Fund, please see the Prospectus. 
**As of 6/30/17, the Angel Oak Multi-Strategy Income Fund (ANGLX) received a Morningstar rating based on risk-adjusted returns of 5 stars overall, 4 stars for the three-year period & 5 stars for the five-year period among 233, 233, and 190 multisector bond funds, respectively. The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history, without adjustment for sales loads. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Duration: An approximate measure of a bond’s price sensitivity to changes in interest rates.

**As of 6/30/17, the Angel Oak Multi-Strategy Income Fund (ANGLX) received a Morningstar rating based on risk-adjusted returns of 5 stars overall, 4 stars for the three-year period & 5 stars for the five-year period among 233, 233, and 190 multisector bond funds, respectively. The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history, without adjustment for sales loads. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
**As of 6/30/17, the Angel Oak High Yield Opportunities Fund (ANHIX) received a Morningstar rating based on risk-adjusted returns of 4 stars overall, 5 stars for the three-year period and 4 stars for the five-year period among 590, 590, and 474 high yield bond funds.

Performance data current to the most recent month-end and quarter-end can be obtained by clicking the links above.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than what is stated.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Funds can make short sales of securities, which involves the risk that losses in securities may exceed the original amount invested. Leverage, which may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of securities in a Fund’s portfolio on the Fund’s Net Asset Value and therefore may increase the volatility of a Fund. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are increased for emerging markets. Investments in fixed income instruments typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. Derivatives involve risks different from and, in certain cases, greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. Investments in asset backed and mortgage‐backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of, such as credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. Investments in lower‐rated and nonrated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher‐rated securities. A non‐diversified fund, may be more susceptible to being adversely affected by a single corporate, economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund. Funds will incur higher and duplicative costs when it invests in mutual funds, ETFs and other investment companies. There is also the risk that the Funds may suffer losses due to the investment practices of the underlying funds. For more information on these risks and other risks of the Funds, please see the Prospectus.
There is no guarantee that this or any investment strategy will succeed; the strategy is not an indicator of future performance; and investment results may vary.
Definitions:Correlation: A statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to another. Index used for comparison is the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.Duration: A measure of the sensitivity of the price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates.
References to other mutual funds should not be interpreted as an offer of these securities.
Fund holdings and allocations are subject to change at any time and should not be considered a recommendation to buy or sell any security.
Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect from loss in a declining market.
Indexed annuities are complex, not suitable for all investors, and due to surrender charges it is possible to lose money.
Upside potential may be limited due to participation rates.
**As of 6/30/17, the Angel Oak Multi-Strategy Income Fund (ANGLX) received a Morningstar rating based on risk-adjusted returns of 5 stars overall, 4 stars for the three-year period & 5 stars for the five-year period among 233, 233, and 190 multisector bond funds, respectively. The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history, without adjustment for sales loads. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
**As of 6/30/17, the Angel Oak High Yield Opportunities Fund (ANHIX) received a Morningstar rating based on risk-adjusted returns of 4 stars overall, 5 stars for the three-year period and 4 stars for the five-year period among 590, 590, and 474 high yield bond funds. The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history, without adjustment for sales loads.

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        March 30, 2017.

Start Supplemental Information
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.

Summary of the Application:

1. Applicants request an order that would permit the applicants to participate in an interfund lending facility where each Fund could lend money directly to and borrow money directly from other Funds to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls, such as unanticipated redemptions or trade fails.[1] 
           The Funds will not borrow under the facility for leverage purposes and the loans' duration will be no more than 7 days.[2] 

2. Applicants anticipate that the proposed facility would provide a borrowing Fund with a source of liquidity at a rate lower than the bank borrowing rate at times when the cash position of the Fund is insufficient to meet temporary cash requirements. In addition, Funds making short-term cash loans directly to other Funds would earn interest at a rate higher than they otherwise could obtain from investing their cash in repurchase agreements or certain other short term money market instruments. Thus, applicants assert that the facility would benefit both borrowing and lending Funds.
3. Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be Start Printed Page 16643subject to the terms and conditions stated in the Application. Among others, the Adviser, through a designated committee, would administer the facility as a disinterested fiduciary as part of its duties under the investment management agreement with each Fund and would receive no additional fee as compensation for its services in connection with the administration of the facility. The facility would be subject to oversight and certain approvals by the Funds' Board, including, among others, approval of the interest rate formula and of the method for allocating loans across Funds, as well as review of the process in place to evaluate the liquidity implications for the Funds. A Fund's aggregate outstanding interfund loans will not exceed 15% of its net assets, and the Fund's loans to any one Fund will not exceed 5% of the lending Fund's net assets.[3] 

4. Applicants assert that the facility does not raise the concerns underlying section 12(d)(1) of the Act given that the Funds are part of the same group of investment companies and there will be no duplicative costs or fees to the Funds.[4] 
           Applicants also assert that the proposed transactions do not raise the concerns underlying sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(3), 17(d) and 21(b) of the Act as the Funds would not engage in lending transactions that unfairly benefit insiders or are detrimental to the Funds. Applicants state that the facility will offer both reduced borrowing costs and enhanced returns on loaned funds to all participating Funds and each Fund would have an equal opportunity to borrow and lend on equal terms based on an interest rate formula that is objective and verifiable. With respect to the relief from section 17(a)(2) of the Act, applicants note that any collateral pledged to secure an interfund loan would be subject to the same conditions imposed by any other lender to a Fund that imposes conditions on the quality of or access to collateral for a borrowing (if the lender is another Fund) or the same or better conditions (in any other circumstance).[5] 

5. Applicants also believe that the limited relief from section 18(f)(1) of the Act that is necessary to implement the facility (because the lending Funds are not banks) is appropriate in light of the conditions and safeguards described in the application and because the Funds would remain subject to the requirement of section 18(f)(1) that all borrowings of a Fund, including combined interfund loans and bank borrowings, have at least 300% asset coverage.
6. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any persons or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Rule 17d-1(b) under the Act provides that in passing upon an application filed under the rule, the Commission will consider whether the participation of the registered investment company in a joint enterprise, joint arrangement or profit sharing plan on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants.

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.

 The Dos And Don'ts Of Setting Up A Trust Fund? | How To Protect Your Assets            How To Protect Your Assets Menu       The Dos And Don’ts Of Setting Up A Trust Fund? SETTING UP A TRUST FUND: WHAT YOU SHOULD NEVER CONSIDER DOING Parents tend to make mistakes. It kind of goes with the job when you become one. No parent is going to be perfect. This also goes for setting up a trust fund for their kids. There are many parents who have made quite a few mistakes with this. You are here so you can learn from these mistakes. Learn what not to do when setting up a trust.  WHO IS GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF THEIR KID’S TRUST FUNDThis is probably the number one mistake parents make when setting up a trust fund for their kids. They fail to select the appropriate trustee for their kids. There are two different types of trustees. There is the Single trustee. There is also the co-trustee. This one offers more of a checks-and-balances protocol in the system. It really doesn’t matter who you pick, just make sure it’s someone you trust 100% and beyond. What is going to happen once you are no longer there? The trustee can say or go along with anything you want, as long as you are still alive. Once you are dead and gone, this person might just take the reins. This can be both good and bad. Please make sure you are selecting someone you really do have faith in.  THINK ABOUT THE PATH OF THE MONEY This is the second mistake many parents make. They set up a trust. However, they fail to set up a direction for the trust. Guys, you have to do this. Figure out how and when the money should be dispersed out. Do you really want to leave this up to a neutral party? This can and will happen. When it does, you might not be happy with the results. This is your money. These are your kids. Set up some goals.A LIST OF BENEFICIARIES Setting up the trust and the trustee are the first steps. Afterwards, you have to set up a small list of beneficiaries. This way the money goes back and forth where it’s intended to be. You have to have protocols in place to make sure all your plans are happening, as well as people to do the job. You cannot leave this up to chance. Too many parents have left it up to chance. The kids ended up suffering because of it. A trust fund is not just about money. It’s about your kids and their future. Please make sound choices here. Part of providing well for your kids is making good choices with the people involved. Go with your gut. If your gut says to not trust someone with this charge, than listen to it.
