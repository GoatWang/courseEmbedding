The Worcesters are a delight to work with and display exceptional wisdom in real estate investment. We can vouch for their integrity, honesty, and desire to serve more than be served. Most of our investments with WI earns interest that the firm pays in monthly installments, always on time. There is no other opportunity available that can match the returns WI offers and also gives us the sense of security that our funds are in safe hands.
 - Stuart & Christine Smith





It has been a pleasure conducting business with Worcester Investments, as they have remitted all payments on time and provided timely documentation for all necessary activities.

I highly recommend Worcester Investments and I believe they represent the correct risk/reward opportunity.

I've worked closely with Worcester Investments through every aspect of acquisition. I have found WI and its members to be knowledgeable investors who are well equipped to handle all aspects of a real estate transaction.

Worcester Investments and its members are timely, efficient, knowledgeable and a pleasure to work with.

Paul and Joel were easy to work with and honest throughout the purchase process. We were able to close the transaction successfully. I look forward to working with them in the future.
 - Aaron Mesmer, Block LLC





It's my pleasure to recommend the principals of Worcester Investments. The principals have strong knowledge and keen financial strength in the commercial real estate arena to recognize an opportunity to add their value added expertise to a property. I've seen the high results of their efforts and know that their future will be full of successes moving forward.
 - Jack Hanrahan, First American Title





Over the past few years, we have had the pleasure of working closely with Worcester Investments LLC on a number of real estate transactions. They have a tremendous amount of knowledge regarding the real estate industry in St. Joseph, MO, and are very thorough when it comes to the details of each and every acquisition. They are an asset to our community and we hope to continue doing business with them for many years to come
 - Saint Joseph Title & Abstract





Joel and Worcester Investments are a pleasure to work with. They are tenacious negotiators, tireless researchers and incredibly dependable partners. Whether partnering in real estate purchases or loaning them funds for opportunities, I am always confident that the outcome will be successful.
 - Kerrie Johnson





I would recommend Paul Worcester as a very good man to do business with. He was very honest, helpful and businesslike in our dealings. He is a man of his word which I appreciate very much.
 - Ray LaVaugn





I've worked closely with Worcester Investments through every aspect of acquisition. I have found WI and its members to be knowledgeable investors who are well equipped to handle all aspects of a real estate transaction. A purchaser of investment property is presented with a number of challenges during the course of a transaction. WI has met every challenge. Worcester Investments and its members are timely, efficient, knowledgeable and a pleasure to work with.
 - Robert Smejkal, Oregon State Bar





I have worked with Worcester Investments on a couple projects. They always paid on time and delivered exactly what was agreed upon. The Worcesters are known for their great integrity. I will gladly work with them again.
 - Kevin Pendergast, O’Riley Capital





We have worked with the Worcester family and Worcester Investments for over a year and closed multiple transactions together. They have always been very straight forward, accessible, and accommodating with the many information requests and questions that go along with processing a loan. Their knowledge of real estate, especially multi-family, is truly impressive. We welcome the opportunity to work with Worcester Investments for a long time to come!
 - John Schorgl & Tom Cohen, Johnson Capital





I want to take this opportunity to thank you for the business you with Nodaway Valley Bank. The loans we have with you have been maintained in an excellent manner. It is a big asset having Paul manage these investments for you and gives the bank the comfort level we need. I look forward to a long standing relationship.
 - Jerry Ingle, Nodaway Valley Bank





Paul and Joel were easy to work with and honest throughout the purchase process. We were able to close the transaction successfully. I look forward to working with them in the future.
 - Aaron Mesmer, Block LLC





It has been a pleasure conducting business with Worcester Investments, as they have remitted all payments on time and provided timely documentation for all necessary activities. I still maintain a singular business relationship with Worcester Investments, but would, without hesitation, discuss other business opportunities with them. I highly recommend Worcester Investments and I believe they represent the correct risk/reward opportunity.
 - Toby Ream, Imagine Investing





The Worcesters are a delight to work with and display exceptional wisdom in real estate investment. We can vouch for their integrity, honesty, and desire to serve more than be served. Most of our investments with WI earns interest that the firm pays in monthly installments, always on time. There is no other opportunity available that can match the returns WI offers and also gives us the sense of security that our funds are in safe hands.
 - Stuart & Christine Smith





I have been the Worcesters' accountant for several years. I have found them to be professional, competent and ethical in their business ventures. I would not hesitate to recommend their services to others.
 - Gerald Hoots, Hoots, Baker & Wiley PC





The Worcesters are humble, hardworking people who are continually bettering themselves. I am not surprised at the success they are experiencing. I highly recommend any potential business partners, lenders, etc. to work with the Worcesters.
 - Joe Isenberg, Brothers Cleaning





Worcester Investments has been a great partner and manager. The income our properties have produced has exceeded my expectations. They always follow through on their commitments, and they communicate very well. I consider them true professionals.

Home / Selling Your Property









Selling Your Property
Property owners can often benefit in the process of selling their properties by working directly with known, local, confidential buyers.




Selling directly to the buyer can often save significant time and money.
Brokerage fees add additional costs to the transaction. This can drastically increase the purchase price, which may deter qualified buyers. By removing the broker’s fees, the seller can save thousands.
 
Closing with a broker can often take several months.
Selling directly to the buyer allows for a much quicker closing period. Worcester Investments is an experienced, confidential, and qualified cash buyer with a proven track record of closing quickly.

Private Lending - Worcester Investments




 












































Worcester Investments








Home / Private Lending









Private Lending
Private lending offers higher returns on a consistent basis.




Most private loans are secured by a first mortgage and are personally guaranteed by the owner of the property.
Private lending is an alternative for individuals who are not able to meet the requirements, or time restraints, of a conventional lender. Private loans are usually secured by a first lien position of real estate and/or a personal guarantee from the borrower. There are many advantages to partnering with a private lending company. Private lending offers high returns on a more consistent basis than most investments.
 
The two primary factors in determining the risk of a private loan are the collateral (real estate or other asset securing the loan) and the borrower.
Evaluating risk for a private loan should be conducted when deciding if private lending is the best investment opportunity. The two key factors that should be analyzed are the collateral securing the loan and the borrower. A private lending company should secure a first mortgage lien position at a comfortable LTV (loan to value) typically 50-75%. They should also obtain a guarantee from a borrower with an acceptable credit.
