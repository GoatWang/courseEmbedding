Burt's Bees is an American personal care products company that markets its products internationally. The company is a subsidiary of Clorox that describes itself as an "Earth friendly, Natural Personal Care Company"[6] making products for personal care, health, beauty, and personal hygiene. As of 2007, they manufactured over 197 products for facial and body skin care, lip care, hair care, baby care, men's grooming, and outdoor remedies.[2] Since then, their products have been distributed in nearly 30,000 retail outlets including grocery stores and drug store chains across the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and New Zealand from their headquarters in Durham, North Carolina.[2][7]
Burt's Bees manufactures their products with natural ingredients[8] using minimal processing such as distillation/condensation, extraction/steamed distillation/pressure cooking, and hydrolysis to maintain the purity of those ingredients.[9] In addition, every product has a "natural bar" which gives a percentage of natural ingredients in that product, often with detailed ingredient descriptions.[10]
Originating in Maine in the 1980s, the business began when co-founder Roxanne Quimby started making candles from Burt Shavitz's leftover beeswax.[11] This eventually led to their bottling and selling of honey, a practice that slowly diminished as the company evolved as a corporation. Eventually, other products using honey and beeswax, including edible spreads and furniture polish, were sold, before a move into the personal care line.[citation needed] In late 2007, Clorox purchased Burt's Bees for $925 Million USD.[12]

History[edit]
1984–89: Founding[edit]




Burt's Bees Hand Salve, Sep 2012


Burt's Bees originated in Maine in 1984 as a candle making partnership between Roxanne Quimby and Burt Shavitz. Shavitz had a honey business which provided the excess beeswax needed for the candles and Quimby's focus on maintaining high quality helped to grow their business from an initial $200 at the Dover-Foxcroft Junior High School craft fair to $20,000 by the end of their first year. Their first headquarters was an abandoned one-room schoolhouse rented from a friend for $150 a year.[13]
Burt's Bees increased production in 1989 after a New York boutique, Zona, ordered hundreds of their beeswax candles. Forty additional employees were hired and an abandoned bowling alley became their new manufacturing location. During this time, Quimby read one of Burt Shavitz's 19th-century books about bee-keeping which included home-made personal care recipes and Burt's Bees entered into the personal care products industry.[13]
1990s: Incorporation and diversification[edit]
Burt's Bees became incorporated in 1991 and had a product offering including candles, natural soaps, perfumes, and eventually lip balm, which became their best-selling product. The lip balm comes in various flavors including beeswax and strawberry.
In 1993, Quimby threatened to sue Shavitz over personal issues and essentially forced Shavitz out of the company's operations. Increasing demand and product offerings necessitated a move from Maine headquarters to North Carolina where other personal care product manufacturers were also situated. Burt's Bees changed its focus to exclusively personal care products.[2]
In 1995, the company moved its manufacturing operations into an 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) former garment factory in Creedmoor, North Carolina. Although Burt's Bees continued to focus on the "home-made" product theme, automated machines, such as a former cafeteria mixer from Duke University, were introduced to increase production, . Chapel Hill was the site of the first Burt's Bees retail store, which offered 50 natural personal care products. Distribution and demand of products had also reached the Japanese market.[2]
In 1998, Burt's Bees was offering over 100 natural personal care products in 4,000 locations with sales in excess of $8 million. Distribution had reached national retailers such as Whole Foods Market and restaurants like Cracker Barrel. New product offerings branched into travel-sized skin care and hair care products.[2] In 1999, with increasing demand and an increase product offerings, including sugar and milk-based body lotions and bath products, Burt's Bees relocated to Durham among the many other enterprises located in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. An eCommerce website was launched allowing distribution in a much larger, nationwide scale.[2]
In 1999, Quimby bought out Shavitz's one-third stake in the company in exchange for a house in Maine, worth approximately $130,000.[14]
2000-06: New products and AEA[edit]




Burt's Bees Products, Sep 2012


See also: AEA Investors
In 2002 and 2003, Burt's Bees launched its first toothpaste, first shampoo, and successful Baby Bee product line of infant personal care products. The co-founder, Roxanne Quimby, also used company-earned profits to preserve 185,000 acres (750 km2) of forest land in Maine, marking the beginning of a relationship with The Nature Conservancy, an international organization engaged in environmental protection and conservation.[2]
In 2004, private equity firm, AEA Investors, purchased 80% of Burt's Bees for $173,000,000 US, with co-founder, Roxanne Quimby, retaining a 20% share and a seat on the board.[15] Upon seeking compensation from Quimby after the deal, Shavitz was paid $4 million.[14] In 2005, Douglas Haensel, a former GE executive, became Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Michael Indursky, a former Garnier and Unilever executive, joined Burt's Bees in July to head Burt's Bees marketing and public relations group.[16] In 2006, John Replogle, a former general manager of Unilever's skin care division, became the Chief Executive Officer and President, effective from January 19, 2006.[17]
2007–present: Clorox acquisition[edit]
See also: Clorox
As of 2007, they manufactured over 197 products for facial and body skin care, lip care, hair care, baby care, men's grooming, and outdoor remedies[2] distributed in nearly 30,000 retail outlets including grocery stores and drug store chains across the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and New Zealand from their headquarters in Durham, North Carolina.[2] In late 2007, Clorox acquired Burt's Bees for a reported sum of $925,000,000 USD.[12] The company subsequently released a statement to their customers.[18]
Replogle left Burt's Bees to become CEO and President of Seventh Generation Inc. in February 2011.[19] In 2011 Nick Vlahos, a 15-year veteran of The Clorox Company was named Vice President and General Manager of Burt's Bees, effective April 2011.[20] In 2013, Vlahos was promoted to Senior Vice President and Chief Customer Officer, and Craig Stevenson was named as the Vice President and General Manager of Burt's Bees. Stevenson, a 19-year veteran at Clorox, was previously the head of Clorox’s Professional Products Division.[4]
By February 2014, the Clorox Company had increased "advertising and sales promotion spending for Burt’s Bees, particularly for its lip care lines." At the time, "Burt’s Bees sales [were] outpacing volume due to price increases." [21] In August 2014, a documentary detailing the story between the two co-founders was released.[22] Co-founder Shavitz died in July 2015 at the age of 80, and was buried in Bangor, Maine. In his final years, he had lived on a 37-acre (15 ha) plot of land in Parkman, Maine.[23]

Excellent.The album mixes cleverly bossa nova, contemporary jazz with glorious, classic Burt Bacharach songbook. Has Carol Duboc got anything new to add to these tunes?  Yes. "Close To You" gets a rare bossa treatment and Duboc's phrasing is a subtle pleasure. "Walk On By", stripped down and taken slow, like everything here, features a beguiling jazzy break embroidered with silvery flute notes from legendary Hubert Laws.  You will never listen to Bacharach's songs sung in such a distinctive fashion as lyrical, refreshing and intense as on this one.  There is poise and polish here : the 'real' instrumentation is excellent and her sultry vocals interpretations are breathtaking.  This is dream, gently swaying and swinging, contemporary jazz music, which has an obvious understated allure all of its own.  Bacaharach will be proud of it.  For sure Ms. Duboc will live up to all expectations.  This is her best album yet!By jazzkat7 (New York, NY)

Item Description: Nova Science Publishers Inc. Hardback. Book Condition: new. BRAND NEW, Homelessness: Prevention, Strategies and Effectiveness, Martha R. Burt, Carol L. Pearson, Ann Elizabeth Montgomery, Homelessness prevention is an essential element of any effort to end homelessness either locally or nation-wide. To close the front door of entry into homelessness, the central challenge of prevention is targeting our efforts toward those people that will become homeless without the intervention. This book identifies elements of community homelessness prevention strategies that seem to lead to reductions in the number of people who otherwise would become homeless. The contributing elements include targeting through control of the eligibility screening process; developing community motivation; maximising mainstream and private resources; fostering leadership; and ensuring the availability and structure of data and information used to track progress, improve on prevention efforts, and facilitate outcome-based contracting. Evidence from the six communities studied indicates that those employing the most elements seem to be more successful at prevention and better able to document their achievements. This book also identifies four promising homelessness prevention activities that may be used alone or in combination as part of a coherent community-wide strategy: supportive services coupled with permanent housing, particularly when combined with effective discharge from institutions, especially mental hospitals; mediation in Housing Courts; cash assistance for rent or mortgage arrears; and rapid exit from shelter. This study provides insight into approaches that will help prevent homelessness. It is an important contribution to our understanding of how to help homeless Americans.
