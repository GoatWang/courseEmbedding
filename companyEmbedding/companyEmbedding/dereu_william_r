Potlatch Announces Appointment of William R. DeReu as Vice President, Land Sales and Development

 
SPOKANE, Wash., Apr 11, 2006 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Potlatch Corporation (NYSE:PCH) today announced that effective May 15, 2006, William R. DeReu, 39, will join Potlatch in the new position of Vice President, Land Sales and Development, reporting to President and Chief Executive Officer Michael J. Covey. 

Most recently, DeReu was Director, Land Asset Management Services, for Plum Creek Timber Co., Inc. In his new position with Potlatch, he will manage and direct the company's efforts to identify, market and develop higher and better use lands to maximize their value and returns to Potlatch stockholders, and to assess higher and better use land opportunities in future land acquisitions. He will be located in the company's Spokane headquarters office. 

Covey noted, "Bill brings nine years of real estate experience to his new role at Potlatch. During his career with Plum Creek in Montana and Wisconsin, Bill was instrumental in identifying, marketing and developing rural land with alternative values to timber production. He also negotiated conservation sales and easements with both private and public agencies. Importantly for Potlatch, Bill has experience working under the complex structure of a REIT and has extensive experience with 1031 land exchanges and the use of the internet as a marketing tool," Covey concluded. 

DeReu has a degree in Business Administration/Finance from the University of Montana and worked in commercial banking prior to beginning a career in real estate. 

Potlatch is a REIT with 1.5 million acres of forestland in Idaho, Minnesota, Arkansas and Oregon. Through a taxable subsidiary, the company also operates 13 manufacturing facilities that produce lumber and panel products and bleached pulp products, including paperboard and tissue products. 

his news release contains, in addition to historical information, certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's best estimates and assumptions regarding future events, and are therefore subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance. The company's actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. The company disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

                  Plum Creek is one of the largest landowners in the nation and the most geographically diverse, with approximately 6.4 million acres in major timber producing regions of the United States. We continually assess the value of the trees growing on our lands, the value of the natural resources (rocks, sand, minerals, oil and gas) that reside beneath the surface, and the value of the land itself. Our job, as stewards of these assets, is to maximize the value of each of them.

The company produces lumber, plywood and medium density fiberboard (MDF) in our wood products manufacturing facilities in the Northwest. Plum Creek also operates a real estate development business which is a taxable REIT subsidiary. Plum Creek employs more than 1,200 people across 19 states.

The company is committed to being the premier timberland company by demonstrating leadership and innovation in:

    Identifying opportunities for value growth from our assets.
    Practicing environmentally responsible resource stewardship.
    Achieving superior returns for our owners.
    Engaging with our communities on matters of common interest.
    Consistently providing quality products and services to our customers.
    Selecting business partners that share common values and beliefs.
    Fostering an ethical business culture that encourages ideas and initiative and rewards accomplishments. 

Plum Creek is also committed to high standards of corporate governance. This commitment is expressed in a variety of our charters and serves as the foundation of our corporate governance practices
