What Others Are Saying I think that the “Focus Fusion” approach of Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, Inc. should be funded as the science behind it is very interesting. Even if this approach does not succeed in producing fusion energy, the research will produce valuable technology in the near term.Bruno Coppi, Professor of Physics and Senior Fusion Researcher, MITThe experimental program that LPP plans to carry out has great potential to show how the plasma focus can be used to generate fusion energy and to demonstrate the feasibility of hydrogen-boron fusion.

   LPPFusion | Competing Technologies            Please click here if you are not redirected within a few seconds.    LPPFusionEmpowering The WorldCompeting TechnologiesYou are here:HomeFusion PowerCompeting TechnologiesNuclear Power – Fission Reactors Current nuclear reactors use uranium or plutonium fission to produce electricity. In fission, an atom will split apart into two smaller atoms and some high energy neutrons, which produce more fission reactions. There are many ways a radioactive atom can split apart into the two smaller atoms, called reaction products. But these reaction products all have one thing in common: they are all radioactive. There has been no viable solution as to what to do with this radioactive waste, some of which will be radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years or more. Another danger comes from the high-energy neutrons. These neutrons slam into whatever is in their path. This creates heat, which in a nuclear power plant is used to boil water to run a steam-powered generator. However, heat is not the only thing neutrons produce. A neutron can enter the nucleus of a non-radioactive atom and make it radioactive. So fission power plants have three problems with radioactivity:The fuel is radioactive.The reaction products are radioactive.The high-energy neutrons can take ordinary materials in the reactor building and make them radioactive. Of course, the same technology that is used to make reactor fuel can also make the more purified fuel of atomic weapons. Finally, nuclear reactors generate electricity by the same method that Edison developed—steam turbines. This means that fission reactors can never be extremely cheap, since most of the cost is in the energy conversion system. Deuterium-Tritium Fusion with Tokamaks Nuclear fusion has the potential to generate power without the radioactive waste of nuclear fission. But most fusion research today is focused on fusing deuterium and tritium using tokamaks, which are large, highly-complex devices. When deuterium and tritium are heated to sufficiently high temperatures (about 300 million degrees), they fuse, producing helium and high energy neutrons. These neutrons create heat and radioactive materials just as in a fission reactor. Deuterium and helium are not radioactive and occur in nature. Tritium, however, is radioactive and does not occur in nature. It must be created in the reactor by using neutrons. So deuterium-tritium fusion still has two of the disadvantages of nuclear fission: The high-energy neutrons can take ordinary materials in the reactor building and make them radioactiveSome of the fuel—tritium—is radioactive.In addition, tokamaks are by their nature very large, expensive and complex devices, using powerful magnets to keep the hot plasma in place. It is not at all clear that they could ever produce net energy, but if they did, it would be more expensive than that produced in fission reactors, since the steam conversion would be the same, and the energy producing core would be more expensive. Comparison with Focus Fusion In contrast, Focus Fusion reactors using the plasma focus device and hydrogen-boron fuel would produce almost no neutrons at all and no radioactivity induced in the structure. The energy comes out as a beam of charged particles, helium nuclei or alpha particles, which can be converted directly into electricity, making the reactors compact and cheap.MenuJoin An EventCrowdfundGet InvolvedDiscussVolunteerShop FusionDonateNews Archives Search News Archives Search Select Month July 2017  (1) May 2017  (2) April 2017  (6) March 2017  (4) December 2016  (5) November 2016  (2) October 2016  (3) September 2016  (1) August 2016  (3) July 2016  (1) June 2016  (3) May 2016  (6) April 2016  (6) February 2016  (1) January 2016  (5) December 2015  (3) November 2015  (3) October 2015  (2) August 2015  (6) July 2015  (4) May 2015  (5) April 2015  (4) March 2015  (1) February 2015  (2) January 2015  (1) December 2014  (6) November 2014  (2) October 2014  (6) September 2014  (4) August 2014  (1) July 2014  (9) June 2014  (3) May 2014  (6) April 2014  (12) March 2014  (21) February 2014  (19) January 2014  (7) December 2013  (3) November 2013  (5) October 2013  (8) September 2013  (2) August 2013  (7) May 2013  (1) March 2013  (4) February 2013  (2) January 2013  (2) December 2012  (4) November 2012  (4) October 2012  (2) September 2012  (1) August 2012  (2) July 2012  (2) June 2012  (1) May 2012  (5) April 2012  (5) March 2012  (8) February 2012  (4) January 2012  (1) December 2011  (2) November 2011  (3) October 2011  (2) September 2011  (2) August 2011  (4) July 2011  (1) June 2011  (3) May 2011  (3) April 2011  (3) March 2011  (5) February 2011  (3) January 2011  (2) December 2010  (1) November 2010  (1) October 2010  (1) September 2010  (1) June 2010  (1) May 2010  (1) April 2010  (2) March 2010  (1) February 2010  (2) January 2010  (1) November 2009  (2) October 2009  (2) September 2009  (2) June 2009  (1) February 2009  (1) December 2008  (1) May 2008  (1) February 2007  (1) February 2004  (1) Copyright © 2017 LPPFusion

LPPFusionEmpowering The WorldX-ScanYou are here:HomeX-ScanX-Scan: Giving highway departments “X-ray vision” LPPFusion has developed the technology for a portable, economical, extremely intense hard X-ray source using a dense plasma focus (DPF) device. Such a source, transportable by truck, will allow economical non-destructive inspection of the nation’s critical infrastructure, leading to savings in repair costs of at least five billion dollars annually. This technology is ready for mass production and we are currently looking to sell out to the highest bidder. A source with the power, photon energy and adjustability developed in this project will allow the use of Compton scattering, in which the X-rays are scattered off the material being probed and return to a detector on the same side of the object as the source. Compton scattering requires far higher X-ray power than does direct X-ray scanning, in which the detector is on the opposite side of the structure from the source, but has the great advantage that scanning can be done from one side. Such one-side scanning will greatly reduce the cost and time of inspections, making possible the timely preventive maintenance of infrastructure such as bridges, roads and buildings. The X-ray source technology is being developed as a “spin-off” of our medium-term research into the use of the DPF device as a source for nuclear waste free nuclear fusion energy. Essentially the same technology can produce both useful clean energy and extremely intense X-ray pulses. In February 2011, LPPF achieved a major milestone by measuring sufficient X-ray energy to show that our X-Scan product is technically feasible.MenuJoin An EventCrowdfundGet InvolvedDiscussVolunteerShop FusionDonateNews Archives Search News Archives Search Select Month July 2017  (1) May 2017  (2) April 2017  (6) March 2017  (4) December 2016  (5) November 2016  (2) October 2016  (3) September 2016  (1) August 2016  (3) July 2016  (1) June 2016  (3) May 2016  (6) April 2016  (6) February 2016  (1) January 2016  (5) December 2015  (3) November 2015  (3) October 2015  (2) August 2015  (6) July 2015  (4) May 2015  (5) April 2015  (4) March 2015  (1) February 2015  (2) January 2015  (1) December 2014  (6) November 2014  (2) October 2014  (6) September 2014  (4) August 2014  (1) July 2014  (9) June 2014  (3) May 2014  (6) April 2014  (12) March 2014  (21) February 2014  (19) January 2014  (7) December 2013  (3) November 2013  (5) October 2013  (8) September 2013  (2) August 2013  (7) May 2013  (1) March 2013  (4) February 2013  (2) January 2013  (2) December 2012  (4) November 2012  (4) October 2012  (2) September 2012  (1) August 2012  (2) July 2012  (2) June 2012  (1) May 2012  (5) April 2012  (5) March 2012  (8) February 2012  (4) January 2012  (1) December 2011  (2) November 2011  (3) October 2011  (2) September 2011  (2) August 2011  (4) July 2011  (1) June 2011  (3) May 2011  (3) April 2011  (3) March 2011  (5) February 2011  (3) January 2011  (2) December 2010  (1) November 2010  (1) October 2010  (1) September 2010  (1) June 2010  (1) May 2010  (1) April 2010  (2) March 2010  (1) February 2010  (2) January 2010  (1) November 2009  (2) October 2009  (2) September 2009  (2) June 2009  (1) February 2009  (1) December 2008  (1) May 2008  (1) February 2007  (1) February 2004  (1) Copyright © 2017 LPPFusion

   LPPFusion | Executive Summary            Please click here if you are not redirected within a few seconds.    LPPFusionEmpowering The WorldExecutive SummaryYou are here:HomeExecutive SummaryLawrenceville Plasma Physics, Inc. (DBA LPPFusion) is researching an innovative approach to nuclear fusion. Our approach differs from others in the following ways: SMALL INEXPENSIVE MACHINERY Conventional fusion approaches use huge, expensive machinery (magnets or lasers) to compress hot gas (plasma) enough to fuse the atomic nuclei and release energy. We use Nature to achieve this. Our device, called a Dense Plasma Focus (DPF), creates a magnetic bottle that compresses itself, due to natural instabilities of plasma. Our DPF harnesses these instabilities instead of fighting them. It fits in a small room, and could be mass-produced and sold for $1 – 2M. NO RADIOACTIVE WASTE Conventional approaches are fueled with deuterium and radioactive tritium. Their fusion produces high-energy neutrons, which gradually destroy machinery and turn it radioactive. Our fusion fuel is abundant hydrogen and boron, which produces no high-energy neutrons (aneutronic fusion). Our DPF can never melt down, never pollute the environment, and requires no costly containment structure or radioactive waste disposal. DIRECT GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY Conventional approaches produce heat that drives steam turbines to generate electricity. Our approach avoids this costly process. Most energy is produced as a beam of nontoxic helium ions, which directly generates electricity in a form of high-tech step-down transformer. No steam turbines are required. While innovative, our approach is based on proven laws of classical and quantum physics, unlike “cold fusion” claims. Our research is published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. In March 2012, the leading journal of its field, Physics of Plasmas, published our paper describing proof that we achieved two of the three conditions required to fuse hydrogen-boron and produce net energy (more released than put in). The first condition is plasma temperature of 1.6 billion degrees C. We achieved 1.8 billion, which is the hottest ever reported for a fusion fuel, and hotter than the core of the sun. The other conditions are sufficient confinement time, which we also achieved, and sufficient plasma density, which we expect to achieve soon. We expect this because our mathematical model of the DPF is derived from physical laws, not mere trial-and-error. The model led us to design improvements that we patented in the U.S. (#7,482,607) and other nations (some pending). The model has been confirmed by years of experiments, and it predicts that design improvements we are now implementing will produce the breakthrough or net fusion energy, sought around the world for 60 years. In November 2013, our approach was evaluated by an independent committee of senior fusion scientists, chaired by a former director of U.S. fusion research. Their conclusion: “…the LPP DPF approach to fusion power has considerable merit and that a much higher level of investment is warranted, based on their considerable progress to date.” We seek $2.5M from accredited or otherwise qualified investors, in addition to $5M already raised for our current research phase. With this funding, we expect to demonstrate net fusion energy from hydrogen-boron fuel in 12-18 months. Then we plan a 3-4 year engineering phase, leading to the nonexclusive licensing of our technology to large manufacturers. Our 5-megawatt fusion generators are projected to cut the cost of electricity by over 90%, due to their small size, low capital and fuel costs, clean operation, and direct generation of electricity. Each generator will power approximately 3,500 homes, or mobile applications such as ships, trains, or electric planes. We project this could cut global CO2 emissions by up to 10 gigatons per year by 2030, soon enough to prevent the worst effects of climate change.MenuJoin An EventCrowdfundGet InvolvedDiscussVolunteerShop FusionDonateNews Archives Search News Archives Search Select Month July 2017  (1) May 2017  (2) April 2017  (6) March 2017  (4) December 2016  (5) November 2016  (2) October 2016  (3) September 2016  (1) August 2016  (3) July 2016  (1) June 2016  (3) May 2016  (6) April 2016  (6) February 2016  (1) January 2016  (5) December 2015  (3) November 2015  (3) October 2015  (2) August 2015  (6) July 2015  (4) May 2015  (5) April 2015  (4) March 2015  (1) February 2015  (2) January 2015  (1) December 2014  (6) November 2014  (2) October 2014  (6) September 2014  (4) August 2014  (1) July 2014  (9) June 2014  (3) May 2014  (6) April 2014  (12) March 2014  (21) February 2014  (19) January 2014  (7) December 2013  (3) November 2013  (5) October 2013  (8) September 2013  (2) August 2013  (7) May 2013  (1) March 2013  (4) February 2013  (2) January 2013  (2) December 2012  (4) November 2012  (4) October 2012  (2) September 2012  (1) August 2012  (2) July 2012  (2) June 2012  (1) May 2012  (5) April 2012  (5) March 2012  (8) February 2012  (4) January 2012  (1) December 2011  (2) November 2011  (3) October 2011  (2) September 2011  (2) August 2011  (4) July 2011  (1) June 2011  (3) May 2011  (3) April 2011  (3) March 2011  (5) February 2011  (3) January 2011  (2) December 2010  (1) November 2010  (1) October 2010  (1) September 2010  (1) June 2010  (1) May 2010  (1) April 2010  (2) March 2010  (1) February 2010  (2) January 2010  (1) November 2009  (2) October 2009  (2) September 2009  (2) June 2009  (1) February 2009  (1) December 2008  (1) May 2008  (1) February 2007  (1) February 2004  (1) Copyright © 2017 LPPFusion

Eric J. Lerner (born May 31, 1947) is an American popular science writer, and independent plasma researcher.[2] He wrote the 1991 book The Big Bang Never Happened, which advocates Hannes Alfvén's plasma cosmology instead of the Big Bang theory. He is founder, president, and chief scientist of Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, Inc.[3][4]

Professional work[edit]
Lerner received a BA in physics from Columbia University[5] and started as a graduate student in physics at the University of Maryland, but left after a year due to his dissatisfaction with the mathematical rather than experimental approach there.[6][7] He then pursued a career in popular science writing.
In 1984, he began studying plasma phenomena and laboratory fusion devices, performing experimental work on a machine called a dense plasma focus (DPF). NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has funded mainstream as well as alternative approaches to fusion, and between 1994 and 2001 NASA provided a grant to Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, the company of which Lerner was the only employee, to explore whether Lerner's alternative approach to fusion might be useful to propel spacecraft; a 2007 New York Times article noted that Lerner had not received funding from the US Department of Energy.[8][9] He believes that a dense plasma focus can also be used to produce useful aneutronic fusion energy.[10][11] Lerner explained his "Focus Fusion" approach in a 2007 Google Tech Talk.[12] On November 14, 2008, Lerner received funding for continued research, to test the scientific feasibility of Focus Fusion.[13] On January 28, 2011, LPP published preliminary results.[14] In March, 2012, the company published a paper saying that it had achieved temperatures of 1.8 billion degrees, beating the old record of 1.1 billion that had survived since 1978.[15][16] One independent expert stated that they were not close to a commercial fusion reactor with this device.[17] In 2012 the company announced a collaboration with a lab at the Islamic Azad University Central Tehran Branch in Iran.[18]
Lerner is also an active general science writer, estimating that he has had about 600 articles published.[3] He has received journalism awards between 1984 and 1993 from the Aviation Space Writers Association. In 2006 he was a Visiting Scientist at the European Southern Observatory in Chile.[19]
The Big Bang Never Happened[edit]
The Big Bang Never Happened: A Startling Refutation of the Dominant Theory of the Origin of the Universe (1991) is Lerner's controversial book which rejects mainstream Big Bang cosmology, and instead advances a non-standard plasma cosmology originally proposed by Hannes Alfvén in the 1960s. The book appeared at a time when results from the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite were of some concern to astrophysicists who expected to see cosmic microwave background anisotropies but instead measured a blackbody spectrum with little variation across the sky. Lerner referred to this as evidence that the Big Bang was a failed paradigm. He also denigrated the observational evidence for dark matter and recounted a well known cosmological feature that superclusters are larger than the largest structures that could have formed through gravitational collapse in the age of the universe.[6]
As an alternative to the Big Bang, Lerner adopted Alfvén's model of plasma cosmology that relied on plasma physics to explain most, if not all, cosmological observations by appealing to electromagnetic forces.[6] Adopting an eternal universe,[20] Lerner's explanation of cosmological evolution relied on a model of thermodynamics based on the work of the Nobel Chemistry prize winner Ilya Prigogine under which order emerges from chaos.[6][21] This is in apparent defiance of the second law of thermodynamics. As a way of partially acknowledging this, Lerner asserts that away from equilibrium order can spontaneously form by taking advantage of energy flows, as argued more recently by Eric Chaisson, an American astrophysicist.[22]
Lerner's ideas have been rejected by the professional physicists and cosmologists who have reviewed them. In these critiques, critics have explained that, contrary to Lerner's assertions, the size of superclusters is a feature limited by subsequent observations to the end of greatness and is consistent with having arisen from a power spectrum of density fluctuations growing from the quantum fluctuations predicted in inflationary models.[23][24][25] Anisotropies were discovered in subsequent analysis of the both COBE and BOOMERanG experiments and were more fully characterized by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe[23][24] and Planck.
Physical cosmologists who have commented on the book have generally dismissed it.[23][25][26][27][28][29] In particular, Edward L. Wright, the American astrophysicist and cosmologist, was critical of Lerner for making errors of fact and interpretation and criticized specifics of Lerner's alternative cosmology,[24] making the following critiques:

Lerner's alternative model for Hubble's Law is dynamically unstable
the number density of distant radio sources falsifies Lerner's explanation for the cosmic microwave background
Lerner's explanation that the helium abundance is due to stellar nucleosynthesis fails because of the small observed abundance of heavier elements

Lerner has disputed Wright's critique.[30]
Activism[edit]
While at Columbia, Lerner participated in the 1965 Selma March[31] and helped organize the 1968 Columbia Student Strike.[32][33]
In the 1970s, Lerner became involved in the National Caucus of Labor Committees, an offshoot of the Columbia University Students for a Democratic Society. Lerner left the National Caucus in 1978, later stating in a lawsuit that he had resisted pressure from the U.S. Labor Party, an organization led by Lyndon LaRouche, to violate election law by channeling profits of an engineering firm to the organization.[34][35]
More recently, Lerner sought civil rights protection for immigrants as a member and spokesman for the New Jersey Civil Rights Defense Committee.[36][37] He participated in the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011,[38] with socialist movement.[39]

Lerner is also an active general science writer, estimating that he has had about 600 articles published.[3] He has received journalism awards between 1984 and 1993 from the Aviation Space Writers Association. In 2006 he was a Visiting Scientist at the European Southern Observatory in Chile.[19]
The Big Bang Never Happened[edit]
The Big Bang Never Happened: A Startling Refutation of the Dominant Theory of the Origin of the Universe (1991) is Lerner's controversial book which rejects mainstream Big Bang cosmology, and instead advances a non-standard plasma cosmology originally proposed by Hannes Alfvén in the 1960s. The book appeared at a time when results from the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite were of some concern to astrophysicists who expected to see cosmic microwave background anisotropies but instead measured a blackbody spectrum with little variation across the sky. Lerner referred to this as evidence that the Big Bang was a failed paradigm. He also denigrated the observational evidence for dark matter and recounted a well known cosmological feature that superclusters are larger than the largest structures that could have formed through gravitational collapse in the age of the universe.[6]
As an alternative to the Big Bang, Lerner adopted Alfvén's model of plasma cosmology that relied on plasma physics to explain most, if not all, cosmological observations by appealing to electromagnetic forces.[6] Adopting an eternal universe,[20] Lerner's explanation of cosmological evolution relied on a model of thermodynamics based on the work of the Nobel Chemistry prize winner Ilya Prigogine under which order emerges from chaos.[6][21] This is in apparent defiance of the second law of thermodynamics. As a way of partially acknowledging this, Lerner asserts that away from equilibrium order can spontaneously form by taking advantage of energy flows, as argued more recently by Eric Chaisson, an American astrophysicist.[22]
Lerner's ideas have been rejected by the professional physicists and cosmologists who have reviewed them. In these critiques, critics have explained that, contrary to Lerner's assertions, the size of superclusters is a feature limited by subsequent observations to the end of greatness and is consistent with having arisen from a power spectrum of density fluctuations growing from the quantum fluctuations predicted in inflationary models.[23][24][25] Anisotropies were discovered in subsequent analysis of the both COBE and BOOMERanG experiments and were more fully characterized by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe[23][24] and Planck.
Physical cosmologists who have commented on the book have generally dismissed it.[23][25][26][27][28][29] In particular, Edward L. Wright, the American astrophysicist and cosmologist, was critical of Lerner for making errors of fact and interpretation and criticized specifics of Lerner's alternative cosmology,[24] making the following critiques:

Lerner's alternative model for Hubble's Law is dynamically unstable
the number density of distant radio sources falsifies Lerner's explanation for the cosmic microwave background
Lerner's explanation that the helium abundance is due to stellar nucleosynthesis fails because of the small observed abundance of heavier elements

Lerner has disputed Wright's critique.[30]
Activism[edit]
While at Columbia, Lerner participated in the 1965 Selma March[31] and helped organize the 1968 Columbia Student Strike.[32][33]
In the 1970s, Lerner became involved in the National Caucus of Labor Committees, an offshoot of the Columbia University Students for a Democratic Society. Lerner left the National Caucus in 1978, later stating in a lawsuit that he had resisted pressure from the U.S. Labor Party, an organization led by Lyndon LaRouche, to violate election law by channeling profits of an engineering firm to the organization.[34][35]
More recently, Lerner sought civil rights protection for immigrants as a member and spokesman for the New Jersey Civil Rights Defense Committee.[36][37] He participated in the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011,[38] with socialist movement.[39]

More recently, Lerner sought civil rights protection for immigrants as a member and spokesman for the New Jersey Civil Rights Defense Committee.[36][37] He participated in the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011,[38] with socialist movement.[39]

Eric is knowledgeable, committed and out of the box when it comes to his approaches to problem solving and everyone was very welcoming of me. My ideas were heard and listened to whenever they held solid merit and the progress that was made during my time there was great. For a company that is not even listed on the Fusion Science projects list under the Department of Energy every idea and plan of attack is well thought out and always verified with a specialist in the field to ensure steps are taken properly. As part of my fellowship my senior year I research several renewable energy sources and several renewable energy research projects focused on fusion research and I honestly can say that I wouldn't be surprised if LPP Fusion, Inc. is a name that becomes more well known in the coming years. 展开James Ray · 2016年7月29日I researched LPPFusion quite a bit, including reading through their private placement memorandum and reading through their first paper. I think the technology h...as potential, but I would be skeptical about investing more than 5% (or even 2%, with one's total investments not risking more than one is prepared to lose) of one's capital as there is no guarantee that it will work, and their claim that it can have a levelised cost of electricity of 0.1 US cents is a tall one, considering that they have not even achieved net energy production yet.  The dense plasma focus may not have yields that are higher than the scaling law, despite Lerner's hypothesis that the DPF can have similar pinching phenomena as that which occurs in quasars. Even if they overcome their current issues with impurities in the vacuum chamber, if they can't achieve yields that scale much more than the current scaling law of DPF's (which they haven't), then it would require a larger reactor than what they predict, even the size of ITER or a tokamak. Then again, even if a very large reactor is required, the electricity generation could be converted directly from a beam of charged particles rather than via a significantly more expensive steam turbine. On the other hand, if a large reactor is required, the disadvantage of that is that centralised energy generally has more drawbacks than distributed energy, e.g. more network augmentation required, less ability for end users of electricity to be empowered (pun intended) and decentralised energy trading is not available. 展开Steven Marsh · 2015年9月28日I think this is a valid path for Scientific inquiry because I have personally used Plasma to vaporize steel! Also, I think that for Humans to be able to move on... from an economic system that rewards the domination of resources and exploitation of political systems, that we desperately need an energy system like this.  If it works, then great, if it doesn't then we will have learned a great deal from this and the other experimental approaches being tried, and we must try them all.  In the meantime, there are lots of awesome investment opportunities in Shared/Public Transit and existing renewable energy technologies that we must (and are) pursuing, so despite the disconcerting nature of the changes that we are experiencing, the future is bright indeed.  To me, the single most important thing that I look forward to, is the possibility that, at last, we will have achieved an economic system that rewards innovation instead of exploitation. 展开Max Casa · 2015年9月2日They will bring humanity peace, life and prosperity in the near future. Abundant source of energy, this is not an empty promise, this is inevitable.全部帖子Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, Inc. 上传了 7 张新照片 — 觉得充满力量 · 7月18日 04:57 · Our new little beast with the NVIIDIA Quadro M5000 graphic card had arrived!

   Focus Fusion: Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, Inc. - Revolution-Green         Select Page   Focus Fusion: Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, Inc. by mark dansie | Oct 19, 2013 | Clean Energy, Clean Nuclear | 5 comments Purify Water with Plasma New Battery 5x Existing Lithiun-ion Technology Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, Inc. is a high-tech research and development corp specializing in applications of plasma physics, including fusion power and intense X-rayI am way out of my level of competence reporting on this so will be relying on the feedback from our readers. Many thanks to Andy Spreadbury for bringing this to our attention. I am mainly drawing from there website for information: http://www.lawrencevilleplasmaphysics.com/. The claims made in this article are their own and being reported as information only. I look forward to everyone’s take on this.Lawrenceville Plasma Physics (LPP) objective is  the development of an ecologicaly safe fusion energy generator using a device called the dense plasma focus (DPF) and hydrogen-boron fuel. We call this “Focus Fusion”. This work was initially funded by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and is now backed by over forty private investors including the Abell Foundation of Baltimore.  LPP’s patented technology and peer-reviewed science are guiding the design of this technology for this virutally unlimited source of clean energy that can be significantly cheaper than any other energy sources currently in use.Unlike zero-point energy and cold fusion, which are based on new physical theories, or at least new interpretations of exiting theories, aneutronic fusion with a (dense) plasma focus device, which we call Focus Fusion, is based on an original application of very well-confirmed scientific theories such as electromagnetism and quantum mechanics. No “new physical theories” are invoked. Indeed we are utilizing natural phenomena that have been observed at much large scales in the universe– in solar flares, for example.Video[youtube 49p0cZEisTA]How is Focus Fusion Different?In current nuclear reactors, energy is produced through nuclear fission. Here, a neutron breaks apart a uranium nucleus releasing energy and more high-energy neutrons. The nuclear fragments produced are highly radioactive. They naturally decay and give off their own energetic radiation. In addition, the neutrons smash into the nuclei of atoms in the reactor structure, transmuting them to radioactive nuclei as well. All of these radioactive atoms constitute nuclear waste.The form of nuclear fusion that the US government has funded, which uses deuterium and tritium as fuel, also produces some radioactive waste, although far less than fission. Tritium, a form of hydrogen with two additional neutrons, is itself radioactive. When deuterium and tritium nuclei fuse together they produce nucleus of harmless and non-radioactive helium and a neutron. But the high energy neutron that carries most of the energy of the reaction can again smash into the reactor’s structure making it radioactive.In Focus Fusion, however, none of this occurs. The fuel that will be used consists of hydrogen and boron. Both are harmless, non-radioactive substances. When hydrogen nuclei (protons) and boron nuclei fuse together at extremely high temperatures, they produce only helium nuclei and no neutrons.A secondary reaction occurs when some helium nuclei fuse with boron nuclei, which does produce some neutrons. But these reactions are rare, and only 1/500th of the energy is emitted in the form of neutrons. More important, none of these neutrons have enough energy to transform the materials they hit into long-lived radioactive materials. So no such radioactive materials are produced in the reactor structure. Hydrogen-boron reactors would be free of long-lived radioactivity, and the small number of neutrons emitted could easily be absorbed in several inches of shielding.Focus Fusion reactors are so safe that anyone could safely enter the reactor room seconds after it had been turned off, even if it had previously been functioning for a yearProgress to DateBrief History of LPP’s Focus Fusion Development Timelines While the Dense Plasma Focus device (referred to as DPF or PF) has existed for 40 years, progress with the DPF has been impeded mainly by a lack of good quantitative theoretical models of the tiny plasmoid, where the fusion reactions take place. There are too many parameters in the DPF device to allow progress on a purely empirical basis:  the anode and cathode radii, electrode length, shape of the anode and especially anode tip, length of insulator, charging voltage, fill pressure, fill gas, and so on. Without a good theory, DPF research is like wandering in a six-dimensional desert looking for small oases. This means that there has been until recently, apart from our own work, no good way of predicting in advance the size, density, magnetic field and ion and electron energies of the plasmoids (ultra-dense, self-confined blobs of plasma) in the DPF, given initial conditions.Lawrenceville Plasma Physics (or LPP for short), beginning in the 1980’s, developed a detailed quantitative theory of DPF device operation, which has been successfully tested against experiments that we performed in collaboration with the University of Illinois in 1994 and with Texas A&M University in 2001. This theory, including important refinements that include magnetic effects gives us the ability, unique among DPF groups, to show in advance that hydrogen-boron fusion is feasible. Now, in the past two years, other DPF groups are working along closer lines making collaboration feasible and speeding research.2001 – A small team of physicists led by Lerner achieved temperatures above one billion degrees in a plasma focus device, high enough for hydrogen-boron reactions.  This breakthrough, reported at an international scientific conference in May 2002, took place at Texas A&M University and was funded by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.2003 – LPP was incorporated.  Lerner presented new theoretical analysis at the prestigious 5th Symposium on Current Trends in International Fusion Research in Washington DC, showing that the magnetic field effect could greatly reduce the cooling of hydrogen-boron plasma by X-ray emission, and make the production of net energy far easier.  The presentation was favorably received by some of the top fusion experts in the world.2004 – LPP completed a preliminary simulation of plasmoids that burned proton-boron (pB11) fuel.  The simulation results confirmed that net energy production is possible with a small Focus Fusion device.2006 – LPP submitted a patent application to the US Patent Office.  The patent application, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Producing X-rays, Ion Beams and Nuclear Fusion Energy”, covers the use of high magnetic fields (the quantum magnetic field effect) in the production of fusion energy, the injection of angular momentum into the plasma sheath, and a new method of converting X-ray energy into electricity. 2007 – Eric Lerner presented Focus Fusion at Google TechTalks, raising public awareness of our work. LPP began to develop a sophisticated computer simulation aimed at understanding the formation of the plasmoids in the dense plasma focus reactor in detail. This work is being carried out in collaboration with Dr. John Guillory, Professor Emeritus at George Mason University, and Dr. David Rose of Voss Scientific, Inc.2008 – LPP initiated its planned two-year experiment after receiving $1.2 million from private investors and The Abell Foundation.2009:US Patent office issued Patent 7,482,607, “Method and apparatus for producing X-rays, ion beams and nuclear fusion energy,” to Eric J. Lerner and Aaron Blake, with the assignment of the patent to Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, Inc.LPP moved into its new office where the equipment was assembled.Eric Lerner and the research team finished assembling “Focus Fusion-1” DPF device and began experiments.  (We use a FF-1 nickname for short of Focus Fusion-1)2010 Annual summaryLPP’s research team demonstrated repeatable firing with ion temperatures over 100 keV. The troublesome switching system            was redesigned and upgraded to handle many more shots at higher energies.2011 Annual summaryDemonstrating the continuation of I5 power scaling of the fusion yield—that is, showing that fusion energy per shot continues to increase with the fifth power of the peak current, as predicted by our theory.Record (for FF-1) fusion yield (ibid) of 150 billion neutrons.Improvement of repeatability of fusion yield 1st to within 15%, then to within 3%.Fusion yield at the highest pressures (over 40 torr) for any dense plasma focus device.Demonstrating the technical feasibility of the X-scan spin-off inspection technology by showing high X-ray transmission through 6 inches of metal.These achievements were made possible by several technical advances:Synchronous and reliable operation of the new switch design deployed August 2011.Reliable functioning of FF-1 above 40 kV and initial shots at 45 kV (full voltage).Improvement in the symmetry of the electrodes.2012 Annual Summary LPP published in a leading peer-reviewed journal, Physics of Plasmas, our achievement of two out of the three conditions needed to produce net energy: a record-high temperature and the required confinement time of the hot plasma.LPP demonstrated that our approach is, by far, the leader in the effort to achieve aneutronic or radioactive-waste-free  fusion, the only known route to ecologically clean, cheap, bio-safe, and unlimited energy.LPP eliminated arcing problems in the FF-1 fusion device that were blocking progress; it developed and used simulations to improve the FF-1 fusion device design, and acquired a greater theoretical understanding of FF-1’s 1.8 billion- degree temperatures.We initiated collaboration with the Plasma Physics Research Center in Iran, established closer collegial links with Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, and set up collaboration with Japanese simulation scientists. These collaborations will help substantially in accomplishing our goals in 2013.Publications and Peer Reviews May, 2012, with the publication in the Journal of Fusion Energy of a paper by S. Abolhasani, M. Habibi, and R. Amrollahi,     “Analytical Study of Quantum Magnetic and Ion Viscous Effects on p11B Fusion in Plasma Focus Devices”. The paper studied in greater detail the “quantum magnetic field effect” we discussed in our Journal of Fusion Energy paper in 2011, citing our work and for the first time independently confirming our calculations showing that ignition and net energy gain can be achieved with pB11 (hydrogen-boron) fuel, the key to obtaining aneutronic fusion energy. “According to the results of this paper”,  they concluded, ” it could be said that p11B fuelled plasma focus device is a clean and efficient source of energy.”December, 2012 issue of IEEE Transaction on Plasma Science, M. Krishnan, in a broad survey of the plasma focus field, cited the use of a smaller anode to obtain higher fusion yield. “The recent work of Lerner et al[our JOFE paper] used a smaller anode at much higher pressure, and so, it is no surprise that his neutron outputs are higher than those measured on PF-1000[the world’s most powerful plasma focus device in Warsaw].”A new paper, in Physics of Plasma, has been cited by P. Kubes et al in Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion as an example of observations of high magnetic fields.  Purify Water with Plasma New Battery 5x Existing Lithiun-ion Technology        Ken Rasmussen Interesting how those who once had funding, but now lost it quickly jump on the “suppression claim” just as those who never found any money do too.  Could it be that Catherine Austin Fitts was correct that the entire system is a conspiracy and anyone who just loses former funding should really be thankful they still have their lives?  Anyone who has actually faced the business end of a Glock or AK47 (I know 2) would gladly settle for funding loss over the next level of suppression. While I continue my own soap box of wanting to see more R&D money to small guys with good ideas, the academics who burn up millions with nothing to show for it need to show some responsibility too. If they got major money, yet delivered nothing, maybe they should admit it was just a bad idea, not worth chasing too.  alpcns . A very interesting technology indeed. I’ve been following these guys for a while, and I think it looks promising, especially since hydrogen and boron are both harmless and no (serious) harmful radiation is produced. The fact that one can safely enter the reactor seconds after it has been turned off is extremely impressive. I think it looks promising, but I’m no expert in this field.  Bob Norman I think this approach makes way more sense than the big ITER approach. I think it will eventually produce energy, but I’m skeptical the efficiencies will make it viable. I think the whole hot fusion efforts will eventually die, if for no other reason than the Grid went away and a big power generator is no longer relevant in a world dominated by wind, solar and whatever else comes.  TR M Once storage is figured out (batteries or ultracaps) and cheep then the intermittent sources become a lot more viable. I conserve with the best of them but the majority of my utility bills are connection fees etc. You only really get a killer payback when you are off grid.  mark dansie That is the truth that many people are starting to realize mark    Subscribe for Weekly NewsletterRegister for Updates!

LPPFusionEmpowering The WorldTeamYou are here:HomeTeamEric Lerner, President and Chief Scientist, has been active in dense plasma focus (DPF) research for 30 years. Beginning in 1984, he developed a detailed quantitative theory of the functioning of DPF. Based on this theory, he proposed that the DPF could achieve high ion and electron energies at high densities, suitable for advanced fuel fusion and space propulsion. Under a series of contracts with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he planned and participated in carrying out experiments that tested and confirmed this theory. In addition, he developed an original model of the role of the quantum magnetic field effect on DPF functioning, showing that this effect could have a large effect on increasing ion temperature and decreasing electron temperature, which would reduce unwanted X-ray cooling of the plasma. Eric can be reached at Eric@lppfusion.com Dr. Syed Hassan, Research Physicist, is a plasma physicist with more than 20 years experience with the dense plasma focus device. Dr. Hassan began working with the DPF at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, Pakistan and continued at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, where he received his PhD. From 2007 to 2010, as a Marie Curie Fellow, he performed experiments with plasma focus devices he had constructed for the Technological Educational Institute of Crete, Greece. Most recently he was a Research Associate at the School of Nuclear Engineering, Purdue University. He has both designed plasma focus devices and has innovated diagnostic instruments for the device. Dr. Syed can be reached at Syed@lppfusion.com Ivy Karamitsos, Chief Information Officer, joined LPPF in 2010. Initially she wrote the code for the collection and analysis of the experimental data. She now coordinates LPPFusion proprietary software and database development; manages network administration, website, content management, and communications, as well as educational and promotional videos, and she oversees the financial system. She completely updated LPPFusion’s website, lab and IT security systems, network and database, and has participated in mission-critical, hands-on experimental operations in the lab. She studied mathematics and classical music in the former Yugoslavia before receiving a degree in Computer Science from Binghamton University, SUNY in 2003. Some of her music accompanies LPPF’s videos. Ivy can be reached at Ivy@lppfusion.com Rudolph “Rudy” Fritsch, Director of Investor Relations, has been President of Allsteel, a manufacturer of industrial metal-forming equipment, for 15 years. He was born in Hungary in 1947, and emigrated to Canada during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. As an engineer and entrepreneur, he ran a successful family business in Canada for decades, at its peak employing over 100 workers. He is an advocate of Austrian economics and a student of Professor Antal Fekete. Rudy can be reached at Rudy@lppfusion.com Fred Van Roessel, Research Electrical Engineer, joined LPPF in July, 2010 as a Research Electrical Engineer. He started his career in the Television Group at Philips Research Laboratories in the Netherlands. He stayed with Philips when he emigrated to the US, and was responsible for Broadcast Color Camera Development. Later on he developed the software and hardware for fully automating camera adjustments. For this and earlier work he has been awarded 17 patents. Fred can be reached at Fred@lppfusion.com Warwick Dumas, Simulation Researcher. After being awarded his PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Leicester (UK) in 2010, he began volunteering on simulation building for Focus Fusion Society. He is inspired by the prospects for Focus Fusion to make a dramatic change to the global prospects for social justice and environmental conservation. He joined LPPF in 2012, carrying on with the same project, a simulation of the plasma filaments that form when the capacitor banks are discharged. An early version of this simulation helped LPPF to re-design the cathode and the current version still under development, will break new ground in several directions in simulation of plasmas. In the past, he has worked as a  statistics analyst for the UK government Learning and Skills Council and with Santander. Dr. Robert Terry joined LPPF as Computational Physics Consultant and has started working with Dr. Warwick Dumas to develop our ongoing simulation of the early phases of the plasma focus process. This simulation will help us to understand how the current filaments form and what conditions favor or imperil their survival. The filaments in turn are the vital first steps in compressing the plasma to high densities. Dr. Terry has had over 35 years of experience in simulation of plasma phenomena, having strong expertise both in computational techniques and plasma physics. He worked for over 20 years at the US Naval Research Laboratory developing innovative techniques for modeling the Z-pinch, a plasma device closely related to the the dense plasma focus device.MenuJoin An EventCrowdfundGet InvolvedDiscussVolunteerShop FusionDonateNews Archives Search News Archives Search Select Month July 2017  (1) May 2017  (2) April 2017  (6) March 2017  (4) December 2016  (5) November 2016  (2) October 2016  (3) September 2016  (1) August 2016  (3) July 2016  (1) June 2016  (3) May 2016  (6) April 2016  (6) February 2016  (1) January 2016  (5) December 2015  (3) November 2015  (3) October 2015  (2) August 2015  (6) July 2015  (4) May 2015  (5) April 2015  (4) March 2015  (1) February 2015  (2) January 2015  (1) December 2014  (6) November 2014  (2) October 2014  (6) September 2014  (4) August 2014  (1) July 2014  (9) June 2014  (3) May 2014  (6) April 2014  (12) March 2014  (21) February 2014  (19) January 2014  (7) December 2013  (3) November 2013  (5) October 2013  (8) September 2013  (2) August 2013  (7) May 2013  (1) March 2013  (4) February 2013  (2) January 2013  (2) December 2012  (4) November 2012  (4) October 2012  (2) September 2012  (1) August 2012  (2) July 2012  (2) June 2012  (1) May 2012  (5) April 2012  (5) March 2012  (8) February 2012  (4) January 2012  (1) December 2011  (2) November 2011  (3) October 2011  (2) September 2011  (2) August 2011  (4) July 2011  (1) June 2011  (3) May 2011  (3) April 2011  (3) March 2011  (5) February 2011  (3) January 2011  (2) December 2010  (1) November 2010  (1) October 2010  (1) September 2010  (1) June 2010  (1) May 2010  (1) April 2010  (2) March 2010  (1) February 2010  (2) January 2010  (1) November 2009  (2) October 2009  (2) September 2009  (2) June 2009  (1) February 2009  (1) December 2008  (1) May 2008  (1) February 2007  (1) February 2004  (1) Copyright © 2017 LPPFusion
