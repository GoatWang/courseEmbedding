					Full Description



Oconee Federal Financial Corp. is a stock holding company for Oconee Federal Savings and Loan Association. Oconee Federal Savings and Loan Association is a federally chartered savings and loan association. The Company's principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the public in its market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, nonresidential mortgage, construction and land, agricultural and other loans. The Company also invests in the United States Government and federal agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and short-term deposits. The Company has also used borrowed funds as a source of funds. The Company borrows principally from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. The Company's primary market area consists of the counties where it has offices and the nearby communities and townships in adjacent counties in South Carolina and Georgia.Lending ActivitiesThe principal lending activity of Oconee Federal Savings and Loan Association is originating one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, home equity loans and lines of credit, nonresidential real estate loans, construction and land loans, commercial loans, agricultural loans, and other loans. The nonresidential loans include those secured by real estate mortgages on churches, owner-occupied and non-owner occupied commercial buildings of various types, retail and office buildings, hotels, and other business and industrial properties. The Company makes construction loans to individuals for the construction of their primary residences and to commercial businesses for their real estate needs. The Company offers home equity loans and lines of credit secured by first or second deeds of trust on primary residences in its market area. The agricultural real estate loans are secured by farmland and related improvements in the Company's market area. The Company also offers installment loans for various consumer purposes, including the purchase of automobiles, boats, and for other legitimate personal purposes. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had a total loan of $293.1 million.Investment ActivitiesThe Company's investment policy permits investments in securities issued by the United States government and its agencies or government sponsored enterprises. The Company may invest in mortgage-backed securities and mutual funds, which invest in mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market, which are collateralized by pools of mortgages. The Company's investment policy also permits, with certain limitations, investments in bank-owned life insurance, collateralized mortgage obligations, asset-backed securities, real estate mortgage investment conduits, South Carolina revenue bonds and municipal securities. Mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by pools of one- to four-family or multifamily mortgages. Ginnie Mae, a United States Government agency, and government sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, either guarantee the payments or guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest to investors. As of June 30, 2016, its total available-for-sale securities were $129.2 million.Sources of FundsDeposits are the source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. The Company's primary sources of funds are deposits and the proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities. The Company may use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta advances, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, the Company receives funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. The Company accepts deposits from Oconee County, South Carolina, and Stephens and Rabun Counties, Georgia and surrounding counties and townships. The Company offers a selection of deposit accounts, including demand accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). The Company offers an electronic banking platform, including online bill pay, and mobile banking as services to its deposit customers. As of June 30, 2016, its total deposits were $399.6 million.
