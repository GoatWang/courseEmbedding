DEAR SHAREHOLDER,                                                               

We present you with the semiannual report for Series T (the "Trust"), a series  
of SMA Relationship Trust, for the six months ended June 30, 2004.              

PERFORMANCE                                                                     

Over the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Trust returned 0.33%. During the   
same period, its benchmarks, the Lehman Brothers U.S. Credit Index and the      
Lehman Brothers MBS Fixed Rate Index, declined 0.27% and returned 0.77%,        
respectively. (Please note that these returns do not reflect the deduction of   
taxes that a shareholder would pay on Trust distributions or the redemption of  
Trust shares. For more on the Trust's performance, see page 4.)                 

AN INTERVIEW WITH PORTFOLIO MANAGER JOSEPH PRATT                                
Q. CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OVER THE PERIOD?                   

A. Despite increasing signs that economic recovery was taking hold, the Federal 
Reserve Board (the "Fed") maintained an accommodative monetary policy for 
much of the reporting period. It was not until after a particularly strong
  employment report in March that the Fed changed course, and began to lay the
groundwork for higher rates. The first rate increase in four years finally
 came on June 30, 2004, when the Fed moved the federal funds rate from 1.00%
 to 1.25%. As part of its announcement, the Fed also indicated that it would
consider larger and more frequent rate hikes, if needed, to ward off      
inflation.                                                                

Q. HOW DID THE CORPORATE AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECTORS PERFORM OVER THE PERIOD?   

A. Throughout the reporting period, positive economic news was offset by higher 
oil prices, inflation fears and rising interest rates. The net result was 
little movement in the corporate bond market over the six-month reporting 
period. Conversely, the rise in interest rates negatively affected the    
mortgage-backed bond market, causing it to underperform similar duration  
  Treasury bonds. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) have prepayment risk, which
means that, as

   interest rates rise, the incentive for homeowners to "call" their bonds (that
 is, refinance) decreases, and the effective duration of any outstanding MBS
increases as a function of the rise in interest rates. This duration      
extension makes mortgage-oriented portfolios more sensitive to rising     
interest rates.                                                           

Q. HOW DID YOU MANAGE THE TRUST IN THIS ENVIRONMENT?                            

A. Within the corporate marketplace, our research suggested that the market was 
factoring in a very optimistic scenario, which we felt was unlikely to    
unfold. As a result, we entered the reporting period with a relatively    
neutral market weighting and a slightly lower duration than the Indexes, a
positioning that was intended to protect the portfolio from market        
  volatility, and to allow us to take advantage of periods of market weakness.
This strategy helped performance when corporate bonds underperformed other
  spread sectors, and when longer dated corporate bonds underperformed shorter
dated ones.                                                               

Within the mortgage-backed portion of the Trust, we favored higher coupon 
securities. As a result, the Trust was able to generate incremental income
and, at the same time, maintain a shorter duration versus the Indexes,    
ultimately enhancing relative performance. Performance was also aided by  
strong individual issue selection within the mortgage market.             

Q. HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE STRUCTURING THE TRUST'S PORTFOLIO GOING FORWARD?       

A. We will continue to focus the mortgage portion of the Trust on shorter       
duration, less prepayment-sensitive issues. These will generally be higher
coupon bonds, or securities with specific structural features that limit  
prepayment variability. On the corporate side, we also have less duration 
than the benchmark, as the extra yield available over Treasuries that     
 long-dated corporate bonds can presently offer is not much higher than what
we can earn on short-dated (for example, five-year) issues.

much of the reporting period. It was not until after a particularly strong

Q. HOW DID YOU MANAGE THE TRUST OVER THE PERIOD?                                

A. Given the overall economic expansion and our belief that interest rates would
be rising, we continued to maintain a shorter duration than the benchmark 
   throughout the reporting period. This was detrimental to results in the first
   quarter of 2004, as yields declined due to less than expected new job growth.
However, our increased exposure to the 19- to 26-year portion of the yield
curve, which outperformed shorter duration securities, was beneficial to  
performance. In the second quarter of 2004, our duration strategy enhanced
re-

sults, given the rising interest rate environment. From a yield curve     
perspective, our underweight position in one- to five-year maturities was 
 helpful as this was the poorest performing area. Our position in the 12- to
 15-year range of the curve helped relative performance as well, as this was
the best performing area of the curve.                                    

As the reporting period progressed we adjusted our strategy related to    
   general obligation bonds. We had previously underweighted this sector, as the
fortunes of these bonds are tied to tax revenues. However, given the      
strengthening economy, many states reduced their budget deficits through  
larger-than-expected tax revenues. We believe this trend is likely to     
continue going forward. As such, we selectively added a number of general 
obligation securities to the portfolios, including those of California and
New York City. We also took the opportunity to purchase several California
tax-exempt bonds. The state issued a record $5 billion in municipal       
securities over the period to help shore up its budget deficit. This huge 
influx of supply put an enormous strain on the market, and caused the     
 California exempt market, in particular, to underperform. We viewed this as
  an opportunity given the potential for the state's economy to improve in the
coming years, and purchased these bonds on weakness.                      

We have also seen a number of positive trends in the airport sector. The  
airline industry itself remains weak, yet the need for airfreight and     
 transportation continues to rise. In addition, start-up and budget airlines
  continue to gain market share from the major airline carriers, many of which
are in precarious financial straits. Overall, this is beneficial, as the  
airport sector itself is not as tied to the fortunes of any particular    
carrier. Additionally, while we remain negative on the overall healthcare 
sector as a result of declining government reimbursements, we identified  
several turnaround situations that we believe are attractive.             

Q. HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE STRUCTURING THE TRUST'S PORTFOLIO GOING FORWARD?       

A. Looking ahead, we will retain our short duration, as we believe the Federal  
Reserve Boards 25-basis point short-term rates increase at the end of June
  could be the beginning of a series of rate hikes. In fact, after period end,
 the Fed announced another 25 basis point hike at its August meeting. Having
 said that, we do not believe inflation is out of control. However, slightly
   higher rates would be consistent with the Fed's policy of acting preemptively
to avoid a dramatic increase in either interest rates or inflation in the 
future. We anticipate maintaining our strategy of overweighting California
tax-exempt bonds given their attractiveness. We will also continue to look
   for opportunities in the California and New York City general obligation bond
sectors. As always, we remain diligent in our quest to identify securities
that offer meaningful upside potential with limited risk.

SMA RELATIONSHIP TRUST                                                          

Notes to Financial Statements                                                   

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             

SMA Relationship Trust (the "Trust") is an open end, investment company         
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust has  
two separate investment portfolios available for investment, each having its own
investment objectives and policies: Series T and Series M (the "Funds"). Series 
M investment objective is to seek total return, consisting of capital           
appreciation and current income exempt from federal income tax. Series M pursues
its investment objective by investing primarily in municipal bonds. The         
investment objective of Series T is to maximize total return, consisting of     
income and capital appreciation by investing in affiliated investment companies.

In the normal course of business the Funds enter into contracts that contain a  
variety of representations that provide general indemnification. The Fund's     
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve      
future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet occurred.    
However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these        
contracts and expect the risk of losses to be remote.                           

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires the Fund's management to make  
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in   
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The 
following is a summary of significant accounting policies:                      

a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS--The Funds calculate their net asset value based on 
the current market value, where available, for their portfolio securities. The  
Funds normally obtain market values for their securities from independent       
pricing sources and broker dealers. Independent pricing sources may use reported
last sale prices, current market quotations or valuations from computerized     
"matrix" systems that derive values based on comparable securities. If a market 
value is not available from an independent pricing source for a particular      
security, that security is valued at fair value as determined in good faith by  
or under the direction of the Funds' Board of Trustees (the "Board").           
Investments in affiliated investment companies are valued at the daily closing  
net asset value of the respective fund. The amortized cost method of valuation, 
which approximates market value, generally is used to value short-term debt     
instruments with sixty days or less remaining to maturity, unless the Board     
determines that this does not represent fair value.                             

b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS, AND INVESTMENT INCOME--Investment transactions are  
recorded on the trade date basis. Realized gains and losses from investment     
transactions are calculated using the identified cost method. Interest income,  
which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is      
recorded on the accrual basis.                                                  

c) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--Dividends and distributions to shareholders are 
recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends and distributions     

20

P-->N-CSRS24th�Page�of�31TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
is determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may      
differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These
"book/tax" differences are either considered temporary or permanent in nature.  
To the extent these differences are permanent in nature, such amounts are       
reclassified within the capital accounts based on their federal tax-basis       
treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.               

d) CONCENTRATION OF RISK--The ability of the issuers of debt securities held by 
Series M to meet their obligations may be affected by economic and political    
developments particular to a specific state or region.                          

e) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES--The policy of each Fund is to comply with all          
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") applicable to regulated  
investment companies and to distribute substantially all of their taxable income
to their shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes is    
required.                                                                       

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES AND ADMINSTRATION AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH       
AFFILIATES                                                                      

The Board has approved an investment advisory and administration contract       
("Advisory Contract") with UBS Global Asset Management (US) Inc. ("UBS Global   
AM" or "Advisor") under which UBS Global AM serves as investment advisor and    
administrator of the Funds. Pursuant to the Advisory Contract, the Funds will   
not pay a fee to UBS Global AM for investment advisory services provided by UBS 
Global AM. However, for financial reporting purposes only, the Funds' statements
of operations will reflect an imputed unitary fee for investment advisory and   
administration services provided by UBS Global AM, currently estimated at 0.25% 
of average net assets per annum, of which all was waived.                       

UBS Global AM (not the Funds) pays the operating expenses of the Fund. The Funds
may invest in shares of certain affiliated investment companies also sponsored  
by the Advisor. These investments represented 98.95% of Series T's total net    
assets. Amounts relating to these investments at June 30, 2004 are summarized as
follows:
