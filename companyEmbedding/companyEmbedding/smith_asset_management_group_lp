Our Fundamental Belief


Companies that can sustainably grow earnings faster than expected should have strong price appreciation.







Who we are:
Smith Asset Management Group is based in Dallas, Texas and was founded in 1995 by Steve Smith, our CEO and Chief Investment Officer. We are a 100% employee owned company.
What we do:
Smith Group originated in our founder Steve Smith's understanding that unexpected earnings growth can be a persistent source of excess investment returns.  In the late 1970's, Steve participated in some of the earliest studies on unexpected earnings growth (then known merely as earning surprise), and his focus on the unexpected is the foundation and driving force for our approach to investing.
Keys To Success:
- 20 years focused on the theory and practice of capturing unexpected earnings
- A portfolio construction process with the intent to integrate the best of both disciplines
   - Quantitative research to identify opportunities and risks swiftly
   - Fundamental analysis to verify potential sources of unexpected growth
- Seeking to deliver realized growth that is better than expected
