Meat on a Mission
The world loves meat. But relying on cows to make meat is land-hungry, water-thirsty, and pollution-heavy. That’s why we set out to do the impossible: make delicious meats that are good for people and the planet.
It all starts with the Impossible Burger. But our world-renowned team of scientists are hard at work inventing more ways to make the foods we love most.
About Us







Today we rely on cows to turn plants into meat. There has to be a better way.













Reinventing the Burger from the Ground Up
We spent the past five years researching what makes meat unique: the sizzle, the smell, the juicy first bite. Then we set out to find precisely the right ingredients from the plant kingdom to recreate the experience meat lovers crave. You’ve never tasted plants like this.

High On Taste, Low On Impact
Every time you choose a quarter-pound Impossible Burger instead of a burger made from a cow, you can make a huge difference without compromising.
*Compared to a typical U.S. beef production system.





You save water equivalent to a 10-minute shower.





You spare 18 driving miles-worth of greenhouse gases.





You spare 75 square feet of land for wildlife.

Q&A




What Is Impossible Foods?
Founded by Patrick O. Brown, M.D., Ph.D., Impossible Foods is a Silicon Valley startup on a mission to make the global food system more sustainable. The fast-growing team includes scientists, engineers, chefs, farmers and foodies. The first product is the Impossible Burger. It tastes great -- and you can feel great about it because the Impossible Burger is made entirely from plants.


How Did the Company Get Started?
We started in 2011 with a simple question: “Why does meat taste like meat?” We spent the next five years researching every aspect of the unique sensory experience of meat, from how it looks raw to how it sizzles and what happens when we sink our teeth into a burger. Then we recreated the precise flavors, textures, aromas, and nutrition of ground beef -- using only plants. By understanding meat at the molecular level, we made a juicy burger that’s delicious, yet nutritious.


Why Do You Make Only Ground Beef?
Our first product to hit the market is the Impossible Burger, but we’re not stopping there. We are already developing other types of meat and dairy. Our team of scientists and food researchers can make chicken, pork, fish or yogurt entirely from plants. We will bring other products to market according to regional food preferences and customer demand worldwide. The Impossible Burger is only the beginning.


What Exactly Is It Made Of?
The Impossible Burger is made from simple ingredients found in nature, including wheat, coconut oil and potatoes. We add one more special ingredient, called “heme.” Heme contributes to the characteristic color and taste of meat, and it catalyzes all the other flavors when meat is cooked. Heme is exceptionally abundant in animal muscle -- and it’s a basic building block of life in all organisms, including plants. We discovered how to take heme from plants and produce it using fermentation -- similar to the method that’s been used to make Belgian beer for nearly a thousand years. Adding heme to the Impossible Burger makes it a carnivore’s delight.
Full Ingredient List: Water, Textured Wheat Protein, Coconut Oil, Potato Protein, Natural Flavors, 2% or less of: Leghemoglobin (soy), Yeast Extract, Salt, Soy Protein Isolate, Konjac Gum, Xanthan Gum, Thiamin (Vitamin B1), Zinc, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Vitamin B12.
Contains: Soy, Wheat


Do you produce heme by genetic modification?
Yes. We genetically engineer yeast to make a key ingredient: heme. The process allows us to produce the Impossible Burger at scale with the lowest achievable environmental impact.
We start with the gene for a protein called leghemoglobin, a heme protein that is naturally found in the root nodules of soy plants. Leghemoglobin is similar to myoglobin, the heme protein that is exceptionally abundant in animal muscles, binds oxygen and gives meat its unique flavor and aroma, as well as its red or pink color.
We add the soy leghemoglobin gene to a yeast strain, and grow the yeast via fermentation. Then we isolate the leghemoglobin, or heme, from the yeast. We add heme to the Impossible Burger to give it the intense, meaty flavor, aroma and cooking properties of animal meat.
By producing our heme in yeast, we avoid digging up soy plants to harvest the root nodules, which would promote erosion and release carbon stored in the soil. This enables us to produce heme sustainably at high volume and make plant-based meat for millions of people, offsetting the environmental impact of animal agriculture.


Besides the yeast used to make heme, do you use other genetically modified crops?
No. We currently buy soy, wheat and potatoes from certified non-GMO sources.


Is It Vegan? Gluten-Free?
Impossible Burgers are 100% vegan. They include wheat protein, which means they contain gluten.




Where can I eat the burger?
We're currently serving the Impossible Burger at select restaurants in New York, L.A., Las Vegas, Texas, and San Francisco. Go to our ‘Locations’ page for more info.


Can I buy the Impossible Burger in grocery stores or online?
We are not yet available in grocery stores or for online ordering. We are starting by working with world-class chefs to ensure the best possible experience for our customers. As we ramp up our supply, we intend to be accessible and available widely.


Can I buy the Impossible Burger internationally?
The Impossible Burger is only available in select restaurants in the United States. We are currently focusing on wider availability in the US and will be available internationally in the coming years.


Why is the Impossible Burger not more widely available?
We want to get the Impossible Burger in the hands of as many people as possible, but it takes time to build something new. We are working around the clock to build our production facilities to get you and many others an Impossible burger very soon. Thank you for being patient with us as we grow.


Why Is The Impossible Burger Better For The Planet?
It takes a lot of land, water, food, and time for cows to turn plants into meat. And by basically skipping the biggest step in the plants-to-cows-to-burgers equation, we save a lot of resources. Compared to a burger made from cows, making an Impossible Burger uses about 1/20th the land, 1/4th the water, and produces 1/8th the greenhouse gas emissions.


Where Do Our Environmental Numbers Come From?
We use what’s called a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)—an estimate of a product’s full environmental impact, from raw material to finished product—that allows us to compare it to US beef production. However, because beef production methods vary, so do our estimates.
Our next step is to bring our LCA into compliance with standards from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This year, as we put the finishing touches on our new manufacturing facilities and supply chain, we’re working with our sustainability consulting partners to get this started.


How Good Is The Impossible Burger For Me?
The plant-based Impossible Burger delivers bioavailable protein and iron comparable to conventional beef. It has no cholesterol, hormones or antibiotics.

The company collects proteins and nutrients from grains, greens and seeds and adds them to vitamins, fats, and amino acids to effectively reconstitute sustainable meats and dairy. The result is food that the company claims tastes like real meat, but without the cholesterol, antibiotics, and hormones that are increasing a byproduct of eating from the traditional food chain. The process requires fewer resources than the traditional farming process. For now, the company’s product line consists of just a cheeseburger, which is set to be released in the U.S. in 2016.

REDWOOD CITY, Calif., July 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Impossible Foods Inc., announced today that it will introduce the Impossible Burger on Wednesday, July 27, at Momofuku Nishi in Manhattan. This is the first time the Impossible Foods "animal-free" burger will be regularly featured on a restaurant menu, and marks the commercial introduction of a new generation of delicious plant-based foods that promises to revolutionize the world's food system.










 







							 		Nishi Style Impossible Burger
							  



 

 
 



Opened in January 2016 in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood, Momofuku Nishi is part of the Momofuku Group of restaurants founded by world renowned chef David Chang.
"Impossible Foods is honored to have a chef of David Chang's talent and vision as our anchor chef in New York," said Patrick O. Brown, M.D., Ph.D., founder and CEO of Impossible Foods. "Under David's skilled hand, the Impossible Burger is moving to the next level of taste."
The Impossible Burger looks, cooks, smells, sizzles, and tastes like conventional ground beef but is made entirely from plants. Among the breakthroughs that make the Impossible Burger unique is the discovery that a molecule called "heme" is the magic ingredient that makes meat look, cook and taste gloriously meaty. While heme is exceptionally abundant in meat, it is a basic molecular building block of life on Earth, including plants. Impossible Foods uses a plant-based heme protein to give the Impossible Burger its irresistibly meaty taste.
"I was genuinely blown away when I tasted the burger," said chef and founder of Momofuku, David Chang. "The Impossible Foods team has discovered how to re-engineer what makes beef taste like beef. We're always looking to support people who are making the best products in the best ways possible and to me, the Impossible Burger is one more example. First and foremost, we think this makes a delicious burger."
Momofuku's first restaurant on the West side of Manhattan, Momofuku Nishi, will serve a limited number of Impossible Burgers during lunch, brunch and dinner service starting Wednesday. The 'Nishi Style Impossible Burger' is topped with romaine, beefsteak tomato, pickles and special sauce and served on a Martin's potato roll with shoestring fries. Guests may also add cheese upon request. 
Impossible Foods's mission is to produce delicious, nutritious, affordable plant-based foods with a lower environmental impact than raising animals for food. Producing the Impossible Burger requires approximately a quarter of the water used to produce the same burger from a cow, a twentieth of the land, and only an eighth of the greenhouse gas emissions, according to a lifecycle analysis conducted by Impossible Foods.
"Two factors have made the Impossible Burger as good as it is," said Harold McGee, author of On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen and other works about food science and its history. "One is Impossible Foods's ambition to make a plant-based burger that's just as delicious as a beef burger, with the same satisfying flavors and textures. The other is its pursuit of a deeper scientific understanding of meat itself, and how cooking makes it delicious. This research effort has generated major new insights into the flavor of meat, and continues to drive the innovations that put the Impossible Burger in a category of its own."
The Impossible Burger's key ingredients are water, wheat protein, coconut oil, potato protein and leghemoglobin (i.e., heme) plus natural flavors and micronutrients. The Impossible Burger delivers comparable protein and iron to conventional beef but contains no cholesterol, hormones, or antibiotics.
Later this year, the Impossible Burger is also expected to become a regularly featured menu item at select restaurants in San Francisco and Los Angeles.  The company plans to expand to additional restaurants in the U.S., followed by grocery stores and overseas markets as production capacity rises over the coming several years.
Impossible Foods expects the price of the burger to decline as it scales up production, until it is at or below the cost of commercial ground beef. The company's technology can be used to produce virtually any animal-based food, from steaks and chops to chicken and fish and dairy foods. 
"The burger is only the beginning," Brown said. "With its introduction at Momofuku Nishi, we have begun the movement to build a new kind of global food system, one that creates new markets for farmers, supports a more resilient food supply, and offers consumers new choices for the meat and dairy products they know and love – ones that are equally delicious but made from plants."
About Impossible Foods
Based in Redwood City, California, Impossible Foods gives consumers a better choice: delicious, healthy, affordable meat and dairy foods made directly from plants. Impossible Foods extracts specific proteins from plants and combines them with simple, natural ingredients like fats, amino acids and vitamins to create raw meat from plants that delivers the irresistible taste, texture and aroma of conventional beef while using far less of the Earth's finite resources. Impossible Foods is a private company funded in part by Khosla Ventures, Bill Gates, Google Ventures, Horizons Ventures, UBS, and Viking Global Investors.  The company was founded in 2011 by Patrick O. Brown, M.D., Ph.D., a medical doctor, research scientist and formerly a professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Stanford University.
