Description

Description

While a large percentage of Americans claim religious identity, the number of Americans attending traditional worship services has significantly declined in recent decades. Where, then, are Americans finding meaning in their lives, if not in the context of traditional religion? In this provocative study, the authors argue that the objects of our attention have become our god and fulfilling our desires has become our religion. They examine the religious dimensions of six specific aspects of American culture—body and sex, big business, entertainment, politics, sports, and science and technology—that function as "altars" where Americans gather to worship and produce meaning for their lives. The Altars Where We Worship shows how these secular altars provide resources for understanding the self, others, and the world itself. "For better or worse," the authors write, "we are faced with the reality that human experiences before these altars contain religious characteristics in common with experiences before more traditional altars." Readers will come away with a clearer understanding of what religion is after exploring the thoroughly religious aspects of popular culture in the United States.


Reviews

"This book provides a compelling analysis that expands our understanding of religion by revealing its presence in cultural activities far beyond the traditional confines of churches, mosques, temples, and other sacred spaces. It demonstrates that the intensity of religious devotion is not limited to such traditional locations as churches, temples, mosques, and shrines but actually flourishes in various spheres of our cultural life, such as big business, body and sex, entertainment, sports, politics, and science and technology."—Peter J. Paris, Elmer G. Homrighausen Professor Emeritus of Christian Social Ethics, Princeton Theological Seminary


"What is religion and where does one find it? What are the markers of religiosity exposed through popular culture? These are some of the vital questions addressed by this important text. Those interested in a rich and multilayered analysis of how religion is organized and expressed within the everyday language, symbols, and practices of cultural life will find this text an important contribution to scholarship. It is insightful and a much-needed addition to our understanding of the deep significance of the cultural worlds that hold and express religious belief and practices."—Anthony B. Pinn, Agnes Cullen Arnold Professor of Humanities and Professor of Religion, Rice University


"Leaving the safe, stuffy hallways of academia, the Floyd-Thomases and Mark Toulouse, as participant-observers, provide a riveting, rigorous, and reflective analysis of 'worshiping' at one of the seven popular altars of U.S. culture—a process they call "altar-ization." Regardless as to which 'secular' altar you bend your knees; this groundbreaking book will raise your consciousness to the meaning of your participation."—Miguel A. De La Torre, Professor of Social Ethics and Latino/a Studies, Iliff School of Theology


"Americans' search for ultimate meaning is alive and well, although it looks different than it has in the past. The Altars Where We Worship is an intelligent and intriguing exploration into the ways in which Americans are increasingly living in multiple religious worlds at once, where traditional religious altars have been replaced in people's hearts with altars created by popular cultural (e.g., business, entertainment, sex, technology, sports) altars no less demanding and meaning-full."—Renita J. Weems, biblical scholar, African Methodist Episcopal minister, and author of Just A Sister Away and Battered Love


"Tillich meets Marx in this sweeping indictment of where Americans really go to find ultimate meaning—not to church but to sex, business, entertainment, politics, sports, and science and technology. Rejecting the idea that popular culture is devoid of religion, the authors argue instead that religion in America is deeply and pervasively self-indulgent."—Amanda Porterfield, Robert A. Spivey Professor of Religion and Professor of History, Florida State University

Shipping & Returns Policy
  View complete shipping
  and returns policy & FAQs.

        


White Glove Shipping
Appropriate for large or fragile items.

      Costs range from $100 for smaller items delivered locally to $1,000+ for extra large
      items transported across the Continental United States. Final cost depends on the size of the items and the
      buyer's location.
    

      Local deliveries typically take about 2 weeks and longer
      distance deliveries typically take about 3-6 weeks.
    
Flat Rate Shipping

      Shipment through recognized carriers such as UPS, FedEx, and USPS. Appropriate for smaller items, most
      accessories and some small furniture.
    

      Costs range from $9 to $299 and up, depending on the size and weight of the item.
    
Delivery is typically 7-10 days
Local Pickup

      Local pickup allows a buyer to avoid shipping costs by picking up an item in person. The buyer must contact the
      seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a pickup date and time. Delays may result in
      additional charges.
    
Local Delivery

      As a lower cost alternative, some of our sellers offer local curbside delivery within a limited geography around
      their location. The buyer must contact the seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a
      delivery date and time. Delays may result in additional charges.
    

      If additional labor is required to move the item inside or upstairs, buyers should make sure to plan accordingly.
    




Returns & Cancellations

        Except for Local Pickup and Local Delivery, buyers have 48 hours after delivery to inspect
        their item(s) and contact support@chairish.com if they wish
        to return an item. There are no restocking fees, but we deduct outbound and return shipping charges from the
        buyer's original purchase price (+ taxes when applicable). Buyers may not be reimbursed for returns that are not
        received in original condition.

The pinnacle of interior design is the carefully curated “vignette”. A hodgepodge of seemingly random objects placed on a table, console or mantel does the yeoman's share of taking a room from dull and drab to chic and sophisticated. Add a vintage book, a tiny obelisk (now’s not the time to be a minimalist), and whatever suits your fancy!

      Bookends
    

Having too many vintage books is not a problem. Having said books topple off the ends of your shelves, well, that’s an (easily solvable) problem. Enter bookends, a decorative way to keep your precious library right where it belongs. A pretty pair of vintage brass pineapple bookends will add a touch of the tropical, while a pair of used bookends shaped like Scotty dogs are perfect for a manly study. You get the idea: steady books, chic shelves.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT STYLING WITH VINTAGE BOOKENDS
Since bookshelves are quite a large focal point in any area, arranging and styling them in such a way that they are both functional and elegant will make all the difference in a room’s look. Adding vintage bookends to your book and memorabilia collection will help with organization, but it will also complement the space with a stylish touch. Read on to find a few useful tips about what vintage bookends will work best with your shelves.
TYPES OF VINTAGE BOOKENDS
The hunt for antique bookends stops here! With so many different styles and colors to choose from, it will be impossible to only settle on one pair. Have fun with them by mixing and matching different styles, colors, and novelties in order to truly personalize any home. 
Natural Bookends 
Geode, onyx, marble and granite bookends are a few great ways to include earthy elements into a space. While onyx, marble and granite are usually neutral in color, geode bookends can be found in an assortment of shades. The outside of the bookend (or the rock) is generally a drab shade, but what is found inside is a bright, bold hue. These types of used bookends can add a touch of sophistication to any space.
Metal Bookends 
Vintage brass bookends can be a true staple in a vintage-style room. Coming in all shapes, including novelties, these antique bookends can be a fun icebreaker or a showcase of personality. From ships to horses to busts of Lincoln, finding a pair of brass bookends that meld well with the style of the space can be a fun task. 
Ceramic & Glass Bookends 
These tend to be more challenging to find. So, if you get your hands on some sweet ceramic and glass bookends, be sure to scoop them up! These delicate pieces can add pops of color to a muted bookshelf and serve well as accent pieces in a room. Pottery is in the same family of design and is generally easier to come across, so consider using a piece of vintage pottery as a bookend. And remember, they don’t have to match!

Wood Bookends 
Although these are made of a naturally occurring element, wooden bookends deserve their own category. These beauties can add a rustic vibe to any space because of their raw texture and warm tones. For a more traditional look, add wooden bookends to contrasting wooden bookshelves. To appeal to a more modern design, add wooden bookends to a brightly colored, shellacked bookshelf. 
HOW TO ARRANGE A BOOKSHELF
When styling the perfect bookshelf, it is important to resist the urge to pack in the accessories. To ensure a clean appearance, choose one color to play with, for vases, figurines and bookends. Add diversity by mixing up the shapes and sizes of these objects, as well as adding obvious interest with the books. Be sure to balance the overall arrangement of the shelves by placing items slightly off-center.
Add Interest 
Try stacking books both horizontally and vertically to add interest to the shelves. When stacking books vertically, try the pyramid effect by laying the longer books on the bottom of the stack and ending it with the smallest book. Also for the books that are stacked vertically, up the game by adding a bookend on the top of the stack. This can be a great way to modernize a bookshelf while still incorporating a vintage bookend. 
Sometimes, Less is More 
Modern shelves can also call for a sparse look, so group together sets of books and objects that are all relatively uniform in size. Leave lots of open space to showcase the shelves, themselves, instead of cluttering them with decor. If the books on display are busy or don’t match the color scheme of the room, try storing them in baskets or bins for a less cluttered and more simple design. If there are many books to display, organize them by author or genre, and label the bins or baskets accordingly, so specific books are easy to find. 
Symmetry 
Especially when it comes to more traditional spaces, symmetrical is the perfect way to style a bookshelf. Weave collectibles and antiques throughout the books in an even fashion. Mirrors and square-shaped picture frames are also great additions to this sense of style. 
Eye-popping Prints 
Who would have ever thought to add wallpaper to the back wall of a bookshelf? This can be a unique and fun way to personalize any space. Choose wallpaper that coordinates with the overall design of the room (or one that is a bold contrast). If your wallpaper doesn’t create the desired look, try gluing newspaper on the back wall of the bookshelf, or simply paint it an eye-catching color. Remember, if the print or color is bold, contrast it with more muted accessories and books, so as to not overwhelm the piece of furniture. 
Bookends are some of the main focal points, when it comes to a bookshelf. When choosing the perfect ones, be sure to consider the room’s overall style and design, as well as what will be featured on each shelf.
