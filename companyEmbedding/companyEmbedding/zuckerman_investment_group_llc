Equities
Zuckerman Investment Group All-Capitalization Equity Strategy
Our proprietary strategy uses a disciplined, value-based approach to manage a concentrated equity portfolio. We seek to fulfill our dual mandate of wealth preservation and long-term capital appreciation by constructing a portfolio of easy-to-understand investments at a market price below our independent estimate of their intrinsic value.
We invest in companies in all industries and of all market capitalizations. Our portfolio will typically hold 25-35 equity investments. Investments in U.S.-listed equities typically comprise a significant majority of our holdings.
Our portfolio contains a mix of quality, compounding businesses and opportunistic investments, acquired when we believe the market price temporarily undervalues the investment, often due to transitory factors or other special situations.
We manage risk and seek to avoid the permanent loss of capital by understanding all potential risks, by producing a comprehensive thesis and a high-confidence independent estimate of intrinsic value for each investment and by taking a long-term perspective.
When we are unable to find attractive investment opportunities, we are willing to hold cash rather than take unnecessary risks in pursuit of short-term profits.


Equities
International Equities
For clients who desire more meaningful exposure to international equity markets, we have carefully curated a select group of third-party international equity managers that closely mirror our disciplined, valued-based approach while investing in non-U.S. equity markets.


Fixed Income
Zuckerman Investment Group Fixed Income Strategy
Our proprietary fixed income strategy is a concentrated portfolio, typically 20-25 taxable corporate bonds, that leverages our disciplined and independent research process and focuses first on risk minimization and then on achieving an attractive level of income relative to that of the broader taxable corporate fixed income market.
This approach drives us to invest in bonds of stable, high-quality businesses that generate strong free cash flow. Provided that our investment criteria are satisfied, we will invest in the bonds of both investment-grade issuers and high-yield issuers.
Further, our approach leverages two unique advantages that we have, our small size and our flexibility to hold both investment grade and high yield bonds.
The fixed income market is dominated by very large institutional investors who are often mandated to hold only investment grade or high yield bonds. When a bond is split-rated (rated investment grade at one credit rating agency and high yield at another) or gets upgraded from high yield to investment grade (or vice versa), those strict mandates can cause buying or selling that creates market distortions that we are able to take advantage of because of our flexibility.
Similarly, large institutional investors in the bond markets tend to overlook bonds from small issuances (the total amount of the bond offering) and “seasoned” bonds (bonds trading in the secondary market, as opposed to newly-issued bonds). These opportunities are too small to be of much significance to investors running a large bond portfolio, an inefficiency that we are able to use to our advantage because of our small size.


Alternative Investments
Private Equity and Real Estate
When we believe that such investments will benefit our qualifying clients, we recommend investment in a select group of private equity and real estate partnerships that apply a similar disciplined and value-based approach to private market and real property investments.

Investment PhilosophyOur disciplined, value-based approach to asset management emphasizes wealth preservation and long-term capital appreciation. To ensure the full alignment of interests, we invest our assets directly alongside those of our clients.



We are disciplined value investors focused on wealth preservation and long-term capital appreciation. Our investment philosophy is based on the belief that we can deliver attractive absolute returns over a multi-year period by purchasing investments at a market price below our independent estimate of their intrinsic value.
We pursue this objective by seeking easy-to-understand investments that are unloved, out-of-favor or that run contrary to the prevailing conventional wisdom. We do not and will never pursue short-term fads or trends or take unnecessary risks in pursuit of short-term performance.
We identify mispriced investments through a diligent research process. Vigorous debate draws on the collective wisdom and experience of the six-person investment team to identify potential risks and possible downside associated with the investment, to build a detailed investment thesis and to establish a prudent estimate of the investment’s intrinsic value.
Our long-term investment perspective allows us to take advantage of opportunities created by the short-term focus of others and also ensures that we stay the course, or even invest further, when our investment thesis and estimate of intrinsic value are unchanged and short-term market and economic forces work against the price of an investment that we have made. This approach has the added benefit of reducing trading costs and promoting tax efficiency by limiting investment turnover.
We believe that the extensive nature of our research process gives us the confidence necessary to manage a concentrated portfolio of our highest-conviction investments, while maintaining an appropriate level of diversification and avoiding the permanent loss of capital.

 Educational Background



 


The University of Chicago

                  The University of Chicago's Office of Investments (COI) is responsible for managing the University's investment assets, which includes overseeing the endowment to ensure that it benefits both current and future generations of the University of Chicago. COI oversees the broad investment strategy and provides input to the development of the strategic and tactical investment policies of the University & UCMC endowments, pension plans and self-insurance trust assets. Their strategy combines qualitative and quantitative analysis, seeking to achieve superior investment performance on a risk-adjusted basis. COI's approach seeks to evaluate the investment strategy as an integrated part of the operating plans of the University rather than in isolation and focuses the the University's overall success, not investment returns. The endowment is well-diversified across a variety of asset classes, including global stocks and bonds, real estate, natural resources, private equity, absolute return strategies and protection (tail-hedging strategies). Asset class exposure is achieved primarily by selecting and engaging external managers. COI manages the global macro and the overlay portfolio to ensure that the portfolio’s overall positioning is compliance with the endowment's investment guidelines. COI's strategies for investing in the public markets include: Absolute Return, Private Debt, Fixed Income and Credit. and Global Equities. COI's real assets team invests globally in real estate and natural resources using outside managers. The real estate portfolio invests globally in value-added and opportunistic strategies using both private partnerships and public vehicles. The natural resources portfolio invests globally in strategies that include, but are not limited to: oil and gas exploration & production; power generation; infrastructure; timber; mining and minerals; and agriculture.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MOT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
