Long-Term Care




Do you have long-term care insurance? 


Do you have a family history of health issues?
    If care is required, do you have a plan? 


Does your current portfolio support the cost
    of care? 


Do you know the “right” time to buy
    long-term care? 


Do you know where and how to purchase a long-term care policy?



Things to consider
Long-term care (LTC) insurance is designed to cover what most health insurance policies do not, but that is where the
simplicity stops. The differences in policies, the riders, how much you should be paying and lastly, whether you even need it are what make it so complicated. Because policies can be very different, they must be carefully reviewed to make sure your needs/desires are met and you are not spending too much. This product is not for everyone, but it's worth discussing with your financial advisor.


What you need to know
Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)
These are routine activities that people tend to do every day without needing assistance. There are six basic ADLs: bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, transferring, and walking or moving around.
Types of Long-Term Care
1. Home care is for those able to do some physical movement around house; exercise or physical therapy; or monitoring a chronic health condition
2. Senior residences is for those no longer willing or able to live independently; common areas designed for elders; common dining areas and meals; some housekeeping
3. Assisted living includes domestic services, such as meals and housekeeping; assistance with personal care; close monitoring to ensure resident’s health and safety
4. Nursing facilities help with ADLs; around-the-clock monitoring and assistance; no nursing, physical therapy, or skilled medical care


What it means
Funding for Long-Term Care
Medicare pays only for short-term skilled nursing facility care where medical recovery treatment is provided.
Long-term care is predominately funded through Medicaid and the resident’s out-of-pocket assets. Medicaid offers the only comprehensive long-term coverage. This federal program for low-income people, administered by the states, pays for almost half the nation’s total nursing facility costs and much home care as well.




Review your family’s health history when thinking
about considering LTC. Set up an appointment with your advisor to have them complete the LTC analysis within your Financial Plan.

Retirement Income


Do you...


Have a retirement plan and run it against scenarios to ensure you will not run out of money during retirement?


Follow the steps that plan requires? 


Have plans to create an “income stream” in retirement? 


Have a tax-optimized distribution strategy?




Things to consider
The first rule of retirement income planning is to never run out of money. The second rule is to never forget the first rule. Retirement distribution strategies are unique to each individual/couple, taking into account their goals, needs and ability to handle risk. Without a regular paycheck, you need to create a consistent, sustainable income stream at the lowest cost. You must make sure that your distribution strategy is tax-optimized to avoid paying unnecessary taxes.



We can help

Speak with your local advisor to learn how to plan for and provide a monthly income during retirement.

Taxable Brokerage Account


Do you...


Manage your brokerage accounts in an efficient way?  


Review your investments and plan at least twice a year?





Things to consider
Tax planning is more complicated than simply filing and trying to “save” a few dollars in what you may owe Uncle Sam. It requires developing a strategy, as well as proper administration to support, operate, track, document and follow through. A proactive approach can help prepare you, your family or your business for long-term success. 



We can help
We’ll analyze your financial situation or plan from a tax perspective to align your financial goals with tax-efficiency planning. This encompasses many different aspects, and we’re here to help you navigate it all.

Radio Show Hosts - Andy Smith and Bob Richards 



Meet the Hosts of Investing
		Sense™






Andy Smith
Andy Smith, CFP®, has worked as a financial advisor for nearly 15 years and has helped thousands of investors navigate a variety of markets to achieve their long-term financial and retirement goals. Through his years of on-the-ground interactions, he’s forged an understanding of what investors need and want – not just from their accounts but from their relationships with an advisor.
Luckily, Andy’s advising doesn’t stop in the office. He’s spent more than a decade on the local and national airwaves guiding listeners toward all of their investment and retirement goals – all while offering clear and actionable advice on everything from personal finance and investing to the economy.
Between his roles as an advisor and radio-show host, Andy’s spare time is limited, but what little he does have he enjoys spending with his wife and children – he’s able to volunteer at the children’s school, and the family travels the world together.
Andy considers himself on-call 24/7 and is excited to help you achieve your financial and retirement goals – and, quite possibly, learn something cool and have fun in the process.







Bob Richards
Bob Richards represents the voice of the everyday investor by asking the questions that are on the minds of listeners.
Until recently, Bob has been a self-proclaimed do-it-yourself investor and admits to having learned some valuable financial lessons by making mistakes just like everyone else. Because he’s not an investment advisor, he knows all too well the challenges that investors face and is ready to use his own real-life experience to help listeners avoid similar pitfalls.
Bob has been in the radio industry for over 30 years and is an award-winning radio programmer. Bob and Andy have known each other for almost a decade as their paths have crossed in the radio world. Off the air, Bob is an avid runner, reader and Colts fan. He lives in Indianapolis with his family.
