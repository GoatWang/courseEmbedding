Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

KAYA Holdings (OTCQB: KAYS)
First fully reporting U.S. public company to actually own and operate a vertically integrated seed-to-sale legal marijuana enterprise in the United States.






Trimming the flower
                                   to reveal some of the choice bud
is an important part of bringing cannabis to market. By spreading these costs over larger production values, Kaya Farms will be able to better manage quality control, lower costs and decrease patient and consumer prices while allowing for increased potential margins.






Kaya Farms Grow License
By bringing more grow licenses into the Kaya Farms Network, KAYS is positioning itself to able to accumulate inventory to fill demand for early recreational sales.









KAYA Holdings (OTCQB: KAYS) owns and operates brands that produce, distribute and sell premium cannabis products, including flower, concentrates, and cannabis-infused baked goods and candies. 
We are the first fully reporting U.S. public company to actually own and operate a vertically integrated seed-to-sale legal marijuana enterprise in the United States. Our operations include medical marijuana dispensaries ("MMDs"), medical marijuana grow operations ("Grows"), the manufacturing of proprietary cannabis products and the research and development of medical grade cannabis strains and extracts for pain relief and treatment of serious illnesses.
We opened our first KAYA Shack™ MMD in Portland, Oregon in July 2014 when the press dubbed us the "Starbucks of Medical Marijuana", and our first Grow was launched in the first quarter of 2015 - "KAYA Farms Marijuana Grow Operation To Feed KAYA Shack™ Supply Chain".
KAYS expansion plans in Oregon include the launch and replication of our KAYA Shack™ Marijuana Superstore designed to support revenue-enhancing opportunities currently under development by the Company to leverage early recreational sales to begin October 1, 2015. 
KAYS expansion plans beyond Oregon include the establishment of new KAYA Shack™ MMDs and recreational marijuana stores, Grows and other facilities throughout the United States as the law permits, developments unfold and opportunities emerge.

	Item 3.02	 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

	.


	 



	In
	March 2017, the Company completed a $2.1 million financing with an institutional investor (the “

	Investor

	”)
	who had previously furnished KAYS with $1.2 million in financing, pursuant to a financing agreement (the “

	Financing Agreement

	”)
	which the Company had previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
	January 6, 2017 (the “

	Prior Form 8-K

	”). Pursuant to the Financing Agreement, the Investor purchased $2.1 million
	in principal amount of convertible notes (the “

	Notes

	”) from the Company as follows:




	 








	·




	$400,000
	in principal amount of Notes which are convertible into shares of the Company’s
	common stock (“

	Shares

	”), at a conversion price of $0.04;






	 








	·




	$700,000
	in principal amount of Notes which are convertible into Shares at a conversion price
	of $0.07; and






	 








	·




	$1,000,000
	in principal amount of Notes which are convertible into Shares at a conversion price
	of $0.10.






	 



	The purchase price for the Notes is equal
	to the principal amount thereof. The Notes have a term of two years from issuance and bear interest at the rate of eight percent
	(8%) annum, which accrues and is payable to together with interest at maturity. The Investor may convert the principal amount
	of the Notes (as well as other notes it currently holds as referenced above), together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon,
	into Shares at the applicable conversion price, at any time or from time to time prior to maturity. The conversion price is subject
	to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar transactions. The Notes also provide that at no
	time may they be convertible if the number of Shares being issued upon conversion to and then held by the Investor would result
	in the Investor beneficially owning in excess of 4.99% of the Company’s then outstanding Shares, after giving effect to
	the proposed conversion.


	 


	The Notes were issued pursuant to the exemption from
	registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Regulation D thereunder. No
	commissions or placement fees were paid in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes. The proceeds from the offer
	and sale of Notes are being used to fund the Company’s 2017 growth plan, including expansion of our chain of legal Kaya
	Shack™ Marijuana Superstores in Oregon, increasing the capacity of our legal marijuana grow facility and manufacturing
	operations and introducing new Kaya branded cannabis products.


	 


	Copies of the Financing Agreement and
	the form of Note were filed as Exhibits to the Prior Form 8-K. The foregoing summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified
	in their entirety by reference to such documents.

	On March 13, 2017, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our
	Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State increasing the number of shares of common stock KAYA is
	authorized to issue to five hundred million (500,000,000). The Company believes that the authorization of additional shares
	of common stock (which was authorized by our board of directors and holders of a majority of our voting shares) was needed to
	meet the Company’s obligations under outstanding convertible notes and securities, as well as to afford it with the
	ability to raise additional capital as needed and accordingly, is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
	A copy of the Certificate of Amendment is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.




	 







	Item 8.01	Other Information

	.



	 



	On March 21, 2017, we issued a press release announcing that
	KAYA had received its third Marijuana Retailer license from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission and had opened its third
	retail outlet, a Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstore, in North Salem, Oregon. A copy of the press release is filed as
	Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

	KAYA HOLDINGS (OTCQB: KAYS) OPENS




	3

	RD

	KAYA SHACK™ RECREATIONAL
	MARIJUANA STORE




	AND MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARY



	 


	Salem, Oregon: March 21, 2017 – Kaya
	Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: KAYS), announced today that it has received its 3

	rd

	Marijuana Retailer license from the Oregon
	Liquor Control Commission (OLCC), and has opened its third Kaya Shack Retail Marijuana location. Kaya Shack 3, with more than
	2400 square feet of Class “A” retail space in North Salem, Oregon is built on the Marijuana Superstore Model and features
	a wide selection of fine, affordable cannabis, cannabis infused products, and accessories for both recreational customers and
	medical marijuana patients.


	 


	“This new store is the next step in
	the execution of our business plan. Although its opening was delayed by a transitioning regulatory environment, we are hopeful
	that it will serve as a cornerstone of our presence in Salem.” stated Craig Frank, CEO of Kaya Holdings.


	 


	In related news KAYS announced that it has
	hired Greg Perkins of More Realty to assist in identifying a suitable 30-60 acre tract of land in Oregon for KAYS to expand its
	growing operations to the maximum space currently allowed by law utilizing a mix of indoor and greenhouse cultivation. Additionally,
	KAYS is hoping to position itself through the potential acquisition of this property for future development including increased
	Marijuana Canopy production, development of marijuana processing facilities and other cannabis related endeavors (subject to local
	zoning restrictions or liberalization of restrictions). KAYS will cease operations of its Portland grow facility at the end of
	March and has made arrangements to maintain its genetics library of over 30 strains of cannabis at a medical grow site to be registered
	shortly, and has already contracted with farmers to meet demand until the new facility is fully operational.

Stocks: 15 minute delay, EST. Futures and Forex: 10 minute delay, CST.) and new delayed trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash").  Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related ETFs Find exchange traded funds (ETFs) whose sector aligns with the same commodity grouping as the symbol you are viewing.
