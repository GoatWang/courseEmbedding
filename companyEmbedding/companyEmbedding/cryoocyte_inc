The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Non Technical Summary Culturing fish today is organized around two key steps: multiplication of fish in the hatcheries and the increase of fish biomass in grow-out production. This transition is more-or-less linear: immediately after spawning eggs get fertilized, develop and hatch, they are grown to the fry/fingerling/smolt stage, and get transferred to grow-out production. This cycle starts with the spawning event, which mostly is beyond the control of the hatchery managers and dictates when the cycle will end. Therefore, there is limited control over breeding and reproductive operations at the hatchery. This project is proposing a solution to this problem by developing a way to store eggs for extended periods of time in subzero temperatures. The ability to store eggs for extended periods of time at subzero storage will (i) extend egg availability beyond spawning seasons and increase hatchery utilization, (ii) enable synchronization of hatchery operations through on-demand access to eggs, (iii) facilitate transport of eggs for long distances, which is cheaper and safer than shipping fry.We propose an investigation into commonly employed freezing solution additives to establish relationship between their concentration, temperature and potential for extending subzero storage duration of salmon eggs. Out of the relationships, guidelines for additive dosage and storage temperature will be established for direct application to existing subzero storage processes. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop proof-of-concept development of 4-6 week egg storage technique.

Goals / Objectives The over-arching goal of this project is to develop a means to extend the storage life of fish eggs and through this to increase the efficiency of producing food fish. The specific objectives of this project are to (i) produce graphical ice fraction plots for 100 commonly employed freezing solution additives; (ii) produce graphical ice nucleation plots for 100 commonly employed freezing solution additives; (iii) produce graphical plots predicting optimum storage conditions for the 100 commonly employed freezing solution additives; (iv) evaluate the top 10 additives, and associated concentration/temperature guidelines, against existing subzero storage process in terms of duration.
						

Project Methods The project will be conducted based on the high-throughput research and development strategy, facilitating the evaluation of new additives, especially when concentration and temperature guidelines are not available. The work plan encompasses four objectives with the results of the first two objectives combined in the third objective and applies towards direction of the fourth objective. Graphical plots will be identified under objectives 1-3 that will enable prediction of optimum storage conditions (additive concentration and temperature) for the 100 commonly employed freezing solution additives. Additives will be ranked based on their potential for advancing existing subzero storage processes. Under objective 4, at least one freezing solution additive will be identified that enables extended egg storage at subzero temperatures.

Phase I was developed around four technical objectives. The first two objectives developed new physical and functional information on a broad spectrum of potential storage medium additives that was then collated in objective 3 to select the most promising storage medium additives for testing against an existing subzero storage process in objective 4. Objective 1 aimed to: produce graphical ice fraction plots for 100 commonly employed freezing solution additives. Physical data generated as part of this objective enabled a myriad of multiple comparisons between different additives and additive classes. While the data enabled comparative statements between solution additives, its true utility became apparent when combined with additional data sets relating additives to functional measures obtained in Objective 2. Objective 2 aimed to produce graphical ice nucleation plots for 100 commonly employed freezing solution additives. Under this objective, solutions with the most profound effects were identified and general trends were noted in relation to various classes of solutions. Under Objective 3, combinatorial analysis detected regions of favorable intersection between plots from Objective 1 and 2. Finally, under Objective 4,data was obtained on the most promising additives combining assessments from Objective 1,2 and 3. Further optimization strategies were identified, forming the basis for parts of the proposed Phase II experimental plan. Publications
Progress 06/01/15 to 01/31/16OutputsTarget Audience:Although the primary objectives of the research span beyond providing training and professional development, such opportunities have been provided in the reported period. As part of the conducted research, the PI directly worked with a staff of 4 technicians, providing them training and on-the-job coaching in the areas of biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, high-throughput testing, data quality assessment and data analysis. Over 100 hours of one-on-one work involving training and coaching have been carried out throughout the course of the project.A number of students from several Boston Universities were hosted at Cryoocyte&#39;s facilities and introduced to the company&#39;s operations, technical approaches and business objectives. Changes/Problems:Female-to-femalevariability in egg qualityhas proved more challenging than anticipated. Measures have been developed to ensure quality and repeatability of the data and to isolate the effects of the male, female and the researchtreatment. What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?Although the primary objectives of the research span beyond providing training and professional development, such opportunities have been provided in the reported period. As part of the conducted research, the PI directly worked with a staff of 4 technicians, providing them training and on-the-job coaching in the areas of biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, high-throughput testing, data quality assessment and data analysis. Over 200 hours of one-on-one work involving training and coaching have been carried out throughout the course of the project. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?A number of conversations were held with aquaculture researchers, including USDA scientists. Discussions were also held with businesses in the US and internationally about the benefits of technologies coming out of the project and best ways fortheir future commercialization. A number of meetings and presentations have been held with stakeholders from communities of interest. The objective of those efforts was to share the new possibilities in coldwater aquaculture industry, arising from conducted research, and solicit feedback on potential applications for specific customer groups. User requirements for products currently under development by Cryoocyte were also obtained and used to guide product development effort. A workshop about the use of egg storage was held for USDA Cold Water Aquaculture Research Center staff. Outreach has been done to the salmon hatcheries in the USand feedback was obtained about the potential benefits of egg storage. Meetings were held with several Norwegian aquaculture companies, including salmon multiplication hatcheries, vaccine producers working with smolt producers, salmon breeder.Leading salmon breeding practicioners were exposed to the capabilities enabled by the project and shared their perspectives on their relative importance, prioritization and impact. These discussions laid the foundation for andprovided insightsthat went into designingthecommercialization plan. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?Research will be carried out according to the plan and with the addition of measures to addressfactors such as female-to-femalte variability of egg quality. ImpactsWhat was accomplished under these goals?
As of project&#39;s mid-point, the work around all of the four objectives of the proposal has been commenced and is in different stages of completion. The graphical ice fraction plots for commonly employed freezing additives have been produced and assessment has proceeded at two resolutions. After initial screening of singular additives, greater applicability was desired from the results of singular additive analysis. Studies regarding internal ice nucleation in salmonid eggs have progressed through a preliminary screening in our first generation Planer cryogenic freezer.Results have indicated that improvements over our initial process are possible and further refinements on the compositions have been identified.?
