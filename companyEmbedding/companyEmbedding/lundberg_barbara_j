Job Details
               Established in 2002, Blue Oak School is the first independent school in Napa County. We are a vibrant, diverse community where learning is an active, joyful process of discovery. Blue Oak School offers a distinctive program to educate the whole child through active, cooperative learning in a diverse and supportive community. Our mission calls us to serve the needs of each child while also serving the larger community. Our curriculum is designed to foster children's understanding of, and stewardship for, the world in which we live. Teachers encourage pupils to explore an integrated liberal arts curriculum through experiences that develop understanding rather than mere memorization. The program of study builds a solid base in the fundamentals of reading, writing and mathematics. Themes running throughout the curriculum include character education, environmental responsibility, use of technology, respect for other cultures, service and community. Blue Oak School offers the benefit of small classes and individual teacher attention. Blue Oak School first opened its doors to students in grades K-4 in 2002. The School now serves children in kindergarten through eighth grade. The Lower School, comprised of grades K-5, is located in the restored Washington School building at 1436 Polk Street. The Middle School, located at 1272 Hayes Street, serves students in grades 6-8. Blue Oak School graduated our first eighth grade class in June 2007. Blue Oak School is a member of the Progressive Education Network and an affiliate member of the California and National Association of Independent Schools. In early 2008, Blue Oak School received accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. We invite you to consider Blue Oak School as an educational opportunity for your child. We hope the information on this website will encourage you to visit us and experience Blue Oak School for yourself. Thank you for your interest. We look forward to meeting you. Blue Oak School admits students of any race, gender, sexual orientation, color and national or ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the School. Blue Oak School does not discriminate on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, color and national or ethnic origin in the administration of educational policies, employment practices or policies, admissions policies, financial assistance programs, athletic programs and other school-administered programs.

Barbara J. Lundberg

Barbara has extensive international management experience as a CEO, board member, and private equity investor in the US and in Europe. She has a strong record of accomplishment, beginning in the US as a venture capitalist and investment banker, and then becoming one of the leading foreign investors and managers in Poland in the chaos of the post-communist world.
 
Today, Poland has one of the strongest economies in Europe. But in the 1990s, Poland's economic transformation was uncertain and the investment environment posed a number of challenges. Barbara quickly discerned how to bridge cultural differences; devise pioneering business, legal and capital market solutions; and implement high standards of corporate governance to create value.
 
Barbara received a BA in Political Science from Jackson College, Tufts University and an MBA in Finance from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.
