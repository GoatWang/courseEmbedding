About Karen Walker Sunglasses

Since launching her eponymous brand in 1988, New Zealand-based fashion designer Karen Walker has won the hearts and minds of many fashionistas with her chic sunglasses collection. Walker juxtaposes opposites — masculine and feminine, luxurious and casual, edgy and sweet — to create shades that vary from boho-retro to elegant and avant-garde. The popular Helter Skelter design, for example, comes in classic tortoiseshell for an everyday casual look, and in black and gold metal for mysterious Hollywood glamour. Walker takes a similar approach to her Perfect Day cat-eye sunglasses, Deep Freeze wayfarers, and oversize frames. In addition to sunglasses, Walker designs women’s clothing, jewelry, and — for good measure — home accessories that have earned her accolades from the likes of <i>Vogue</i>, <i>InStyle</i>, and <i>Nylon</i>.

In this purchase experience i received an email that i had something in my cart and should buy it soon because only a few were left. I clicked on the email link to VIEW MY CART. My cart was empty. I was confused. But i wanted that piece of clothing and went and purchased it. When I went to check out it showed 2 for the quantity. It also showed only 1 left with an exclamation mark. There is no edit button for quantity. I was afraid to REMOVE and start over because maybe i would not get the item. But i had no choice. I ended up doing just that and there was 1 left and i did get the item. I spent a lot more of my time (important in my opinion) that an EDIT button and full cart from the get go would have have saved me. ... Another subject please: the last box i received was LARGE with many clothes items and a few shoe boxes. Some of the clothes items were on hangers. Most were in bags. The state of the clothes when i opened the box was terrible. I believe the reason is because it needed to be packed with smaller packing boxes inside or split up into smaller boxes altogether. It was laughable to have designer clothes on hangers with tissue around buckles only to find it in a mangled, wrinkled mess. And the box itself was half open (likely because it was too heavy), had been re-taped along the way, if i'm not mistaken, and what i used for my returns just so you could see the state of it for yourself. I recommend presenting the clothes as loved if you want the customers to love them too. A real turn off, especially when on the same day i received something from Club Monaco. If you have not done so already, you might want to check out how they love their clothes--it shows in how they present the clothes to the customers they want to love the clothes too. Thank you for reading my thoughts.                   Jul 27, 2017  The one thing i think Shopbop can really improve on is the packaging aspect. Often if several or many things come in a box together they are wrinkled and mangled and a mess. Often one or more are designer items on a hanger with other protective help like tissue around buckles which by the time i receive the garment is laughable because they are all mangled together with a few exceptions.And the large boxes often come half open, taped along the way because they were too heavy. Either consider splitting up the shipping into separate boxes, or invest in packing boxes inside. Or you likely have another great solution that might work better. Practicality aside, the presentation itself is lacking thought and care. I open the box and there are clear bags of clothes that were tossed in there with some other clothes in garment bags and/or on hangers too--all meshed together. If you want the customer to love the clothes, i suggest you present the clothes with love. It doesn't help when on the same day i receive your clothes and/or shoes i also receive packages from other vendors that do it well every time with sale items like Club Monaco and Net-a-Porter. Just something to consider. Thank you for reading some of my thoughts.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
