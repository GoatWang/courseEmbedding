Applicants' Legal Analysis
A. Section 12(d)(1)
1. Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits a registered investment company from acquiring shares of an investment company if the securities represent more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company, more than 5% of the total assets of the acquiring company, or, together with the securities of any other investment companies, more than 10% of the total assets of the acquiring company. Section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act prohibits a registered open-end investment company, its principal underwriter, and any Broker from selling the investment company's shares to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than 3% of the acquired company's voting stock, or if the sale will cause more than 10% of the acquired company's voting stock to be owned by investment companies generally. Section 12(d)(1)(C) prohibits an investment company from acquiring any security issued by a registered closed-end investment company if such acquisition would result in the acquiring company, any other investment companies having the same investment adviser, and companies controlled by such investment companies, collectively, owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of the registered closed-end investment company.
2. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Applicants request an exemption under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act from the limitations of sections 12(d)(1)(A), (B) and (C) to the extent necessary to permit: (i) The Funds of Funds to acquire shares of Underlying Funds in excess of the limits set forth in section 12(d)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act; and (ii) the Underlying Funds, their principal underwriters and any Broker to sell shares of the Underlying Funds to the Funds of Funds in excess of the limits set forth in section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act.
3. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not give rise to the policy concerns underlying sections 12(d)(1)(A), (B), and (C), which include concerns about undue influence by a fund of funds over underlying funds, excessive layering of fees, and overly complex fund structures. Accordingly, applicants believe that the requested exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed structure will not result in the exercise of undue influence by a Fund or its affiliated persons over the Underlying Funds. To limit the control a Fund of Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate [7] 
           may have over an Unaffiliated Fund, applicants propose a condition prohibiting the Adviser and any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser, and any investment company and any issuer that would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or section 3(c)(7) of the Act advised or sponsored by the Adviser or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser (collectively, the “Advisory Group”) from controlling (individually or in the aggregate) an Unaffiliated Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. The same prohibition would apply to any other investment adviser within the meaning of section 2(a)(20)(B) of the Act to a Fund of Funds (“Subadviser”) and any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Subadviser, and any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act (or portion of such investment company or issuer) advised or sponsored by the Subadviser or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Subadviser (collectively, the “Subadvisory Group”).
5. With respect to closed-end underlying funds, applicants submit that one significant difference from open-end underlying funds is that, whereas open-end underlying funds may be unduly influenced by the threat of large-scale redemptions, closed-end underlying funds cannot be so influenced because they do not issue redeemable securities and, therefore, are not subject to large-scale redemptions. On the other hand, applicants state that closed-end underlying funds may be unduly influenced by a holder's ability to vote a large block of stock. To address this concern, applicants submit that, with respect to a Fund's investment in an Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company, (i) each member of the Advisory Group or Subadvisory Group that is an investment company or an issuer that would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act will vote its shares of the Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company in the manner prescribed by section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act and (ii) each other member of the Advisory Group or Subadvisory Group will vote its shares of the Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company in the same proportion as the vote of all other holders of the same type of such Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company's shares. Applicants state that, in this way, an Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company will be protected from undue influence by a Fund of Funds through the voting of the Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company's shares.
6. Applicants propose other conditions to limit the potential for undue influence over the Unaffiliated Funds, including that no Fund of Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate (except to the extent it is acting in its capacity as an investment adviser to an Unaffiliated Investment Company or sponsor to an Unaffiliated Trust) will cause an Unaffiliated Fund to purchase a security in an offering of securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling Start Printed Page 3892syndicate of which a principal underwriter is an Underwriting Affiliate (“Affiliated Underwriting”).[8] 

7. To further ensure that an Unaffiliated Investment Company understands the implications of a Fund of Funds' investment under the requested exemptive relief, prior to its investment in the shares of an Unaffiliated Investment Company in excess of the limit of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, a Fund of Funds and the Unaffiliated Investment Company will execute an agreement stating, without limitation, that each of their boards of directors or trustees (each, a “Board”) and their investment advisers understand the terms and conditions of the order and agree to fulfill their responsibilities under the order (the “Participation Agreement”). Applicants note that an Unaffiliated Investment Company (including an ETF or an Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company) would also retain its right to reject any initial investment by a Fund of Funds in excess of the limits in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act by declining to execute the Participation Agreement with the Fund of Funds. In addition, an Unaffiliated Investment Company (other than an ETF or an Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company whose shares are purchased by a Fund of Funds in the secondary market) will retain its right at all times to reject any investment by a Fund of Funds. Finally, subject solely to the giving of notice to a Fund of Funds and the passage of a reasonable notice period, an Unaffiliated Investment Company (including a closed-end fund) could terminate a Participation Agreement with the Fund of Funds.
8. Applicants state that they do not believe that the proposed arrangement will result in excessive layering of fees. The Board of each Fund of Funds, including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act (the “Independent Trustees”), will find that the advisory fees charged under a Fund of Funds' advisory contract are based on services provided that are in addition to, rather than duplicative of, services provided under the advisory contract(s) of any Underlying Fund in which the Fund of Funds may invest. In addition, the Adviser will waive fees otherwise payable to it by a Fund of Funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation (including fees received pursuant to any plan adopted by an Unaffiliated Investment Company under rule 12b-1 under the Act) received from an Unaffiliated Fund by the Adviser, or an affiliated person of the Adviser, other than any advisory fees paid to the Adviser or an affiliated person of the Adviser by the Unaffiliated Investment Company, in connection with the investment by the Fund of Funds in the Unaffiliated Fund.
9. Applicants further state that any sales charges and/or service fees charged with respect to shares of a Fund of Funds will not exceed the limits applicable to funds of funds set forth in in rule 2830 of the Conduct Rules of the NASD (“NASD Conduct Rule 2830”).[9] 

10. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangement will not create an overly complex fund structure. Applicants note that no Underlying Fund will acquire securities of any other investment company or company relying on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act in excess of the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act, except in certain circumstances identified in condition 11 below.
B. Section 17(a)
1. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits sales or purchases of securities between a registered investment company and any affiliated person of the company. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person to include (a) any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person; (b) any person 5% or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote by the other person; and (c) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the other person.
2. Applicants state that the Funds of Funds and the Affiliated Funds may be deemed to be under the common control of the Adviser and, therefore, affiliated persons of one another. Applicants also state that the Funds of Funds and the Unaffiliated Funds may also be deemed to be affiliated persons of one another if a Fund of Funds acquires 5% or more of an Unaffiliated Fund's outstanding voting securities. Applicants state that the sale of shares by the Underlying Funds to the Funds of Funds and the purchase of those shares from the Funds of Funds by the Underlying Funds (through redemptions) could be deemed to violate section 17(a).[10] 

3. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (i) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company concerned; and (iii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any person or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed transactions satisfy the standards for relief under sections 17(b) and 6(c) of the Act. Applicants state that the terms of the transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching. Applicants state that the terms upon which an Underlying Open-End Fund will sell its shares to or purchase its shares from a Fund of Funds will be based on the net asset value of each Underlying Open-End Fund.[11] 
           Applicants also state that the Start Printed Page 3893proposed transactions will be consistent with the policies of each Fund of Funds and Underlying Open-End Fund, and with the general purposes of the Act.
C. Other Investments by Same Group Investing Funds
1. Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the Act provides that section 12(d)(1) will not apply to securities of an acquired company purchased by an acquiring company if: (i) the acquiring company and acquired company are part of the same “group of investment companies,” as defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Act; (ii) the acquiring company holds only securities of acquired companies that are part of the same “group of investment companies,” as defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Act, government securities, and short-term paper; (iii) the aggregate sales loads and distribution-related fees of the acquiring company and the acquired company are not excessive under rules adopted pursuant to section 22(b) or section 22(c) of the Act by a securities association registered under section 15A of the 1934 Act or by the Commission; and (iv) the acquired company has a policy that prohibits it from acquiring securities of registered open-end management investment companies or registered UITs in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) of the Act.
2. Rule 12d1-2 under the Act permits a registered open-end investment company or a registered UIT that relies on section 12(d)(1)(G) of the Act to acquire, in addition to securities issued by another registered investment company in the same group of investment companies, government securities, and short-term paper: (a) securities issued by an investment company that is not in the same group of investment companies, when the acquisition is in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(A) or 12(d)(1)(F) of the Act; (b) securities (other than securities issued by an investment company); and (c) securities issued by a money market fund, when the investment is in reliance on rule 12d1-1 under the Act. For the purposes of rule 12d1-2, “securities” means any security as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Act.
3. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement would comply with rule 12d1-2 under the Act, but for the fact that the Same Group Investing Funds may invest a portion of their assets in Other Investments. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption from rule 12d1-2(a) to allow the Same Group Investing Funds to invest in Other Investments. Applicants assert that permitting Same Group Investing Funds to invest in Other Investments as described in the application would not raise any of the concerns that section 12(d)(1) of the Act was intended to address.
4. Consistent with its fiduciary obligations under the Act, the Board of each Same Group Investing Fund will review the advisory fees charged by the Same Group Investing Funds' investment adviser(s) to ensure that the fees are based on services provided that are in addition to, rather than duplicative of, services provided pursuant to the advisory agreement of any investment company in which the Same Group Investing Funds may invest.
Applicants' Conditions
A. Investments by Funds of Funds in Underlying Funds
Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief to permit Funds of Funds to invest in Underlying Funds shall be subject to the following conditions:
1. The members of an Advisory Group will not control (individually or in the aggregate) an Unaffiliated Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. The members of a Subadvisory Group will not control (individually or in the aggregate) an Unaffiliated Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. With respect to a Fund's investment in an Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company, (i) each member of the Advisory Group or Subadvisory Group that is an investment company or an issuer that would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act will vote its shares of the Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company in the manner prescribed by section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act and (ii) each other member of the Advisory Group or Subadvisory Group will vote its shares of the Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company in the same proportion as the vote of all other holders of the same type of such Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company's shares. If, as a result of a decrease in the outstanding voting securities of any Unaffiliated Fund, the Advisory Group or a Subadvisory Group, each in the aggregate, becomes a holder of more than 25 percent of the outstanding voting securities of the Unaffiliated Fund, then the Advisory Group or the Subadvisory Group will vote its shares of the Unaffiliated Fund in the same proportion as the vote of all other holders of the Unaffiliated Fund's shares. This condition will not apply to a Subadvisory Group with respect to an Unaffiliated Fund for which the Subadviser or a person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Subadviser acts as the investment adviser within the meaning of section 2(a)(20)(A) of the Act (in the case of an Unaffiliated Investment Company) or as the sponsor (in the case of an Unaffiliated Trust).
2. No Fund of Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate will cause any existing or potential investment by the Fund of Funds in an Unaffiliated Fund to influence the terms of any services or transactions between the Fund of Funds or a Fund of Funds Affiliate and the Unaffiliated Fund or an Unaffiliated Fund Affiliate.
3. The Board of each Fund of Funds, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will adopt procedures reasonably designed to ensure that its Adviser and any Subadviser(s) to the Fund of Funds are conducting the investment program of the Fund of Funds without taking into account any consideration received by the Fund of Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate from an Unaffiliated Fund or an Unaffiliated Fund Affiliate in connection with any services or transactions.
4. Once an investment by a Fund of Funds in the securities of an Unaffiliated Investment Company exceeds the limit of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, the Board of the Unaffiliated Investment Company, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will determine that any consideration paid by the Unaffiliated Investment Company to a Fund of Funds or a Fund of Funds Affiliate in connection with any services or transactions: (a) Is fair and reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services and benefits received by the Unaffiliated Investment Company; (b) is within the range of consideration that the Unaffiliated Investment Company would be required to pay to another unaffiliated entity in connection with the same services or transactions; and (c) does not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. This condition does not apply with respect to any services or transactions between an Unaffiliated Investment Company and its investment adviser(s), or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such investment adviser(s).
5. No Fund of Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate (except to the extent it is acting in its capacity as an investment adviser to an Unaffiliated Investment Start Printed Page 3894Company or sponsor to an Unaffiliated Trust) will cause an Unaffiliated Fund to purchase a security in any Affiliated Underwriting.
6. The Board of an Unaffiliated Investment Company, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will adopt procedures reasonably designed to monitor any purchases of securities by the Unaffiliated Investment Company in an Affiliated Underwriting once an investment by a Fund of Funds in the securities of the Unaffiliated Investment Company exceeds the limit of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, including any purchases made directly from an Underwriting Affiliate. The Board of the Unaffiliated Investment Company will review these purchases periodically, but no less frequently than annually, to determine whether the purchases were influenced by the investment by the Fund of Funds in the Unaffiliated Investment Company. The Board of the Unaffiliated Investment Company will consider, among other things: (a) Whether the purchases were consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the Unaffiliated Investment Company; (b) how the performance of securities purchased in an Affiliated Underwriting compares to the performance of comparable securities purchased during a comparable period of time in underwritings other than Affiliated Underwritings or to a benchmark such as a comparable market index; and (c) whether the amount of securities purchased by the Unaffiliated Investment Company in Affiliated Underwritings and the amount purchased directly from an Underwriting Affiliate have changed significantly from prior years. The Board of the Unaffiliated Investment Company will take any appropriate actions based on its review, including, if appropriate, the institution of procedures designed to ensure that purchases of securities in Affiliated Underwritings are in the best interests of shareholders.
7. Each Unaffiliated Investment Company shall maintain and preserve permanently, in an easily accessible place, a written copy of the procedures described in the preceding condition, and any modifications to such procedures, and will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any purchase in an Affiliated Underwriting occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, a written record of each purchase of securities in an Affiliated Underwriting once an investment by a Fund of Funds in the securities of an Unaffiliated Investment Company exceeds the limit of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, setting forth the: (a) party from whom the securities were acquired, (b) identity of the underwriting syndicate's members, (c) terms of the purchase, and (d) information or materials upon which the determinations of the Board of the Unaffiliated Investment Company were made.
8. Prior to its investment in shares of an Unaffiliated Investment Company in excess of the limit set forth in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, the Fund of Funds and the Unaffiliated Investment Company will execute a Participation Agreement stating, without limitation, that their Boards and their investment advisers understand the terms and conditions of the order and agree to fulfill their responsibilities under the order. At the time of its investment in shares of an Unaffiliated Investment Company in excess of the limit set forth in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i), a Fund of Funds will notify the Unaffiliated Investment Company of the investment. At such time, the Fund of Funds will also transmit to the Unaffiliated Investment Company a list of the names of each Fund of Funds Affiliate and Underwriting Affiliate. The Fund of Funds will notify the Unaffiliated Investment Company of any changes to the list as soon as reasonably practicable after a change occurs. The Unaffiliated Investment Company and the Fund of Funds will maintain and preserve a copy of the order, the Participation Agreement, and the list with any updated information for the duration of the investment and for a period of not less than six years thereafter, the first two years in an easily accessible place.
9. Before approving any advisory contract under section 15 of the Act, the Board of each Fund of Funds, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall find that the advisory fees charged under the advisory contract are based on services provided that are in addition to, rather than duplicative of, services provided under the advisory contract(s) of any Underlying Fund in which the Fund of Funds may invest. Such finding, and the basis upon which the finding was made, will be recorded fully in the minute books of the appropriate Fund of Funds.
10. The Adviser will waive fees otherwise payable to it by a Fund of Funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation (including fees received pursuant to any plan adopted by an Unaffiliated Investment Company pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act) received from an Unaffiliated Fund by the Adviser, or an affiliated person of the Adviser, other than any advisory fees paid to the Adviser or its affiliated person by the Unaffiliated Investment Company, in connection with the investment by the Fund of Funds in the Unaffiliated Fund. Any Subadviser will waive fees otherwise payable to the Subadviser, directly or indirectly, by the Fund of Funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation received by the Subadviser, or an affiliated person of the Subadviser, from an Unaffiliated Fund, other than any advisory fees paid to the Subadviser or its affiliated person by the Unaffiliated Investment Company, in connection with the investment by the Fund of Funds in the Unaffiliated Fund made at the direction of the Subadviser. In the event that the Subadviser waives fees, the benefit of the waiver will be passed through to the Fund of Funds.
11. No Underlying Fund will acquire securities of any other investment company or company relying on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act, in excess of the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act, except to the extent that such Underlying Fund: (a) acquires such securities in compliance with section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act and either is an Affiliated Fund or is in the same “group of investment companies” as its corresponding master fund; (b) receives securities of another investment company as a dividend or as a result of a plan of reorganization of a company (other than a plan devised for the purpose of evading section 12(d)(1) of the Act); or (c) acquires (or is deemed to have acquired) securities of another investment company pursuant to exemptive relief from the Commission permitting such Underlying Fund to: (i) acquire securities of one or more investment companies for short-term cash management purposes or (ii) engage in inter-fund borrowing and lending transactions.
12. Any sales charges and/or service fees charged with respect to shares of a Fund of Funds will not exceed the limits applicable to funds of funds set forth in NASD Conduct Rule 2830. 
B. Other Investments by Same Group Investing Funds
Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief to permit Same Group Investing Funds to invest in Other Investments shall be subject to the following condition:
1. Applicants will comply with all provisions of rule 12d1-2 under the Act, except for paragraph (a)(2) to the extent that it restricts any Same Group Investing Fund from investing in Other Investments as described in the application.

1.
     Applicants request that the order apply to each existing and each future series of the Trust, and to each existing and future registered open-end management investment company or series thereof which is advised by the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser and which is part of the “same group of investment companies” (as defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Act) as the Trust (each a “Fund” and collectively, “Funds”). All entities that currently intend to rely on the requested order are named as applicants. Any other entity that relies on the order in the future will comply with the terms and conditions of the application.

        Back to Citation
      


2.
     All references to the term “Adviser” include successors-in-interest to the Adviser. A successor-in-interest is limited to an entity that results from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization.

        Back to Citation
      


3.
     For purposes of the request for relief, the term “group of investment companies” means any two or more registered investment companies, including closed-end investment companies, that hold themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes of investment and investor services.

        Back to Citation
      


4.
     Certain of the Underlying Funds may be registered under the Act as either UITs or open-end management investment companies and have obtained exemptions from the Commission necessary to permit their shares to be listed and traded on a national securities exchange at negotiated prices and, accordingly, to operate as exchange-traded funds (collectively, “ETFs” and each, an “ETF”). In addition, certain of the Underlying Funds currently pursue, or may in the future pursue, their investment objectives through a master-feeder arrangement in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act. In accordance with condition 11, a Fund of Funds may not invest in an Underlying Fund that operates as a feeder fund unless the feeder fund is part of the same “group of investment companies” as its corresponding master fund or the Fund of Funds. If a Fund of Funds invests in an Affiliated Fund that operates as a feeder fund and the corresponding master fund is not within the same “group of investment companies” as the Fund of Funds and Affiliated Fund, the master fund would be an Unaffiliated Fund for purposes of the application and its conditions.

        Back to Citation
      


5.
     Applicants state that they do not believe that investments in business development companies present any particular considerations or concerns that may be different from those presented by investments in registered closed-end investment companies.

        Back to Citation
      


6.
     Applicants note that a Fund of Funds will purchase and sell shares of an Underlying Fund that is a closed-end fund through secondary market transactions at market prices rather than through principal transactions with the closed-end fund. Accordingly, applicants are not requesting section 17(a) relief with respect to principal transactions with closed-end funds.

        Back to Citation
      


7.
     A “Fund of Funds Affiliate” is the Adviser, any Subadviser, promoter or principal underwriter of a Fund of Funds, as well as any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of those entities. An “Unaffiliated Fund Affiliate” is an investment adviser(s), sponsor, promoter or principal underwriter of any Unaffiliated Fund or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of those entities.

        Back to Citation
      


8.
     An “Underwriting Affiliate” is a principal underwriter in any underwriting or selling syndicate that is an officer, director, trustee, advisory board member, investment adviser, subadviser or employee of the Fund of Funds, or a person of which any such officer, director, trustee, investment adviser, subadviser, member of an advisory board or employee is an affiliated person. An Underwriting Affiliate does not include any person whose relationship to an Unaffiliated Fund is covered by section 10(f) of the Act.

        Back to Citation
      


9.
     Any references to NASD Conduct Rule 2830 include any successor or replacement Financial Industry Regulatory Authority rule to NASD Conduct Rule 2830.

        Back to Citation
      


10.
     Applicants acknowledge that receipt of any compensation by (a) an affiliated person of a Fund of Funds, or an affiliated person of such person, for the purchase by the Fund of Funds of shares of an Underlying Fund or (b) an affiliated person of an Underlying Fund, or an affiliated person of such person, for the sale by the Underlying Fund of its shares to a Fund of Funds may be prohibited by section 17(e) (1) of the Act. The Participation Agreement also will include this acknowledgement.

        Back to Citation
      


11.
     Applicants note that a Fund of Funds generally would purchase and sell shares of an Underlying Fund that operates as an ETF through secondary market transactions rather than through principal transactions with the Underlying Fund. Applicants nevertheless request relief from sections 17(a)(1) and (2) to permit each Fund of Funds that is an affiliated person, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of an ETF to purchase or redeem shares from the ETF. Applicants are not seeking relief from section 17(a) for, and the requested relief will not apply to, transactions where an ETF could be deemed an affiliated person, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, of a Fund of Funds because an investment adviser to the ETF or an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the investment adviser to the ETF is also an investment adviser to the Fund of Funds. Applicants note that a Fund of Funds will purchase and sell shares of an Underlying Fund that is a closed-end fund (including a business development company) through secondary market transactions at market prices rather than through principal transactions with the closed-end fund. Accordingly, applicants are not requesting section 17(a) relief with respect to principal transactions with closed-end funds (including business development companies).

                             API TRUST








Dear Fellow Shareholders:


It is with great pleasure that we present the annual report to shareholders.
From the inception of API Trust, we have developed a leadership position in
developing and maintaining some of our industry's most diversified and diverse
mutual funds. Three of our funds, the API Trust Growth Fund, Capital Income Fund
and Multiple Index Trust have offered superior performance through the broadest
of diversification. Also our Yorktown Classic Value Trust and our Treasuries
Trust are tightly focused within their portfolio holdings. The right asset
allocation requires the right structure. We believe very strongly in building
our family of funds to enhance your future. Today our funds offer efficient
direct access to the world's financial marketplaces.


The last twelve months we have seen investor enthusiasm drive markets to new
highs across the board. Lead by the NASDAQ technology sector and then followed
closely by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, our domestic markets have done
very, very well. Driving the market, in part, was consumer confidence. Consumer
spending exceeded 6% for the first half of 1999, the largest rise in eleven
years. The market's rise seems to have buoyed consumer confidence, which rose
for the seventh consecutive month in May. The resilience of the economy has
bolstered more optimistic expectations for the remainder of the year. Also
inspiring consumer confidence was one of the lowest levels of inflation in a
generation. As measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), inflation has been
between 1 1/2 and 2%, compared to approximately 4% in the beginning of the
1990's and 10 to 12% in the beginning of the 1980's. Still, inflation worries
have been seeping into the market. The growing conviction that Asian and Latin
American economies are recovering is raising commodity prices, particularly oil.
The price of West Texas Intermediate oil surged from less than $12 in February
to almost $19 in early May. That alone almost guarantees a rise in the
"headline" inflation rate this year, which is the rate of inflation as measured
by the entire CPI. But it's important to note that the Federal Reserve Board
looks primarily at the core inflation rate, which is the CPI minus food and
energy --and the core inflation rate looks as if it will remain low at about 2%
this year.



Fiscal Year 1999 Results for Treasuries Trust




Fixed Income Commentary



For fiscal year ended May 31, 1999 the Treasuries Trust had a total return of
5.11% and its average annualized return since inception of 6.80%. The aggregate
total return since inception is 14.92%. Of course, past performance is no
guarantee of future results. During the twelve month period ended March 31,
1999, the fund was ranked #1 out of twenty funds in the Government Bond category
as reported by Lipper Analytical Services and Morningstar. Where can we expect
to go from here? The fundamentals by which we judge the health of the economy
have been stretched to the upper limits. Unemployment stands at a twenty- nine
year low of 4.2% and eleven states currently have jobless rates of under 3%.
While different surveys show vary-

ing rates of wage increases, they all indicate compensation rising significantly
faster than prices. The conference boards latest surveys of companies suggest
that pay raises will average about 4% both for this year and next year. When
productivity gains keep pace with wage increases, there is no squeeze on profit
margins or direct pressures on companies to raise prices. Real inflation and
real interest rates become the real question for the future market cycle.
April's Consumer Price Index jumped 0.7% for an annualized inflation rate of a
frightening 8.4%. The Fed issued its official warning . . . the economy must
slow down and inflation must decrease or interest rates will be raised. The
efficiency by which our markets adjust any and all influence factors suggests to
us that the market will accomplish the Fed's tightening on its own. The market
is very cognizant of the relationship between interest rates and inflation.
Adjusting for a current inflation rate of about 2%, a 5% federal funds rate
would imply a real interest rate of about 3%. This compares with an average
historical rate closer to 2%. However, strong economic growth in the U.S.
economy and vigorous investment demand have driven up the underlying real return
on capital. If the Federal Reserve attempted to peg its target rate well above
this equilibrium real interest rate, the money supply would shrink
substantially. Instead, monetary aggregates continue to grow rapidly, suggesting
that a tightening in Federal Reserve policy is appropriate. Interest rates will
surely rise until we see a leveling of the growth rate in our domestic economy.


Fiscal year 1999 results for the API Trust Growth Fund, Capital Income Fund,
Multiple Index Trust and Yorktown Classic Value Trust



Equity Commentary



For the fiscal year ended May 31, 1999, the API Trust Growth Fund returned
8.46%, the Capital Income Fund returned 6.57%, the Multiple Index Trust returned
17.49%, and the Yorktown Classic Value Trust returned 17.80%. As always, past
performance is no guarantee of future results. The U.S. Market rally started in
the fall of 1998 and was fueled by investor appetite for growth stocks,
particularly technology, communications and Internet-related stocks. On March
29,1999 the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 10,000 for the first time
and the broader averages also flirted with their all-time highs. However, market
activity was narrow.


Roughly one-third of the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index came
from just two stocks, Microsoft Corp. and America Online, Inc. The divergence
between large and small cap stocks widened dramatically -- as indicated by the
Russell 2000 Index's decline of more than 16%. For the twelve month period, only
value stocks broke free and reversed their trend to finally outperform the
overheated technology sector by the end of May.


Despite our concerns about the technology sector's lofty valuations, the broad
markets both domestic and overseas are supporting good economic news that is
getting better. The U.S. economy is growing at a healthy 3 to 3 1/2% annual
rate, and unemployment remains at near historical lows with only a trace of
inflation. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of Gross Domestic
Product growth, is high, and so far in 1999 corporate profits have been much
stronger than had been expected.


However, we do see some vulnerability. Trade is a weak spot in the economy
right now. Exports of U.S. goods and services dropped in the first quarter
while imports soared. This reflects the fact that the U.S. is one of the few
countries financially fit enough to buy goods produced elsewhere in the world.
But for as long as less vibrant international economies are unable to buy U.S.
goods, the profitability of U.S. companies trying to export will be challenged.

When you think about it, vulnerability in regard to the international economy is
nothing new. Globally, the outlook is slightly more positive than it was a few
months ago. For example, the European markets are slowing down, which will most
likely lead to the central bank lowering interest rates in order to boost
domestic spending. In many countries in Europe, there are no fixed-rate
mortgages, only adjustable-rate mortgages. When interest rates go down,
mortgages are reduced and homeowners spend money elsewhere. This has a huge
impact on consumer spending, and will help European equities in the long term.
Additionally, the situation in Japan remains unchanged. And, problems in the
emerging markets haven't had the negative impact many people expected both the
Mexican and Brazilian stock markets have actually risen in the past three
months.



Going Forward



In summary, there are concerns that the current economy is unsustainable and we
soon could see an abrupt end. In many cases, however, people are looking for a
slowdown because they are fearful growth will drive up inflation -- these are
particularly older investors who are accustomed to inflation accompanying
growth. But we currently just don't see the pressure toward inflation at all, so
there's no reason to want a slowdown. The best approach now, as in any market,
is to diversify and invest for the long term.


PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Trust's independent auditors, have completed
their annual examination, and audited financial statements accompany this
report.


Thank you for your continued confidence. We look forward to the future with your
support.


Best Regards,

AMERICAN PENSION INVESTORS TRUST

GROWTH FUND






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1. Organization:


American Pension Investors Trust (the "Trust") is organized as a
Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a diversified, open-end
management investment company. It is composed of six separate portfolios. The
accompanying financial statements include only the Growth Fund (the "Fund").


The Fund's investment objective is growth of capital. The Fund seeks to
achieve its objective by investing primarily in mutual funds that invest
primarily in common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
common stock (such as convertible preferred stock, convertible debentures or
warrants) and that seek long-term capital growth or appreciation.


2. Significant Accounting Policies:


a. Portfolio Valuation


The investments of the Fund consist primarily of mutual funds that are
valued daily at their respective closing net asset values in accordance
with the 1940 Act. Equity securities listed or regularly traded on a
securities exchange are valued at the last quoted sales price on the
exchange where they are principally traded.


b. Security Transactions and Investment Income


Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains
and losses from security transactions are reported on an identified-cost
basis for both financial statement and federal income tax purposes.
Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income and expenses are recorded on an accrual
basis.


c. Federal Income Taxes


The Trust's policy is for the Funds to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies
and to distribute all of its investment company taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.


As of May 31, 1999, the aggregate cost of investments for federal income
tax purposes, the net unrealized appreciation on a federal income tax
basis, and the gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation with respect
to securities where there is an excess of value over tax cost or tax cost
over value were $56,781,511, $12,321,639, $12,708,691 and $387,052,
respectively.


d. Use of Estimates


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements

2. Significant Accounting Policies, continued:


and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


e. Cash and Cash Equivalents


Cash and cash equivalents include amounts invested in overnight money
market accounts, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
These amounts are invested in one financial institution.


3. Investment Advisory Agreement:


Yorktown Management & Research Company, Inc. (the "Advisor"), whose principal
stockholder is also a trustee of the Trust, serves as the Fund's investment
advisor and manager. For its services, the Advisor receives a fee, calculated
daily and payable monthly, at an annual rate of 1.00% of the first $100
million of the average daily net assets of the Fund and .75% of the average
daily net assets exceeding $100 million. The Advisor reduces its advisory
fees (not below zero) to the extent that the Distributor (see Note 4)
receives any dealer reallowances or 12b-1 fees resulting from the Fund's
purchase of shares of underlying funds. During the year ended May 31, 1999,
the Advisor waived $184,052 of its fees.


4. Distribution Plan and Fees:


Yorktown Distributors, Inc. (the "Distributor") distributes shares of the
Fund pursuant to a Rule 12b-1 distribution plan adopted by the Trust. The
plan provides that the Distributor shall receive annual fees of 1.00% of the
Fund's average daily net assets.


In addition, to the extent possible, the Distributor is generally designated
as the dealer entitled to receive the dealer reallowance portion of the sales
charge on purchases of underlying load fund shares by the Fund. During the
year ended May 31, 1999, the Distributor received $184,052 from brokerage
commissions earned on its execution of purchases of portfolio investments for
the Fund. The principal stockholder of the Distributor is also a trustee of
the Trust.


A 1.50% contingent deferred sales charge in generally imposed on redemptions
made within five years of the date that Fund shares are purchased.


5. Investment Activity:


For the year ended May 31, 1999, there were no purchases or sales of U.S.
government obligations. Purchases and sales of securities other than
short-term obligations and U.S. government obligations amounted to
$60,564,795 and $71,642,160, respectively.

      Net assets applicable to outstanding shares of

                                                             ===========








In order for the Fund's capital accounts and distributions to reflect the tax
character of certain transactions $693,413 of net operating losses was
reclassified to paid-in capital, $386,858 of short-term capital gains was
reclassified to undistributed net investment income, and $492,090 of
short-term capital gain distributions was reclassified to cover the prior
year net investment income underdistribution during the year ended May 31,
1999. The results of operations and net assets were not affected by the
reclassification.

AMERICAN PENSION INVESTORS TRUST

CAPITAL INCOME FUND






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1. Organization:


American Pension Investors Trust (the "Trust") is organized as a
Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a diversified, open-end
management investment company. It is composed of six separate portfolios. The
accompanying financial statements include only the Capital Income Fund (the
"Fund").


The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek to achieve high current
income. The Fund's secondary objective is growth of capital and income. The
Fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing primarily in mutual funds,
at least 65% of which seek to achieve an objective of high current income by
investing in income-producing equity securities, long or short-term bonds and
other fixed-income securities (such as U.S. government securities, commercial
paper and preferred stock).


2. Significant Accounting Policies:


a. Portfolio Valuation


The investments of the Fund consist primarily of mutual funds that are
valued daily at their respective closing net asset values in accordance
with the 1940 Act. Equity securities listed or regularly traded on a
securities exchange are valued at the last quoted sales price on the
exchange where they are principally traded.


b. Security Transactions and Investment Income


Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains
and losses from security transactions are reported on an identified-cost
basis for both financial statement and federal income tax purposes.
Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income and expenses are recorded on an accrual
basis.


c. Federal Income Taxes


The Trust's policy is for the Fund to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies
and to distribute all of its investment company taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.


As of May 31, 1999, the aggregate cost of investments for federal income
tax purposes, the net unrealized appreciation on a federal income tax
basis, and the gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation with respect
to securities where there is an excess of value over tax cost or tax cost
over value were $11,503,827, $1,796,567, $1,879,630 and $83,063,
respectively.


d. Use of Estimates


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements

2. Significant Accounting Policies, continued:


and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


e. Cash and Cash Equivalents


Cash and cash equivalents include amounts invested in overnight money
market accounts, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
These amounts are invested in one financial institution.


3. Investment Advisory Agreement:


Yorktown Management & Research Company, Inc. (the "Advisor"), whose principal
stockholder is also a trustee of the Trust, serves as the Fund's investment
advisor and manager. For its services, the Advisor receives a fee, calculated
daily and payable monthly, at an annual rate of .60% of the average daily net
assets of the Fund. The Advisor reduces its advisory fees (not below zero) to
the extent that the Distributor (see Note 4) receives any dealer reallowances
or 12b-1 fees resulting from the Fund's purchase of shares of underlying
funds. During the year ended May 31, 1999, the Advisor waived all of its fees
in the amount of $74,342.


4. Distribution Plan and Fees:


Yorktown Distributors, Inc. (the "Distributor") distributes shares of the
Fund pursuant to a Rule 12b-1 distribution plan adopted by the Trust. The
plan provides that the Distributor shall receive an annual fee of .50% of the
Fund's average daily net assets.


In addition, to the extent possible, the Distributor is generally designated
as the dealer entitled to receive the dealer reallowance portion of the sales
charge on purchases of underlying load fund shares by the Fund. During the
year ended May 31, 1999, the Distributor received $84,720 from brokerage
commissions earned on its execution of purchases of portfolio investments for
the Fund. The principal stockholder of the Distributor is also a trustee of
the Trust.


A 1.50% contingent deferred sales charge in generally imposed on redemptions
made within five years of the date that Fund shares are purchased.


5. Investment Activity:


For the year ended May 31, 1999, there were no purchases or sales of U.S.
government obligations. Purchases and sales of securities other than
short-term obligations and U.S. government obligations amounted to
$10,872,662 and $9,402,080, respectively.

Paid-in capital                                               $ 10,931,177
Accumulated net investment income                                  100,136
Accumulated net realized gain from security transactions           995,288

                                                              ------------
      Net assets applicable to outstanding shares of
       beneficial interest                                    $ 13,823,168
                                                              ============








In order for the Fund's capital accounts and distributions to reflect the tax
character of certain transactions, $89,619 of short-term capital gains was
reclassified to undistributed net investment income during the year ended May
31, 1999. The results of operations and net assets were not affected by the
reclassification.

AMERICAN PENSION INVESTORS TRUST

MULTIPLE INDEX TRUST






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1. Organization:


American Pension Investors Trust (the "Trust") is organized as a
Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a diversified, open-end
management investment company. It is composed of six separate portfolios. The
accompanying financial statements include only the Multiple Index Trust (the
"Fund").


The Fund's investment objective is to maximize total return from capital
growth and income. The Fund seeks to achieve its ojbective by investing at
least 65% of its total assets in shares of other open-end investment
companies whose portfolios mirror those of one index or another of market
securities. A 1.50% contingent deferred sales charge is generally imposed on
redemptions made within five years of the date that fund shares are
purchased.


2. Significant Accounting Policies:


a. Portfolio Valuation


The investments of the Fund consist primarily of mutual funds that are
valued daily at their respective closing net asset values in accordance
with the 1940 Act. Equity securities listed or regularly traded on a
securities exchange are valued at the last quoted sales price on the
exchange where they are principally traded.


b. Security Transactions and Investment Income


Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains
and losses from security transactions are reported on an identified-cost
basis for both financial statement and federal income tax purposes.
Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income and expenses are recorded on an accrual
basis.


c. Organizaiton Expenses


Costs incurred by the Fund in connection with its organization and
initial registration have been amortized evenly over two years. At May
31, 1999, no such unamortized costs remained.


d. Federal Income Taxes


The Trust's policy is for the Fund to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute all of its investment company taxable income
to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
required.


As of May 31, 1999, the aggregate cost of investments for federal income
tax purposes, the net unrealized appreciation on a federal income tax
basis, and the gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation with respect
to securities where there is an excess of value over tax cost or tax cost
over value were $4,151,401, $777,372, $788,997 and $11,625, respectively.

MULTIPLE INDEX TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued



2. Significant Accounting Policies, continued:


e. Cash and Cash Equivalents


Cash and cash equivalents include amounts invested in overnight money
market accounts, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
These amounts are invested in one financial institution.


f. Use of Estimates


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.


3. Investment Advisory Agreement:


Yorktown Management & Research Company, Inc. (the "Advisor"), whose principal
stockholder is also a trustee of the Trust, serves as the Fund's investment
advisor and manager. For its services, the Advisor receives a fee, calculated
daily and payable monthly, at an annual rate of .70% of the average daily net
assets of the Fund. For the year ended May 31, 1999, the Advisor voluntarily
waived all of its advisory fees in the amount of $28,785. In addition, the
Advisor voluntarily reimbursed $9,585 of the Fund's operating expenses.


4. Investment Activity:


For the period ended May 31, 1999, there were no purchases or sales of U.S.
government obligations. Purchases and sales of securities other than
short-term obligations and U.S. government obligations amounted to
$2,772,653 and $1,355,229, respectively.


5. Composition of Net Assets:


At May 31, 1999, net assets consisted of:








Paid-in capital                                               $ 4,789,666
Accumulated net investment income                                  14,574
Accumulated net realized gain from security transactions           30,704
Unrealized appreciation on investments                            777,372
                                                              -----------
      Net assets applicable to outstanding shares of
       beneficial interest                                    $ 5,612,316
                                                              ===========








In order for the Fund's capital accounts and distributions to reflect the tax
character of certain transactions, $18,077 of short-term capital gains was
reclassified to undistributed net investment income during the year ended May
31, 1999. The results of operations and net assets were not affected by the
reclassification.

YORKTOWN CLASSIC VALUE TRUST






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1. Organization:


American Pension Investors Trust (the "Trust") is organized as a
Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as an open-end management
investment company. It is composed of six separate portfolios. The
accompanying financial statements include only the Yorktown Classic Value
Trust (the "Fund").


The primary investment objective of the Fund is growth of capital; income is
a secondary objective. The Fund seeks to achieve these objectives by
investing primarily in equity securities which the Fund's investment advisor
believes are undervalued in relation to the quality of the securities and the
long-term earning power of their issuers, regardless of short-term
indicators.


2. Significant Accounting Policies:


a. Portfolio Valuation


Equity securities listed or regularly traded on a securities exchange are
valued at the last quoted sales price on the exchange where they are
principally traded. Securities for which market quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under
the direction of the Board of Trustees.


b. Security Transactions and Investment Income


Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains
and losses from security transactions are reported on an identified-cost
basis for both financial statement and federal income tax purposes.
Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income and expenses are recorded on an accrual
basis.


c. Federal Income Taxes


The Trust's policy is for the Fund to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies
and to distribute all of its investment company taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.


As of May 31, 1999, the aggregate cost of investments for federal income
tax purposes, the net unrealized appreciation on a federal income tax
basis, and the gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation with respect
to securities where there is an excess of value over tax cost or tax cost
over value were $17,652,317, $4,222,433, $4,511,382 and $288,949,
respectively.


d. Use of Estimates


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued



2. Significant Accounting Policies, continued:


and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


e. Cash and Cash Equivalents


Cash and cash equivalents include amounts invested in overnight money
market accounts, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
These amounts are invested in one financial institution.


f. Borrowings


The Fund is permitted to borrow up to one-third of the value of its net
assets, before such borrowings, for investment purposes. Such borrowing is
referred to as leveraging. As of May 31, 1999, the balance due for
securities purchased through leveraging was $6,314,000. The average daily
balance during the year ended May 31, 1999 was $4,949,959 or $4.96 per
share, based on average shares outstanding of 997,456. The maximum amount
of borrowings outstanding at any month-end during the year was $6,314,000.
The Fund's investment securities are pledged as collateral under the
borrowing arrangement.


Interest is charged at a rate of 1.50% plus the Fed Funds rate (6.375% as
of May 31, 1999). Such interest amounted to $331,363 for the year ended May
31, 1999.


3. Investment Advisory Agreement:


Yorktown Management & Research Company, Inc. (the "Advisor"), whose principal
stockholder is also a trustee of the Trust, serves as the Fund's investment
advisor and manager. For its services, the Advisor receives a fee, calculated
daily and payable monthly, at an annual rate of .90% of the average daily net
assets of the Fund. For the year ended May 31, 1999, the Advisor voluntarily
waived $21,477 of its fees.


4. Distribution Plan and Fees:

AMERICAN PENSION INVESTORS TRUST

TREASURIES TRUST






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1. Organization:


American Pension Investors Trust (the "Trust") is organized as a
Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a diversified, open-end
management investment company. It is composed of six separate portfolios. The
accompanying financial statements include only the Treasuries Trust (the
"Fund").


The Fund's investment objective is to seek current income while limiting
credit risk. The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing in
obligations of the U.S. Treasury that are guaranteed as to principal and
interest by the full faith and credit of U.S. government. A 1.50% contingent
deferred sales charge is generally imposed on redemptions made within five
years of the date that fund shares are purchased.


2. Significant Accounting Policies:


a. Portfolio Valuation


Fund assets are valued at current market value or, where unavailable, at
fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the
Board of Trustees. U.S. Treasury securities are valued at the mean between
the bid and asked prices.


b. Security Transactions and Investment Income


Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains
and losses from security transactions are reported on an identified-cost
basis for both financial statement and federal income tax purposes.
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
Interest income and expenses are recorded on an accrual basis.


c. Organization Expenses


Costs incurred by the Fund in connection with its organization and initial
registration have been amortized evenly over two years. At May 31, 1999, no
such unamortized costs remained.


d. Federal Income Taxes


The Trust's policy is for the Fund to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies
and to distribute all of its investment company taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.


As of May 31, 1999, the aggregate cost of investments for federal income
tax purposes, the net unrealized depreciation on a federal income tax
basis, the gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation with respect to
securities where there is an excess of value over tax cost or tax cost over
value were $7,485,153, $191,836, $1,212 and $193,048, respectively.

TREASURIES TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued



2. Significant Accounting Policies, continued:


e. Cash and Cash Equivalents


Cash and cash equivalents include amounts invested in overnight money
market accounts, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
These amounts are invested in one financial institution.


f. Use of Estimates


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.


3. Investment Advisory Agreement:


Yorktown Management & Research Company, Inc. (the "Advisor"), whose principal
stockholder is also a trustee of the Trust, serves as the Fund's investment
advisor and manager. For its services, the Advisor receives a fee, calculated
daily and payable monthly, at an annual rate of .40% of the average daily net
assets of the Fund. For the year ended May 31, 1999, the Advisor voluntarily
waived all of its fees in the amount of $18,515. In addition, the Advisor
voluntarily reimbursed $23,711 of the Fund's operating expenses.


4. Investment Activity:


For the year ended May 31, 1999, purchases and sales of U.S. government
obligations amounted to $13,778,854 and $10,336,708, respectively. There
were no purchases and sales of securities other than short-term obligations
and U.S. government obligations.


5. Composition of Net Assets:


At May 31, 1999, net assets consisted of:








Paid-in capital                                               $ 7,574,289
Accumulated net investment income                                  62,112
Accumulated net realized gain from security transactions           59,551
Unrealized depreciation on investments                           (191,836)
                                                              -----------
      Net assets applicable to outstanding shares of
       beneficial interest                                    $ 7,504,116
                                                              ===========

Report of Independent Accountants



To the Board of Trustees of American Pension Investors Trust
and the Shareholders of American Pension Investors Trust:


In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the schedules of investments, and the related statements of operations,
statements of changes in net assets and financial highlights present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of American Pension Investors
Growth Fund, Capital Income Fund, Multiple Index Trust, Yorktown Classic Value
Trust, and Treasuries Trust (five portfolios of American Pension Investors Trust
and collectively referred to as the "Funds"), at May 31, 1999, the results of
each of their operations, the changes in each of their net assets and the
financial highlights for each of the fiscal periods presented in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements and
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Funds' management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at May 31, 1999 by
correspondence with custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

	AMERICAN PENSION INVESTORS TRUST




	SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS OF




	THE API SHORT TERM BOND FUND




	To Be Held on November 29, 2016



	 


	 



	PROXY STATEMENT



	 


	 


	This Proxy Statement is being furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Trustees (the Board of Trustees) of
	American Pension Investors Trust (the Trust) for use at the Special Meeting of Shareholders (the Meeting) of the API Short Term Bond Fund (the Fund), to be held at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on November 29, 2016 at
	the offices of the Trust, located at 2303 Yorktown Avenue, Lynchburg, Virginia 24501 or at any adjournment thereof. The principal business address of the Fund is 2303 Yorktown Avenue, Lynchburg, Virginia 24501.


	As described in more detail below, at the Meeting, the Funds shareholders are being asked to consider the following proposals:


	 




	Proposal 1:


	To approve changing the Funds investment objective.




	 




	Proposal 2:


	To transact any other business, not currently contemplated, that may properly come before the special meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof in the discretion of the proxies or their substitutes.




	Your proxy, if properly executed, duly returned and not revoked, will be voted in accordance with your directions on the proxy. If you
	properly execute and return your proxy but do not provide instructions with respect to a proposal, your proxy will be voted for that proposal. You may revoke a proxy at any time prior to the Meeting by filing with the Secretary of the Trust an
	instrument revoking the proxy, by submitting a proxy bearing a later date, or by attending and voting at the Meeting in person. This Proxy Statement and proxy card were first mailed to shareholders on or about November 8, 2016.


	The Adviser will pay the cost of preparing, printing and mailing the enclosed proxy card(s) and Proxy Statement and all other costs incurred by the Fund in

	telephone, facsimile or otherwise. It is anticipated that broker-dealer firms, custodians, nominees, fiduciaries and other financial institutions will be requested to forward proxy materials to beneficial owners and to obtain approval for the
	execution of proxies.

	PROPOSAL 1: TO APPROVE CHANGING THE FUNDS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE.




	Background and Discussion

	:


	The Funds current
	investment objective is to seek Maximum total return from capital growth and income. The Trust is asking the Funds shareholders to approve changing the Funds investment objective to state, The Funds investment
	objective is to seek income consistent with the preservation of capital.


	The most significant aspect of the change in investment objective is
	the elimination capital growth as an objective of the Fund. If the Funds shareholders approve the change, the Funds objective will be to produce income and preserve capital. Capital growth will no longer be a part of the Funds
	investment strategy. The Advisers management of the Fund will not change in terms of its overall philosophy of seeking maximum diversification. What will change will be the focus of the Advisers investments. The adviser will now focus on
	fixed income securities.


	If the Funds investment objective is changed, the investment strategies and risks of the Fund will change as well. In
	the table below, the Funds investment strategies and risks are set forth, as currently stated and as would become effective if the Funds investment objective is changed.





	INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



	 


	 














	CURRENT




	 



	PROPOSED





	Maximum total return from capital growth and income.


	 


	The Funds investment objective is to seek income consistent with the preservation of
	capital.




	 






	INVESTMENT STRATEGIES








	CURRENT




	 



	PROPOSED






	The Short Term Bond
	Fund invests in securities that, in the Advisers opinion, offer the opportunity for maximum total return from capital growth and income.


	 


	The Adviser exercises a flexible strategy in the selection of investments and is not limited by investment style or asset class. The Fund normally invests in
	the common stock of U.S. and foreign issuers and in other U.S. and foreign securities, including:


	 


	    securities convertible into common stock and securities issued through private
	placements;


	 


	    Underlying Funds;


	 


	    ETFs that
	represent interests in a portfolio of common stocks or fixed income securities seeking to track the performance of a securities index or similar benchmark, such as the S&P 500 Index, the NYSE Composite Index, the NASDAQ Composite Index or the
	Russell 1000 Index, but that also have a component of active management such that the investment manager of the security attempts to outperform the applicable index);


	 


	    real estate investment trusts and other issuers that invest, deal, or otherwise engage
	in transactions in real estate;



	 



	Under normal circumstances, the Short Term Bond
	Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in fixed income securities that, in the Advisers opinion, offer the opportunity for income consistent with preservation of capital. The Funds portfolio will have an average aggregate maturity of
	not more than three years.


	 


	The Adviser exercises a flexible strategy in the selection
	of various types of debt (or fixed income) investments and is not limited by investment style, sector or asset class. The fund seeks to provide diversification by allocating the Funds investments


	among various areas of the fixed income markets.


	 


	The Fund primarily invests in the investment grade debt securities of various types. Such investments primarily include (but not limited to):


	 


	    Corporate debt of
	U.S. and foreign issuers (including emerging market) that are denominated in U.S. Dollars


	 


	    Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, including privately issued
	mortgage-related securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities (privately issued mortgage-related securities are limited to not more than 5% of the Funds total assets)






	 


	7



















	    debt securities
	(domestic and foreign corporate notes and bonds, and structured notes).


	 


	The Adviser
	invests directly in equity or debt securities when it believes attractive investment opportunities exist. Attractive investments are securities that have been identified by the Adviser as trading below their current intrinsic value and that possess
	fundamental attributes that, in the Advisers opinion, indicate significant long term growth and income potential. Although the Adviser considers ratings in determining whether securities convertible into common stock or debt securities are
	appropriate investments for the Fund, such securities may include investments rated below investment grade, commonly known as junk bonds.


	 


	When investing in Underlying Funds, the Adviser considers, among other things, the Underlying Funds past performance and their investment objectives and
	policies, the investment style, reputation and quality of their investment advisers and the Underlying Funds size and cost structure. The Adviser selects ETFs in which to invest based on a number of factors, including an analysis of
	their past performance, market sector and liquidity.


	 


	Through direct investments and indirect investments in


	Underlying Funds, and ETFs, the Short Term Bond Fund may have significant exposure to foreign securities, including emerging market securities, small-cap
	securities and specific sectors of the market. The Adviser may sell a security or redeem shares of an Underlying Fund given a variety of circumstances, such as: when an investment no longer appears to the Adviser to offer the potential to achieve
	the Short Term Bond Funds investment objective; when an investments performance does not meet the Advisers expectations; when an investment opportunity arises that the Adviser believes is more compelling; to realize gains or limit
	losses; or to raise cash to meet shareholder redemptions or to pay expenses.


	 


	The Fund
	may, from time to time, take temporary defensive positions that are inconsistent with the Funds principal investment strategies in attempting to respond to adverse market, economic, political, or other conditions. When the Fund takes a
	defensive position, the Funds assets may be held in cash and/or invested in money market mutual funds, money market instruments, including repurchase agreements or other short term securities considered by the Adviser to be of



	 



	    Securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies or
	government-sponsored enterprises


	 


	    Bonds of foreign government issuers (including its agencies) payable in U.S. dollars


	 


	    Inflation linked
	investments


	 


	    Exchange traded funds with similar investment strategies and objectives


	 


	    Taxable municipal
	bonds and/or tax-exempt municipal bonds Although the Short Term Bond Fund invests primarily in investment-grade debt securities (as designated by S&P, Moodys or Fitch) it may invest a portion of its net assets in securities rated below
	investment grade. Normally we would expect the majority of these investments to be rated in the top tier of below investment grade (i.e. BB designations by S&P). Additionally, the Fund may invest a portion of its net assets in any one or a
	combination of the following types of fixed income securities (but not limited to):


	 


	    Preferred stock, baby bonds


	 


	    High-yield debt
	securities (commonly referred to as lower-rated or junk bonds


	 


	    Senior loans, including bridge loans, assignments, and participations


	 


	    Non-rated
	securities for S&P, Moodys or Fitch


	 


	    Convertible securities, including convertible bonds and preferred stocks The fund
	attempts to manage interest rate risk through its management of dollar-weighted average modified duration of the securities it holds in its portfolio. Under normal conditions, the Funds portfolio will have an average aggregate maturity of not
	more than three years. The Fund also attempts to manage risk through credit analysis with a focus on company assets, free cash flow, capital stack, earnings, economic prospects and debt structure. While not limited by these factors the goal of all
	investments is to provide a reasonable amount of income with the barbell of capital preservation and how they interact within the portfolio. To this end, the fund does not attempt to purchase securities with an attempt to quickly turnover those
	assets.






	 


	8


















	a defensive nature. When the Fund is invested in this manner, it may not achieve its investment objective.


	 



	The Adviser may sell
	a security or redeem shares of an Underlying Fund given a variety of circumstances, such as: when an investment no longer appears to the Adviser to offer the potential to achieve the Short Term Bond Funds investment objective; when an
	investments performance does not meet the Advisers expectations; when an investment opportunity arises that the Adviser believes is more compelling; to realize gains or limit losses; or to raise cash to meet shareholder redemptions or to
	pay expenses.


	 


	The Fund may, from time to time, take temporary defensive positions that
	are inconsistent with the Funds principal investment strategies in attempting to respond to adverse market, economic, political, or other conditions. When the Fund takes a defensive position, the Funds assets may be held in up to 100%
	cash and/or invested in money market mutual funds, money market instruments, including repurchase agreements or other short term securities considered by the Adviser to be of a defensive nature. When the Fund is invested in this manner, it may not
	achieve its investment objective.





	 






	INVESTMENT RISKS








	CURRENT




	 



	PROPOSED







	General
	Risks

	. There is a risk that you could lose all or a portion of your investment in the Fund. The value of your investment in the Fund will go up and down with the prices of the securities in which the Fund invests.


	 



	Equity Security Risk.

	Prices of equity securities generally fluctuate more than
	those of other securities, such as debt securities. Market risk, the risk that prices of securities will decrease because of the interplay of market forces, may affect a single issuer, industry or sector of the economy or may affect the market as a
	whole.


	 



	Company Risk

	. The Fund may invest in securities that involve certain
	special circumstances that the Adviser believes offer the opportunity for long-term capital appreciation. These investments may involve greater risks of loss than investments in securities of well-established companies with a history of consistent
	operating patterns.


	 



	Investment Company Risk.

	Any investment in an open-end or
	closed-end investment company involves risk and, although the Fund invests in a number of Underlying Funds, this practice does not eliminate



	 




	General Risks

	. There is a risk that you
	could lose all or a portion of your investment in the Fund. The value of your investment in the Fund will go up and down with the prices of the securities in which the Fund invests.


	 




	Equity Security Risk.

	Prices of equity securities generally fluctuate more
	than those of other securities, such as debt securities. Market risk, the risk that prices of securities will decrease because of the interplay of market forces, may affect a single issuer, industry or sector of the economy or may affect the market
	as a whole.

	. The Fund may invest in securities
	that involve certain special circumstances that the Adviser believes offer the opportunity for long-term capital appreciation. These investments may involve greater risks of loss than investments in securities of well-established companies with a
	history of consistent operating patterns.



	 



	Investment Company Risk.

	Any
	investment in an open-end or closed-end investment company involves risk and, although the Fund invests in a number of Underlying Funds, this practice does not eliminate






	 


	9



















	investment risk. The value of shares of an Underlying Fund will go up and down in response
	to changes in the value of its portfolio holdings.


	 



	Underlying Fund Risk.

	None
	of the Underlying Funds are or will be affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. Therefore, investment decisions by the investment advisers of the Underlying Funds are made independently of the Fund and the Funds Adviser. The investment adviser
	of one Underlying Fund may be purchasing securities of the same issuer whose securities are being sold by the investment adviser of another Underlying Fund. The result of this would be an indirect expense to the Fund without accomplishing any
	investment purpose.


	 



	Closed-End Fund Risk.

	Shares of closed-end funds frequently
	trade at a price per share that is less than the net asset value per share. There can be no assurance that the market discount on shares of any closed-end fund purchased by the Fund will ever decrease or that when the Fund seeks to sell shares of a
	closed end fund it can receive the net asset value of those shares.


	 



	Business
	Development Companies Risk.

	Business Development Companies (BDCs) are a specialized form of closed-end fund that invest generally in small developing companies and financially troubled businesses. BDCs invest in private
	companies and thinly traded securities of public companies, including debt instruments. Generally, little public information exists for private and thinly traded companies and there is a risk that investors may not be able to make fully informed
	investment decisions. Many debt investments in which a BDC may invest will not be rated by a credit rating agency and will be below investment grade quality. Risks faced by BDCs include: competition for limited BDC investment opportunities; the
	liquidity of a BDCs private investments; uncertainty as to the value of a BDCs private investments; risks associated with access to capital and leverage; and reliance on the management of a BDC. A Funds investments in BDCs
	are similar and include portfolio company risk, leverage risk, market and valuation risk, price volatility risk and liquidity risk.


	 



	Exchange Traded Fund Risk.

	ETFs and index funds are not managed in the traditional sense, using economic, financial and market analysis, and the
	adverse financial situation of an issuer will not directly result in its elimination from the index. In addition,



	 



	investment risk. The
	value of shares of an Underlying Fund will go up and down in response to changes in the value of its portfolio holdings.


	 



	Underlying Fund Risk.

	None of the Underlying Funds are or will be affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. Therefore, investment decisions by the
	investment advisers of the Underlying Funds are made independently of the Fund and the Funds Adviser. The investment adviser of one Underlying Fund may be purchasing securities of the same issuer whose securities are being sold by the
	investment adviser of another Underlying Fund. The result of this would be an indirect expense to the Fund without accomplishing any investment purpose.


	 



	Closed-End Fund Risk.

	Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a price per share that is less than the net asset value per share. There can be no
	assurance that the market discount on shares of any closed-end fund purchased by the Fund will ever decrease or that when the Fund seeks to sell shares of a closed end fund it can receive the net asset value of those shares.


	 




	Business Development Companies Risk.

	Business Development Companies
	(BDCs) are a specialized form of closed-end fund that invest generally in small developing companies and financially troubled businesses. BDCs invest in private companies and thinly traded securities of public companies, including
	debt instruments. Generally, little public information exists for private and thinly traded companies and there is a risk that investors may not be able to make fully informed investment decisions. Many debt investments in which a BDC may invest
	will not be rated by a credit rating agency and will be below investment grade quality. Risks faced by BDCs include: competition for limited BDC investment opportunities; the liquidity of a BDCs private investments; uncertainty as to the value
	of a BDCs private investments; risks associated with access to capital and leverage; and reliance on the management of a BDC. A Funds investments in BDCs are similar and include portfolio company risk, leverage risk, market and
	valuation risk, price volatility risk and liquidity risk.



	 



	Exchange Traded
	Fund Risk.

	ETFs and index funds are not managed in the traditional sense, using economic, financial and market analysis, and the adverse financial situation of an issuer will not directly result in its elimination from the index. In
	addition,






	 


	10



















	investments in ETFs involve risks similar to investments in closed-end funds
	including, but not limited to, the possibility that the shares of ETFs may trade at a market discount.


	 



	Debt Security Risk.

	The values of debt securities held by the Fund are affected by rising and declining interest rates. In general, debt securities with
	longer term maturities tend to fall more in value when interest rates rise than debt securities with shorter terms. A debt security is also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer will weaken and/or an
	issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default, and therefore it may lose value if the issuer is unable to pay interest or repay principal when it is due.


	 



	Junk Bonds or High Yield, High Risk Securities Risk.

	Bonds rated below investment
	grade (i.e., BB or lower by S&P or Ba or lower by Moodys) are speculative in nature, involve greater risk of default by the issuing entity and may be subject to greater market fluctuations than higher rated fixed income securities.


	 



	Foreign Securities Risk.

	The Funds direct or indirect investments in foreign
	securities, including depositary receipts, involve risks not associated with investing in U.S. securities that can adversely affect the Funds performance. Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, may be less liquid, more volatile and
	subject to less government supervision than domestic markets. The value of the Funds investment may be negatively affected by changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies. There may be difficulties enforcing
	contractual obligations, and it may take more time for trades to clear and settle.


	 



	Emerging Market Risk.

	There are greater risks involved in investing in emerging market countries and/or their securities markets. Generally, economic
	structures in these countries are less diverse and mature than those in developed countries, and their political systems are less stable. Investments in emerging markets countries may be affected by national policies that restrict foreign investment
	in certain issuers or industries.


	 



	Small-Cap Company Risk.

	The Funds
	investments in small cap companies may involve greater risks than investments in larger, more established issuers. Smaller companies generally have narrower product lines, more limited financial resources and more limited trading markets for their
	stock, as compared



	 



	investments in
	ETFs involve risks similar to investments in closed-end funds including, but not limited to, the possibility that the shares of ETFs may trade at a market discount.


	 



	Debt Security Risk.

	The values of debt securities held by the Fund are affected by rising and declining interest rates. In general, debt securities with
	longer term maturities tend to fall more in value when interest rates rise than debt securities with shorter terms. A debt security is also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer will weaken and/or an
	issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default, and therefore it may lose value if the issuer is unable to pay interest or repay principal when it is due.


	 



	Junk Bonds or High Yield, High Risk Securities Risk.

	Bonds rated below investment
	grade (i.e., BB or lower by S&P or Ba or lower by Moodys) are speculative in nature, involve greater risk of default by the issuing entity and may be subject to greater market fluctuations than higher rated fixed income securities.

	The Funds direct or indirect investments in foreign
	securities, including depositary receipts, involve risks not associated with investing in U.S. securities that can adversely affect the Funds performance. Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, may be less liquid, more volatile and
	subject to less government supervision than domestic markets. The value of the Funds investment may be negatively affected by changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies. There may be difficulties enforcing

	Emerging Market Risk.

	There are greater risks involved in investing in emerging market countries and/or their securities markets. Generally,
	economic structures in these countries are less diverse and mature than those in developed countries, and their political systems are less stable. Investments in emerging markets countries may be affected by national policies that restrict foreign
	investment in certain issuers or industries.



	 




	Small-Cap Company
	Risk.

	The Funds investments in small cap companies may involve greater risks than investments in larger, more established issuers. Smaller companies generally have narrower product lines, more limited financial resources and more limited
	trading markets for their stock, as compared







	 


	11



















	with larger companies. Their securities may be less well-known and trade less frequently
	and in more limited volume than the securities of larger, more established companies.


	 



	Real Estate Investment Trusts.

	Investments in real estate investment trusts and other issuers that invest, deal, or otherwise engage in transactions in
	or hold real estate or interests therein expose the Fund to risks similar to investing directly in real estate and the value of these investments may be affected by changes in the value of the underlying real estate, the creditworthiness of the
	issuer of the investments, and changes in property taxes, interest rates and the real estate regulatory environment. Convertible Securities. A convertible security is a bond, debenture, note, preferred stock or other security that may be converted
	into or exchanged for a prescribed amount of common stock of the same or a different issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula. A convertible security entitles the holder to receive the interest paid or accrued on
	debt or the dividend paid on preferred stock until the convertible security matures or is redeemed, converted or exchanged. Before conversion or exchange, such securities ordinarily provide a stream of income with generally higher yields than common
	stocks of the same or similar issuers, but lower than the yield on non-convertible debt. The value of a convertible security is a function of (1) its yield in comparison with the yields of other securities of comparable maturity and quality
	that do not have a conversion privilege and (2) its worth, at market value, if converted into or exchanged for the underlying common stock. Convertible securities are typically issued by smaller capitalized companies whose stock prices may be
	volatile. The price of a convertible security often reflects such variations in the price of the underlying common stock in a way that non-convertible debt does not.



	 




	with larger
	companies. Their securities may be less well-known and trade less frequently and in more limited volume than the securities of larger, more established companies.



	 




	Real Estate Investment Trusts.

	Investments in real estate investment trusts and other issuers that invest, deal, or otherwise engage in
	transactions in or hold real estate or interests therein expose the Fund to risks similar to investing directly in real estate and the value of these investments may be affected by changes in the value of the underlying real estate, the
	creditworthiness of the issuer of the investments, and changes in property taxes, interest rates and the real estate regulatory environment. Convertible Securities. A convertible security is a bond, debenture, note, preferred stock or other security
	that may be converted into or exchanged for a prescribed amount of common stock of the same or a different issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula. A convertible security entitles the holder to receive the interest
	paid or accrued on debt or the dividend paid on preferred stock until the convertible security matures or is redeemed, converted or exchanged. Before conversion or exchange, such securities ordinarily provide a stream of income with generally higher
	yields than common stocks of the same or similar issuers, but lower than the yield on non-convertible debt. The value of a convertible security is a function of (1) its yield in comparison with the yields of other securities of comparable maturity
	and quality that do not have a conversion privilege and (2) its worth, at market value, if converted into or exchanged for the underlying common stock. Convertible securities are typically issued by smaller capitalized companies whose stock prices
	may be volatile. The price of a convertible security often reflects such variations in the price of the underlying common stock in a way that non-convertible debt does not.







	As you can see from the above tables, if the Funds investment objective is changed, the Fund will cease to invest in
	securities that are designed to produce capital growth and will concentrate its investments in securities that are designed to produce income and preserve capital. As a result of those investment changes, the Funds risks that are related to
	capital growth securities will be eliminated, and the Funds risks related to income producing securities will remain.

	Board Considerations and Recommendations:



	At a Special Meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, held on September 29, 2016, the Board considered, among other matters, the Advisers
	recommendation that the Funds investment objective be changed. Officers of the Adviser made a presentation to the Board and noted that over the last year or so, they had noticed a growing desire among potential investors for a fund that
	concentrated on income and sought to protect capital. They reminded the Board that in May of 2016, the Funds name had been changed from the API Efficient Frontier Core Income Fund to the API Short Term Bond Fund. The
	reason for the name change had been to conform the Fund more closely to the Funds true investment style. Changing the Funds investment objective as proposed would allow the Short Term Bond Fund to be a true income producing Fund and
	would eliminate the capital growth portion of the Funds portfolio. The Adviser reported that in its discussions with potential investors, the idea of modifying the Short Term Bond Fund had been very well received.


	The Board then deliberated among themselves and sought the assistance of legal counsel and the Trusts Chief Compliance Officer.



	After full and careful consideration, the Board of Trustees unanimously approved the proposed investment objective and recommends that the Funds
	shareholders vote FOR the proposed change of investment objective.




	 


	 





	PROPOSAL 2:  TO TRANSACT ANY OTHER BUSINESS, NOT CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATED, THAT MAY PROPERLY COME BEFORE
	THE MEETING OR ANY ADJOURNMENT THEREOF IN THE DISCRETION OF THE PROXIES OR THEIR SUBSTITUTES



	The proxy holders have no present intention of bringing
	any other matter before the Meeting other than the matters described herein or matters in connection with or for the purpose of effecting the same. Neither the proxy holders nor the Board of Trustees are aware of any matters which may be presented
	by others. If any other business shall properly come before the Meeting, the proxy holders intend to vote thereon in accordance with their best judgment.



	OUTSTANDING SHARES AND VOTING REQUIREMENTS




	Record Date.

	The Board of Trustees has fixed the close of business on September 30, 2016 (the Record Date) as the record date for
	determining shareholders of the Fund entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting or any adjournment thereof. As of the Record Date, there were 19,233,788.14 outstanding shares of beneficial interest of the Fund. Each share is entitled to one
	vote, with proportionate voting for fractional shares.



	5% Shareholders.

	As of the Record Date, the following shareholders owned of record more
	than 5% of the outstanding shares of the Fund. No other person owned of record and, according to information available to the Trust, no other person owned beneficially, 5% or more of the outstanding shares of the Fund on the Record Date.

	Quorum.

	A quorum is the number of shares legally required to be at a meeting in order to conduct
	business, which is more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund at the meeting. The favorable vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund is required to approve the Proposal. The vote of a majority of the
	outstanding shares means the vote of the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares are present or represented by proxy, or
	(2) more than 50% of the Funds outstanding shares. Proxies properly executed and marked with a negative vote or an abstention will be considered to be present at the Meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum for the
	transaction of business. If the Meeting is called to order but a quorum is not present at the Meeting, the persons named as proxies may vote those proxies that have been received with respect to adjournment of the Meeting to a later date. If a
	quorum is present at the Meeting but sufficient votes to approve the proposals described herein are not received, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting not to exceed 120 days from the record date for the
	meeting, to permit further solicitation of proxies. Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares of the Fund represented at the Meeting in person or by proxy. The persons named as proxies will vote those
	proxies received that voted in favor of a proposal in favor of such an adjournment for the proposal and will vote those proxies received that voted against the proposal against any such adjournment.


	Abstentions and broker non-voters are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present but do not represent votes cast with respect
	to the proposal. Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker or nominee for whom an executed proxy is received by the Trust, but are not voted as to one or more proposals because instructions have not been received from the beneficial
	owners or persons entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power. Notwithstanding the foregoing, broker non-votes will be excluded from the denominator of the calculation of the number of votes
	required to approve any proposal to adjourn the Meeting. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will effectively be a vote against the proposal, for which the required vote is a percentage of the outstanding voting shares and will
	have no effect on a vote for adjournment.



	Trustee Votes.

	The Trustees intend to vote all of their shares in favor of the proposals described
	herein. On the Record Date, the Trustees and officers of the Trust as a group owned of record and/or beneficially less than 1% of the outstanding shares of the Fund.

	The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by Tait Weller & Baker, LLP for the audit
	of the annual financial statements of the Trust or for services that are normally provided by Tait Weller & Baker, LLP in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements were $105,000 with respect to the fiscal year ended January

	Audit-Related



	Fees



	 


	No fees were billed in either of the last two fiscal years for assurance and related services by Tait Weller & Baker, LLP that are reasonably related to the
	performance of the audit of the Trusts financial statements and are not reported as Audit Fees in the preceding paragraph.




	Tax Fees


	 


	No fees were billed in either of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by Tait Weller
	& Baker, LLP for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning, except fees for preparing and filing tax returns in the amount of $

	                

	.

	Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures.

	The Trusts Audit Committee has established
	policies and procedures pursuant to which services performed by the Trusts independent registered public accounting firm may be pre-approved. Such services include audit, audit-related, tax and other services. Pre-approval considerations
	include whether the proposed services are consistent with SEC rules on auditor independence and whether the accounting firm is best positioned to provide the most efficient services.






	Annual and Semi-Annual Reports



	The Trust will furnish,
	without charge, a copy of its most recent annual report and most recent semi-annual report succeeding such annual report, if any, upon request. To request the annual or semi-annual report, please call us toll free at 800-544-6060, or write to the
	Trust at 2303 Yorktown Avenue, Lynchburg, VA 24501. The Funds most recent annual and semi-annual reports are available for download at www.apifunds.com






	OTHER MATTERS







	Shareholder Proposals



	As a Massachusetts business trust, the Trust does not intend to, and is not required to hold annual meetings of shareholders, except under certain limited
	circumstances. The Board of Trustees does not believe a formal process for shareholders to send communications to the Board of Trustees is appropriate due to the infrequency of shareholder communications to the Board of Trustees. The Trust has not
	received any shareholder proposals to be considered for presentation at the Meeting. Under the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shareholder proposals may, under certain conditions, be included in the Trusts proxy
	statement for a particular meeting. Under these rules, proposals submitted for inclusion in the Trusts proxy materials must be received by the Trust within a reasonable time before the solicitation is made. The fact that the Trust receives a
	shareholder proposal in a timely manner does not insure its inclusion in its proxy materials, because there are other requirements in the proxy rules relating to such inclusion. Annual meetings of shareholders of the Funds


	 


	16






	are not required as long as there is no particular requirement under the 1940 Act or the Declaration of Trust, which must be met by convening such a shareholder meeting. Any shareholder proposal
	should be sent to David D. Jones, Secretary of the Trust, 2303 Yorktown Avenue, Lynchburg, VA 24501.



	Shareholder Communications with Trustees



	Shareholders who wish to communicate with the Board or individual Trustees should write to the Board or the particular Trustee in care of the Funds,
	at the offices of the Trust as set forth below. All communications will be forwarded directly to the Board or the individual Trustee. Shareholders also have an opportunity to communicate with the Board at shareholder meetings. The Trust does not
	have a policy requiring Trustees to attend shareholder meetings.



	Proxy Delivery



	The Trust may only send one proxy statement to shareholders who share the same address unless the Fund has received different instructions from one or more of
	the shareholders. The Fund will deliver promptly to a shareholder, upon oral or written request, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a shared address to which a single copy of this proxy statement was delivered. By calling or writing the Fund,
	a shareholder may request separate copies of future proxy statements, or if the shareholder is receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement now, may request a single copy in the future. To request a paper or e-mail copy of the proxy statement or
	annual report at no charge, or to make any of the aforementioned requests, write to the Fund at 2303 Yorktown Avenue, Lynchburg, VA 24501, or call the Funds toll-free at 1-800-544-6060

	.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
