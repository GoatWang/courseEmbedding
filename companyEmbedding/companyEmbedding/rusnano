Rusnano (Russian: Роснано) (formerly Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies) is a government-owned[2] joint-stock company established as a $10B Private Equity and Venture Capital Evergreen Fund by the government of Russia and aimed at commercializing developments in nanotechnology. Rusnano's task is to develop the Russian Nanotechnology industry into one whose products will be worth 900 billion rubles by 2015.[3] Rusnano is focused on making growth stage investments and to this end was lead investor in Quanntena Communication's $79M Series G round of preferred financing. Quantenna Communications then successfully completed its initial public offering under the ticker QTNA in October 2016.[4] According to a press release issued by Rusnano, this investment will leverage synergies between Quantenna's portfolio and a number of nanotechnology initiatives that are under way at Rusnano.[5] Rusnano was also the largest investor in MEMS timing pioneer SiTime, which was acquired by Megachips in October 2014.[6]

History[edit]
The law which resulted in the creation of the "Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies" was proposed by several members of the United Russia party on June 2007. The proposal passed its first reading in the State Duma on June 14[7] and its final reading on July 4. The upper house and the Federation Council, approved it on July 6.[8] Initially organized as a state corporation, the company was re-registered on March 11, 2011 as the open joint-stock company Rusnano.[9]
In 2009, Rusnano established an international award in the “nano” field – the Rusnanoprize.[10] The prize is awarded annually in one of the following fields: Optics and Electronics, Nanomaterials, Surface Modification, Medicine, Pharmacology, Biotechnologies, and Green Technologies. The prize fund is worth 3 million rubles.
On 7 September 2007 Vladimir Putin appointed Leonid Melamed, a former deputy CEO of RAO UES, the Director General of Rusnano. On September 22, 2008, President Dmitry Medvedev appointed Anatoly Chubais as the Director General of Rusnano. This same decree removed former Director General Leonid Melamed from his position. Despite this, Melamed is now the president of the European telecommunications giant Effortel and remains on the executive board of the company's Supervisory Council.[11] In 2015, Melamed was temporarily placed on house arrest in an investigation into accusations of "wasting public money".[12] Soon after the arrest, at least five high rank Rosnano managers left Russia.[13][14]
Management bodies[edit]
The CEO of Rusnano is appointed by the Decree of the President of Russia. The Supervisory Council is the highest management body of the corporation. The Supervisory Council appoints members of the Executive Board.
Members of the Supervisory Council as of December 31, 2009[15]

Funds[edit]
The source of financing for the activities of Rusnano in 2008 and 2009 was an asset contribution of 130 billion rubles (US $4.39 billion) from the Russian Federation, received in November 2007. During 2009 capital of Rusnano decreased by 58.768 billion rubles and at year end stood at 76.638 billion rubles (US $2.59 billion). The change in the corporation’s capital is attributable to the return of 66.4 billion rubles of the asset contribution to the Russian Federation, expenditures of 3.617 billion rubbles in fulfillment of the corporation’s purposes, and net income of 11.251 billion rubles earned largely from temporarily free monetary resources deposited in accounts at commercial banks in accordance with recommendations from the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.[16] Rusnano also intends to attract additional investment by issuing state-guaranteed bonds[17]
In 2011, Rusnano suffered US $2.9 billion of net loss under Russian Accounting Standards and closed down 6 investment projects worth $300 million. The company seems to have a shortage of money. In March 2012, Rusnano announced it was closing 13 investment projects estimated at $600 billion, the official reason for the decision was the rejection of the co-investors. In April 2012 announced that it was looking to sell a 10% share by the end of 2012. This is just the beginning of a plan to make 40% of the company private.[18]
Activities[edit]
In 2009 the Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies received 634 requests for project cofinancing. The projects have aggregate budgets of 1.355 trillion rubles of which 712.3 billion rubles were requested from the corporation. A significant percentage of the requests were for new production or modernization of existing processes and fixed assets.
All requests that enter the corporation go through a multi-staged system of expert evaluation. In 2009, for various reasons, 467 projects (including some that had been received in 2008) were denied cofinancing. The Supervisory Council of the corporation approved 54 projects during 2009, projects in solar energy, mechanical engineering, metalwork, nanoelectronics, medicine, and venture financing. The total budget for these projects is 181.6 billion rubles of which 86.6 billion rubles were requested from the corporation. Fifty-three projects that have passed all evaluation steps and the Science and Technology Board will be brought to the Supervisory Council in the first half of 2010.
In sum during 2008–2009, the Supervisory Council of the corporation approved 61 projects. Their budgets total 192.3 billion rubles and include 92.4 billion rubles that RUSNANO will cofinance. A considerable share of these projects is oriented toward the priority areas for modernizing the economy of the country that President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev has declared. These 61 projects are forecasted to earn revenue from sales in excess of 130 billion rubles annually by 2015. In 2008 and 2009 the corporation financed 17 approved projects, disbursing 32.2 billion rubles through the end of 2009. Four manufacturing projects earned their first revenues in 2007—176.5 million rubles.
Investment projects[edit]
All Rusnano projects[19] can be grouped into 6 clusters:[20] 1 solar energy and energy saving[21]



The firm applies an environment friendly approach by financing projects that explore the possibilities of energy technology.



2 nanostructured materials;[22] 3 medicine and biotech;[23] 4 mechanical engineering and metal working;[24] 5 optoelectronics and nanoelectronics;[25]



Rusnano has acquired minority stake in Plastic Logic in 2011. The company planned to set up a factory in Zelenograd where they planned to manufacture lightweight, flexible plastic e-readers and related products, however these plans appear to be cancelled since Plastic Logic decided to shift its focus towards licensing its existing technology instead of actually manufacturing any products.[26][27]



6 infrastructure projects.[28]



One of the most interesting infrastructural investment that Rusnano has backed is the one of BiOptix: the American patented product enables label-free biomolecula analysis in real time without isotope labeling and with minimal human handling.



In 2011 a new subsidiary Liotech was created for production of high-capacity Lithium-ion batteries in cooperation with Chinese factory Thunder Sky.[29] In 2012 Liotech was noted by state auditors for possible corruption-related violations. In 2016 Liotech entered bankruptcy process.[30]

On September 22, 2008, President Dmitry Medvedev appointed Anatoly Chubais as the Director General of Rusnano. This same decree removed former Director General Leonid Melamed from his position. Despite this, Melamed is now the president of the European telecommunications giant Effortel and remains on the executive board of the company's Supervisory Council.[11] In 2015, Melamed was temporarily placed on house arrest in an investigation into accusations of "wasting public money".[12] Soon after the arrest, at least five high rank Rosnano managers left Russia.[13][14]

Funds[edit]
The source of financing for the activities of Rusnano in 2008 and 2009 was an asset contribution of 130 billion rubles (US $4.39 billion) from the Russian Federation, received in November 2007. During 2009 capital of Rusnano decreased by 58.768 billion rubles and at year end stood at 76.638 billion rubles (US $2.59 billion). The change in the corporation’s capital is attributable to the return of 66.4 billion rubles of the asset contribution to the Russian Federation, expenditures of 3.617 billion rubbles in fulfillment of the corporation’s purposes, and net income of 11.251 billion rubles earned largely from temporarily free monetary resources deposited in accounts at commercial banks in accordance with recommendations from the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.[16] Rusnano also intends to attract additional investment by issuing state-guaranteed bonds[17]
In 2011, Rusnano suffered US $2.9 billion of net loss under Russian Accounting Standards and closed down 6 investment projects worth $300 million. The company seems to have a shortage of money. In March 2012, Rusnano announced it was closing 13 investment projects estimated at $600 billion, the official reason for the decision was the rejection of the co-investors. In April 2012 announced that it was looking to sell a 10% share by the end of 2012. This is just the beginning of a plan to make 40% of the company private.[18]
Activities[edit]
In 2009 the Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies received 634 requests for project cofinancing. The projects have aggregate budgets of 1.355 trillion rubles of which 712.3 billion rubles were requested from the corporation. A significant percentage of the requests were for new production or modernization of existing processes and fixed assets.
All requests that enter the corporation go through a multi-staged system of expert evaluation. In 2009, for various reasons, 467 projects (including some that had been received in 2008) were denied cofinancing. The Supervisory Council of the corporation approved 54 projects during 2009, projects in solar energy, mechanical engineering, metalwork, nanoelectronics, medicine, and venture financing. The total budget for these projects is 181.6 billion rubles of which 86.6 billion rubles were requested from the corporation. Fifty-three projects that have passed all evaluation steps and the Science and Technology Board will be brought to the Supervisory Council in the first half of 2010.
In sum during 2008–2009, the Supervisory Council of the corporation approved 61 projects. Their budgets total 192.3 billion rubles and include 92.4 billion rubles that RUSNANO will cofinance. A considerable share of these projects is oriented toward the priority areas for modernizing the economy of the country that President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev has declared. These 61 projects are forecasted to earn revenue from sales in excess of 130 billion rubles annually by 2015. In 2008 and 2009 the corporation financed 17 approved projects, disbursing 32.2 billion rubles through the end of 2009. Four manufacturing projects earned their first revenues in 2007—176.5 million rubles.
Investment projects[edit]
All Rusnano projects[19] can be grouped into 6 clusters:[20] 1 solar energy and energy saving[21]



The firm applies an environment friendly approach by financing projects that explore the possibilities of energy technology.



2 nanostructured materials;[22] 3 medicine and biotech;[23] 4 mechanical engineering and metal working;[24] 5 optoelectronics and nanoelectronics;[25]



Rusnano has acquired minority stake in Plastic Logic in 2011. The company planned to set up a factory in Zelenograd where they planned to manufacture lightweight, flexible plastic e-readers and related products, however these plans appear to be cancelled since Plastic Logic decided to shift its focus towards licensing its existing technology instead of actually manufacturing any products.[26][27]



6 infrastructure projects.[28]



One of the most interesting infrastructural investment that Rusnano has backed is the one of BiOptix: the American patented product enables label-free biomolecula analysis in real time without isotope labeling and with minimal human handling.



In 2011 a new subsidiary Liotech was created for production of high-capacity Lithium-ion batteries in cooperation with Chinese factory Thunder Sky.[29] In 2012 Liotech was noted by state auditors for possible corruption-related violations. In 2016 Liotech entered bankruptcy process.[30]

Rusnano (Russian: Роснано) (formerly Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies) is a government-owned[2] joint-stock company established as a $10B Private Equity and Venture Capital Evergreen Fund by the government of Russia and aimed at commercializing developments in nanotechnology. Rusnano's task is to develop the Russian Nanotechnology industry into one whose products will be worth 900 billion rubles by 2015.[3] Rusnano is focused on making growth stage investments and to this end was lead investor in Quanntena Communication's $79M Series G round of preferred financing. Quantenna Communications then successfully completed its initial public offering under the ticker QTNA in October 2016.[4] According to a press release issued by Rusnano, this investment will leverage synergies between Quantenna's portfolio and a number of nanotechnology initiatives that are under way at Rusnano.[5] Rusnano was also the largest investor in MEMS timing pioneer SiTime, which was acquired by Megachips in October 2014.[6]

History[edit]
The law which resulted in the creation of the "Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies" was proposed by several members of the United Russia party on June 2007. The proposal passed its first reading in the State Duma on June 14[7] and its final reading on July 4. The upper house and the Federation Council, approved it on July 6.[8] Initially organized as a state corporation, the company was re-registered on March 11, 2011 as the open joint-stock company Rusnano.[9]
In 2009, Rusnano established an international award in the “nano” field – the Rusnanoprize.[10] The prize is awarded annually in one of the following fields: Optics and Electronics, Nanomaterials, Surface Modification, Medicine, Pharmacology, Biotechnologies, and Green Technologies. The prize fund is worth 3 million rubles.
On 7 September 2007 Vladimir Putin appointed Leonid Melamed, a former deputy CEO of RAO UES, the Director General of Rusnano. On September 22, 2008, President Dmitry Medvedev appointed Anatoly Chubais as the Director General of Rusnano. This same decree removed former Director General Leonid Melamed from his position.

The change in the corporation’s capital is attributable to the return of 66.4 billion rubles of the asset contribution to the Russian Federation, expenditures of 3.617 billion rubbles in fulfillment of the corporation’s purposes, and net income of 11.251 billion rubles earned largely from temporarily free monetary resources deposited in accounts at commercial banks in accordance with recommendations from the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.[16] Rusnano also intends to attract additional investment by issuing state-guaranteed bonds[17]
In 2011, Rusnano suffered US $2.9 billion of net loss under Russian Accounting Standards and closed down 6 investment projects worth $300 million. The company seems to have a shortage of money. In March 2012, Rusnano announced it was closing 13 investment projects estimated at $600 billion, the official reason for the decision was the rejection of the co-investors. In April 2012 announced that it was looking to sell a 10% share by the end of 2012. This is just the beginning of a plan to make 40% of the company private.[18]
Activities[edit]
In 2009 the Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies received 634 requests for project cofinancing. The projects have aggregate budgets of 1.355 trillion rubles of which 712.3 billion rubles were requested from the corporation. A significant percentage of the requests were for new production or modernization of existing processes and fixed assets.
All requests that enter the corporation go through a multi-staged system of expert evaluation. In 2009, for various reasons, 467 projects (including some that had been received in 2008) were denied cofinancing. The Supervisory Council of the corporation approved 54 projects during 2009, projects in solar energy, mechanical engineering, metalwork, nanoelectronics, medicine, and venture financing. The total budget for these projects is 181.6 billion rubles of which 86.6 billion rubles were requested from the corporation. Fifty-three projects that have passed all evaluation steps and the Science and Technology Board will be brought to the Supervisory Council in the first half of 2010.
In sum during 2008–2009, the Supervisory Council of the corporation approved 61 projects. Their budgets total 192.3 billion rubles and include 92.4 billion rubles that RUSNANO will cofinance. A considerable share of these projects is oriented toward the priority areas for modernizing the economy of the country that President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev has declared. These 61 projects are forecasted to earn revenue from sales in excess of 130 billion rubles annually by 2015. In 2008 and 2009 the corporation financed 17 approved projects, disbursing 32.2 billion rubles through the end of 2009. Four manufacturing projects earned their first revenues in 2007—176.5 million rubles.
Investment projects[edit]
All Rusnano projects[19] can be grouped into 6 clusters:[20] 1 solar energy and energy saving[21]



The firm applies an environment friendly approach by financing projects that explore the possibilities of energy technology.



2 nanostructured materials;[22] 3 medicine and biotech;[23] 4 mechanical engineering and metal working;[24] 5 optoelectronics and nanoelectronics;[25]



Rusnano has acquired minority stake in Plastic Logic in 2011. The company planned to set up a factory in Zelenograd where they planned to manufacture lightweight, flexible plastic e-readers and related products, however these plans appear to be cancelled since Plastic Logic decided to shift its focus towards licensing its existing technology instead of actually manufacturing any products.[26][27]



6 infrastructure projects.[28]



One of the most interesting infrastructural investment that Rusnano has backed is the one of BiOptix: the American patented product enables label-free biomolecula analysis in real time without isotope labeling and with minimal human handling.



In 2011 a new subsidiary Liotech was created for production of high-capacity Lithium-ion batteries in cooperation with Chinese factory Thunder Sky.[29] In 2012 Liotech was noted by state auditors for possible corruption-related violations. In 2016 Liotech entered bankruptcy process.[30]

Rusnano (Russian: Роснано) (formerly Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies) is a government-owned[2] joint-stock company established as a $10B Private Equity and Venture Capital Evergreen Fund by the government of Russia and aimed at commercializing developments in nanotechnology. Rusnano's task is to develop the Russian Nanotechnology industry into one whose products will be worth 900 billion rubles by 2015.[3] Rusnano is focused on making growth stage investments and to this end was lead investor in Quanntena Communication's $79M Series G round of preferred financing. Quantenna Communications then successfully completed its initial public offering under the ticker QTNA in October 2016.[4] According to a press release issued by Rusnano, this investment will leverage synergies between Quantenna's portfolio and a number of nanotechnology initiatives that are under way at Rusnano.[5] Rusnano was also the largest investor in MEMS timing pioneer SiTime, which was acquired by Megachips in October 2014.[6]

History[edit]
The law which resulted in the creation of the "Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies" was proposed by several members of the United Russia party on June 2007. The proposal passed its first reading in the State Duma on June 14[7] and its final reading on July 4. The upper house and the Federation Council, approved it on July 6.[8] Initially organized as a state corporation, the company was re-registered on March 11, 2011 as the open joint-stock company Rusnano.[9]
In 2009, Rusnano established an international award in the “nano” field – the Rusnanoprize.[10] The prize is awarded annually in one of the following fields: Optics and Electronics, Nanomaterials, Surface Modification, Medicine, Pharmacology, Biotechnologies, and Green Technologies. The prize fund is worth 3 million rubles.
On 7 September 2007 Vladimir Putin appointed Leonid Melamed, a former deputy CEO of RAO UES, the Director General of Rusnano. On September 22, 2008, President Dmitry Medvedev appointed Anatoly Chubais as the Director General of Rusnano. This same decree removed former Director General Leonid Melamed from his position. Despite this, Melamed is now the president of the European telecommunications giant Effortel and remains on the executive board of the company's Supervisory Council.[11] In 2015, Melamed was temporarily placed on house arrest in an investigation into accusations of "wasting public money".[12] Soon after the arrest, at least five high rank Rosnano managers left Russia.[13][14]
Management bodies[edit]
The CEO of Rusnano is appointed by the Decree of the President of Russia. The Supervisory Council is the highest management body of the corporation. The Supervisory Council appoints members of the Executive Board.

Rusnano (Russian: Роснано) (formerly Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies) is a government-owned[2] joint-stock company established as a $10B Private Equity and Venture Capital Evergreen Fund by the government of Russia and aimed at commercializing developments in nanotechnology. Rusnano's task is to develop the Russian Nanotechnology industry into one whose products will be worth 900 billion rubles by 2015.[3] Rusnano is focused on making growth stage investments and to this end was lead investor in Quanntena Communication's $79M Series G round of preferred financing. Quantenna Communications then successfully completed its initial public offering under the ticker QTNA in October 2016.[4] According to a press release issued by Rusnano, this investment will leverage synergies between Quantenna's portfolio and a number of nanotechnology initiatives that are under way at Rusnano.[5] Rusnano was also the largest investor in MEMS timing pioneer SiTime, which was acquired by Megachips in October 2014.[6]

History[edit]
The law which resulted in the creation of the "Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies" was proposed by several members of the United Russia party on June 2007. The proposal passed its first reading in the State Duma on June 14[7] and its final reading on July 4. The upper house and the Federation Council, approved it on July 6.[8] Initially organized as a state corporation, the company was re-registered on March 11, 2011 as the open joint-stock company Rusnano.[9]
In 2009, Rusnano established an international award in the “nano” field – the Rusnanoprize.[10] The prize is awarded annually in one of the following fields: Optics and Electronics, Nanomaterials, Surface Modification, Medicine, Pharmacology, Biotechnologies, and Green Technologies. The prize fund is worth 3 million rubles.
On 7 September 2007 Vladimir Putin appointed Leonid Melamed, a former deputy CEO of RAO UES, the Director General of Rusnano. On September 22, 2008, President Dmitry Medvedev appointed Anatoly Chubais as the Director General of Rusnano. This same decree removed former Director General Leonid Melamed from his position. Despite this, Melamed is now the president of the European telecommunications giant Effortel and remains on the executive board of the company's Supervisory Council.[11] In 2015, Melamed was temporarily placed on house arrest in an investigation into accusations of "wasting public money".[12] Soon after the arrest, at least five high rank Rosnano managers left Russia.[13][14]
Management bodies[edit]
The CEO of Rusnano is appointed by the Decree of the President of Russia. The Supervisory Council is the highest management body of the corporation. The Supervisory Council appoints members of the Executive Board.
Members of the Supervisory Council as of December 31, 2009[15]

Funds[edit]
The source of financing for the activities of Rusnano in 2008 and 2009 was an asset contribution of 130 billion rubles (US $4.39 billion) from the Russian Federation, received in November 2007. During 2009 capital of Rusnano decreased by 58.768 billion rubles and at year end stood at 76.638 billion rubles (US $2.59 billion). The change in the corporation’s capital is attributable to the return of 66.4 billion rubles of the asset contribution to the Russian Federation, expenditures of 3.617 billion rubbles in fulfillment of the corporation’s purposes, and net income of 11.251 billion rubles earned largely from temporarily free monetary resources deposited in accounts at commercial banks in accordance with recommendations from the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.[16] Rusnano also intends to attract additional investment by issuing state-guaranteed bonds[17]
In 2011, Rusnano suffered US $2.9 billion of net loss under Russian Accounting Standards and closed down 6 investment projects worth $300 million. The company seems to have a shortage of money. In March 2012, Rusnano announced it was closing 13 investment projects estimated at $600 billion, the official reason for the decision was the rejection of the co-investors. In April 2012 announced that it was looking to sell a 10% share by the end of 2012. This is just the beginning of a plan to make 40% of the company private.[18]
Activities[edit]
In 2009 the Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies received 634 requests for project cofinancing. The projects have aggregate budgets of 1.355 trillion rubles of which 712.3 billion rubles were requested from the corporation. A significant percentage of the requests were for new production or modernization of existing processes and fixed assets.
All requests that enter the corporation go through a multi-staged system of expert evaluation. In 2009, for various reasons, 467 projects (including some that had been received in 2008) were denied cofinancing. The Supervisory Council of the corporation approved 54 projects during 2009, projects in solar energy, mechanical engineering, metalwork, nanoelectronics, medicine, and venture financing. The total budget for these projects is 181.6 billion rubles of which 86.6 billion rubles were requested from the corporation. Fifty-three projects that have passed all evaluation steps and the Science and Technology Board will be brought to the Supervisory Council in the first half of 2010.
In sum during 2008–2009, the Supervisory Council of the corporation approved 61 projects. Their budgets total 192.3 billion rubles and include 92.4 billion rubles that RUSNANO will cofinance. A considerable share of these projects is oriented toward the priority areas for modernizing the economy of the country that President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev has declared. These 61 projects are forecasted to earn revenue from sales in excess of 130 billion rubles annually by 2015. In 2008 and 2009 the corporation financed 17 approved projects, disbursing 32.2 billion rubles through the end of 2009. Four manufacturing projects earned their first revenues in 2007—176.5 million rubles.
Investment projects[edit]
All Rusnano projects[19] can be grouped into 6 clusters:[20] 1 solar energy and energy saving[21]



The firm applies an environment friendly approach by financing projects that explore the possibilities of energy technology.



2 nanostructured materials;[22] 3 medicine and biotech;[23] 4 mechanical engineering and metal working;[24] 5 optoelectronics and nanoelectronics;[25]



Rusnano has acquired minority stake in Plastic Logic in 2011. The company planned to set up a factory in Zelenograd where they planned to manufacture lightweight, flexible plastic e-readers and related products, however these plans appear to be cancelled since Plastic Logic decided to shift its focus towards licensing its existing technology instead of actually manufacturing any products.[26][27]



6 infrastructure projects.[28]



One of the most interesting infrastructural investment that Rusnano has backed is the one of BiOptix: the American patented product enables label-free biomolecula analysis in real time without isotope labeling and with minimal human handling.



In 2011 a new subsidiary Liotech was created for production of high-capacity Lithium-ion batteries in cooperation with Chinese factory Thunder Sky.[29] In 2012 Liotech was noted by state auditors for possible corruption-related violations. In 2016 Liotech entered bankruptcy process.[30]

RUSNANO to Invest in Basalt Nanocomposite Plastics Production





(Nanowerk News) RUSNANO and Galen company have signed an investment agreement for establishing production of composite nanostructured polymer based on basalt fiber. The project has a total budget of 500 million rubles of which RUSNANO will co-invest 200 million rubles. Project planners expect production to reach 2,500 tons to 3,000 tons in 2016. Products include shaft lining for the mining industry; armature, flexible connectors, and rawl plugs for the construction industry; composite alluvial drill rods for oil production; and poles for street lighting and power transmission lines.
                     



Basalt plastic armature is as strong as steel and a great deal more durable. Moreover, composite material based on basalt fiber does not corrode. This is very important for structures that must operate where moisture is high or salt is present, particularly bridge supports. The material is considerably lighter than steel (on average 70 percent), simplifying transportation and making it less costly. Under some circumstances, the material extends the service life of equipment by reducing the stress load, for example, in alluvial drill rods used to produce oil. Because the composite is shock absorbent and impact safe, the material is ideally suited to street lighting poles.
                     



"Galen is experienced in developing unique technological solutions. Take, for example its armature for construction of a single-span bridge in Northern Ireland or its flexible connectors for the Passive House in England, an innovative project. By the way, the strict requirement the British had for fire resistance of materials prompted the company's engineers to begin experiments with nanomodifiers for polymer connectors," noted RUSNANO Managing Director Alexander Kondrashov.
                     



The composite materials that Galen manufactures contain basalt fiber produced using pultrusion, a continuous molding process, with an epoxy binder that is resistant to halogens, acids, and alkalis. The disadvantage of the composite's relatively low combustion temperature has been overcome by adding to the epoxy binder a small amount of nanoparticles of aluminosilicate montmorillonite based largely on clay. This also improves the strength of the composite under flexion.
                     



Technical information




Pultrusion is a production technology for manufacturing construction industry items using plastic fibers in a continuous process. The name pultrusion comes from the English words pull and extrusion. Saturated with polymer binding material, the filler (rope, linen, woven tape, fiberglass, carbon fiber, or organic fiber) is stretched through a heated die that determines its form. The polymer binder is usually made of epoxy resin, unsaturated polyesters, or thermoplastics. Galen uses epoxy resins to which nanoparticles of aluminosilicate montmorillonite have been added for chemical stability, resistance to heat, and impact and fatigue endurance.

This particular method for preparing composite materials has superior compatibility with the environment: CO2 emissions during production of a single run of basalt plastic are one thirty-fifth to one forty-ninth the CO2 emitted during production of regular steel or stainless steel armature. Measured by energy consumption, a kilogram of the composite armature requires only two kilowatts to produce while a kilogram of the steel armature consumes three times the energy.

2 nanostructured materials;[22] 3 medicine and biotech;[23] 4 mechanical engineering and metal working;[24] 5 optoelectronics and nanoelectronics;[25]



Rusnano has acquired minority stake in Plastic Logic in 2011. The company planned to set up a factory in Zelenograd where they planned to manufacture lightweight, flexible plastic e-readers and related products, however these plans appear to be cancelled since Plastic Logic decided to shift its focus towards licensing its existing technology instead of actually manufacturing any products.[26][27]



6 infrastructure projects.[28]



One of the most interesting infrastructural investment that Rusnano has backed is the one of BiOptix: the American patented product enables label-free biomolecula analysis in real time without isotope labeling and with minimal human handling.



In 2011 a new subsidiary Liotech was created for production of high-capacity Lithium-ion batteries in cooperation with Chinese factory Thunder Sky.[29] In 2012 Liotech was noted by state auditors for possible corruption-related violations. In 2016 Liotech entered bankruptcy process.[30]

Alcoa, RUSNANO to Produce Oil & Gas Aluminum Drill Pipe with Antiwear Coating Under Latest MOU



Published on 2013-06-24. Author :
SpecialChem









ST. PETERSBURG, Russia & NEW YORK -- Alcoa (NYSE:AA) and OJSC RUSNANO will produce technologically advanced oil and gas aluminum drill pipe finished with a life-extending antiwear coating under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) recently signed by the companies. With the help of the Alcoa Technical Center, the parties intend to pursue the potential application of a nanotechnology-based coating for the aluminum drill pipe to enhance its wear resistance in harsh corrosive drilling environments.
Alcoa Chairman and CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and OJSC RUSNANO Chief Executive Officer Anatoly Chubais signed the MOU at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.
"Complex oil and gas development projects require drilling equipment with enhanced capabilities," Chubais said. "Aluminum drill pipe with antiwear nano-coating would enable directional and deep drilling in aggressive, corrosive environments. We expect our joint efforts with Alcoa will create a differentiated product for customers in the oil and gas industry."
Mr. Kleinfeld added, "Alcoa's deep technological capabilities, combined with the expertise of our partner RUSNANO, will open new opportunities for developing the aluminum industry in Russia. Alcoa is setting a high standard for innovation and extending our product range in the oil and gas segment."
With facilities in Samara and Belaya Kalitva, Alcoa is Russia's largest producer of fabricated aluminum, manufacturing a wide range of flat rolled products, forgings and extrusions for a variety of end markets including aerospace and automotive. Under terms of the MOU, Alcoa will leverage its Samara facility to produce aluminum drill pipe with hot fit tool joints for the country's oil and gas market. RUSNANO Capital, a subsidiary of OJSC RUSNANO, will contribute capital.
The antiwear nano-coating is expected to extend the life of the aluminum pipe by approximately 30% to 40% in aggressive and corrosive drilling environments compared to uncoated aluminum pipe.
About Alcoa
Alcoa is one of the world's leading producers of primary and fabricated aluminum, as well as the world's largest miner of bauxite and refiner of alumina. In addition to inventing the modern-day aluminum industry, Alcoa innovation has been behind major milestones in the aerospace, automotive, packaging, building and construction, commercial transportation, consumer electronics and industrial markets over the past 125 years. Among the solutions Alcoa markets are flat-rolled products, hard alloy extrusions, and forgings, as well as Alcoa® wheels, fastening systems, precision and investment castings, and building systems in addition to its expertise in other light metals such as titanium and nickel-based super alloys. Sustainability is an integral part of Alcoa's operating practices and the product design and engineering it provides to customers. Alcoa has been a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 11 consecutive years and approximately 75 percent of all of the aluminum ever produced since 1888 is still in active use today. Alcoa employs approximately 61,000 people in 30 countries across the world.
In 2005, the Company acquired two of Russia's largest fabricating facilities: Samara Metallurgical Plant (now ZAO Alcoa SMZ) and Belaya Kalitva Metallurgical Production Association (now ZAO AMR).
About RUSNANO
RUSNANO was founded in March 2011 as an open joint stock company through reorganization of state corporation Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies. RUSNANO's mission is to develop the Russian nanotechnology industry through co-investment in nanotechnology projects with substantial economic potential or social benefit. The Government of the Russian Federation owns 100 percent of the shares in RUSNANO. Anatoly Chubais is CEO and chairman of the Executive Board of RUSNANO.
Work to establish nanotechnology infrastructure and training for nanotechnology specialists, formerly conducted by the Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies, has been entrusted to the Fund for Infrastructure and Educational Programs, a non-commercial fund also established through reorganization of the Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies.

Summary
 Rusnano is a private equity firm focused on the development of nanotechnology industry in Russia.  Using government funds, it invests in nano projects that have significant economic or social potential, across a variety of industries.  Having provided capital for a company, Rusnano works with it for five to seven years to develop the business before it is bought by strategic investors.

       The hi-tech nature of these enterprises means that Rusnano often has to make an investment decision at the R&D phase, before a product is on the market. This introduces a high level of risk, so the company looked to the discipline of risk management, adopting a modern and comprehensive approach through risk modelling.
Rusnano uses the complete Palisade  DecisionTools Suite toolset, with a focus on TopRank and  @RISK. The tools help Rusnano to model projections of different KPIs on two management levels: portfolio management level and investee management level. This allows it to calculate the right value of investment based on the risk it entails and understand the overall liquidity of the portfolio using risk analysis.
Using Palisade’s tools, risk managers at Rusnano can communicate uncertainty to the company’s senior executives; the key factors, risks and projects that have the most impact on the company and project KPIs. Modelling risks also helps Rusnano to understand the different micro factors that are outside the control of the investment team. The insight provided is in-depth and indicates when the impact of those factors is potentially a significant threat, therefore requiring risk mitigation action planning and model changing accordingly for the portfolio or the project to be successful.
