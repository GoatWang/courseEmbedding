Love The Way You Look & Feel

BUILD YOUR SELF CONFIDENCE

As you consider plastic surgery, remember the old adage that beauty is more than skin deep. The way you look is largely determined by the contours and dimensions of the bone structure that underlies the soft tissues. As we age, our skin elasticity decreases and the underlying soft tissues descend being affected by gravity giving us the aged appearance.
Dr. Michael Jones has dedicated his practice to natural appearing plastic surgery that rejuvenates the health and appearance while regaining the beauty that was once yours. Dr. Jones has helped men and women of all ages and walks of life turn back the clock and achieve a more youthful appearance by tailoring treatment to the patients’ individual attributes, ethnic features and desires.

Your face is the first thing people notice about you. Whether it is your eyes, your smile or expressiveness you are constantly aware of the impression you make on other people. When wrinkles, skin discoloration, sagging skin or other evidence of aging become more noticeable, cosmetic surgery may be the answer.  With cosmetic surgery you can turn back the hands of time. Not only will you look and feel younger you will also feel more confident and vibrant.
 
Millions of people every New Year resolve to lose weight.  Some are successful, some are not. Even the most successful dieter have problems getting rid of as much fat as they would like. Some areas of their body do not respond to diet and exercise the way they would like them to. It comes as no surprise then, that some of the most common cosmetic plastic surgery procedures involve reshaping of the body through removal of excess fat deposits. Arms, abdomen, hips, thighs and knees respond very well to treatment.

Gentleman's Choice Procedures



Eyelid Rejuvenation

Eye contact is very important for in business and social settings. Most men realize the importance of their eyes and requested blepharoplasty procedures to minimize the extra skin, hooding, puffiness, and sagging.
Each year over 100,000 men and women choose blepharoplasty to improve the way they look.  Droopy eyelids can make you look older and can also impair vision.  Blepharoplasty corrects these problems and also removes puffiness and bags under the eyes that make you look worn and tired.  Blepharoplasty does not correct dark circles, fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes, nor can it change sagging eyebrows, so although it is typically performed as a single procedure, you may also require a brow lift, face lift or skin resurfacing to achieve the best results.﻿ 

  Prior to visiting Dr. Jones I went to another doctor and was not happy with my results.  Luckily Dr. Jones was able to correct my previous eye surgery. – Patient JL


The Procedure
Blepharoplasty commonly known as eyelid surgery, removes the excess fat and drooping skin from the upper or lower eyelids or both, to rejuvenate your appearance.  The removal of fat deposits minimizes bags under the eyes and tightens the lower eyelid skin.  
Variations of Blepharoplasty include:
Upper eyelid surgery:  Removes fatty deposits that appear as puffiness in the upper eyelids
Lower eyelid surgery:  Removes excess skin and wrinkles on the lower eyelid as well as corrects droopiness and bags under the eyes.
The Method(s)
Eyelid surgery usually takes from one to three hours, under local or general anesthesia.  The doctor will make incisions in the creases of the upper eyelids and/or below the lashes of the lower eyelids.  The placement of the incision lines is designed to minimize visible scarring.  Once the incision is made, the doctor will separate the skin from the fatty tissue and muscle, remove excess fat and trim drooping skin/muscle.  In instances where there is no drooping skin to be removed, the doctor may make an incision line just below the lower lash to just remove excess fat.
Ideal Candidate
The ideal candidate for eyelid surgery is a non-smoking adult, without pre-determined, serious eye conditions.  Healthy facial tissue and muscles is desired.  The patient must also have realistic expectations for the outcome of the surgery.
Recovery/Post-Operative

 Temporary eyelid swelling, bruising irritation or dry eyes
Results of eyelid surgery will appear gradually as swelling and bruising subside
 Temporary discomfort and irritation at the incision site is possible
  Stitches will be removed two days to a week after surgery
  Avoid strenuous activities for two weeks after surgery﻿﻿

Male Liposuction

Many men find that dieting and exercise are good ways to lose weight and tone muscle; however, they still find it difficult to achieve the typical body they desire.  Fat deposits may conceal the toned muscles and make it difficult to get rid of fat in certain areas. ﻿ 

  As a fireman, I have to be physically able to lift heavy weight.  Removing some of the fat in my stomach makes a difference when I’m moving around. – Patient KB



The Procedure
The most popular areas for liposuction for men include: waist, abdomen, lower back, breast and neck.  A key difference between liposuction for a man and a woman concerns the make up of the fatty tissue itself. Adipose tissue in women is softer and less fibrous than tissue found in men.  Therefore, liposuction for males presents greater physical demands on the performing surgeon.
The Method(s)
There are several approaches to liposuction including standard liposuction, power-assisted liposuction and laser-assisted liposuction.


 Standard liposuction utilizes various cannulas (hollow, stainless steel tube 
Power assisted liposuction utilizes oscillating cannulas, which pre-tunnel the tissue and are especially helpful in difficult areas. Power assisted liposuction allows surgeons to effectively perform higher volumes of liposuction without burn risks, trauma to fibrous tissues and in faster time. 

Ideal Candidate
The ideal liposuction patient is a healthy, non-smoking adult.  The procedure is an option for those who would like to remove excess fat deposits and have realistic expectations and goals for body contouring.  Fat deposits may form from over eating, a lack of exercise or inherited family traits.
Recovery/Postoperative

Adherence to post-operative and recovery instructions is critical and mandatory.
  Transportation post-surgery is strongly recommended
 Possibility of up to several months for swelling to completely disappear
Some supplements and vitamins are prohibited to reduce prolonged bleeding﻿﻿

Male Breast Reduction

Although rarely discussed, enlarged male breasts are a common condition.  The condition, clinically known as Gynecomastia affects 40 to 60 percent of men.  In most cases, there is no known cause for it, although it has been correlated to various drugs and medical conditions.﻿ 

  The extra fat in my chest was embarrassing and hard to get rid of from exercising.  I should have done this years ago. – Patient DH


·         
The Procedure
Male breasts typically occur at times of hormonal change, such as puberty.  As men physically mature, it sometimes disappears on its own.  However, occasionally it remains possibly due to heredity and as was aforementioned certain drugs or other medical conditions. 
The Method(s)
Prior to surgery a detailed medical history and physical examination is performed to assess the underlying causes for gynecomastia.  Dependent upon each case’s characteristics, the doctor may correct the undesired look through alternative medical treatments like the removal of glandular tissue.  The amount of glandular tissue present will determine the type of liposuction the doctor feels is best for the patient.  Typically there is a firm and tender mass of breast tissue beneath the areola that may need to be removed. 
Gynecomastia techniques include:


  Liposuction alone
 Liposuction with breast gland removal
   Liposuction, gland and skin removal.

Ideal Candidate﻿
The ideal candidate for breast removal surgery is a healthy, non-smoking adult with excess breast gland, fat or both.  The procedure is most commonly performed on adult males between the ages of 18 and 30.
Recovery/Post-Operative

Patients should arrange for transportation from surgery
 Home recovery for approximately 4 to 7 days is required before returning to work
 Post-operative swelling will begin to improve after a week
Resume exercise and heavy lifting within 3 weeks﻿﻿

Nose Reshaping 

There are many reasons why men seek Rhinoplasty, some of these include removing a bump on the nose, creating a bridge, or opening their breathing passages. Most men who seek Rhinoplasty do not wish to dramatically change their nose shape, but instead are looking for subtle improvements.﻿ 

  I didn’t want a drastic change in my nose structure but it’s an obvious improvement to my face. – Patient EL


The Procedure
Rhinoplasty also known as a “nose job” is a surgical procedure that improves the appearance, proportions and balance of the nose including the nasal tip and nostrils.  Aside from aesthetic appearance, surgery of the nose is also used to correct difficulty with breathing.  For example, a deviated septum causes breathing impairment, which can be corrected by adjusting the nasal structure to improve alignment.  
The Method(s)
Rhinoplasty can be performed in two ways, “open”, where an incision is made across the columella, the strip of tissue that divides the nostrils or “closed”, an LPS procedure of choice, whereby incisions are hidden inside the nose to reduce visible scarring.  A typical rhinoplasty procedure lasts 2 to 3 hours.
Ideal Candidate
The ideal candidate is a non-smoking and healthy adult with realistic expectations.  To consider rhinoplasty you should at least in your mid-teens to ensure the development of the nose has stabilized.
Recovery/Post-Operative

 Temporary bruising may extend to the eyes and other areas of the face
 Nasal cast must be worn for 7 to 10 days
 Nasal tampons may be placed in the nose for up to 3 days
Most bruising and swelling should disappear within 2 weeks
 Return to work within 7 to 10 days﻿﻿

Razor Bump Laser Hair Removal

Tired of shaving? Yes, many men are and that’s a fact, not an assumption.  According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, laser hair removal is one of the top, cosmetic, non-invasive procedures requested by men.﻿ 

  It saves me a lot of time not having to worry about shaving every other day.  – Patient SL


Laser Hair Removal
The laser hair removal process is performed with Candela Gentle YAG, the most advanced laser equipment, focusing laser light energy at the surface of the skin targeting pigment in hair follicles.  The laser is effective on all skin tones; however, gray, white/silver, blonde and some shades of red cannot be treated.
The laser light energy quickly heats the targeted hair follicle while the skin is cooled and essentially destroys the hair in a process known as photothermolysis.  With each laser treatment you can expect to see less hair grow back and the hair become finer and/or is permanently or safely removed. Typically up to 6 treatments are required.
Laser hair removal can be performed on the abdomen, arm, underarms, back, bikini, chest, face, neck and legs.  Results may vary based upon location of hair removal and specific hormone conditions.﻿﻿

Keloid Management: A Retrospective Case Review on a New Approach Using Surgical Excision, Platelet-Rich Plasma, and In-office Superficial Photon X-ray Radiation Therapy
Michael E. Jones, MD; Cherrell Hardy, BSN, RN; and Julie Ridgway, BSN, RN

Keloids are fibrous lesions that form at a site of injury due to irregular production of types I and III collagen.1 Unlike hyper- trophic scars, keloids continue to grow outside the original wound margins and fail to resolve over time.2 They itch and become painful.2 High-tension areas, such as the chest, trunk, and back, as well as commonly pierced areas, such as the ears, are some of the more common sites for keloid formation.3 Although there is limited understanding on the cause(s) of keloids, they are known to occur more frequently in persons aged 10 to 30 years and in females (likely the result of more frequent body piercing).1 Although documented in all races, keloids are more prevalent in individuals with darker skin (African American, Asian, Hispanic), with a positive correlation to skin pigmentation. Most keloids ap- pear in those with darker skin types, and there are no reported in- cidents in albinos.2 Keloids often mature into unsightly lesions affecting self-esteem and quality of life. Depending on the loca- tion and size of the keloid, range of motion may be impaired﻿.

Eye Diseases
A quick look at some of the most common eye diseases diagnosed and often treated at Michael D. Jones, O.D. in Las Vegas
“Eye diseases” is a blanket term that refers to a host of diseases relating to the function of the eye. Below we describe some of the more common types of eye diseases and how they are generally treated. For more in-depth information, please speak with your eye care provider at Michael D. Jones, O.D..

Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)
Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is an infection or inflammation of the conjunctiva – the thin, protective membrane that covers the surface of the eyeball and inner surface of the eyelids. Caused by bacteria, viruses, allergens and other irritants like smoke and dust, pink eye is highly contagious and is usually accompanied by redness in the white of the eye and increased tearing and/or discharge.
While many minor cases improve within two weeks, some can develop into serious corneal inflammation and threaten sight. If you suspect conjunctivitis, visit your eye care provider at Michael D. Jones, O.D. for an examination and treatment.
Diabetic Eye Disease
Diabetic eye disease is a general term for a group of eye problems that can result from having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, including diabetic retinopathy, cataracts and glaucoma.
Often there are no symptoms in the early stages of diabetic eye disease, so it is important that you don’t wait for symptoms to appear before having a comprehensive eye exam. Early detection and treatment of diabetic eye disease will dramatically reduce your chances of sustaining permanent vision loss.
Glaucoma
Often called “the silent thief of sight,” glaucoma is an increase in the intraocular pressure of the eyes, which causes damage to the optic nerve with no signs or symptoms in the early stages of the disease. If left untreated, glaucoma can lead to a decrease in peripheral vision and eventually blindness.
While there is no cure for glaucoma, there are medications and surgery available that can help halt further vision loss. Early detection and regular eye exams are vital to slowing the progress of the disease.
Macular Degeneration
Macular degeneration is a chronic, progressive disease that gradually destroys sharp central vision due to a deterioration of the macula, a tiny spot in the central portion of your retina comprised of millions of light-sensing cells. Because it is so commonly associated with aging, it is also known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). There are two forms of AMD called “dry,” most common and with no known treatment, and “wet,” less common and treated with laser procedures. Genetic testing is now available to help identify those most likely to develop “wet” macular degeneration.
In most cases, reversing damage caused by AMD is not possible, but supplements, protection from sunlight, eating a balanced diet and quitting smoking can reduce the risk and progression of macular degeneration. For suggestions, speak with your eye care provider at Michael D. Jones, O.D..

Michael D. Jones, O.D. has the experience and equipment necessary to diagnose and often treat the eye diseases detailed above, as well as many other eye diseases, at our office in Las Vegas. For more information please schedule an appointment with your optometrist, and we’ll be in touch with you shortly.

Scar & Keloid Treatments


Scar Revision

When the skin is in the process of recovering from an injury, whether the result of an accident, surgery, a burn, or acne, scarring will occur wherever multiple layers of the skin have been affected. Once a scar forms, it is permanent but may be made less visible or relocated surgically. With very few exceptions most people are self-conscious about facial scars. Some people may also experience diminished functioning of the eyes, mouth, or nose due to scarring. If you've wondered how facial scar revision could improve your appearance, your self-confidence, or your level of facial functioning, you need to know how scar revision works and what you can expect from this procedure.﻿﻿ 

  I didn’t think it was possible to remove my scar but Dr. Jones did an amazing job. – Patient CSV 


PROCEDURE
Scar revision is a surgical procedure to improve or reduce the appearance of scars. It also restores function and corrects disfigurement caused by an injury, wound or previous surgery.  Scars are formed when the skin is damaged in some way. Scars are permanent visible wounds and are unpredictable in their development.  Although a scar cannot be removed completely, Dr. Jones can improve the appearance of a scar by making them less noticeable.
 
METHOD
Many factors affect the severity of scarring including the size and depth of the wound, blood supply to the area, thickness and color of your skin, as well as the direction of the scar. If you are considering scar revision, it is important to consult with a board-certified plastic surgeon that can help you determine which procedure is best for you.
 
There are several treatment options which vary based on the type and degree of scarring, however, the Z-plasty is recommended. Z-plasty is a surgical technique that repositions a scar to more closely conform it to the natural lines and creases of the skin.
 
IDEAL CANDIDATE
The ideal candidate for scar revision surgery is a healthy individual of any age who would like to improve the appearance of scars anywhere on their body.  It is also beneficial if the candidate does not have active acne or other skin diseases in the area to be treated
 
RECOVERY / POSTOPERATIVE

Temporary discoloration or discomfort will occur in the first two weeks
Healing is expected to continue for several weeks
Dressings may be removed after one to two weeks post surgery
Minimal activity is advised post surgery
Use of scar products (i.e. Keloid Care) and massages to the affected area(s) are essential for individuals prone to thickened or keloid scars

Keloid Care

Keloid Care is an innovative, new fast-acting, topical cream specifically designed to help improve the appearance of thick or stubborn scars like keloids and hypertropic (raised) scar, as well as lighten any discoloration in affected and surrounding area(s).

The cream is carefully formulated with Beta Ionone, a powerful anti-oxidant shown to nourish the skin and help improve the appearance of thick, stubborn or hard to treat scars. Keloid Care also contains Aloe, Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter and other natural ingredients commonly used to soften and moisturize the skin. 

  "I first heard about Keloid Care when my daughter Marley hit her chin on the side of my table. I took her to Dr. Jones to get stitches and he stitched her up beautifully but I was still afraid that she was going to have a scar on her face for the rest of her life. He recommended Keloid Care and I applied it and it was barely visible after a few weeks. ~Yvonne Wright mother of Marley"

As you recline or lye down, dependent upon the area where you will be treated, the pulse dye laser will deliver an intense but gentle burst of light into selectively targeted areas of the skin to target the aforementioned problems. Most patients report a warming or tingling sensation during treatment. No anesthesia is required but it may be used if requested. Candela’s laser also offers an innovative cooling method, which mists the skin before the laser emits its pulse, in an effort to minimize discomfort.

Advanced Superficial Radiation Therapy

Keloids are a type of painful and/or itchy scar tissue that may form over a wound from an injury or surgical procedure. They can also form due to a piercing, acne, chickenpox and even a scratch. Most often, they appear on the chest, back, shoulders and earlobes. Keloids are 15 times more frequent in highly pigmented ethnic groups than in Caucasians. Living with keloids can be difficult and even embarrassing. Surgery alone is usually not the best option as the keloid may grow back and re-form in the scar area, at times recurring larger than the initial growth.
