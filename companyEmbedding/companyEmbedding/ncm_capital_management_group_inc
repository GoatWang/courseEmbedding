Many people assume their best bet is to sign on with one of the big brokerage firms. But in my experience, often the brightest and most thoughtful advisers are at smaller financial planning shops. So don't be put off if an adviser works alone or with just one or two others.— Jonathan Clements - Wall Street Journal



























































ASK YOURSELF

                    Is my financial advisor just trying to sell me a product?
                    
                    Why does he only recommend one type of investment (i.e. mutual funds, annuities)?

                    How do I know if my advisor is looking out for my best interests?

1The Bergen County Top Financial Advisor rankings 






The Bergen County Top Financial Advisor rankings are generated by Meridian-IQ and AdviceIQ. AdviceIQ collected data from financial advisors in the Bergen County area to create a top list on behalf of (201) Magazine and bergencounty.com.

There are three criterion used in these rankings: 1) the number of years that the financial advisor has been in business; 2) the number of individual client relationships; and 3) the advisor firm’s assets under management. All three criteria were given equal weighting in deciding the final order of the rankings.

The rankings were open to all types of advisors.  It was advertised on bergencounty.com and participation was also encouraged via phone calls and by email to more than 1,500 advisors.  Only retail firms were considered and eligibility was determined by geographical location in the Bergen County area.

AdviceIQ used the Regulatory Compliance Review, or RCR™ to perform due diligence on all the advisors who participated. The RCR™ audit involves first verifying that each advisor is indeed registered with a bona fide regulator. Then, a screen is then conducted with the following regulators for each advisor: Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), each advisor’s home state Insurance Commissioner and State Investment Advisor Representative regulator.  The RCR™ audit also checks to see if an advisor has any negative history with any of the above regulators. Note that there is precedent for advisors who have been banned by one regulator who reappear under another regulator. Only advisors with a clean regulatory history across all four regulators are included in these rankings.

Investment Philosophy
Your Partner To Financial Success










Tactical Investing





    
    
   In today’s environment of more volatile markets, tactical investing can be an important tool in an investor’s portfolio.  While the practice of buying and holding quality companies for the long-term should always remain the goal, monitoring and adjusting “what you own” have become essential strategies to achieving long-term investment success.  At NCM, the tenets of our philosophy are: 

    
Strategic asset allocation provides an appropriate balance between risk and return, especially during challenging market conditions.
	    Investing in low-cost, tax-efficient, and transparent investments is a proven approach; the investments and securities that we use are all publicly-traded, priced daily and highly liquid.
	    Market timing is NOT an effective long-term investment strategy.
	    Investing in proprietary products often benefits the advisor or firm, not necessarily the client.


We feel that advisors often make investing far more complex than it needs to be.  We try to be value investors for our clients, choosing fair or under-priced securities rather than chasing the latest fad or investment bubble.
    
We utilize low-cost, tax-efficient and transparent investments such as:
				



➢	Exchange-traded funds (ETF’s)➢	Individual bonds


➢	Individual securities➢	Options


➢	Index funds➢	Managed Futures


FACT:  Most active managers do not beat their index benchmark over time; it is further true that hedge funds, private equity or other complex structured products are not appropriate for most investors.  

In short, we stay diversified in our portfolios, while maintaining the flexibility to underweight or overweight in a particular asset class when it is appropriate.  We stand ready to add to positions that are more attractive in relative terms, just as we are prepared to step away from an investment that may have appreciated in value and is at a level above our criteria for what dictates a fair price.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
