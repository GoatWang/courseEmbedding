Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 4    3.92      Net Money Flow ($)  93,369    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Only 3 days left to cash in on Empire State Realty OP LP (ESBA) dividend, should investors buy?



Sebastian Eder 


            				June 10, 2017			        


 Are you after Empire State Realty OP (ARCA:ESBA)‘s upcoming $0.11 dividend? Then you have only few days left as the stock will start trading ex-dividend on the Tue 13 Jun 2017 with the cash dividend payment to be paid on the Fri 30 Jun 2017. Should ESBA be on dividend investor’s list? I’m going to look at the latest data and analyze this stock in more detail. 
 What is the ex-dividend date?  If you purchase a stock on or after its ex-dividend date, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend. 
 View our latest analysis for Empire State Realty OP 
 Investors should be cautious of Empire State Realty OP (ESBA)’s 2.01% dividend 
 A 2.01% dividend yield definitely makes Empire State Realty OP LP (ARCA:ESBA) look like an attractive dividend payer on face value. However, I always advise investors to be cautious when buying a company just for its dividend yield. I generally like to examine a few key metrics behind the yield to see if the yield is actually an attractive proposition, as it often surfaces important insights that most investors overlook. See our latest analysis for ESBA 
 The first thing I look at is the company’s payout ratio.  
 Payout ratio is a measure of what portion of a company’s earnings are paid out to shareholders as a dividend. So a payout ratio of 50% would mean for every $1 earnt they pay 50c as a dividend. Likewise a payout ratio of 150% means the company is paying out more as a dividend than it earns, usually this is paid out of debt or cash. 
 Empire State Realty OP has a payout ratio of 107%, which means that the dividend is not well covered by earnings. Analysts have not forecast a dividends per share estimate for 3 years time, which makes it hard to determine what yield shareholders should expect to see in the future. 
In addition to the payout ratio, the payout consistency is a significant consideration for dividend stocks like ESBA. 
 If the dividend is a key criteria in your investment consideration, then you need to make sure the dividend stock you’re eyeing out is reliable. It is really too early to view Empire State Realty OP as a dividend investment. They have only been consistently paying for 4 years and standard practice for reliable payers is to look for 10+ years track record. }

Where else to look?
We’ve seen why investors should be careful investing in ESBA for the dividend. In fact if you are looking for a good dividend stock, it would probably be worth of looking elswhere.
If you are not after a reliable dividend payer, Empire State Realty OP could still offer some interesting investment opportunities. See our latest FREE analysis to find out! If you are looking for potential dividend investments I recommend you take a look at our Dividend Rock Stars view.
