	NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS







	PROXY STATEMENT



	 




















	Annual




	Meeting:




	  



	May 23, 2017


	2:00 p.m., EDT        



	  



	The Butler Institute of American Art


	9350
	East Market Street


	Howland, Ohio 44484













	Record Date




	and Voting:




	  


	5:00 p.m., EDT, March 27, 2017. If you were a shareholder of Cortland Bancorp (Cortland) at that time, you may vote at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the Annual Meeting). Each common share entitles
	the holder to one vote on each matter to be voted on by shareholders at the Annual Meeting. On the record date, Cortland had 4,420,255 common shares outstanding.











	Agenda:



	  



	1. To elect four directors to serve on the Board for terms of three years each until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and
	thereafter until their successors are elected and qualified.


	 


	2. To approve, on an
	advisory basis, the executive compensation of Cortlands named executive officers as described in this proxy statement.


	 


	3. To consider and vote upon amendment of Section 2.01 of Cortlands Code of Regulations.


	 


	4. To ratify the appointment of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as Cortlands independent
	auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017.


	 


	5. To transact any other
	business that may properly come before the Annual Meeting.












	Proxies:



	  


	Unless you specify on the proxy card to vote differently, the management proxies will vote all signed and returned proxies FOR election of the Boards nominees for director, FOR approval of
	executive compensation, FOR amendment of the Code of Regulations and FOR ratification of Cortlands independent auditor. The management proxies will use their discretion on any other matters that may arise. If
	a named nominee cannot or will not serve as a director, the management proxies will vote for a substitute person nominated by the Board to serve as a director.












	Proxies




	Solicited By:




	  


	Proxies are being solicited by the Board. The cost of the solicitation is being borne by Cortland. Proxies will be solicited by mail and may be further solicited, for no additional compensation, by officers, directors,
	or employees of Cortland and its subsidiaries by mail, telephone, or personal contact. Cortland will also pay the standard charges and expenses of brokerage houses, voting trustees, banks, associations, and other custodians, nominees, and
	fiduciaries who are record holders of common shares not beneficially owned by them, for forwarding proxy materials to, and obtaining proxies from, the beneficial owners of such common shares. In addition, we have retained Advantage Proxy to
	assist us in soliciting proxies. For these services, we will pay Advantage Proxy a fee of $4,750 plus reasonable expenses.











	Mailing Date:



	  


	We anticipate mailing this proxy statement on or about April 11, 2017.











	Revoking Your     Proxy:



	  



	You may revoke your proxy before it is voted at the Annual Meeting. You may revoke your proxy by:


	 


	    sending written
	notice revoking your proxy to Lance A. Morrison, Cortlands Secretary, at 194 West Main Street, Cortland, Ohio 44410, which must be received prior to the Annual Meeting;


	 


	    sending in another signed proxy card with a later date, which must be received by
	Cortland prior to the Annual Meeting; or


	 


	    attending the Annual Meeting and revoking your proxy in person if your common shares are
	held in your name. If your common shares are held in the name of your broker, financial institution, or other holder of record, you must bring an account statement or letter from the broker, financial institution, or other holder of record
	indicating that you were the beneficial owner of the common shares on the record date.













	  



	Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, in and of itself, constitute revocation of a proxy.







	IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
	TO BE HELD ON MAY 23, 2017: THE PROXY STATEMENT, INCLUDING NOTICE OF THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS, AND FORM 10-K ARE AVAILABLE AT

	Stock Ownership Guidelines

	. At its February 24, 2015 meeting, the Board updated the stock ownership guidelines for directors,
	affirming the value that the Board places on directors having a significant personal financial stake in our success and the value that the Board places on the alignment of the interests of directors with the interests of shareholders
	generally. A director who does not comply with the guidelines will not be nominated for election. If the value of the directors holdings declines to an amount under the minimum, the director will be required to apply up to 100% of
	his annual retainer to purchase shares sufficiently to meet the minimum requirement. The minimum value of a non-employee directors holdings of our stock is 3.5 times the annual fees earned and paid in cash. For employee directors,
	the minimum value is one times the annual base compensation. Directors are expected to achieve compliance with the stock ownership guidelines within three years after becoming a director or within two years in the case of Directors serving at
	the time these ownership guidelines were adopted. In an effort to provide an effective mechanism for satisfying the ownership requirements, the Corporate Compensation Committee enables non-employee directors to participate in the director
	10(b)5-1 program, under which 50% of each months retainer will be withheld for purchase of company shares.





	RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES; QUORUM



	If you were a shareholder of Cortland at the close of business on March 27, 2017,
	you are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of March 27, 2017, there were 4,420,255 common shares of Cortland issued and outstanding. When present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting, the holders of a majority of the common
	shares of Cortland issued and outstanding and entitled to vote will constitute a quorum for the conduct of business at the Annual Meeting.





	VOTE REQUIRED



	Shareholders are entitled to one vote for each share held. Shareholders are not entitled to cumulate their votes in the election or
	removal of directors or otherwise. The director nominees receiving the greatest numbers of votes will be elected. We will consider the non-binding proposal regarding executive compensation to be approved if the proposal receives the affirmative
	vote of a majority of votes cast. We will consider the proposal to ratify the appointment of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as independent auditor to be approved if the proposal receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. The proposal to
	amend the Code of Regulations will be considered adopted if it receives the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitled to exercise a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock.





	ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES



	Abstention may be specified on all proposals except the election of directors. Broker non-votes generally occur when shares held by a
	broker nominee for a beneficial owner are not voted on a proposal because the nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and lacks discretionary authority to vote the shares. Brokers generally have the right to vote
	on a proposal such as the ratification of the selection of independent auditors, but brokers generally do not have the discretion to vote on matters such as amendments to charter documents, executive compensation proposals, and the election of
	directors. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of establishing that a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of directors or on the non-binding proposal to approve
	executive compensation. Because the proposal to amend the Code of Regulations will not be approved unless it receives the affirmative vote of holders of shares entitled to exercise a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares,
	abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against the proposal to amend the Code of Regulations.

	SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE



	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), requires Cortlands executive officers and directors
	to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing their initial beneficial ownership of common shares and any subsequent changes in their beneficial ownership. Specific due dates have been established by the SEC, and
	Cortland is required to disclose in this proxy statement any late reports. To Cortlands knowledge, based solely on a review of reports furnished to Cortland and written representations that no other reports were required, Cortlands
	executive officers and directors complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements during the 2016 fiscal year.





	ELECTION OF DIRECTORS




	(Proposal One)



	The Board currently has twelve members. Directors are divided into three classes, and directors of each class serve for three-year
	terms. Four directors serve in the class whose terms will expire at the Annual Meeting, four directors serve in the class whose term expires in 2018 and four directors serve in the class whose term expires in 2019. Proxies may not be voted
	for more than the four nominees.





	BOARD NOMINEES



	Directors are individuals with knowledge and experience who serve and represent Cortlands geographic footprint throughout the counties
	and communities served and those counties contiguous to its market. Current Board representation by outside directors demonstrates a background in the automotive, law, manufacturing, financial services, construction and the accounting
	industries, with the expertise of these individuals covering a broad array of skills including corporate management, human resource management, strategic planning, business acquisitions, and small business operations.


	The Board proposes that the four nominees identified be elected for a new term of three years. Each nominee was recommended by the
	Boards Corporate Governance Committee. Each individual elected as a director at the Annual Meeting will hold office until his term expires and thereafter until his successor is duly elected and qualified, or until his earlier resignation,
	removal from office, or death. While it is contemplated that all nominees will stand for re-election, if a nominee who would otherwise receive the required number of votes becomes unavailable or unable to serve as a candidate for re-election as
	a director, the individuals designated as proxies on the proxy card will have full discretion to vote the common shares represented by the proxies they hold for the election of the remaining nominees and for the election of any substitute nominee or
	nominees designated by the Board following recommendation by the Corporate Governance Committee. The Board knows of no reason any of the nominees named below will be unavailable or unable to serve if elected to the Board.

	THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD




	Independence of Directors



	The Board has
	reviewed, considered, and discussed each directors relationships, both direct or indirect, with Cortland and its subsidiaries and the compensation and other payments, if any, each director has, both directly or indirectly, received from or
	made to Cortland and its subsidiaries in order to determine whether the director is independent. The Board has determined that it has a majority of independent directors and that each of the following directors qualifies as independent under
	Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2): David C. Cole, J. Martin Erbaugh, James E. Hoffman, III, Neil J. Kaback, Joseph E. Koch, Joseph P. Langhenry, Thomas P. Perciak, Richard B. Thompson, Anthony R. Vross, and Timothy K. Woofter.


	James M. Gasior and Timothy Carney do not qualify as independent directors because they currently serve as executive officers of Cortland and
	its subsidiaries.



	Meetings of the Board and Attendance at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders



	In 2016, the Board held a total of 12 meetings. Each incumbent director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the total number of
	meetings held by the Board and the total number of meetings held by the board committees on which he served, in each case during the period of his service.


	Cortland encourages all incumbent directors and director nominees to attend each annual meeting of shareholders. All of the incumbent
	directors and director nominees attended Cortlands last Annual Meeting of Shareholders, held on May 24, 2016.



	Communications with the Board



	Although Cortland does not currently have formal procedures by which shareholders may communicate directly with directors, Cortland
	believes that its current process has adequately served the needs of the Board and its shareholders. Communications sent to the Board, either generally or in care of the Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, the Investor Relations Officer, or
	another corporate officer, are forwarded to all directors. There is no screening process, and all communications that are received by officers for the Boards attention are forwarded to the Board.


	Until other procedures are developed and posted on Cortlands website at www.cortlandbank.com, any communication to the Board may be
	mailed to the Board, in care of the Investor Relations Officer, at Cortlands headquarters in Cortland, Ohio. The mailing envelope must contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed letter is a Shareholder-Board
	Communication or a Shareholder-Director Communication. In addition, communication via Cortlands website may be used. Correspondence through the investor relations page of the website should also be directed to the
	Investor Relations Officer and indicate that the communication is a Shareholder-Board Communication or a Shareholder-Director Communication. All such communications, whether via mail or website, must identify the author
	as a shareholder and clearly state whether the intended recipients are all directors on the Board or just certain specified individual directors or committee members. The Investor Relations Officer will make copies of all such communications
	and circulate them to the appropriate director or directors.



	Board Committees




	Audit Committee



	The Board
	has an Audit Committee comprised of Messrs. Erbaugh, Kaback (Chair), Thompson and Vross. The Board has determined that each member and nominee of the Audit Committee qualifies as independent under the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, as well as under Rule
	10A-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Board has determined that Mr. Kaback qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. Mr. Kaback has acquired these attributes through
	education and experience as a certified public accountant.


	The Audit Committee conducts its business pursuant to a written charter adopted
	by the Board. A current copy of the charter of the Audit Committee is posted on Cortlands website at www.cortlandbank.com on the investor relations page under Governance Documents, Audit Committee Charter. At least
	annually, the Audit Committee reviews and reassesses the adequacy of its charter and recommends any proposed changes to the full Board for approval as necessary.


	 


	8







	Table of Contents



	The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, compensating, and overseeing the independent
	registered public accounting firm employed by Cortland for the purpose of preparing and issuing an audit report or other audit, review, or attestation services. The Audit Committee evaluates the independence of the independent registered public
	accounting firm on an ongoing basis. The Audit Committee also approves audit reports and plans, accounting policies, and audit outsource arrangements, including audit scope, internal audit reports, audit fees, and certain other
	expenses. The Audit Committee is responsible for developing procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal auditing controls, or auditing matters, including procedures for the confidential,
	anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.


	The Audit Committee held six (6)
	meetings in 2016. The Audit Committees report relating to the 2016 fiscal year appears elsewhere in this proxy statement.



	Compensation
	Committee



	The Compensation Committee is currently comprised of Messrs. Cole, Langhenry, Perciak, Thompson and Woofter (Chair). Mr.
	Perciak was appointed to the Compensation Committee on May 24, 2016. The Board determined that each member of the Compensation Committee qualified as independent under Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. In addition, each member of the Compensation
	Committee qualified as an outside director for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the IRC), and as a non-employee director for purposes of Section 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.


	The Compensation Committee oversees director and executive officer compensation as well as compensation under the Profit Sharing Program and
	the Employee Benefit 401(k) Plan. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for administration of other executive benefits and plans, including the 2015 Omnibus Equity Plan. The Compensation Committee reviews and recommends officer
	compensation levels and benefit plans. In evaluating executive officer performance, the Compensation Committee takes into account 


	 




	 


	


	 


	job knowledge, initiative, and originality;




	 




	 


	


	 


	quality and accuracy of work performed and priority setting;




	 




	 


	


	 


	customer relations;




	 




	 


	


	 


	subordinate feedback and ability to provide instruction to staff; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	the relationship of these factors to Cortland and the Banks achievement of strategic objectives and profitability.




	The Compensation Committee occasionally requests the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to be present at Compensation Committee meetings to discuss
	executive compensation and evaluate individual performance. The Compensation Committee discusses the CEOs compensation with him, but final deliberations and all votes regarding his compensation are made in executive session, without the
	CEO present. The Compensation Committee also approves the compensation for other executive officers based on the CEOs recommendations with input from outside advisors and counsel and then makes its recommendations to the Board.


	The Compensation Committee reviews publicly available peer data to assist with evaluating the overall compensation for the Board. From
	time to time, the Compensation Committee will recommend changes in compensation to further the goals of the director compensation program, which strives to provide appropriate compensation to directors for their time, efforts and contributions.


	The Compensation Committee uses compensation data from similar-sized financial institutions for comparative purposes from time to time to
	provide input on both Board and executive compensation issues, and used Meyer-Chatfield Compensation Advisors as a consultant in setting 2016 compensation. The Compensation Committee conducts its business pursuant to a written charter adopted by the
	Board. At least annually, the Compensation Committee reviews and reassesses the adequacy of its charter and recommends any proposed changes to the full Board for approval as necessary. The Compensation Committee held three (3) meetings in 2016.



	Corporate Governance Committee



	The Corporate Governance Committee is comprised of Messrs. Cole, Koch, Perciak, Thompson, and Woofter (Chair). Mr. Koch was appointed to the
	Corporate Governance Committee on May 24, 2016. The Board has determined that each member of the Corporate Governance Committee qualifies as independent under Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. In addition, each member of the Corporate Governance
	Committee qualifies as an outside director for purposes of Section 162(m) of the IRC, and as a non-employee director for purposes of Section 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. The Corporate Governance

	Committee held one (1) meeting during 2016. The charter of the Corporate Governance Committee is reviewed annually and is available on Cortlands website at www.cortlandbank.com on the
	investor relations page under Governance Documents, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter.


	The Corporate Governance Committee
	is charged with the following responsibilities:


	 




	 


	


	 


	identify qualified candidates for election, nomination, or appointment to the Board and recommend to the full Board a slate of director nominees for each annual meeting or as vacancies occur;




	 




	 


	

	Nominating Procedures



	The Corporate
	Governance Committee has the responsibility to identify and recommend individuals qualified to become directors. Each candidate must satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth in Cortlands Code of Regulations, Article Two, Section
	2.01 Authority and Qualifications, and in guidelines adopted by the Board from time to time. No person who has attained the age of 70 is eligible for election as a director. The Board of Directors is seeking stockholder approval to
	increase the mandatory retirement age for directors in order to provide the Company with the opportunity to benefit from the valuable expertise of directors for a longer time and to bring the Companys director retirement policy in line with
	other similarly sized financial institutions. The proposal to increase the mandatory retirement age is described below in the discussion of Proposal Three, the proposal to amend the Code of Regulations. Stock ownership guidelines adopted by the
	Board and described above in SHARE OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 

	Stock Ownership Guidelines

	, provide minimum stock ownership levels for non-employee directors.


	When considering potential candidates for the Board, the Corporate Governance Committee strives to assure that the composition of the Board,
	as well as its practices and operation, contributes to an effective representation and advocacy of shareholders interest. The Corporate Governance Committee may consider those factors it deems appropriate in evaluating director
	candidates, including judgment, skill, strength of character, experience with business and organizations comparable in size and scope to Cortland, experience and skills relative to other Board members, and specialized knowledge or
	experience. Depending upon the current needs of the Board, certain factors may be weighed more heavily than others by the Corporate Governance Committee. The Corporate Governance Committee does not have a policy for the consideration of
	diversity in the nomination process, but takes into account in its deliberations all facets of a potential nominees background, including the potential nominees educational background, business and professional experience, and his or her
	particular skills and other qualities. The Corporate Governance Committees goal is to identify individuals who will enhance and add valuable perspective to the Boards deliberations and who will assist Cortland in its effort to
	capitalize on business opportunities in a challenging and highly competitive market.


	In considering candidates for the Board, the
	Corporate Governance Committee evaluates the entirety of each candidates credentials and, other than the eligibility requirements set forth in Cortlands Code of Regulations and other than the stock ownership guidelines, there are no
	specific minimum qualifications that must be met by a Corporate Governance Committee-recommended nominee. However, the Corporate Governance Committee does believe that each director on the Board should be of the highest character and integrity;
	possess a reputation for working constructively with others; have sufficient time to devote to Board matters; and be without any conflict of interest that would impede the individuals performance as a director.


	The Corporate Governance Committee will consider candidates for the Board from any reasonable source, including shareholder
	recommendations. The Corporate Governance Committee will not evaluate candidates differently based on who has made the recommendation. The Corporate Governance Committee has the authority to hire and pay a fee to consultants or search
	firms for the purpose of identifying and evaluating candidates. No such consultants or search firms have been used to date and, accordingly, no fees have been paid to consultants, search firms, or any other individuals.


	According to Section 2.03(B) of Cortlands Code of Regulations, any shareholder who desires to nominate an individual to the Board must
	provide timely written notice. To be timely, the notice must be mailed to the President of Cortland at least 14 days but no more than 50 days before the meeting at which directors will be elected, or 7 days after notice of the meeting is mailed
	to shareholders if the meeting is held within 21 days of Cortland mailing notice of the meeting.

	The shareholders notice of nomination must give:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the name and address of the nominee;




	 




	 


	

	


	 


	the number of shares beneficially owned by the shareholder making the nomination.




	The
	Corporate Governance Committee will disregard a shareholders nomination if it is not made in compliance with these rules and standards.



	Board
	Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight



	The office of Chairman of the Board and the office of Chief Executive Officer have
	been separate at Cortland since 2005. Since November 2, 2009, James M. Gasior has held the office of Chief Executive Officer and effective April 27, 2010, Timothy K. Woofter became Chairman of the Board. Cortland believes that separation
	of these two offices is consistent with the Boards responsibility for oversight of management and of Cortlands affairs generally. The Board and its committees have a significant role in oversight of the risks to which Cortland is
	subject. Like other community banking organizations, Cortland exercises oversight of common banking risks through a loan committee that considers loan applications and credit risk, an asset and liability committee whose routine responsibilities
	require consideration of interest rate and liquidity risk, an audit committee that takes into account audit and regulatory compliance risks and a loan review committee that monitors non-performing assets and their ultimate outcome. The full Board
	takes these and other risks into account in its deliberations as well.



	Code of Ethics



	Cortland has adopted a Code of Ethics (the Code) as part of its corporate governance program. The Code applies to all of Cortlands
	officers and employees, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Code is posted on the Investor Relations page of Cortlands website at www.cortlandbank.com under Governance Documents, Code of Business
	Conduct and Ethics. Any amendments to, or waivers from, this Code will be posted on this same website. In addition, a copy of the Code is available to shareholders upon request. Shareholders desiring a copy of the Code should
	address written requests to Mr. Lance A. Morrison, Vice President and Secretary of Cortland Bancorp, 194 West Main Street, Cortland, Ohio 44410, and are asked to mark Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on the outside of the envelope
	containing the request.

	Each non-employee director, except Director Woofter, was awarded 177 fully vested shares on April 26, 2016. Director Woofer was awarded 196 fully vested shares. The price of our stock on that date was $15.25.






	(1)


	Perquisites and other personal benefits provided to each of the directors described in the table were less than $10,000 in 2016. The figures in the all other compensation column consist of the imputed
	monetary value of life insurance policies for the directors and the addition in 2016 to the liability accrual balance established by Cortland to account for Cortlands obligation to pay retirement benefits under director retirement agreements
	entered into with participating non-employee directors. Director Vross has declined participation in both the retirement and life insurance programs. Entry into the Director Retirement Program has been discontinued. As such, Directors Erbaugh and
	Perciak do not participate in the Director Retirement Program. The imputed value of life insurance policies for income tax purposes in 2016 was $186 for Director Cole, $372 for Director Hoffman, $99 for Director Kaback, $123 for Director Koch, $119
	for Director Langhenry, $501 for Director Thompson, and $405 for Director Woofter. The addition to the liability accrual balance to account for the director retirement agreements in 2016 was $6,317 for Director Cole, $3,486 for Director Kaback,
	$3,993 for Director Koch, $3,585 for Director Langhenry and $6,686 for Director Thompson.





	Retirement Agreements and
	Insurance for Non-Employee Directors

	. Directors Cole, Hoffman, Kaback, Koch, Langhenry, Thompson, and Woofter are parties to director retirement agreements with Cortland. The director retirement agreements promise a post-retirement
	benefit of $10,000 payable annually for 10 years if the director retires after reaching his normal retirement age, which is a function of years of service on the Board and attained age. Normal retirement ages for these directors are age 61 (Mr.
	Cole), age 62 (Mr. Hoffman), age 67 (Mr. Kaback), age 70 (Mr. Koch), age 72 (Mr. Langhenry), age 70 (Mr. Thompson), and age 63 (Mr. Woofter). A reduced annual retirement benefit is payable if the director terminates service or becomes disabled
	before reaching the normal retirement age, but the benefit is not paid until the director reaches the normal retirement age. If termination of the directors service occurs within one year after a change in control of Cortland, the director
	will receive cash in a single lump sum equal to the retirement benefit expense accrued by Cortland. The director retirement agreement benefits to which a director is entitled are payable to his beneficiary after the directors death, but
	if the director dies in active service to Cortland before reaching his normal retirement age, his beneficiary will be entitled to cash in a single lump sum equal to the retirement benefit expense accrued by Cortland.


	Cortland purchased insurance on the lives of directors who are parties to the director retirement agreements and entered into split dollar
	agreements with them, promising to share a portion of the life insurance death benefits with the directors designated beneficiaries. Each directors portion of the policys death benefit is $100,000, payable to the
	directors beneficiary whether the directors death occurs while in active service to Cortland or after retirement. Cortland will receive any death benefits remaining after payment to the directors beneficiary. Entry into
	the Director Retirement Program has been discontinued. There will be no new director participants in the program, although the former directors currently participating will continue to do so.

	Director Indemnification

	. At the 2005 Annual Meeting, the shareholders of Cortland
	approved the form and use of indemnification agreements with directors. Cortland has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors. The indemnification agreements allow a director to select the most favorable
	indemnification rights provided under:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Cortlands Articles of Incorporation or Code of Regulations in effect on the date of the indemnification agreement or on the date expenses are incurred;




	 




	 


	


	 


	state law in effect on the date of the indemnification agreement or on the date expenses are incurred;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any liability insurance policy in effect when a claim is made against the director or on the date expenses are incurred; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	any other indemnification arrangement otherwise available.




	The indemnification agreements
	cover all fees, expenses, judgments, fines, penalties, and settlement amounts paid in any matter relating to the directors role as director, officer, employee, agent, or when serving as Cortlands representative with another
	entity. Each indemnification agreement provides for the prompt advancement of all expenses incurred in a proceeding, subject to the directors obligation to repay those advances if it is determined later that the director is not entitled
	to indemnification.



	Retainer and Fees

	. Currently, the Board and the Board of Directors of the Bank consist of the same
	individuals. The annual retainer for the Chairman of the Board is $20,000, with $675 for each board meeting attended. The annual retainer for all other non-employee directors is $18,000, plus $600 for each board meeting
	attended. Non-employee directors also receive a fee for each committee meeting attended: $400 for the Audit Committee, $400 for the Corporate Governance Committee, $400 for the Compensation Committee and $250 for all other committees.








	EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION



	Cortland does not provide any monetary compensation directly to its executive officers. Instead, the executive officers of Cortland are
	paid by the Bank for services rendered in their capacity as executive officers of Cortland and the Bank.

	Represents amounts earned under the Annual Incentive Plan for Executive Officers, a performance-based cash bonus plan, which aligns managements interests with those of the shareholders by requiring an acceptable
	shareholder return prior to any payout. With target return on assets granting a 10% of salaries award, and superior return on assets granting a maximum award of 15% of salaries, the actual performance established an incentive pool representing the
	target of 10% of salaries. In 2016, there were six weighted performance goals established under the plan, including (1) return on equity- 20%, (2) return on assets- 20%, (3) net interest margin- 20%, (4) efficiency ratio- 15%, (5) asset quality-
	15%, and (6) each executives individual performance evaluation- 10%. Having achieved 100% of goal-weighted performance the executives were entitled to a cash incentive bonus equal to 10% of salary as a result of the overall performance of the
	Company. Goal-weighted performance for 2016 resulted in payment of 10% of salary, with return on equity, return on assets, and net interest margin each contributing 2% of salary, efficiency ratio and asset quality 1.5% of salary and individual
	performance 1% of salary.

	On April 26, 2016, the Compensation Committee of Cortlands Board of Directors awarded 2,433 shares of restricted stock to President and CEO James M. Gasior, 2,297 shares to Executive Vice President and COO Timothy
	Carney, and 1,593 shares to Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David J. Lucido. Awarded under the 2015 Omnibus Equity Plan, the shares vest in equal thirds on the first three anniversaries of the award date if the executive remains
	employed with Cortland, but the awards will be fully vested if a change in control occurs. The price of stock on the grant date was $15.25 per share. In 2016, Cortland expensed $8,463 for Mr. Gasior, $7,990 for Mr. Carney and $5,541 for Mr. Lucido.






	(4)


	The figures in the all other compensation column consist of the Banks contribution to the 401(k) plan accounts for the named executive officers, the imputed monetary value of life insurance policies,
	vehicle-related expenses, club memberships, and accrual expense for benefits payable under the executives salary continuation agreements. For 2016, the Bank made contributions of $12,852 to the 401(k) plan account of Mr. Gasior, $13,250
	to the account of Mr. Carney and $9,268 to the account of Mr. Lucido. The imputed value of life insurance policies for income tax purposes in 2016 was $3,596 for Mr. Gasior, $2,043 for Mr. Carney and $2,472 for Mr. Lucido. Vehicle-related expenses
	in 2016 were $8,400 for Mr. Gasior, $8,100 for Mr. Carney and $6,600 for Mr. Lucido. Club membership dues in 2016 were $8,014 for Mr. Gasior, $14,811 for Mr. Carney and $7,816 for Mr. Lucido. In 2016, dividends earned on restricted shares awarded
	under the 2015 Omnibus Equity Plan were $511 for Mr. Gasior, $482 for Mr. Carney and $335 for Mr. Lucido. Incentives earned on residential mortgage loans in 2016 were $0 for Mr. Gasior, $300 for Mr. Carney and $100 for Mr. Lucido. The addition to
	the liability accrual balance to account for the salary continuation agreements in 2016 was $81,478 for Mr. Gasior, $53,240 for Mr. Carney and $71,073 for Mr. Lucido.





	Administration of Cortlands Compensation Programs.

	Cortlands compensation programs for its executive officers are generally
	administered by or under the direction and supervision of Cortlands Compensation Committee, which is responsible for reviewing and recommending to the independent members of the Board of Directors for approval the salary, bonus and all other
	compensation and benefits to be provided to Cortlands Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers.


	The Companys
	Chief Executive Officer and human resources manager annually review the compensation and performance of each executive officer of Cortland (other than the Chief Executive Officer, whose compensation and performance is reviewed by the Compensation
	Committee). The results of these reviews are communicated to the Compensation Committee, along with recommendations regarding compensation adjustments for the ensuing year. The Compensation Committee either approves the recommended compensation
	adjustments or makes modifications in its discretion. The Compensation Committee then makes its final recommendations to the independent members of the Board of Directors for approval.


	In setting salaries for Cortlands executive officers, the Compensation Committee and human resources manager use pay ranges that are
	established based on publicly available market data regarding compensation paid to similarly situated executive officers at other companies. Pay ranges are established and adjusted periodically with reference to market data from publicly available
	compensation surveys. For each employee position or category within Cortland, the pay range that is established includes a minimum, a mid-point and a maximum salary. Although the Compensation Committee generally does not target a specific point
	within the pay range for executive officer salaries, the Compensation Committee strives to ensure that its executive officer compensation remains competitive with the compensation provided by other financial institutions with which Cortland competes
	for executive talent.



	Annual Incentive Plan for Executive Officers

	. At its March 4, 2014 meeting, the Board adopted the
	Annual Incentive Plan for Executive Officers. The plan is a short-term cash incentive plan paying additional cash compensation of a maximum of 15% of salary if specified annual objectives are achieved. The Plan objective is to align the
	interests of management to that of the shareholders by paying out only upon achieving an acceptable shareholder return. The performance objectives can include bank-wide performance objectives, business unit goals, and individual performance
	goals. Adopted by the Compensation Committee at its October 28, 2014 meeting, the six bank-wide performance goals in effect for 2015 and 2016 were based on return on equity, return on assets, net interest margin, efficiency ratio (noninterest
	expense divided by the sum of tax-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income), asset quality (net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans, classified asset coverage, meaning assets classified substandard or doubtful as a percentage
	of the sum of tier 1 capital and the allowance for loan and lease losses, and loan loss exposure, meaning nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans), and each executives individual performance evaluation, with each of the six goals
	having its own assigned weight. If targeted performance is achieved, a participating officer will receive a cash bonus ranging from 10% to 15% of base salary, depending on the level of goal achievement. Assuming targeted goals are achieved for
	a calendar year, cash distributions under the plan

	Table of Contents



	occur in the first quarter of the immediately following year. It is not necessary to achieve each of the performance goals to become entitled to a cash incentive bonus under the
	plan. CEO James M. Gasior, COO Timothy Carney, Senior Vice President and Chief Lending Officer Stanley P. Feret, and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David J. Lucido are participants in the Annual Incentive Plan. The
	Annual Incentive Plan may be terminated by the Board of Directors at any time.



	Severance Agreements

	. Cortland is a party to
	severance agreements with Messrs. Gasior, Carney, and Lucido. Messrs. Gasior and Carney are entitled by their severance agreement to an immediate lump-sum cash payment if a change in control occurs. The amount of the payment is 2.99 times the
	sum of their base salary and the most recent annual bonus. If the executives employment terminates involuntarily but without cause or voluntarily because of an adverse change in employment circumstances to which he did not consent in
	advance, in either case with termination occurring within 24 months after a change in control, he would also be entitled to continued medical, dental, accident, disability, and life insurance coverage for up to three years. Mr. Lucidos
	severance agreement is similar to that of Messrs. Gasior and Carney, except that (

	x

	) the change-in-control benefit of Mr. Lucido is 2.00 times compensation and (

	y

	) the change-in-control benefit is payable if and only if Mr.
	Lucidos employment is terminated within 24 months after a change in control, whether because of involuntary termination by Cortland without cause or voluntary termination by Mr. Lucido because of a material adverse change in employment
	circumstances to which he did not consent in advance.


	The severance agreements prohibit competition with Cortland in Trumbull, Portage,
	or Mahoning Counties in Ohio for one year after employment termination. The executives are entitled to a payment equal to 1.0 times compensation after employment termination in exchange for the agreement not to compete, unless (

	x

	) they
	also receive or are entitled to receive change-in-control benefits under the severance agreement or (

	y

	) their employment termination occurs after age 65 or on account of retirement. The severance agreements of Messrs. Gasior and Carney
	provide that the post-employment prohibition against competition does not apply if a change in control occurs. The severance agreements protect the executives against a challenge by Cortland after a change in control occurs, providing the
	reimbursement of the executives legal expenses to enforce the agreements against Cortland after a change in control. The agreements have three-year terms, extending at each anniversary for one additional year. A copy of the severance agreement
	of each of Messrs. Gasior, Carney, and Lucido is attached as an exhibit to the Form 8-K Current Report filed by Cortland with the SEC on December 1, 2015.


	If a change in control occurs and the total benefits or payments to which an executive is entitled constitute so-called excess parachute
	payments and are therefore subject to the 20% excise tax under IRC Sections 280G and 4999 (whether under the severance agreement or under any other compensation arrangement), Cortland must by the terms of the severance agreements also make an
	adjusted gross-up payment to Messrs. Gasior, Carney, and Lucido, compensating them for the excise tax as well as for income, payroll, and excise taxes imposed on that parachute payment excise tax reimbursement payment. A 20% excise tax is
	imposed under Section 4999 if the value of an executives aggregate change-in-control benefits  calculated according to procedures specified in Section 280G and accompanying IRS regulations  equals or exceeds three times the
	executives five-year average taxable compensation. The five-year average is known as the base amount. If the value of the aggregate change-in-control benefits equals or exceeds three times the base amount, a 20% excise tax is imposed
	on all benefits exceeding the base amount and the employer forfeits its compensation deduction for those same benefits. The total adjusted gross-up payment to Messrs. Gasior, Carney, and Lucido would consist of (1) a payment equal to the
	initial excise tax and (2) a gross-up payment that is equal to 80% of the difference between (

	x

	) the amount that would fully compensate the executives for all income, payroll, and excise taxes imposed on the excise tax reimbursement payment
	and (

	y

	) the excise tax payment itself. The gross-up benefit is not deductible compensation.



	Salary Continuation
	Agreements

	. Messrs. Gasior, Carney and Lucido are also parties to salary continuation agreements with The Cortland Savings and Banking Company. The salary continuation agreements provide Messrs. Gasior, Carney and Lucido with an annual
	normal retirement benefit payable for 15 years, beginning at age 65 and payable regardless of whether the executives continue working past age 65. The annual benefit amount is $127,555 for Mr. Gasior, $129,840 for Mr. Carney, and $80,900 for
	Mr. Lucido. A reduced benefit is payable for termination before attaining age 65, the amount of the reduced benefit being the amount that amortizes over 15 years the liability accrual balance existing when termination occurs. Mr. Lucidos
	early termination benefit is also subject to a vesting requirement, vesting in equal 10% increments on the first ten anniversaries of the agreements June 1, 2010 effective date, but becoming fully vested if a change in control first
	occurs. For termination before full vesting, Mr. Lucidos early termination would be based on the vested accrual balance. If a change in control occurs before attaining age 65, instead of an annual retirement-age benefit Mr. Gasior
	and Mr. Carney would be entitled to an immediate lump-sum payment equal to the liability accrual balance projected to exist at their age 65 normal retirement age, but the payment would be discounted to present value. After a change in control
	Mr. Lucido would be entitled to a lump-sum payment equal to the existing liability accrual balance, but only if within 24 months after the change in control Mr. Lucidos employment termination occurs involuntarily but without cause or
	voluntarily on account of an adverse change in employment circumstances to which he did not consent in advance. The salary continuation agreements employ the definition of the term change in control that is contained in IRC Section 409A and
	implementing regulations.

	Table of Contents



	Like the severance agreements, the salary continuation agreements provide for reimbursement of
	legal expenses for the executives if the agreements are challenged by Cortland after a change in control occurs. The salary continuation agreements of Messrs. Gasior and Carney prohibit them from competing with the Bank for two years after
	employment termination. The prohibition against competition is void if a change in control occurs, however. Finally, although the salary continuation agreements do not commit Cortland to changing the executives benefit amounts in the
	future, as amended in late 2015 the agreements require Cortland to review every three years whether the retirement benefits payable under the agreements continue to be sufficient to provide the intended retirement income security for the executives.
	A copy of the agreement of Mr. Gasior and Mr. Carney  the November 24, 2015 Seventh Amended Salary Continuation Agreement  is included as an exhibit to the Form 8-K Current Report filed with the SEC on December 1, 2015. A copy of Mr.
	Lucidos November 24, 2015 Amended Salary Continuation Agreement also is included as an exhibit to the Form 8-K.


	If Messrs. Gasior,
	Carney and Lucido die before age 65 in active service to the Bank, instead of salary continuation agreement benefits payable to Messrs. Gasior, Carney and Lucido, their beneficiaries will receive a life insurance death benefit in a fixed
	amount. As informal financing for the salary continuation agreement payment obligation arising out of an executives death before retirement, the Cortland Savings and Banking Company purchased life insurance policies on certain
	officers lives, including Messrs. Gasior, Carney, and Lucido. The life insurance policies are owned by the Bank, but the Bank entered into endorsement split dollar arrangements allowing the executives to designate the beneficiary of a
	portion of the policy death benefits. The Bank will receive the remainder of the death benefits. Messrs. Gasiors, Carneys, and Lucidos split dollar agreements provide that the split dollar life insurance benefit expires
	when the nonqualified deferred compensation obligation is fully accrued at age 65, even if the executive is still working for the Bank. Although the Bank expects the split dollar life insurance policy benefits to finance the expense for the
	payment obligations under the salary continuation agreements of Messrs. Gasior, Carney, and Lucido, the executives contractual entitlements under the agreements are not funded and remain contractual liabilities of the Bank. A copy of the
	agreement of Mr. Gasior and Mr. Carney  the April 19, 2011 Fourth Amended Split Dollar Agreement and Endorsement  is included as an exhibit to the Form 8-K Current Report that we filed with the SEC on April 22, 2011. A copy of the
	agreement of Mr. Lucido  the March 27, 2012 Endorsement Split Dollar Agreement  is included as an exhibit to the Form 10-K Annual Report that we filed with the SEC on March 29, 2012.



	Group Term Carve Out Plan.


	 

	In December 2000, the Bank purchased with a single premium payment approximately $2.8 million in
	life insurance on the lives of 22 officers, adopting a Group Term Carve Out Plan that allows those 22 officers to designate through a split dollar life insurance endorsement the beneficiary of a portion of the life insurance proceeds. The Bank
	is entitled to all proceeds other than the portion allocable to the officers designated beneficiaries. A number of the original 22 officers have since terminated, but those who remain include Messrs. Gasior and Carney. The Group Term
	Carve Out Plan was amended and restated as of November 1, 2014. A copy of the November 1, 2014 Amended and Restated Group Term Carve Out Plan is included as an exhibit to the Form 8-K Current Report filed with the SEC on November 3,
	2014. As amended and restated, the Group Term Carve Out Plan provides that  unless an individual participating officers split dollar life insurance endorsement states otherwise  an executives beneficiaries are entitled
	to one of the following death benefit amounts:



	Pre-Retirement Death Benefit

	. If the executive dies before retirement, the
	death benefit is the least of (a) $500,000, (b) twice the executives current annual salary at the time of death, less $50,000, or (c) 100% of the life insurance policy net death proceeds, meaning total death proceeds minus policy cash
	surrender value, or



	Post-Retirement Death Benefit

	. If the executive was no longer employed by the Bank at the time of death,
	but had terminated employment within one year after a change in control, or due to disability, or on or after the early retirement age of 62, the death benefit is the least of (a) $500,000, (b) the Executives most recent salary at the time of
	death, or (c) 100% of the life insurance policy net death proceeds, meaning total death proceeds minus policy cash surrender value.


	The
	Bank receives the remainder of the life insurance policy death benefits, which should be sufficient to recover in full the Banks life insurance investment. No benefits are payable under the plan to any executive whose employment
	terminates before the age of 62, unless termination is due to disability or unless termination occurs within one year after a change in control. Benefits are payable to the executives beneficiaries in a lump sum. When the Group Term
	Carve Out Plan was amended and restated effective November 1, 2014, the split dollar life insurance endorsements of participating officers were also replaced by new endorsements. The new endorsements eliminate the pre-retirement death
	benefit. As a result, the designated beneficiary of a participating officer will be entitled to a life insurance death benefit under the Group Term Carve Out Plan if and only if the officer dies after employment termination, and only if
	employment termination occurred on account of disability, or within one year after a change in control, or after attaining age 62. The benefit amount is limited as described under the heading Post-Retirement Death Benefit, above.

	Table of Contents



	Employees also have life insurance benefits under the Banks group term life insurance
	program, paying benefits up to twice the executives current annual salary at the time of death to the executives beneficiaries if the executive dies while employed by the Bank.



	Profit Sharing Program

	. The Bank maintains a profit sharing plan designed to provide incentives to eligible employees to
	contribute toward the achievement of superior performance. Eligible employees are those in good standing and who do not participate in other incentive programs. Executive management is not eligible. The Board performance criterion for 2016 was
	return on assets. Based upon the level of 2016 return on assets, the Board approved a profit sharing pool that paid 2.5% of salary for eligible employees.



	Employee Benefit Plan 401(k)

	. The Bank maintains a traditional 401(k) retirement plan for employees. In general, the Bank
	matches participants voluntary contributions up to 5% of gross pay. Employee contributions and matching contributions under the plan accumulate tax free until distributions begin at the employees normal retirement age. The goal
	of the 401(k) plan is to enable employees to provide for their own retirement and, combined with Social Security benefits, to ensure that their aggregate post-retirement income is maintained at a percentage of pre-retirement income sufficient to
	sustain a long-term retirement.



	Perquisites and Other Compensation

	. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the
	perquisites that the management team receives. In the case of Messrs. Gasior, Carney and Lucido, membership in a golf or social club is encouraged to provide an appropriate forum for entertaining existing customers, developing and promoting new
	business and generally interacting with influential members of the local community.



	IRC Limits.


	 

	Cortland considers tax
	and accounting implications in the design of its compensation programs. Section 162(m) of the IRC places a limit on the tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the chief executive officer and four most highly compensated
	executive officers of a corporation in a taxable year. All of the compensation Cortland paid in 2016 to the named executive officers is expected to be deductible under Section 162(m). The Executive Compensation Committee retains the
	flexibility, however, to pay non-deductible compensation if it believes doing so is in the best interests of Cortland.





	TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS



	The Board is responsible for reviewing and overseeing the procedures designed to identify
	related party transactions that are material to Cortlands consolidated financial statements or otherwise require disclosure under applicable laws and rules adopted by the SEC and the Board has the authority to approve such
	related party transactions. In addition, each director and executive officer of Cortland must complete a Director and Officer Questionnaire that requires disclosure of any transaction, arrangement or relationship with Cortland or the
	Bank during the last fiscal year in which the director or executive officer, or any member of his or her immediate family, had a direct or indirect material interest. Any transaction, arrangement or relationship disclosed by a director or executive
	officer in the questionnaire is reviewed and considered by the Board in making independence determinations with respect to directors and resolving any conflicts of interest that may be implicated.


	During the Companys 2016 fiscal year, the Bank entered into banking-related transactions in the ordinary course of business with certain
	executive officers and directors of Cortland (including certain executive officers of the Bank), members of their immediate families and corporations or organizations with which they are affiliated. It is expected that similar transactions will be
	entered into in the future. All loans made to directors and executive officers (i) were made in the ordinary course of business; (ii) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time
	for comparable loans with persons not related to Cortland; and (iii) did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. The outstanding principal balance of loans to directors, executive officers, and
	principal shareholders of Cortland (including certain executive officers of the Bank) and their associates as a group at December 31, 2016 was $4.6 million. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, all of these loans were performing loans

	.

	ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION



	(

	Proposal Two

	)


	We are
	subject to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires that we provide to our shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table.


	Commonly known as a say-on-pay vote, the shareholder vote required by Section 14A is an advisory vote, which means that the vote is not
	binding on us, on our Board of Directors, or on the Compensation Committee. The say-on-pay vote is intended to be a vote on the executive officer compensation that is disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the disclosure rules of
	the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	The goals of our compensation arrangements are to provide fair and competitive compensation, to
	provide compensation that promotes the hiring and retention of the most talented personnel, to create incentives for and to reward superior performance, and to align the interests of our officers and employees with the interests of
	shareholders. We seek to avoid creating incentives for unnecessary or excessive risk-taking, avoid creating incentives for excessive focus on stock price performance instead of fundamental business values, avoid creating incentives to seek
	short-term benefits at the expense of long-term results, and avoid creating incentives to achieve short-term benefits with long-term risks. With the assistance of the Compensation Committee, the Board believes that Cortlands compensation
	arrangements avoid these adverse incentives and instead reward performance promoting our long-term prosperity, although the arrangements are continually evolving and are and will remain subject to ongoing review and evaluation by the Board and by
	the Compensation Committee. We are asking shareholders to vote on the following resolution at the 2017 Annual Meeting:


	RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Companys named executive officers, as disclosed in Cortland Bancorps Proxy
	Statement for the 2017 Annual Meeting in compliance with Item 402 of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation S-K, including the compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.


	Approval of a majority of the votes cast will constitute approval of this proposal to approve the named executive officer compensation
	disclosed in this proxy statement. An abstention or broker non-vote is not counted as a vote cast, and as a result will have no effect on the vote to approve the proposal. A proxy that does not specify voting instructions will be voted in
	favor of this non-binding, advisory proposal. Although the results of the say-on-pay vote will not be binding on us, we expect to take the results into account in future compensation decisions.



	The Board recommends a vote

	FOR

	approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement.

	AMENDMENT OF THE CODE OF REGULATIONS



	(

	Proposal Three

	)


	The
	Board of Directors has adopted, declared advisable and is submitting for stockholder approval an amendment to the Companys Code of Regulations to increase the mandatory retirement age for members of the Companys Board of Directors. The
	Companys Code of Regulations currently imposes a mandatory retirement age of 70. The Company proposes to increase this mandatory retirement age by making directors eligible for one additional term after they have first attained the age of
	70 or above. The adoption of this amendment requires the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitled to exercise a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock.


	The second sentence of Article Two, Section 2.01 of the Companys Code of Regulations currently provides as follows:


	No person who has attained the age of seventy (70) shall be eligible for election as a director.


	If the proposed amendment is approved by shareholders, the second sentence of Article Two, Section 2.01 of the Companys Code of
	Regulations will be amended to read as follows:


	A director whose term expires after he has first attained the age of seventy (70)
	shall be eligible to serve one additional term as a director.


	For the reasons set forth below, the Companys Board of
	Directors has adopted and is submitting for stockholder approval an amendment to this provision of the Code of Regulations to increase the current mandatory retirement age for directors. The effect of the amendment as proposed will be to establish a
	mandatory retirement age of 73 to 75, depending upon the directors age when his or her term expires after he or she first attains the age of 70.


	The Board believes that a more flexible mandatory retirement age for the Companys directors is in line with other community bank holding
	companies in the Companys market and is an appropriate and commonsense act of corporate governance. The current mandatory retirement age could deter well-qualified candidates who are approaching the mandatory retirement age from agreeing to
	serve as directors and could result in the premature retirement of experienced directors who are valuable members of the Board of Directors with deep knowledge of the Companys history and operations. Providing a degree of flexibility in
	director retirement would give the Company the opportunity to benefit from the valuable expertise of directors for a longer time, while maintaining a mandatory retirement age that is in line with the average retirement age of directors of other bank
	holding companies.


	The Company has surveyed twelve bank holding companies located in Ohio that, as of December 31, 2016, had securities
	registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and consolidated assets of between $200 million and $1.4 billion. The Company found that its current mandatory retirement age of 70 is on the low end of that survey. Based on the publicly
	available codes of regulations and corporate governance guidelines of the surveyed companies, nine of the twelve companies have a mandatory retirement age higher than the Companys current retirement age of 70 or have no mandatory retirement
	age at all.

	Increasing the Companys mandatory retirement age for directors will bring the Company into better
	alignment with similarly situated bank holding companies in Ohio and will allow the Company to be more competitive with its peers in the recruitment and retention of experienced directors.


	In 2015, the Company appointed two seasoned directors to the Board, each of whom had significant prior experience with publicly traded bank
	holding companies in the Companys market areas. The Companys appointment of these experienced directors has had a positive impact on both business development and corporate governance. The proposed amendment to the Code of Regulations
	would give the Company the required flexibility to attract and retain additional directors of that caliber.

	Table of Contents



	If approved by the shareholders, this amendment to the Companys Code of Regulations will
	become effective immediately upon approval, and the Board of Directors will also make conforming changes to its corporate governance guidelines regarding the retirement age for directors.



	The Board recommends a vote

	FOR

	the proposal to adopt amended Section 2.01 of the Code of Regulations.






	RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS




	(Proposal Four)



	Cortlands independent auditor for the year ended December 31, 2016, was S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. Subject to shareholder ratification,
	the audit committee has selected S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. to be Cortlands independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. We expect one or more representatives of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. to be present at the Annual
	Meeting. The representative of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. will have the opportunity to make a statement if desired, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

	(1)


	Audit fees consist of fees for professional services rendered for the audit of the Companys financial statements, review of financial statements included in the Companys quarterly reports, and for services
	normally provided by the independent auditor in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.






	(2)


	Audit-related fees are fees principally for professional services for the audit of the Companys employee benefit plan.






	(3)


	Tax service fees consist of compliance fees for the preparation of original tax returns.






	(4)


	All other fees relate to consulting services in relation to strategic planning.





	Pre-Approval of Services Performed by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

	. The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit
	and non-audit services provided by the independent auditors prior to the engagement of the independent auditors with respect to such services. The Chairman of the Audit Committee has been designated the authority by the Committee to pre-approve
	the engagement of the independent auditors when the entire Audit Committee is unable to do so. The Chairman must report all such pre-approvals to the entire Audit Committee at its next meeting. All of the services rendered by S.R.
	Snodgrass, P.C. to Cortland and its subsidiaries for the 2016 and the 2015 fiscal years were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.



	Auditor Independence

	. The Audit Committee believes that the non-audit services provided by S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. are compatible with
	maintaining the auditors independence. To the best of Cortlands knowledge, none of the time devoted by S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. on its engagement to audit Cortlands financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, is
	attributable to work performed by persons other than

	full-time,

	permanent employees of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C.


	Cortlands Code of Regulations do not require the submission of the selection of independent auditors to shareholders for
	approval. However, the Board believes it is appropriate to give shareholders the opportunity to ratify the decision of the Audit Committee to appoint S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as Cortlands principal accountant. Neither the Audit Committee
	nor the Board will be bound by the shareholders vote at the Annual Meeting, but may take the shareholders vote into account in future determinations regarding the retention of an independent auditor.

	Recommendation and Vote




	The Board recommends a vote

	FOR

	ratification of the appointment of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as Cortlands independent auditor for
	the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017.






	AUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS







	Audit Committee Report for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2016



	The Audit Committee has reviewed the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, and has discussed the audited financial
	statements with management. The Audit Committee has also discussed with S.R. Snodgrass, P.C., Cortlands independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (having
	to do with accounting methods used in the financial statements). The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (having to do with matters
	that could affect the independent registered accounting firms independence), and has discussed with S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. the independent registered accounting firms independence. Based on this, the Audit Committee recommended to the
	Board that Cortlands audited consolidated financial statements be included in Cortlands Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.



	Submitted by the Audit Committee



	J.
	Martin Erbaugh, Neil J. Kaback, Richard B. Thompson, and Anthony R. Vross








	SUBMISSION OF SHAREHOLDER
	PROPOSALS



	If any Cortland shareholder wishes to submit a proposal to be included in next years proxy statement and acted upon
	at Cortlands Annual Meeting to be held in 2018, the proposal must be received by Cortlands Secretary prior to the close of business on December 12, 2017. Upon receipt of a shareholder proposal, Cortland will determine whether or not
	to include the proposal in the proxy materials in accordance with applicable SEC Rules.


	If a shareholder intends to present a proposal at
	the 2018 Annual Meeting, but has not sought the inclusion of such proposal in Cortlands proxy materials, such proposal must be received by the Secretary of Cortland prior to the close of business on February 25, 2018, or the management proxies
	for the 2018 Annual Meeting will be entitled to use their discretionary voting authority, should such proposal then be raised, without any discussion of the matter in Cortlands proxy material.





	DELIVERY OF PROXY MATERIALS TO SHAREHOLDERS SHARING AN ADDRESS



	SEC rules provide for householding, which permits Cortland to send a single annual report and a single proxy statement to any
	household at which two or more different shareholders reside if Cortland believes such shareholders are members of the same family or otherwise share the same address or in which one shareholder has multiple accounts, if in each case such
	shareholder(s) have not opted out of the householding process. Each shareholder would continue to receive a separate notice of any meeting of shareholders and a separate proxy card. The householding procedure reduces the volume of
	duplicate information that shareholders may receive and reduces Cortlands expense. Cortland may institute householding in the future, and will notify those registered shareholders who will be affected by householding at that time.


	Many brokerage firms and other holders of record have instituted householding. If your family has one or more street name
	accounts under which you beneficially own common shares of Cortland, you may have received householding information from your broker, bank, or other nominee in the past. Please contact the holder of record directly if you have any questions,
	require additional copies of the Form 10-K or proxy statement for the 2016 fiscal year, or to revoke your consent to household and, thereby, receive multiple copies once again. These options are available to you at any time.

	OTHER BUSINESS



	As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board knows of no other matters that will be presented for action at the annual meeting other than
	those discussed in this proxy statement. If any other business should properly arise, the persons acting under the proxies solicited by the Board have the discretionary authority to vote in accordance with their best judgment.

	Cortland Bancorp Earns $1.0 Million, or $0.23 Per Share, for 1Q17; Driven by Solid Loan and Deposit Growth







	CORTLAND, Ohio, April 26, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

	Cortland Bancorp

	(OTCQB:CLDB), the holding company for Cortland Savings and Banking Company, today reported net income of $1.0 million, or $0.23 per share, for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.4 million, or $0.31 per share, for the first quarter of 2016.  Earnings were $1.1 million, or $0.26 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.  All results are unaudited.   



	“Following the most profitable year we’ve delivered since 2003, first quarter 2017 financial results were solid,” said James Gasior, President and Chief Executive Officer.  “Throughout 2016, we continued to implement our strategic initiatives of expanding into adjacent markets.  We invested in key personnel to support the Cortland Private Bank and Commercial lending efforts in other northeast Ohio markets, as well as expanding our retail presence in the Hudson market.  These investments are in the early stages of their production with an expected lag in the corresponding revenue stream; thus, the first quarter results are affected by the higher than usual noninterest expense base.  We are optimistic that our organic expansion will translate into loan and deposit growth, and eventual improvement in earnings.”


	“We celebrated the grand opening of our fourteenth full-service branch in Hudson, Ohio, the first week of April with many community leaders in attendance.  Over 100 customers and prospective customers were also in attendance,” added Gasior.  “The new branch is now open for business and is providing a full array of financial services for personal, business and private banking, including checking, savings, loan, credit card and investment products.  In the meantime, we continue to host our popular Thursday morning coffee gatherings for our customers and neighbors at a local Starbucks each month.”


	“Net Interest Income, our core earnings barometer, continued to show improvement at $4.9 million, for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $4.7 million for the like quarter a year ago,” said Gasior.



	First Quarter 2017 Highlights

	(at, or for the period ended March 31, 2017);



	Earnings per share was $0.23 for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $0.31 for the first quarter of 2016, and $0.26 for the fourth quarter of 2016.




	Net interest income increased 5% to $4.9 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $4.7 million for the first quarter a year ago, and remained relatively flat on a linked quarter basis. 




	Non-interest income was $891,000 for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2016 and $897,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016.




	Net interest margin (“NIM”) for the quarter was 3.52%, compared to 3.58% for the first quarter a year ago and 3.58% for the fourth quarter of 2016.




	Total loans grew 6% to $397.1 million from $373.8 million for the first quarter a year ago.




	Mortgage originations were $8.2 million, generating gains on sale of mortgages of $194,000 in the first quarter of 2017, from $10.4 million in originations and $349,000 in gains in the first quarter of 2016.




	Total deposits grew 7% to $517.4 million from the comparable quarter a year earlier.




	Nonperforming assets declined to 1.41% of total assets at March 31, 2017.

	Operating Results





	Net Interest Income


	Net interest income increased 5% to $4.9 million, compared to $4.7 million for the first quarter a year ago, primarily due to higher average loan balances.  Net interest income declined slightly in the quarter from $5.0 million on a linked quarter basis.   



	Net Interest Margin


	Net interest margin (“NIM”) was 3.52% for the first quarter of 2017, compared to 3.58% for the first quarter of 2016, and the fourth quarter of 2016.  “The challenge to margin continues to be the lower yields we are receiving on loans and investment securities,” said David Lucido, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.


	“With $13.5 million in higher rate, long-term FHLB advances maturing between December 2016 and September 2017, payoff and/or refinancing at lower rates is expected to reduce interest expense by approximately $275,000.  With an improved funding mix, we expect our net interest margin to stabilize or improve,” said Lucido.



	Noninterest Income


	Total noninterest income, excluding investment gains, was $891,000 for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2016 and $897,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016.  Recent interest rate movements since the election has made an impact on the margins generated on mortgage loans sold.  Despite the first quarter decline, mortgage banking revenue was a meaningful contributor to noninterest income.



	Operating Expenses


	Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2017 was $4.6 million, compared to $4.5 million for both the like quarter a year ago and the preceding quarter.  “The increase in noninterest expense in the first quarter was primarily related to higher compensation associated with our expansion in the greater Cleveland area,” explained Lucido.


	“The substantial investments we made in the Cleveland area, by adding experienced staff to our private banking operations and commercial business development, are initially adding to expenses and therefore impacting net income this quarter.  However, as our team begins developing and deepening client relationships, we expect to begin generating results for these investments,” added Gasior.  “Our earlier investment in the Mahoning Valley commercial banking group continues to generate quality loans and deposit flow.”


	The efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2017 was 76.63%, compared to 71.13% for the first quarter a year earlier and 73.13% for the fourth quarter of 2016.


	“The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 was 16.0%, compared to 16.1% for the first quarter of 2016, reflecting the benefits of investments with tax incentives and tax free components of our revenue stream,” added Lucido. 




	Balance Sheet and Asset Quality




	Total assets were $619.9 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $590.4 million at March 31, 2016, and $655.2 million at December 31, 2016. 


	Investment securities totaled $165.1 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $166.0 million at March 31, 2016, and $179.2 million on a linked quarter basis.  As of March 31, 2017, the securities primarily comprised of high-grade mortgage-back securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities.  The balance in investment securities continues to vary with the liquidity and interest rate risk management of the balance sheet.


	“We had another strong quarter of loan production in what is typically a seasonally slow first quarter,” commented Gasior.  Total loans increased 6% to $397.1 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $373.8 million at March 31, 2016, and declined 5% from a December 31, 2016 balance that included $30 million of seasonal short-term loans.  Average loan balances, which help smooth out some of the seasonal impact, increased 4% on a linked quarter basis and 7% year-over-year.   


	The loan portfolio remains diversified and comprise of both retail and business relationships with commercial real estate (CRE) loans accounting for 61.9%, of which 17.6% were owner-occupied by businesses.  Commercial loans accounted for 16.3% while residential 1-4 loans accounted for 14.8%.  Consumer and home equity loans accounted for 7% of total loans.  “Our loan production remains solid, again boosted by the growth in commercial real estate and business loans,” added Gasior.


	Total deposits grew by $35.4 million, or 7%, to $517.4 million at March 31, 2017, from $481.9 million at March 31, 2016, and were lower by $22.5 million, or 4%, compared to $539.9 million at December 31, 2016, which also included $30 million of seasonal short-term accounts.  Noninterest-bearing deposits accounted for 21.6% of total deposits; interest-bearing demand deposits accounted for 9.9%, while money market and savings accounted for 42.9% of total deposits.  Certificates of deposits were 25.6% of the deposit mix. “The Kasasa free checking account program continues to be successful with more than 2,500 accounts now opened and approximately $8.3 million in new checking account balances.  Online account opening was launched allowing customers to open a Rewards Kasasa account on their computer or mobile device,” commented Gasior. 


	Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 1.41% at March 31, 2017, compared to 2.05% of total assets at March 31, 2016, and 1.39% of total assets, at December 31, 2016.  Nonperforming loans were $7.4 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $11.3 million a year earlier and $8.3 million, at December 31, 2016.


	Performing restructured loans, that were not included in nonaccrual loans at the end of the first quarter of 2017, were $4.4 million compared to $5.5 million at the end 2016 and $6.4 million on a linked quarter basis.  Borrowers who are in financial difficulty and who have been granted concessions that may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, or payment alterations are categorized as restructured loans. “We present restructured loans that are performing separately from those that are classified as nonaccrual to provide more information on this category of loans and to differentiate between accruing performing and nonperforming restructured loans,” explained Lucido.

	Forward Looking Statement


	This release may contain “forward-looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s views only as of the date hereof. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, regarding our financial position, business strategy and management’s plans and objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” and “intend” and words or phrases of similar meaning, as they relate to Cortland Bancorp or management, are intended to help identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe that management’s expectations as reflected in forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure readers that those expectations will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from our expectations as indicated in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include our ability to maintain or expand our market share or net interest margins, and to implement our marketing and growth strategies. Further, actual results may be affected by our ability to compete on price and other factors with other financial institutions; customer acceptance of new products and services; the regulatory environment in which we operate; and general trends in the local, regional and national banking industry and economy, as those factors relate to our cost of funds and return on assets. In addition, there are risks inherent in the banking industry relating to collectability of loans and changes in interest rates. Many of these risks, as well as other risks that may have a material adverse impact on our operations and business, are identified in our other filings with the SEC. However, you should be aware that these factors are not an exhaustive list, and you should not assume these are the only factors that may cause our actual results to differ from our expectations.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
