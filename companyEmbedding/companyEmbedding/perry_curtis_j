Since then surgery to refine the nose, chin and cheek implants, liposuction for the chin and neckline, brow lift and later micro-layering fat injection to cheeks and lips have been done. The result is a sculpting to refine and enhance the entire face. Of late I would have chosen micro-layering fat injection alone to contour the cheeks and chin.Eyelid SurgeryMarilyn, our Medical Assistant, in 2003 at age 37, before any proceedure (upper left) and then results after fat injection to the lateral cheeks (upper right). Bottom row shows before and after upper eyelid surgery to remove excess skin in 2006.LiposuctionTricia had liposuction to the neck area combined with fat injection to shape her brow, cheeks, lips and chin.RhinoplastyCosmetic surgical enhancement by Dr Curtis Perry MD at the Artistic Surgical Center, using rhinoplasty, otoplasty, fat augmentation of the cheeks, lips, chin and eyelids and conturing using liposuctionPlastic SurgeryFace LiftLower facelift procedure combined with microlayering fat injection to the cheek and chin area created a much more youthful look.Neck LiftRosalie and Warren are our husband-and-wife team. Rosalie had total face and neck lift with upper eyelid surgery. Fat injection was then done to the cheeks to further improve the contouring of her face.Warren had lower face and neck lift with eyelid surgery and fat injection to the cheeks created a more youthful appearance.Nose SurgeryCraig's nose surgery, facelift with liposuction, fat injection cheeks and chin contributes to him looking the way he feels.Breast SurgeryOtoplastyLaser ResurfacingThis Patient had microlayering fat injection to the cheeks, lips and chin (results in the middle). One year later she had laser resurfacing to improve the skin texture (final results on left).Cosmetic SurgeryDermatologistsChemical PeelsThis patient had eyelid surgery, facelift and cheek implants. This was followed with a deep resurfacing procedure a few months later. The combined results of repositioning sagging tissues, enhancing volume to the mid face to compensate for the volume that is lost with time and the tightening and smoothing a fact of the skin due to the resurfacing procedure has created a dramatic improvement. To emphasize the texture changes resulting from the resurfacing procedure a close-up of the eyelids is shown. Her resurfacing procedure was done using a deep chemical peel now I would use a laser to achieve the same results. I would now also favor micro-layering fat injection over the cheek implants to obtain the volume enhancement in the cheek.Skin CareMany patients achieve desired enhancement using Dysport, the new alternative to Botox and cosmetic dermal fillers such as Restylane, Perlane, Juvederm, and Radiesse. We also offer other antiaging skin care treatments.SurgeonsOtolaryngologyReconstructive SurgerySend to PhonePerry Curtis J MD300 Toll Gate Rd Ste 304, Warwick, RI 02886(401) 541-7170Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailPerry Curtis J MD300 Toll Gate Rd Ste 304, Warwick, RI 02886(401) 541-7170Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
