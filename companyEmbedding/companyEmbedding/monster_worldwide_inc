(Monster Worldwide) provides a global online employment solution, Monster. With a presence in markets in North America, Europe, and Asia, Monster works by connecting employers with job seekers at all levels and by providing personalized career advice to consumers globally. Monster Worldwide delivers targeted audiences to advertisers. The Company operates in three business segments: Monster Careers-North America, Monster Careers-International, and Internet Advertising & Fees.

Monster Worldwide, Inc.'s IT department is based out of its Maynard, MA location. Other IT staff members are located in its New York, NY, headquarters; Toronto, ON; and San Francisco, CA locations. Most of the employees in the IT department work on both internal IT and product side IT.

As of June 2013, IT budgets at Monster have been scaled back due to uncertainty surrounding the company’s fiscal health and future. With the company’s stock value worth approximately a fifth of what it was in 2007, and share holders actively looking for a buyer, IT activity is limited to trying to maintain and support the enterprise. The company has also begun massive staff cuts, which have impacted IT as well. 

Moving forward, for vendors looking for opportunities within this company, because of future uncertainty and budget issues surrounding the enterprise, company executives are looking at solutions that give them the best return with the limited resources that they have. With that being said, the company is projected to have an increased interest in as-a-service solutions where the third party oversees the bulk of the maintenance and support of an outsourced IT service. 

With what limited resources that IT still has, areas of focus for 2013 include analytics, cloud platforms and semantic search areas.

The IT department is organized by several unique technology divisions. The Applications division houses leaders who are responsible for much of the company's data functions. For fiscal year 2013, sources indicate an ongoing upgrade to SharePoint 2013 and an upgrade of its Oracle financials environment. 

The Database Technology division supervises staff members who are responsible for database operations and database security. The CRM Technology and Administration group is supported by data warehouse operations.  Sources are on record as of June 2013, indicating that decision makers are currently in the process of vetting customer relationship management (CRM) vendors for a possible implementation.

The IT Operations division oversees the global infrastructure. Leaders are responsible for networks, operations planning, and IT compliance. 

In Q1 2013, senior sources within the data warehouse group indicated that they are currently running pilots with two undisclosed big data analytic vendors regarding a possible integration of an analytic solution within the company’s internal data warehousing environment. It is unclear at this time if and when a decision will be made concerning a vendor.

The Architecture division handles IT security as well as performance engineering. A large team focuses on website Architecture. Other leaders in the IT department are responsible for quality assurance, release management, software integration, and the product help desk. For Q1 2013, senior sources within the company indicated that executives are open to exploring the logistics of a possible enterprise-wide bring your own device (BYOD) solution. It is unclear at this time if decision makers have begun to vet vendors. 

Military Advantage, a subsidiary of Monster Worldwide, runs a small IT staff out of San Francisco, CA focusing on network and IT Operations and software engineering for Military.com.
