PIMCO: Best Relative Value Fund Manager

Articles and Features











The PIMCO Multi-Asset Volatility Fund treats volatility as an asset class and targets net annualised returns of 10 to 15 per cent with equivalent volatility, independent of broad measures of market return. Positions span interest rates, equities, commodities and currencies, and reflect structural, opportunistic and tail-risk hedging dimensions.
Josh Thimons, Josh Davis and Matt Dorsten, the fund’s portfolio management team, are supported by PIMCO’s extensive firm-wide resources across trade operations, portfolio management/analytics and product management.
PIMCO combines its deep understanding of volatility markets with a robust macroeconomic investment process. The portfolio is designed so that no single theme dominates. Within structural strategies each asset class has a 15 to 25 per cent expected source of added value and risk contribution, while for alpha strategies it is 25 to 50 per cent.
 
Product manager Min Xiao (pictured) says: “Structural positions exploit the tendency for levels of price volatility implied by options markets to exceed the values that are actually realised. Structural anomalies persist because end-users of the options markets are like insurance buyers who willingly pay a volatility premium. Each structural sleeve may have its own hedging requirements and together, the structural strategies are sized with particular risk targets and diversification effects in mind.
 
“Discretionary positions express relative value views, both within and across the asset classes, in conditional form. Often influenced by macro considerations, these conditional positions are designed to produce asymmetric payoffs with limited downside risk. These positions, two or three per asset class on average, add an element of risk diversification and are rigorously governed with stop-loss and targeted gain limits.”
 
Min also stresses the importance of tail-risk hedging in overall portfolio construction. “The tail-risk strategy primarily consists of long volatility positions across multiple markets to hedge against extreme market crises.” she says. “Returns in the active tail risk strategy are generally expected to be negative in benign markets but may produce strong positive returns when the volatility of certain asset classes spikes. Furthermore, the fund is committed to spending at least 300 basis points per year on tail-risk hedging.”
 
Since the fund’s launch in July 2011 equity and bond markets have risen and fallen, producing periods of high and low volatility, but the MAV fund has generated positive returns every month, albeit over a short time period. Says Min: “Up to the end of December, the fund returned 20.1 per cent net of fees with annualised volatility of 9.3 per cent. Structural positions contributed 70 per cent of the returns, discretionary positions 15 per cent and tail-risk hedging strategies 15 per cent.”
 
Min believes the fund’s low correlation with traditional asset classes makes it a good diversifier for investor portfolios. Certainly its market-neutral structure and active tail-risk overlay equip it to add value across asset classes in a variety of market environments.
 
“The competitive landscape is limited for relative value volatility strategies,” says Min. “Proprietary trading desks are closing and the hedge fund community too has a much smaller asset base than pre-crisis. While dislocations in the markets have become more frequent and extreme, the competition in chasing those dislocations has diminished materially.”
 
She adds: “We are delighted by the Hedgeweek award and committed to focusing on volatility as an asset class – delivering high absolute returns with limited volatility from PIMCO’s best ideas across global asset classes.”

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.
