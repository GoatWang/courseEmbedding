Murphy Oil Corporation

                    The Company, headquartered in El Dorado, Arkansas, was originally incorporated in Louisiana in 1950 as Murphy Corporation. It was reincorporated in Delaware in 1964, at which time it adopted the name Murphy Oil Corporation. But, the Company's roots go back to a lumber and banking business in South Arkansas and, more directly, to 1907, when the first oil production was established in the Caddo Field in North Louisiana. Thereafter, oil and gas were important phases of the business. Until the mid 1930's however, oil and gas remained subordinate to timber operations and banking.

Today, Murphy Oil Corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with marketing operations in the United States and the United Kingdom, including a refinery in Milford Haven, Wales. The Company's farm, timber and real estate subsidiary was spun-off to shareholders in 1996 and is now known as Deltic Timber Corporation.

Business activities are conducted by wholly-owned subsidiaries while Murphy Oil Corporation acts as a holding company.

Murphy Exploration & Production Company, (Murphy EXPRO) is engaged worldwide in crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. Murphy EXPRO is headquartered in Houston, Texas.

Murphy Oil USA, Inc., (MOUSA) is engaged in marketing and transportation of petroleum products in the United States. It is headquartered in El Dorado at Murphy's corporate offices. 

A division of MOUSA, Murphy USA Marketing Co., operates retail gasoline stations under the Murphy USA® brand across 23 states in the U.S. These are high-volume, low-cost retail gasoline stations, primarily in the parking areas of Wal-Mart Supercenters. The first Murphy USA station was opened in December 1996.

MOUSA also operates a network of 7 terminals. These terminals, along with numerous third-party terminals, provide fuel supply to our retail network and wholesale customers throughout 23 states.

Murphy Oil Company, Ltd., (MOCL) is engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration and production and the extraction and sale of synthetic crude oil. MOCL's headquarters are located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Murphy Eastern Oil Company, (MEOC) provides technical and professional services to certain of Murphy Oil Corporation's subsidiaries engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration and production in the Eastern Hemisphere, and refining, marketing and transporting of petroleum products in the United Kingdom primarily under the MURCO® brand. The Company owns a 130,000 barrel-a-day refinery in the Milford Haven, Wales. MEOC is headquartered in St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England.

Murphy Sarawak Oil Co.Ltd., Murphy Sabah Oil Co. Ltd., Murphy Peninsular Malaysia Oil Co. Ltd. In 1999, Murphy opened an office in Kuala Lumpur to oversee its E&P activities in Malaysia. Strategic investments in Malaysia are done through these subsidiaries

Electro Savings Credit Union


                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

                                            After getting fed-up with SEFCU’s “nickel-and-dime” fee structure and lack of branches/ATMs in my area, I decided to close my account in April 2017. Fast forward to July 25, 2017 when I receive a collection notice for fees due ($175). Access to my online...show more

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
