Brands
























































Brands
We are proud to introduce you to our prestigious brand offerings and vast selection of fabrics. Our lineup consists of the best in the world. 




 








H.M. Cole
We source a collection of high-quality wools for suiting, jackets, and trousers from up-and-coming mills around the world. We bunch these wools together to create our private collection that includes the H.M. Cole Signature Series, the H.M. Cole Separates Collection, the H.M. Cole Specialty fabrics (tweed & overcoats), and the H.M. Cole Premium Series. These expansive collections each eclipse the competition in terms of value and selection.









Vitale Barberis CanonicoThe Vitale Barberis Canonico family has been milling woolen fabrics in Italy for over 350 years. The VBC family traces its milling roots back to 1663 and is known worldwide as one of the largest producers of Italian wools around. 









DragoLocated in Biella, Italy, Drago was originally a spinning mill and did not engage in full dying or processing. About 20 years ago, Drago took over one of its main dying customers, Fintes, and changed the name of the mill to the family name, Drago. Due to its vast experience in both spinning and dying, the value is incredible.









DormeuilFor 170 years, The House of Dormeuil has developed timeless and iconic fabrics that have cemented the company’s reputation across all five continents. This reputation is based on a few principles, the most notable being exclusivity. If you are looking for something that few others in the world can don, we offer you Dormeuil. 









AristonHeadquartered in Naples, these quality fabrics are produced exclusively in Italy, covering a wide range of fibers and compositions of wool, mohair, silk, cashmere, cotton and linen. The Ariston collection is presented twice a year to some of the top fashion houses in the world.  









Ermenegildo ZegnaFounded in 1910 in Trivero, a city in the Biella Alps, Ermenegildo Zegna has arguably established itself as the most well known high-end Italian brand in the world. Known for their technological advances in silk, wool, mohair, and cashmere production, Zegna has brought luxury to the forefront of the clothing industry.










Canclini
Beginning with the silk industry in Como in 1925, Canclini transitioned to the world of cotton and brought their techniques with them to create some of the best shirting available. We are proud to offer quality Canclini shirting for our clients. 









Allen EdmondsAllen Edmonds is a producer of quality leather goods such as shoes and belts. Their slogan, “An American Original” holds true today as all goods are produced in the United States.
