What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Oil pauses ahead of U.S. rig data, after logging nearly 7% gain for the week
              
              Crude has risen every day this week, gaining 7% in the process to hit two-month highs amid a raft of positive data points and a renewed commitment from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to rein in production and exports.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Since the 2011 earthquake, houses in Japan must have high energy efficiency and a stable power supply during emergencies. By leveraging its over 50 years of experience 
              as a housing company and outstanding technological strengths as the Panasonic Group, PanaHome Corporation is promoting the development of smart houses and smart cities to pursue energy technologies for the entire home and for comfortable family lives. 

 
CASART TERRA builds the future with families.







In 2010, we were developing a zero carbon footprint house. Having built an experimental house through collaboration between industry and academia, we began verification testing on energy saving and energy management. As a consequence, the following year marked the debut of the CASART TERRA home, which fully exploits sunlight, natural breezes, and heat to realize a comfortable lifestyle with virtually zero CO2 emissions. The full insulation design is employed for the entire home, including ceilings, exterior walls, and even the foundation. The low-emissivity double-glazing glass, which has air between two glass panes, reduces heat losses even through large windows.

 
All-year comfort and energy efficiency made possible by full insulation design and geothermal heat





The ECO NAVI ventilation system exploits geothermal heat by reducing the air conditioning load by taking in fresh air from underneath the floorboards that is cooler than the air outside in summer and warmer in winter while enhancing comfort. Our ventilation system also automatically selects mechanical or natural ventilation by measuring the temperature differences between the inside and outside of the house with sensors and thus maintains good ventilation while reducing thermal losses. Without sacrificing comfort, energy efficiency was improved by combining such natural energy as geothermal heat and integrated hybrid ventilation systems in addition to a full insulation design.




Full insulation design throughout the entire home satisfies Japan�s next-generation energy standards.*1

The exterior wall�s steel is covered by insulation material.


*1 Depending on plans and specifications, may not meet Japan�s next-generation energy-saving standards





In response to the increasing demand for zero energy houses after the Great East Japan Earthquake, PanaHome Corporation developed a state-of-the-art house called a �Smart PanaHome� by adopting an Energy Creation-storage Linked System for the Home that combines a photovoltaic power generation system and a storage battery, as well as SMARTHEMSTM for smart energy management for the entire home. The Smart PanaHome enables stress-free energy conservation and gives greater energy independence during power outages. We achieved comfort and eco-friendliness for the entire home not only by adopting energy management through energy creation, storage, and saving equipment but also by combining energy management with passive technology for increasing the building strength.



With outstanding heat insulation performance and an Energy Creation-storage Linked System for the Home, the Smart PanaHome reduces CO2 emissions to a net balance of virtually zero.


Spatial design capitalizing on natural energy for an eco-friendly lifestyle








We are scaling up our smart house solutions to apply them to an entire town. PanaHome Corporation is promoting the development of PanaHome Smart City Shioashiya, one of the largest such cities in Japan.*2 Around 400 detached houses in the city will be equipped with an Energy Creation-storage Linked System for the Home, a W power generation system that combines photovoltaic power generation and ENE-FARM fuel cells, and HEMS. Our goal is to achieve net zero energy and virtually zero CO2 emissions throughout it. We are also planning to build a sustainable town that ensures the safety and security of future generations. 
*2 Surveyed by PanaHome Corporation as of July 20, 2012

 
PanaHome smart cities, which are characterized by smart houses, town design intended to increase asset values, and town management for supporting comfortable lifestyles, are being expanded across Japan (photo: PanaHome Smart City Shioashiya).






Panasonic�s SMARTHEMSTM will be installed in PanaHome Smart City Shioashiya. This will make smart lifestyles even more intelligent through energy-efficient operations of home appliances and other equipment throughout entire home and energy management that automatically reduces power consumption. The town will support smart grids, which will be introduced in the near future.

Zero carbon footprint houses
A zero carbon footprint house is a house with virtually zero CO2 emissions, where air tightness and thermal insulation performances are enhanced, natural energies are effectively used, and various systematic equipment and specifications are combined that allow energy creation, storage, saving, and links to make the energy balance visible.


Energy Creation-storage Linked System for the Home
This system enables efficient storage of the electricity generated (created) by photovoltaic or fuel cell cogeneration systems and the use of this electricity when main power is close to its limit or temporarily unavailable. Alternating current (AC) is generally used to transmit electricity, but since photovoltaic power generation systems and storage battery units supply direct current (DC), photovoltaic power generation systems are equipped with a DC/AC converter. This power conditioner is not 100% efficient, so energy is lost during the conversion process. AC/DC conversion is also required for storing power in storage battery units. The hardwired systems for energy creation and storage, however, directly store the DC power from photovoltaic panels in storage battery units to maximize the use of the generated power.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.
