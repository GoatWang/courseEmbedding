Any statements contained in this press release that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "will," "intends," "potential," "possible" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements about the development of Sarepta's product candidates, the expected timing of results from the extension study of eteplirsen, the potential for the creation of novel dystrophin to lead to clinically meaningful benefits over a longer course of treatment with eteplirsen and Sarepta's estimates regarding its future revenue and expenses and expectations regarding future success, revenue and funding from government and other sources.

Known risk factors include, among others: clinical trials may not demonstrate safety and efficacy of any of Sarepta's drug candidates and/or Sarepta's antisense-based technology platform; development of any of Sarepta's drug candidates may not result in funding from the U.S. government in the anticipated amounts or on a timely basis, if at all; and any of Sarepta's drug candidates may fail in development, may not receive required regulatory approvals, or be delayed to a point where they do not become commercially viable. Any of the foregoing risks could materially and adversely affect Sarepta's business, results of operations and the trading price of Saretpa's common stock. For a detailed description of risks and uncertainties Sarepta faces, you are encouraged to review the official corporate documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

SAN DIEGO, Oct. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Elcelyx Therapeutics announced today that Sandesh "Sandy" Mahatme has been appointed to its Board of Directors as an independent director.
"We welcome Sandy's expertise as Elcelyx nears a critical data read-out this quarter for our drug candidate Metformin Delayed Release for patients with type 2 diabetes and we establish the path forward for Phase 3 development and potential commercialization," said Alain Baron, M.D., president and chief executive officer of Elcelyx.








Mahatme is currently senior vice president, chief financial officer at Sarepta Therapeutics. Prior to joining Sarepta in 2012, Mahatme worked at Celgene Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company, where he served in various roles, including senior vice president of corporate development, senior vice president of finance, corporate treasurer and head of tax. While at Celgene, Mahatme built the treasury and tax functions before establishing the corporate development department, focused on strategic, targeted initiatives including commercial development in emerging markets, acquisitions, licensing and global manufacturing expansion. Prior to working at Celgene, he worked for Pfizer for eight and a half years in senior roles in business development and corporate tax.
Mahatme started his career at Ernst & Young where he advised multinational corporations on a broad range of transactions. He holds Master of Laws (LL.M.) degrees from Cornell Law School and NYU School of Law and is a member of the New York State Bar Association. Mahatme is also a board member of Flexion Therapeutics and Aeglea Biotherapeutics.
Mahatme joins fellow pharmaceutical industry executives and investors on the board of directors at Elcelyx, including: Richard Barry, Ralph "Chris" Christoffersen, Ph.D. (chairman), Jim Glasheen, Ph.D., Ginger Graham, Bosun Hau and Liang Tsui.
About Elcelyx TherapeuticsElcelyx Therapeutics is developing pharmaceutical agents designed to modulate the gut neuroendocrine system including the L-cell, which when activated is responsible for release of glucoregulatory hormones. Metformin Delayed Release (Metformin DR), the first product of this type, is designed to deliver metformin to the gut instead of systemically, thereby reducing bioavailability while still achieving efficacy. Metformin DR development arose from Elcelyx's discovery that the site of action for metformin, the most commonly prescribed diabetes drug, is in the gut. Given its targeted delivery and low systemic bioavailability, Metformin DR may provide a treatment option for type 2 diabetes patients who are currently contraindicated due to renal impairment or who cannot tolerate existing metformin formulations.
