					Often I love one little section of an artwork, so these are just the best bits- colourful jewels that beg you to stop and look more closely. Evening Falls is the feel of the sagebrush desert near Tonto National Monument, AZ.Designed to be hung with more than one- fantastic in an intimate space such as an entryway or powder room. All can be sold individually while some are pre arranged to buy as a set of three. Can be hung in any arrangement- horizontal, vertical or a group. Click on my artist name to see all options.NOTE: All 3x3 artworks have a white frame. Individual images: frame not shown. Sets of three: frames shown.Size: 3x3 in a 8x8 wood frameMedium: Oil pastel and graphite on vellum / Oil pastel on cotton rag paperReady to hang: Framed and matted to 8x8 in a white wooden frame. The piece has been protected with archival varnish, labeled on reverse.About the artist:I create art that lands somewhere between drawing and painting. When I walk through the city, a building will catch me and I think about the stories it holds within its structure. A sketch or photo on site comes back to my studio. There I use a semi transparent paper called vellum, add layers of oil pastel to build up colours, smudge on graphite, and mark in lines with pencil

Product Description

						Often I love one little section of an artwork, so these are just the best bits- colourful jewels that beg you to stop and look more closely. Evening Falls is the feel of the sagebrush desert near Tonto National Monument, AZ.Designed to be hung with more than one- fantastic in an intimate space such as an entryway or powder room. All can be sold individually while some are pre arranged to buy as a set of three. Can be hung in any arrangement- horizontal, vertical or a group. Click on my artist name to see all options.NOTE: All 3x3 artworks have a white frame. Individual images: frame not shown. Sets of three: frames shown.Size: 3x3 in a 8x8 wood frame Medium: Oil pastel and graphite on vellum / Oil pastel on cotton rag paperReady to hang: Framed and matted to 8x8 in a white wooden frame. The piece has been protected with archival varnish, labeled on reverse.About the artist:I create art that lands somewhere between drawing and painting. When I walk through the city, a building will catch me and I think about the stories it holds within its structure. A sketch or photo on site comes back to my studio. There I use a semi transparent paper called vellum, add layers of oil pastel to build up colours, smudge on graphite, and mark in lines with pencil

Have fun with wall decor.If your floor space is limited, it’s important to make the most of your walls by using every inch for home decor. If your walls are looking a little barren, spice them up with colorful artwork. Your own photo collage can add a personal touch to any room, while mirrors can make a small space seem larger thanks to their reflective qualities. If storage is an issue, use shelves and stack them with fun trinkets or flowers. Don’t forget about the wall itself! Add some flavor with colorful, patterned wallpaper or go for a brightly painted accent wall. Home decorations make great table toppers.If your living room needs a lift, liven it up by adding a few thoughtful home decor accessories. Photos always make great additions, but keep them interesting by mixing and matching your frames. When lit, candles add a romantic, relaxing feel, and coffee table books about travel, home design, fashion or photography make for great conversation starters. House decorations can cozy up your floor.While floor space may be limited, there’s always room for a well-placed area rug or two. These are a great way to add texture, color and warmth to a hardwood or tile floor. Choose a traditional floral pattern or some funky chevrons to get started, then pair your  pattern with a textured Berber rug or soft shag for ultimate indulgence. Add some vibrancy to neutral-colored furniture. One of the easiest ways to punch up a look is through the fabric you display. Swap out throw pillows and blankets to liven up a dull home decor foundation, and search right here on Houzz for bold or mismatched patterns, comfy throws and cushy pillows. Don’t forget the drapes.Dress up your windows with elegant, bold or even light and airy treatments. Because of their size, floor-length curtains can make a dramatic difference and can transition a room from traditional to contemporary all by themselves.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreChoose wall art you love.The number one rule for selecting artwork is that it should speak to you. If it isn’t meaningful in any way, it’s best to keep searching. If you’ve themed your furniture and décor around a certain color or idea, that can get you started in your search. Many paintings and other artwork have a cultural theme, such as aboriginal art or Japanese art. On the other hand, black and white photography goes great with anything. Whatever style you choose, just make sure it represents your tastes, interests or history. Check out every type of wall art out there.If you’re looking for paintings that fit perfectly with your traditional décor, consider fine art prints. These are a great alternative if you can’t afford genuine Picasso paintings or works by other famous artists. Pencil art and some sculptures can also fit in well with a traditional scheme. If you’re in the mood for some modern artwork, illustrations and mixed media are a great place to start. Sculptures made from metal or glass can also have a modern tone. Try going bold with abstract paintings, urban art or pop art, which tend to incorporate more modern influences like graffiti and celebrities, plus bright colors. Photographs work well with any décor as they can cross between modern and traditional easily depending on the subject matter. Don’t be afraid to mix and match, either. A modern piece can go amazingly well with a traditional home, and vice versa. Arrange your new artwork for optimal viewing.Once you’ve found those perfect, meaningful pieces, you’ll want to place them in a spot that allows everyone who passes by to admire them. Common locations for artwork include above a seating area or, better yet, facing your seating arrangement. Proper lighting and visibility is also important, as is hanging your new pieces at the correct height. Aim for eye level or the gallery standard, which says the center of your paintings should be approximately 60 inches from the floor.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreWhether it’s black and white drawings you seek or full color masterpieces, here are a few tips on how to select pen and pencil art for your home:• Choose the right size. If you have a large expanse of wall that needs filling, make sure your artwork isn’t so small it will be overpowered by that empty space. On the other hand, you won’t want it to be so large it takes over a room. If you’re unsure what size is right or are hesitant to go big and bold, look for standard-sized art that measures between 12 to 47 inches. • Your art should elicit emotion. Don’t just grab up every piece of art for sale. Be selective and look for pieces that you love. Do the colors call to you? How about the lines and shading? Can you identify with the subject matter in any way? Whatever you choose, it should add dimension and life to your home.• Educate yourself. The easiest way to define your taste in art is to research different styles. You may assume that, because your home décor is traditional, modern, etc., your taste in artwork will be the same. However, you may be pleasantly surprised, and even more surprised to find those traditional-style pen and ink drawings look amazing hanging above your modern sofa.
