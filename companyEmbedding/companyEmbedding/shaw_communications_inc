History[edit]
Shaw was founded as Capital Cable Television Company, Ltd. in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1966.[4] The company changed its name to Shaw Cablesystems Ltd. and went public on the TSX in 1983. The company grew during the 1980s and 1990s through acquisitions of firms including Classicomm in the Toronto area, Access Communications in Nova Scotia, Fundy Cable in New Brunswick, Trillium Cable in Ontario, Telecable in Saskatchewan, Greater Winnipeg Cablevision[5] (serving areas east of the Red River), and Videon Cablesystems of Winnipeg (serving areas west of the Red River), which had itself previously acquired Vidéotron's assets in Alberta. However, two swaps, in 1994 and 2001, with Rogers Cable have resulted in its assets being restricted to Western Canada and a few areas of Northern Ontario.[6] In 1999, Shaw spun out its media properties into a second publicly-traded company, Corus Entertainment.[7][8]
Prior to 2003, Shaw owned cable systems in the United States previously owned by Moffat Communications, serving six communities in Florida (Eastern Pasco County, Clermont, Palm Coast, Ormond Beach, West Palm Beach and Doral), and the Houston, Texas suburbs of Kingwood, Lake Conroe and Lake Livingston. In February 2003, the Florida systems would be sold to Time Warner Cable (with the West Palm Beach and Doral systems later sold to Comcast, and the other systems spun off to Bright House Networks), while the Texas systems were sold to Cequel III, as part of its then-Cebridge Connections subsidiary (now Suddenlink Communications).[9][10]
In 2008, Shaw entered the AWS spectrum auction with the intention of possibly becoming a wireless phone provider. The auction ended July 2008, giving Shaw Communications enough spectrum to build a wireless network in its home provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario.[11] This spectrum ultimately went unused and was sold to Rogers Communications in January 2013.[12]
In July 2009, Shaw announced its acquisition of Mountain Cablevision; in September, Rogers sued Shaw to block the sale, citing violations of a non-compete clause. However, the suit was quickly dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court.[13][14] The purchase was approved by the CRTC on October 22, 2009.[15][16] The acquisition was Shaw's first cable property east of Sault Ste. Marie since the 2001 swaps with Rogers and Cogeco. Shaw's re-entry into Southern Ontario would be short-lived, as its Hamilton system would be resold to Rogers in January 2013 as part of a deal which also saw unused wireless spectrum sold to the company, and saw Rogers sell its stake in specialty channel TVtropolis.[12]
Return to broadcasting[edit]
On April 30, 2009, Shaw announced a deal to acquire three television stations — CHWI-TV in Windsor, Ontario, CKNX-TV in Wingham, Ontario and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba — from CTVglobemedia. CTV had indicated that it would shut down the stations, all of which were incurring extensive financial losses, later in the year if a buyer could not be found, and had placed them on the market at a price of just $1 each.[17] However, it was reported on June 30, 2009 that Shaw has backed out of the deal and is declining to complete the purchase.[18] CHWI-TV would remain on the air as is; CKNX-TV would become a repeater of London station CFPL-TV in September 2009, while CKX-TV would close down entirely in October 2009.
In February 2010, Shaw announced an agreement with the financially troubled Canwest, whereby Shaw would buy an 80% voting interest, and 20% equity interest, in the restructured entity of Canwest, pending approvals from the CRTC and others.[19] Three months later, following negotiations with rival bidders, the company said it would purchase the entirety of Canwest's broadcasting assets, including the interests in the CW Media subsidiary partially held by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.[20] Canwest's newspapers were not part of the Shaw deal and were sold separately to Postmedia Network.
The acquisition was completed on October 27, 2010, after CRTC approval for the sale was announced on October 22, forming the Shaw Media division.[21]
2012–present[edit]
In November 2012, Shaw underwent a corporate re-branding, introducing an updated logo and slogan, along with a new promotional campaign featuring animated robots (including two named mascot robots, Bit and Bud) that live in a representation of Shaw's infrastructure, depicting them as being responsible for how their services work. The campaign was designed by the Vancouver-based agency Rethink, who were also responsible for Bell Canada's beaver characters Frank and Gordon.[22][23]
In April 2013, Shaw Business Solutions took over Enmax's Envision subsidiary, which had built a fiber-optic network throughout Calgary. The acquisition was completed for $225 Million.[24]

In 2014, Shaw partnered with Rogers Communications to launch Shomi, a subscription video on demand service.[25]
In February 2015, Shaw Communications announced that they would close operations for service call centers in Edmonton, Calgary and Kelowna, and consolidate operations in Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal. 1,600 of Shaw's 14,000 employees were affected by the consolidation and cuts.[26] The company offered affected employees the option to relocate to its centralized offices, apply for a new job at their location, or leave the company with a severance package for former employees unable to relocate.[26][27]
In 2013, Shaw attempted to begin developing an IPTV-based platform for its television services. However, after experiencing issues developing the platform, Shaw took a $55 million write-down in June 2015, and announced that it was licensing Comcast's cloud-based X1 architecture.[28][29] In January 2016, Shaw launched its mobile television app FreeRange TV, based on X1 infrastructure, which allows Shaw subscribers to stream selected TV channels and on-demand content.[30][31]
Freedom Mobile, divestment of media assets[edit]
On December 16, 2015, Shaw announced its proposed acquisition of independent wireless provider Wind Mobile from its investors in a deal worth approximately $1.6 billion.[32] The transaction closed on March 1, 2016.[33] Under Shaw, the company was renamed Freedom Mobile in November 2016, coinciding with the launch of its 4G LTE network.[34] The acquisition of Wind was funded by a reorganization in April 2016, which saw the Shaw Media unit transferred to Corus Entertainment,[35] in exchange for $1.85 billion in cash and 71,364,853 class B non-voting shares of Corus.[36] The sale did not include Shaw's 50% stake in the Shomi streaming service and CJBN-TV Kenora; Shomi was shut down in November 2016 and CJBN-TV Kenora was shut down in January 2017..[35][37]
On January 11, 2017, Shaw announced the launch of BlueSky—a new IPTV-based television service based on Comcast's X1 platform. The service was initially made available in Calgary.[38]
Other activities[edit]
Shaw is the parent of Shaw Broadcast Services (previously Shaw Satellite Services, Canadian Satellite Communications, or Cancom) and, through Shaw Broadcast Services,[39] Shaw Direct, one of Canada's two national direct broadcast satellite providers. For many years it also owned a number of radio stations and specialty television services; these assets were later spun off into Corus Entertainment in an effort to satisfy a now-repealed CRTC policy discouraging cross-ownership of cablesystems and specialty services.
Controversy[edit]
Internet usage-based billing[edit]
In December 2010, Shaw filed complaints with the CRTC to have competing internet video services such as Netflix classified as broadcasters under Canadian law.[40] In the same month, Shaw introduced usage based billing on internet plans and lowered plan caps an average of 25% while introducing overage fees of $1 to $2 per gigabyte.[41] On February 8, 2011, Shaw agreed to put a hold on usage based billing for its services and to this date continues to not charge customers any overages for surpassing Internet Data caps.[42]
Complaints[edit]
Customer service complaints are frequent among Canadian cable, mobile and Internet users.

History[edit]
Shaw was founded as Capital Cable Television Company, Ltd. in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1966.[4] The company changed its name to Shaw Cablesystems Ltd. and went public on the TSX in 1983. The company grew during the 1980s and 1990s through acquisitions of firms including Classicomm in the Toronto area, Access Communications in Nova Scotia, Fundy Cable in New Brunswick, Trillium Cable in Ontario, Telecable in Saskatchewan, Greater Winnipeg Cablevision[5] (serving areas east of the Red River), and Videon Cablesystems of Winnipeg (serving areas west of the Red River), which had itself previously acquired Vidéotron's assets in Alberta. However, two swaps, in 1994 and 2001, with Rogers Cable have resulted in its assets being restricted to Western Canada and a few areas of Northern Ontario.[6] In 1999, Shaw spun out its media properties into a second publicly-traded company, Corus Entertainment.[7][8]
Prior to 2003, Shaw owned cable systems in the United States previously owned by Moffat Communications, serving six communities in Florida (Eastern Pasco County, Clermont, Palm Coast, Ormond Beach, West Palm Beach and Doral), and the Houston, Texas suburbs of Kingwood, Lake Conroe and Lake Livingston. In February 2003, the Florida systems would be sold to Time Warner Cable (with the West Palm Beach and Doral systems later sold to Comcast, and the other systems spun off to Bright House Networks), while the Texas systems were sold to Cequel III, as part of its then-Cebridge Connections subsidiary (now Suddenlink Communications).[9][10]
In 2008, Shaw entered the AWS spectrum auction with the intention of possibly becoming a wireless phone provider. The auction ended July 2008, giving Shaw Communications enough spectrum to build a wireless network in its home provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario.[11] This spectrum ultimately went unused and was sold to Rogers Communications in January 2013.[12]
In July 2009, Shaw announced its acquisition of Mountain Cablevision; in September, Rogers sued Shaw to block the sale, citing violations of a non-compete clause. However, the suit was quickly dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court.[13][14] The purchase was approved by the CRTC on October 22, 2009.[15][16] The acquisition was Shaw's first cable property east of Sault Ste. Marie since the 2001 swaps with Rogers and Cogeco. Shaw's re-entry into Southern Ontario would be short-lived, as its Hamilton system would be resold to Rogers in January 2013 as part of a deal which also saw unused wireless spectrum sold to the company, and saw Rogers sell its stake in specialty channel TVtropolis.[12]
Return to broadcasting[edit]
On April 30, 2009, Shaw announced a deal to acquire three television stations — CHWI-TV in Windsor, Ontario, CKNX-TV in Wingham, Ontario and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba — from CTVglobemedia. CTV had indicated that it would shut down the stations, all of which were incurring extensive financial losses, later in the year if a buyer could not be found, and had placed them on the market at a price of just $1 each.[17] However, it was reported on June 30, 2009 that Shaw has backed out of the deal and is declining to complete the purchase.[18] CHWI-TV would remain on the air as is; CKNX-TV would become a repeater of London station CFPL-TV in September 2009, while CKX-TV would close down entirely in October 2009.
In February 2010, Shaw announced an agreement with the financially troubled Canwest, whereby Shaw would buy an 80% voting interest, and 20% equity interest, in the restructured entity of Canwest, pending approvals from the CRTC and others.[19] Three months later, following negotiations with rival bidders, the company said it would purchase the entirety of Canwest's broadcasting assets, including the interests in the CW Media subsidiary partially held by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.[20] Canwest's newspapers were not part of the Shaw deal and were sold separately to Postmedia Network.
The acquisition was completed on October 27, 2010, after CRTC approval for the sale was announced on October 22, forming the Shaw Media division.[21]
2012–present[edit]
In November 2012, Shaw underwent a corporate re-branding, introducing an updated logo and slogan, along with a new promotional campaign featuring animated robots (including two named mascot robots, Bit and Bud) that live in a representation of Shaw's infrastructure, depicting them as being responsible for how their services work. The campaign was designed by the Vancouver-based agency Rethink, who were also responsible for Bell Canada's beaver characters Frank and Gordon.[22][23]
In April 2013, Shaw Business Solutions took over Enmax's Envision subsidiary, which had built a fiber-optic network throughout Calgary. The acquisition was completed for $225 Million.[24]

In 2014, Shaw partnered with Rogers Communications to launch Shomi, a subscription video on demand service.[25]
In February 2015, Shaw Communications announced that they would close operations for service call centers in Edmonton, Calgary and Kelowna, and consolidate operations in Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal. 1,600 of Shaw's 14,000 employees were affected by the consolidation and cuts.[26] The company offered affected employees the option to relocate to its centralized offices, apply for a new job at their location, or leave the company with a severance package for former employees unable to relocate.[26][27]
In 2013, Shaw attempted to begin developing an IPTV-based platform for its television services. However, after experiencing issues developing the platform, Shaw took a $55 million write-down in June 2015, and announced that it was licensing Comcast's cloud-based X1 architecture.[28][29] In January 2016, Shaw launched its mobile television app FreeRange TV, based on X1 infrastructure, which allows Shaw subscribers to stream selected TV channels and on-demand content.[30][31]
Freedom Mobile, divestment of media assets[edit]
On December 16, 2015, Shaw announced its proposed acquisition of independent wireless provider Wind Mobile from its investors in a deal worth approximately $1.6 billion.[32] The transaction closed on March 1, 2016.[33] Under Shaw, the company was renamed Freedom Mobile in November 2016, coinciding with the launch of its 4G LTE network.[34] The acquisition of Wind was funded by a reorganization in April 2016, which saw the Shaw Media unit transferred to Corus Entertainment,[35] in exchange for $1.85 billion in cash and 71,364,853 class B non-voting shares of Corus.[36] The sale did not include Shaw's 50% stake in the Shomi streaming service and CJBN-TV Kenora; Shomi was shut down in November 2016 and CJBN-TV Kenora was shut down in January 2017..[35][37]
On January 11, 2017, Shaw announced the launch of BlueSky—a new IPTV-based television service based on Comcast's X1 platform. The service was initially made available in Calgary.[38]
Other activities[edit]
Shaw is the parent of Shaw Broadcast Services (previously Shaw Satellite Services, Canadian Satellite Communications, or Cancom) and, through Shaw Broadcast Services,[39] Shaw Direct, one of Canada's two national direct broadcast satellite providers. For many years it also owned a number of radio stations and specialty television services; these assets were later spun off into Corus Entertainment in an effort to satisfy a now-repealed CRTC policy discouraging cross-ownership of cablesystems and specialty services.
Controversy[edit]
Internet usage-based billing[edit]
In December 2010, Shaw filed complaints with the CRTC to have competing internet video services such as Netflix classified as broadcasters under Canadian law.[40] In the same month, Shaw introduced usage based billing on internet plans and lowered plan caps an average of 25% while introducing overage fees of $1 to $2 per gigabyte.[41] On February 8, 2011, Shaw agreed to put a hold on usage based billing for its services and to this date continues to not charge customers any overages for surpassing Internet Data caps.[42]
Complaints[edit]
Customer service complaints are frequent among Canadian cable, mobile and Internet users.

History[edit]
Shaw was founded as Capital Cable Television Company, Ltd. in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1966.[4] The company changed its name to Shaw Cablesystems Ltd. and went public on the TSX in 1983. The company grew during the 1980s and 1990s through acquisitions of firms including Classicomm in the Toronto area, Access Communications in Nova Scotia, Fundy Cable in New Brunswick, Trillium Cable in Ontario, Telecable in Saskatchewan, Greater Winnipeg Cablevision[5] (serving areas east of the Red River), and Videon Cablesystems of Winnipeg (serving areas west of the Red River), which had itself previously acquired Vidéotron's assets in Alberta. However, two swaps, in 1994 and 2001, with Rogers Cable have resulted in its assets being restricted to Western Canada and a few areas of Northern Ontario.[6] In 1999, Shaw spun out its media properties into a second publicly-traded company, Corus Entertainment.[7][8]
Prior to 2003, Shaw owned cable systems in the United States previously owned by Moffat Communications, serving six communities in Florida (Eastern Pasco County, Clermont, Palm Coast, Ormond Beach, West Palm Beach and Doral), and the Houston, Texas suburbs of Kingwood, Lake Conroe and Lake Livingston. In February 2003, the Florida systems would be sold to Time Warner Cable (with the West Palm Beach and Doral systems later sold to Comcast, and the other systems spun off to Bright House Networks), while the Texas systems were sold to Cequel III, as part of its then-Cebridge Connections subsidiary (now Suddenlink Communications).[9][10]
In 2008, Shaw entered the AWS spectrum auction with the intention of possibly becoming a wireless phone provider. The auction ended July 2008, giving Shaw Communications enough spectrum to build a wireless network in its home provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario.[11] This spectrum ultimately went unused and was sold to Rogers Communications in January 2013.[12]
In July 2009, Shaw announced its acquisition of Mountain Cablevision; in September, Rogers sued Shaw to block the sale, citing violations of a non-compete clause. However, the suit was quickly dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court.[13][14] The purchase was approved by the CRTC on October 22, 2009.[15][16] The acquisition was Shaw's first cable property east of Sault Ste. Marie since the 2001 swaps with Rogers and Cogeco. Shaw's re-entry into Southern Ontario would be short-lived, as its Hamilton system would be resold to Rogers in January 2013 as part of a deal which also saw unused wireless spectrum sold to the company, and saw Rogers sell its stake in specialty channel TVtropolis.[12]
Return to broadcasting[edit]
On April 30, 2009, Shaw announced a deal to acquire three television stations — CHWI-TV in Windsor, Ontario, CKNX-TV in Wingham, Ontario and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba — from CTVglobemedia. CTV had indicated that it would shut down the stations, all of which were incurring extensive financial losses, later in the year if a buyer could not be found, and had placed them on the market at a price of just $1 each.[17] However, it was reported on June 30, 2009 that Shaw has backed out of the deal and is declining to complete the purchase.[18] CHWI-TV would remain on the air as is; CKNX-TV would become a repeater of London station CFPL-TV in September 2009, while CKX-TV would close down entirely in October 2009.
In February 2010, Shaw announced an agreement with the financially troubled Canwest, whereby Shaw would buy an 80% voting interest, and 20% equity interest, in the restructured entity of Canwest, pending approvals from the CRTC and others.[19] Three months later, following negotiations with rival bidders, the company said it would purchase the entirety of Canwest's broadcasting assets, including the interests in the CW Media subsidiary partially held by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.[20] Canwest's newspapers were not part of the Shaw deal and were sold separately to Postmedia Network.
The acquisition was completed on October 27, 2010, after CRTC approval for the sale was announced on October 22, forming the Shaw Media division.[21]
2012–present[edit]
In November 2012, Shaw underwent a corporate re-branding, introducing an updated logo and slogan, along with a new promotional campaign featuring animated robots (including two named mascot robots, Bit and Bud) that live in a representation of Shaw's infrastructure, depicting them as being responsible for how their services work. The campaign was designed by the Vancouver-based agency Rethink, who were also responsible for Bell Canada's beaver characters Frank and Gordon.[22][23]
In April 2013, Shaw Business Solutions took over Enmax's Envision subsidiary, which had built a fiber-optic network throughout Calgary. The acquisition was completed for $225 Million.[24]

In 2014, Shaw partnered with Rogers Communications to launch Shomi, a subscription video on demand service.[25]
In February 2015, Shaw Communications announced that they would close operations for service call centers in Edmonton, Calgary and Kelowna, and consolidate operations in Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal. 1,600 of Shaw's 14,000 employees were affected by the consolidation and cuts.[26] The company offered affected employees the option to relocate to its centralized offices, apply for a new job at their location, or leave the company with a severance package for former employees unable to relocate.[26][27]
In 2013, Shaw attempted to begin developing an IPTV-based platform for its television services. However, after experiencing issues developing the platform, Shaw took a $55 million write-down in June 2015, and announced that it was licensing Comcast's cloud-based X1 architecture.[28][29] In January 2016, Shaw launched its mobile television app FreeRange TV, based on X1 infrastructure, which allows Shaw subscribers to stream selected TV channels and on-demand content.[30][31]
Freedom Mobile, divestment of media assets[edit]
On December 16, 2015, Shaw announced its proposed acquisition of independent wireless provider Wind Mobile from its investors in a deal worth approximately $1.6 billion.[32] The transaction closed on March 1, 2016.[33] Under Shaw, the company was renamed Freedom Mobile in November 2016, coinciding with the launch of its 4G LTE network.[34] The acquisition of Wind was funded by a reorganization in April 2016, which saw the Shaw Media unit transferred to Corus Entertainment,[35] in exchange for $1.85 billion in cash and 71,364,853 class B non-voting shares of Corus.[36] The sale did not include Shaw's 50% stake in the Shomi streaming service and CJBN-TV Kenora; Shomi was shut down in November 2016 and CJBN-TV Kenora was shut down in January 2017..[35][37]
On January 11, 2017, Shaw announced the launch of BlueSky—a new IPTV-based television service based on Comcast's X1 platform. The service was initially made available in Calgary.[38]
Other activities[edit]
Shaw is the parent of Shaw Broadcast Services (previously Shaw Satellite Services, Canadian Satellite Communications, or Cancom) and, through Shaw Broadcast Services,[39] Shaw Direct, one of Canada's two national direct broadcast satellite providers. For many years it also owned a number of radio stations and specialty television services; these assets were later spun off into Corus Entertainment in an effort to satisfy a now-repealed CRTC policy discouraging cross-ownership of cablesystems and specialty services.
Controversy[edit]
Internet usage-based billing[edit]
In December 2010, Shaw filed complaints with the CRTC to have competing internet video services such as Netflix classified as broadcasters under Canadian law.[40] In the same month, Shaw introduced usage based billing on internet plans and lowered plan caps an average of 25% while introducing overage fees of $1 to $2 per gigabyte.[41] On February 8, 2011, Shaw agreed to put a hold on usage based billing for its services and to this date continues to not charge customers any overages for surpassing Internet Data caps.[42]
Complaints[edit]
Customer service complaints are frequent among Canadian cable, mobile and Internet users.

History[edit]
Shaw was founded as Capital Cable Television Company, Ltd. in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1966.[4] The company changed its name to Shaw Cablesystems Ltd. and went public on the TSX in 1983. The company grew during the 1980s and 1990s through acquisitions of firms including Classicomm in the Toronto area, Access Communications in Nova Scotia, Fundy Cable in New Brunswick, Trillium Cable in Ontario, Telecable in Saskatchewan, Greater Winnipeg Cablevision[5] (serving areas east of the Red River), and Videon Cablesystems of Winnipeg (serving areas west of the Red River), which had itself previously acquired Vidéotron's assets in Alberta. However, two swaps, in 1994 and 2001, with Rogers Cable have resulted in its assets being restricted to Western Canada and a few areas of Northern Ontario.[6] In 1999, Shaw spun out its media properties into a second publicly-traded company, Corus Entertainment.[7][8]
Prior to 2003, Shaw owned cable systems in the United States previously owned by Moffat Communications, serving six communities in Florida (Eastern Pasco County, Clermont, Palm Coast, Ormond Beach, West Palm Beach and Doral), and the Houston, Texas suburbs of Kingwood, Lake Conroe and Lake Livingston. In February 2003, the Florida systems would be sold to Time Warner Cable (with the West Palm Beach and Doral systems later sold to Comcast, and the other systems spun off to Bright House Networks), while the Texas systems were sold to Cequel III, as part of its then-Cebridge Connections subsidiary (now Suddenlink Communications).[9][10]
In 2008, Shaw entered the AWS spectrum auction with the intention of possibly becoming a wireless phone provider. The auction ended July 2008, giving Shaw Communications enough spectrum to build a wireless network in its home provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario.[11] This spectrum ultimately went unused and was sold to Rogers Communications in January 2013.[12]
In July 2009, Shaw announced its acquisition of Mountain Cablevision; in September, Rogers sued Shaw to block the sale, citing violations of a non-compete clause. However, the suit was quickly dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court.[13][14] The purchase was approved by the CRTC on October 22, 2009.[15][16] The acquisition was Shaw's first cable property east of Sault Ste. Marie since the 2001 swaps with Rogers and Cogeco. Shaw's re-entry into Southern Ontario would be short-lived, as its Hamilton system would be resold to Rogers in January 2013 as part of a deal which also saw unused wireless spectrum sold to the company, and saw Rogers sell its stake in specialty channel TVtropolis.[12]
Return to broadcasting[edit]
On April 30, 2009, Shaw announced a deal to acquire three television stations — CHWI-TV in Windsor, Ontario, CKNX-TV in Wingham, Ontario and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba — from CTVglobemedia. CTV had indicated that it would shut down the stations, all of which were incurring extensive financial losses, later in the year if a buyer could not be found, and had placed them on the market at a price of just $1 each.[17] However, it was reported on June 30, 2009 that Shaw has backed out of the deal and is declining to complete the purchase.[18] CHWI-TV would remain on the air as is; CKNX-TV would become a repeater of London station CFPL-TV in September 2009, while CKX-TV would close down entirely in October 2009.
In February 2010, Shaw announced an agreement with the financially troubled Canwest, whereby Shaw would buy an 80% voting interest, and 20% equity interest, in the restructured entity of Canwest, pending approvals from the CRTC and others.[19] Three months later, following negotiations with rival bidders, the company said it would purchase the entirety of Canwest's broadcasting assets, including the interests in the CW Media subsidiary partially held by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.[20] Canwest's newspapers were not part of the Shaw deal and were sold separately to Postmedia Network.
The acquisition was completed on October 27, 2010, after CRTC approval for the sale was announced on October 22, forming the Shaw Media division.[21]
2012–present[edit]
In November 2012, Shaw underwent a corporate re-branding, introducing an updated logo and slogan, along with a new promotional campaign featuring animated robots (including two named mascot robots, Bit and Bud) that live in a representation of Shaw's infrastructure, depicting them as being responsible for how their services work. The campaign was designed by the Vancouver-based agency Rethink, who were also responsible for Bell Canada's beaver characters Frank and Gordon.[22][23]
In April 2013, Shaw Business Solutions took over Enmax's Envision subsidiary, which had built a fiber-optic network throughout Calgary. The acquisition was completed for $225 Million.[24]

In 2014, Shaw partnered with Rogers Communications to launch Shomi, a subscription video on demand service.[25]
In February 2015, Shaw Communications announced that they would close operations for service call centers in Edmonton, Calgary and Kelowna, and consolidate operations in Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal. 1,600 of Shaw's 14,000 employees were affected by the consolidation and cuts.[26] The company offered affected employees the option to relocate to its centralized offices, apply for a new job at their location, or leave the company with a severance package for former employees unable to relocate.[26][27]
In 2013, Shaw attempted to begin developing an IPTV-based platform for its television services. However, after experiencing issues developing the platform, Shaw took a $55 million write-down in June 2015, and announced that it was licensing Comcast's cloud-based X1 architecture.[28][29] In January 2016, Shaw launched its mobile television app FreeRange TV, based on X1 infrastructure, which allows Shaw subscribers to stream selected TV channels and on-demand content.[30][31]
Freedom Mobile, divestment of media assets[edit]
On December 16, 2015, Shaw announced its proposed acquisition of independent wireless provider Wind Mobile from its investors in a deal worth approximately $1.6 billion.[32] The transaction closed on March 1, 2016.[33] Under Shaw, the company was renamed Freedom Mobile in November 2016, coinciding with the launch of its 4G LTE network.[34] The acquisition of Wind was funded by a reorganization in April 2016, which saw the Shaw Media unit transferred to Corus Entertainment,[35] in exchange for $1.85 billion in cash and 71,364,853 class B non-voting shares of Corus.[36] The sale did not include Shaw's 50% stake in the Shomi streaming service and CJBN-TV Kenora; Shomi was shut down in November 2016 and CJBN-TV Kenora was shut down in January 2017..[35][37]
On January 11, 2017, Shaw announced the launch of BlueSky—a new IPTV-based television service based on Comcast's X1 platform. The service was initially made available in Calgary.[38]
Other activities[edit]
Shaw is the parent of Shaw Broadcast Services (previously Shaw Satellite Services, Canadian Satellite Communications, or Cancom) and, through Shaw Broadcast Services,[39] Shaw Direct, one of Canada's two national direct broadcast satellite providers. For many years it also owned a number of radio stations and specialty television services; these assets were later spun off into Corus Entertainment in an effort to satisfy a now-repealed CRTC policy discouraging cross-ownership of cablesystems and specialty services.
Controversy[edit]
Internet usage-based billing[edit]
In December 2010, Shaw filed complaints with the CRTC to have competing internet video services such as Netflix classified as broadcasters under Canadian law.[40] In the same month, Shaw introduced usage based billing on internet plans and lowered plan caps an average of 25% while introducing overage fees of $1 to $2 per gigabyte.[41] On February 8, 2011, Shaw agreed to put a hold on usage based billing for its services and to this date continues to not charge customers any overages for surpassing Internet Data caps.[42]
Complaints[edit]
Customer service complaints are frequent among Canadian cable, mobile and Internet users.

History[edit]
Shaw was founded as Capital Cable Television Company, Ltd. in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1966.[4] The company changed its name to Shaw Cablesystems Ltd. and went public on the TSX in 1983. The company grew during the 1980s and 1990s through acquisitions of firms including Classicomm in the Toronto area, Access Communications in Nova Scotia, Fundy Cable in New Brunswick, Trillium Cable in Ontario, Telecable in Saskatchewan, Greater Winnipeg Cablevision[5] (serving areas east of the Red River), and Videon Cablesystems of Winnipeg (serving areas west of the Red River), which had itself previously acquired Vidéotron's assets in Alberta. However, two swaps, in 1994 and 2001, with Rogers Cable have resulted in its assets being restricted to Western Canada and a few areas of Northern Ontario.[6] In 1999, Shaw spun out its media properties into a second publicly-traded company, Corus Entertainment.[7][8]
Prior to 2003, Shaw owned cable systems in the United States previously owned by Moffat Communications, serving six communities in Florida (Eastern Pasco County, Clermont, Palm Coast, Ormond Beach, West Palm Beach and Doral), and the Houston, Texas suburbs of Kingwood, Lake Conroe and Lake Livingston. In February 2003, the Florida systems would be sold to Time Warner Cable (with the West Palm Beach and Doral systems later sold to Comcast, and the other systems spun off to Bright House Networks), while the Texas systems were sold to Cequel III, as part of its then-Cebridge Connections subsidiary (now Suddenlink Communications).[9][10]
In 2008, Shaw entered the AWS spectrum auction with the intention of possibly becoming a wireless phone provider. The auction ended July 2008, giving Shaw Communications enough spectrum to build a wireless network in its home provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario.[11] This spectrum ultimately went unused and was sold to Rogers Communications in January 2013.[12]
In July 2009, Shaw announced its acquisition of Mountain Cablevision; in September, Rogers sued Shaw to block the sale, citing violations of a non-compete clause. However, the suit was quickly dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court.[13][14] The purchase was approved by the CRTC on October 22, 2009.[15][16] The acquisition was Shaw's first cable property east of Sault Ste. Marie since the 2001 swaps with Rogers and Cogeco. Shaw's re-entry into Southern Ontario would be short-lived, as its Hamilton system would be resold to Rogers in January 2013 as part of a deal which also saw unused wireless spectrum sold to the company, and saw Rogers sell its stake in specialty channel TVtropolis.[12]
Return to broadcasting[edit]
On April 30, 2009, Shaw announced a deal to acquire three television stations — CHWI-TV in Windsor, Ontario, CKNX-TV in Wingham, Ontario and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba — from CTVglobemedia. CTV had indicated that it would shut down the stations, all of which were incurring extensive financial losses, later in the year if a buyer could not be found, and had placed them on the market at a price of just $1 each.[17] However, it was reported on June 30, 2009 that Shaw has backed out of the deal and is declining to complete the purchase.[18] CHWI-TV would remain on the air as is; CKNX-TV would become a repeater of London station CFPL-TV in September 2009, while CKX-TV would close down entirely in October 2009.
In February 2010, Shaw announced an agreement with the financially troubled Canwest, whereby Shaw would buy an 80% voting interest, and 20% equity interest, in the restructured entity of Canwest, pending approvals from the CRTC and others.[19] Three months later, following negotiations with rival bidders, the company said it would purchase the entirety of Canwest's broadcasting assets, including the interests in the CW Media subsidiary partially held by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.[20] Canwest's newspapers were not part of the Shaw deal and were sold separately to Postmedia Network.
The acquisition was completed on October 27, 2010, after CRTC approval for the sale was announced on October 22, forming the Shaw Media division.[21]
2012–present[edit]
In November 2012, Shaw underwent a corporate re-branding, introducing an updated logo and slogan, along with a new promotional campaign featuring animated robots (including two named mascot robots, Bit and Bud) that live in a representation of Shaw's infrastructure, depicting them as being responsible for how their services work. The campaign was designed by the Vancouver-based agency Rethink, who were also responsible for Bell Canada's beaver characters Frank and Gordon.[22][23]
In April 2013, Shaw Business Solutions took over Enmax's Envision subsidiary, which had built a fiber-optic network throughout Calgary. The acquisition was completed for $225 Million.[24]

In 2014, Shaw partnered with Rogers Communications to launch Shomi, a subscription video on demand service.[25]
In February 2015, Shaw Communications announced that they would close operations for service call centers in Edmonton, Calgary and Kelowna, and consolidate operations in Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal. 1,600 of Shaw's 14,000 employees were affected by the consolidation and cuts.[26] The company offered affected employees the option to relocate to its centralized offices, apply for a new job at their location, or leave the company with a severance package for former employees unable to relocate.[26][27]
In 2013, Shaw attempted to begin developing an IPTV-based platform for its television services. However, after experiencing issues developing the platform, Shaw took a $55 million write-down in June 2015, and announced that it was licensing Comcast's cloud-based X1 architecture.[28][29] In January 2016, Shaw launched its mobile television app FreeRange TV, based on X1 infrastructure, which allows Shaw subscribers to stream selected TV channels and on-demand content.[30][31]
Freedom Mobile, divestment of media assets[edit]
On December 16, 2015, Shaw announced its proposed acquisition of independent wireless provider Wind Mobile from its investors in a deal worth approximately $1.6 billion.[32] The transaction closed on March 1, 2016.[33] Under Shaw, the company was renamed Freedom Mobile in November 2016, coinciding with the launch of its 4G LTE network.[34] The acquisition of Wind was funded by a reorganization in April 2016, which saw the Shaw Media unit transferred to Corus Entertainment,[35] in exchange for $1.85 billion in cash and 71,364,853 class B non-voting shares of Corus.[36] The sale did not include Shaw's 50% stake in the Shomi streaming service and CJBN-TV Kenora; Shomi was shut down in November 2016 and CJBN-TV Kenora was shut down in January 2017..[35][37]
On January 11, 2017, Shaw announced the launch of BlueSky—a new IPTV-based television service based on Comcast's X1 platform. The service was initially made available in Calgary.[38]
Other activities[edit]
Shaw is the parent of Shaw Broadcast Services (previously Shaw Satellite Services, Canadian Satellite Communications, or Cancom) and, through Shaw Broadcast Services,[39] Shaw Direct, one of Canada's two national direct broadcast satellite providers. For many years it also owned a number of radio stations and specialty television services; these assets were later spun off into Corus Entertainment in an effort to satisfy a now-repealed CRTC policy discouraging cross-ownership of cablesystems and specialty services.
Controversy[edit]
Internet usage-based billing[edit]
In December 2010, Shaw filed complaints with the CRTC to have competing internet video services such as Netflix classified as broadcasters under Canadian law.[40] In the same month, Shaw introduced usage based billing on internet plans and lowered plan caps an average of 25% while introducing overage fees of $1 to $2 per gigabyte.[41] On February 8, 2011, Shaw agreed to put a hold on usage based billing for its services and to this date continues to not charge customers any overages for surpassing Internet Data caps.[42]
Complaints[edit]
Customer service complaints are frequent among Canadian cable, mobile and Internet users.

History[edit]
Shaw was founded as Capital Cable Television Company, Ltd. in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1966.[4] The company changed its name to Shaw Cablesystems Ltd. and went public on the TSX in 1983. The company grew during the 1980s and 1990s through acquisitions of firms including Classicomm in the Toronto area, Access Communications in Nova Scotia, Fundy Cable in New Brunswick, Trillium Cable in Ontario, Telecable in Saskatchewan, Greater Winnipeg Cablevision[5] (serving areas east of the Red River), and Videon Cablesystems of Winnipeg (serving areas west of the Red River), which had itself previously acquired Vidéotron's assets in Alberta. However, two swaps, in 1994 and 2001, with Rogers Cable have resulted in its assets being restricted to Western Canada and a few areas of Northern Ontario.[6] In 1999, Shaw spun out its media properties into a second publicly-traded company, Corus Entertainment.[7][8]
Prior to 2003, Shaw owned cable systems in the United States previously owned by Moffat Communications, serving six communities in Florida (Eastern Pasco County, Clermont, Palm Coast, Ormond Beach, West Palm Beach and Doral), and the Houston, Texas suburbs of Kingwood, Lake Conroe and Lake Livingston. In February 2003, the Florida systems would be sold to Time Warner Cable (with the West Palm Beach and Doral systems later sold to Comcast, and the other systems spun off to Bright House Networks), while the Texas systems were sold to Cequel III, as part of its then-Cebridge Connections subsidiary (now Suddenlink Communications).[9][10]
In 2008, Shaw entered the AWS spectrum auction with the intention of possibly becoming a wireless phone provider. The auction ended July 2008, giving Shaw Communications enough spectrum to build a wireless network in its home provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario.[11] This spectrum ultimately went unused and was sold to Rogers Communications in January 2013.[12]
In July 2009, Shaw announced its acquisition of Mountain Cablevision; in September, Rogers sued Shaw to block the sale, citing violations of a non-compete clause. However, the suit was quickly dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court.[13][14] The purchase was approved by the CRTC on October 22, 2009.[15][16] The acquisition was Shaw's first cable property east of Sault Ste. Marie since the 2001 swaps with Rogers and Cogeco. Shaw's re-entry into Southern Ontario would be short-lived, as its Hamilton system would be resold to Rogers in January 2013 as part of a deal which also saw unused wireless spectrum sold to the company, and saw Rogers sell its stake in specialty channel TVtropolis.[12]
Return to broadcasting[edit]
On April 30, 2009, Shaw announced a deal to acquire three television stations — CHWI-TV in Windsor, Ontario, CKNX-TV in Wingham, Ontario and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba — from CTVglobemedia. CTV had indicated that it would shut down the stations, all of which were incurring extensive financial losses, later in the year if a buyer could not be found, and had placed them on the market at a price of just $1 each.[17] However, it was reported on June 30, 2009 that Shaw has backed out of the deal and is declining to complete the purchase.[18] CHWI-TV would remain on the air as is; CKNX-TV would become a repeater of London station CFPL-TV in September 2009, while CKX-TV would close down entirely in October 2009.
In February 2010, Shaw announced an agreement with the financially troubled Canwest, whereby Shaw would buy an 80% voting interest, and 20% equity interest, in the restructured entity of Canwest, pending approvals from the CRTC and others.[19] Three months later, following negotiations with rival bidders, the company said it would purchase the entirety of Canwest's broadcasting assets, including the interests in the CW Media subsidiary partially held by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.[20] Canwest's newspapers were not part of the Shaw deal and were sold separately to Postmedia Network.
The acquisition was completed on October 27, 2010, after CRTC approval for the sale was announced on October 22, forming the Shaw Media division.[21]
2012–present[edit]
In November 2012, Shaw underwent a corporate re-branding, introducing an updated logo and slogan, along with a new promotional campaign featuring animated robots (including two named mascot robots, Bit and Bud) that live in a representation of Shaw's infrastructure, depicting them as being responsible for how their services work. The campaign was designed by the Vancouver-based agency Rethink, who were also responsible for Bell Canada's beaver characters Frank and Gordon.[22][23]
In April 2013, Shaw Business Solutions took over Enmax's Envision subsidiary, which had built a fiber-optic network throughout Calgary. The acquisition was completed for $225 Million.[24]

In 2014, Shaw partnered with Rogers Communications to launch Shomi, a subscription video on demand service.[25]
In February 2015, Shaw Communications announced that they would close operations for service call centers in Edmonton, Calgary and Kelowna, and consolidate operations in Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal. 1,600 of Shaw's 14,000 employees were affected by the consolidation and cuts.[26] The company offered affected employees the option to relocate to its centralized offices, apply for a new job at their location, or leave the company with a severance package for former employees unable to relocate.[26][27]
In 2013, Shaw attempted to begin developing an IPTV-based platform for its television services. However, after experiencing issues developing the platform, Shaw took a $55 million write-down in June 2015, and announced that it was licensing Comcast's cloud-based X1 architecture.[28][29] In January 2016, Shaw launched its mobile television app FreeRange TV, based on X1 infrastructure, which allows Shaw subscribers to stream selected TV channels and on-demand content.[30][31]
Freedom Mobile, divestment of media assets[edit]
On December 16, 2015, Shaw announced its proposed acquisition of independent wireless provider Wind Mobile from its investors in a deal worth approximately $1.6 billion.[32] The transaction closed on March 1, 2016.[33] Under Shaw, the company was renamed Freedom Mobile in November 2016, coinciding with the launch of its 4G LTE network.[34] The acquisition of Wind was funded by a reorganization in April 2016, which saw the Shaw Media unit transferred to Corus Entertainment,[35] in exchange for $1.85 billion in cash and 71,364,853 class B non-voting shares of Corus.[36] The sale did not include Shaw's 50% stake in the Shomi streaming service and CJBN-TV Kenora; Shomi was shut down in November 2016 and CJBN-TV Kenora was shut down in January 2017..[35][37]
On January 11, 2017, Shaw announced the launch of BlueSky—a new IPTV-based television service based on Comcast's X1 platform. The service was initially made available in Calgary.[38]
Other activities[edit]
Shaw is the parent of Shaw Broadcast Services (previously Shaw Satellite Services, Canadian Satellite Communications, or Cancom) and, through Shaw Broadcast Services,[39] Shaw Direct, one of Canada's two national direct broadcast satellite providers. For many years it also owned a number of radio stations and specialty television services; these assets were later spun off into Corus Entertainment in an effort to satisfy a now-repealed CRTC policy discouraging cross-ownership of cablesystems and specialty services.
Controversy[edit]
Internet usage-based billing[edit]
In December 2010, Shaw filed complaints with the CRTC to have competing internet video services such as Netflix classified as broadcasters under Canadian law.[40] In the same month, Shaw introduced usage based billing on internet plans and lowered plan caps an average of 25% while introducing overage fees of $1 to $2 per gigabyte.[41] On February 8, 2011, Shaw agreed to put a hold on usage based billing for its services and to this date continues to not charge customers any overages for surpassing Internet Data caps.[42]
Complaints[edit]
Customer service complaints are frequent among Canadian cable, mobile and Internet users.

Shaw Communications Inc. vs. Rogers Communications Inc.: Which Stock Offers Better Value Right Now?

Ambrose O'Callaghan | July 26, 2017 | More on:  RCI SJR RCI.B SJR.B








 




Over 150,000 Canadians cancelled their television subscriptions in 2015. Canadian providers like Shaw Communications Inc. (TSX:SJR.B)(NYSE:SJR) and Rogers Communications Inc. (TSX:RCI.B)(NYSE:RCI) have attempted to overcome this development by raising rates on their customer base and making a commitment to a technological transformation.

The rise of online television providers, like Netflix, Inc., Primus, ViaNet TV, and others have necessitated the evolution of legacy cable companies.

Both Shaw and Rogers are taking steps to shore up their disadvantages and make an appeal to consumers who are now being offered a plethora of revolutionary services, often at a reduced cost.

Over 150,000 Canadians cancelled their television subscriptions in 2015. Canadian providers like Shaw Communications Inc. (TSX:SJR.B)(NYSE:SJR) and Rogers Communications Inc. (TSX:RCI.B)(NYSE:RCI) have attempted to overcome this development by raising rates on their customer base and making a commitment to a technological transformation.
The rise of online television providers, like Netflix, Inc., Primus, ViaNet TV, and others have necessitated the evolution of legacy cable companies.
Both Shaw and Rogers are taking steps to shore up their disadvantages and make an appeal to consumers who are now being offered a plethora of revolutionary services, often at a reduced cost.
Shaw Communications
Shaw recently reported that it had gained 13,000 customers in three months leading up to May 31, 2017. This was the first time since 2010 that it had experienced a net increase. Shaw gave much of the credit to its new product BlueSky TV, which was launched in January. A surge in internet sales has also helped the company win customers and aid with retention.
The transformation has not come without a cost. Operating income fell in 0.5% to $550 million. Profit experienced an 81% decline, even with a 2.8% increase in revenue. These changes illustrate the rising costs faced by legacy cable providers in competition with new tech.
Shaw’s share price suffered after the release of these results in late June, and up until now it has dropped almost 8% month over month to settle at $27.80 as of Friday’s close. Still, the stock has gained 3% in 2017, and rising costs for the transformation have had a substantive impact in improving the consumer base.
Rogers Communications
Rogers’s stock price surged over 5% in a week on the back of news that it had added 93,000 wireless subscribers in the three months ending June 30, beating analyst estimates by over 15,000. It lost 25,000 television subscribers and won 11,000 for its internet service.
The company has plans to introduce Comcast’s X1 platform in 2018 — a strategy it shares with Shaw after both providers abandoned their IPTV platforms to compete with BCE Inc.
The share price has experienced a 27% increase over the course of 2017. It closed at $65.89 on Friday — up 1.56%, nearing its all-time high of $65.91.
Where should investors turn?
The challenges faced by the cable industry are not going to dissipate any time soon. Providers are being forced to make large technological transformations. Demographics are driving consumers away from traditional television subscriptions, and toward exclusively wireless and online providers.
Shaw stock offers a dividend of $0.10 per share, with a 4.26% yield. Its digital push has shown early success, but results demonstrated that transformation expenses have eaten into profits. Rogers boasts a dividend of $0.48 per share and a dividend yield of 2.91%.
Investors seeking income and a robust performer should look to Rogers as a solid add to any portfolio. However, those in the market for gamble can look at Shaw, which may be a bargain after negative results overshadowed what are some very positive developments for the company.

The Next Canadian Superbrand You've Never Heard of...
This small-cap stock is "Hidden in Plain Sight!" It's flying under the radar and is being touted as a "royalty collector" by several of our top Canadian analysts.

For only the 5th time in over 14 years, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner just issued a Buy Recommendation on this recent Canadian IPO.

Why are over 15,130 well-positioned and in-the-know Canadian investors all counting down to two very specific days this month at 4 p.m.?

It has to do with an amazingly telling profit signal we’ve come to call a “Ground Floor Event” (even though it’s completely unrelated to an IPO)…
And one that’s made a few lucky investors who’ve paid close attention to under-the-radar events like these gains of 832%... 5,480%... and even 7,902% over the past 5 to 10 years. 
You can join the roughly 0.03% of Canadians who’ve already positioned themselves to capitalize on this next “Ground Floor Event” – but you must act soon…

History[edit]
Shaw was founded as Capital Cable Television Company, Ltd. in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1966.[4] The company changed its name to Shaw Cablesystems Ltd. and went public on the TSX in 1983. The company grew during the 1980s and 1990s through acquisitions of firms including Classicomm in the Toronto area, Access Communications in Nova Scotia, Fundy Cable in New Brunswick, Trillium Cable in Ontario, Telecable in Saskatchewan, Greater Winnipeg Cablevision[5] (serving areas east of the Red River), and Videon Cablesystems of Winnipeg (serving areas west of the Red River), which had itself previously acquired Vidéotron's assets in Alberta. However, two swaps, in 1994 and 2001, with Rogers Cable have resulted in its assets being restricted to Western Canada and a few areas of Northern Ontario.[6] In 1999, Shaw spun out its media properties into a second publicly-traded company, Corus Entertainment.[7][8]
Prior to 2003, Shaw owned cable systems in the United States previously owned by Moffat Communications, serving six communities in Florida (Eastern Pasco County, Clermont, Palm Coast, Ormond Beach, West Palm Beach and Doral), and the Houston, Texas suburbs of Kingwood, Lake Conroe and Lake Livingston. In February 2003, the Florida systems would be sold to Time Warner Cable (with the West Palm Beach and Doral systems later sold to Comcast, and the other systems spun off to Bright House Networks), while the Texas systems were sold to Cequel III, as part of its then-Cebridge Connections subsidiary (now Suddenlink Communications).[9][10]
In 2008, Shaw entered the AWS spectrum auction with the intention of possibly becoming a wireless phone provider. The auction ended July 2008, giving Shaw Communications enough spectrum to build a wireless network in its home provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario.[11] This spectrum ultimately went unused and was sold to Rogers Communications in January 2013.[12]
In July 2009, Shaw announced its acquisition of Mountain Cablevision; in September, Rogers sued Shaw to block the sale, citing violations of a non-compete clause. However, the suit was quickly dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court.[13][14] The purchase was approved by the CRTC on October 22, 2009.[15][16] The acquisition was Shaw's first cable property east of Sault Ste. Marie since the 2001 swaps with Rogers and Cogeco. Shaw's re-entry into Southern Ontario would be short-lived, as its Hamilton system would be resold to Rogers in January 2013 as part of a deal which also saw unused wireless spectrum sold to the company, and saw Rogers sell its stake in specialty channel TVtropolis.[12]
Return to broadcasting[edit]
On April 30, 2009, Shaw announced a deal to acquire three television stations — CHWI-TV in Windsor, Ontario, CKNX-TV in Wingham, Ontario and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba — from CTVglobemedia. CTV had indicated that it would shut down the stations, all of which were incurring extensive financial losses, later in the year if a buyer could not be found, and had placed them on the market at a price of just $1 each.[17] However, it was reported on June 30, 2009 that Shaw has backed out of the deal and is declining to complete the purchase.[18] CHWI-TV would remain on the air as is; CKNX-TV would become a repeater of London station CFPL-TV in September 2009, while CKX-TV would close down entirely in October 2009.
In February 2010, Shaw announced an agreement with the financially troubled Canwest, whereby Shaw would buy an 80% voting interest, and 20% equity interest, in the restructured entity of Canwest, pending approvals from the CRTC and others.[19] Three months later, following negotiations with rival bidders, the company said it would purchase the entirety of Canwest's broadcasting assets, including the interests in the CW Media subsidiary partially held by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.[20] Canwest's newspapers were not part of the Shaw deal and were sold separately to Postmedia Network.
The acquisition was completed on October 27, 2010, after CRTC approval for the sale was announced on October 22, forming the Shaw Media division.[21]
2012–present[edit]
In November 2012, Shaw underwent a corporate re-branding, introducing an updated logo and slogan, along with a new promotional campaign featuring animated robots (including two named mascot robots, Bit and Bud) that live in a representation of Shaw's infrastructure, depicting them as being responsible for how their services work. The campaign was designed by the Vancouver-based agency Rethink, who were also responsible for Bell Canada's beaver characters Frank and Gordon.[22][23]
In April 2013, Shaw Business Solutions took over Enmax's Envision subsidiary, which had built a fiber-optic network throughout Calgary. The acquisition was completed for $225 Million.[24]

In 2014, Shaw partnered with Rogers Communications to launch Shomi, a subscription video on demand service.[25]
In February 2015, Shaw Communications announced that they would close operations for service call centers in Edmonton, Calgary and Kelowna, and consolidate operations in Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal. 1,600 of Shaw's 14,000 employees were affected by the consolidation and cuts.[26] The company offered affected employees the option to relocate to its centralized offices, apply for a new job at their location, or leave the company with a severance package for former employees unable to relocate.[26][27]
In 2013, Shaw attempted to begin developing an IPTV-based platform for its television services. However, after experiencing issues developing the platform, Shaw took a $55 million write-down in June 2015, and announced that it was licensing Comcast's cloud-based X1 architecture.[28][29] In January 2016, Shaw launched its mobile television app FreeRange TV, based on X1 infrastructure, which allows Shaw subscribers to stream selected TV channels and on-demand content.[30][31]
Freedom Mobile, divestment of media assets[edit]
On December 16, 2015, Shaw announced its proposed acquisition of independent wireless provider Wind Mobile from its investors in a deal worth approximately $1.6 billion.[32] The transaction closed on March 1, 2016.[33] Under Shaw, the company was renamed Freedom Mobile in November 2016, coinciding with the launch of its 4G LTE network.[34] The acquisition of Wind was funded by a reorganization in April 2016, which saw the Shaw Media unit transferred to Corus Entertainment,[35] in exchange for $1.85 billion in cash and 71,364,853 class B non-voting shares of Corus.[36] The sale did not include Shaw's 50% stake in the Shomi streaming service and CJBN-TV Kenora; Shomi was shut down in November 2016 and CJBN-TV Kenora was shut down in January 2017..[35][37]
On January 11, 2017, Shaw announced the launch of BlueSky—a new IPTV-based television service based on Comcast's X1 platform. The service was initially made available in Calgary.[38]
Other activities[edit]
Shaw is the parent of Shaw Broadcast Services (previously Shaw Satellite Services, Canadian Satellite Communications, or Cancom) and, through Shaw Broadcast Services,[39] Shaw Direct, one of Canada's two national direct broadcast satellite providers. For many years it also owned a number of radio stations and specialty television services; these assets were later spun off into Corus Entertainment in an effort to satisfy a now-repealed CRTC policy discouraging cross-ownership of cablesystems and specialty services.
Controversy[edit]
Internet usage-based billing[edit]
In December 2010, Shaw filed complaints with the CRTC to have competing internet video services such as Netflix classified as broadcasters under Canadian law.[40] In the same month, Shaw introduced usage based billing on internet plans and lowered plan caps an average of 25% while introducing overage fees of $1 to $2 per gigabyte.[41] On February 8, 2011, Shaw agreed to put a hold on usage based billing for its services and to this date continues to not charge customers any overages for surpassing Internet Data caps.[42]
Complaints[edit]
Customer service complaints are frequent among Canadian cable, mobile and Internet users.

History[edit]
Shaw was founded as Capital Cable Television Company, Ltd. in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1966.[4] The company changed its name to Shaw Cablesystems Ltd. and went public on the TSX in 1983. The company grew during the 1980s and 1990s through acquisitions of firms including Classicomm in the Toronto area, Access Communications in Nova Scotia, Fundy Cable in New Brunswick, Trillium Cable in Ontario, Telecable in Saskatchewan, Greater Winnipeg Cablevision[5] (serving areas east of the Red River), and Videon Cablesystems of Winnipeg (serving areas west of the Red River), which had itself previously acquired Vidéotron's assets in Alberta. However, two swaps, in 1994 and 2001, with Rogers Cable have resulted in its assets being restricted to Western Canada and a few areas of Northern Ontario.[6] In 1999, Shaw spun out its media properties into a second publicly-traded company, Corus Entertainment.[7][8]
Prior to 2003, Shaw owned cable systems in the United States previously owned by Moffat Communications, serving six communities in Florida (Eastern Pasco County, Clermont, Palm Coast, Ormond Beach, West Palm Beach and Doral), and the Houston, Texas suburbs of Kingwood, Lake Conroe and Lake Livingston. In February 2003, the Florida systems would be sold to Time Warner Cable (with the West Palm Beach and Doral systems later sold to Comcast, and the other systems spun off to Bright House Networks), while the Texas systems were sold to Cequel III, as part of its then-Cebridge Connections subsidiary (now Suddenlink Communications).[9][10]
In 2008, Shaw entered the AWS spectrum auction with the intention of possibly becoming a wireless phone provider. The auction ended July 2008, giving Shaw Communications enough spectrum to build a wireless network in its home provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario.[11] This spectrum ultimately went unused and was sold to Rogers Communications in January 2013.[12]
In July 2009, Shaw announced its acquisition of Mountain Cablevision; in September, Rogers sued Shaw to block the sale, citing violations of a non-compete clause. However, the suit was quickly dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court.[13][14] The purchase was approved by the CRTC on October 22, 2009.[15][16] The acquisition was Shaw's first cable property east of Sault Ste. Marie since the 2001 swaps with Rogers and Cogeco. Shaw's re-entry into Southern Ontario would be short-lived, as its Hamilton system would be resold to Rogers in January 2013 as part of a deal which also saw unused wireless spectrum sold to the company, and saw Rogers sell its stake in specialty channel TVtropolis.[12]
Return to broadcasting[edit]
On April 30, 2009, Shaw announced a deal to acquire three television stations — CHWI-TV in Windsor, Ontario, CKNX-TV in Wingham, Ontario and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba — from CTVglobemedia. CTV had indicated that it would shut down the stations, all of which were incurring extensive financial losses, later in the year if a buyer could not be found, and had placed them on the market at a price of just $1 each.[17] However, it was reported on June 30, 2009 that Shaw has backed out of the deal and is declining to complete the purchase.[18] CHWI-TV would remain on the air as is; CKNX-TV would become a repeater of London station CFPL-TV in September 2009, while CKX-TV would close down entirely in October 2009.
In February 2010, Shaw announced an agreement with the financially troubled Canwest, whereby Shaw would buy an 80% voting interest, and 20% equity interest, in the restructured entity of Canwest, pending approvals from the CRTC and others.[19] Three months later, following negotiations with rival bidders, the company said it would purchase the entirety of Canwest's broadcasting assets, including the interests in the CW Media subsidiary partially held by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.[20] Canwest's newspapers were not part of the Shaw deal and were sold separately to Postmedia Network.
The acquisition was completed on October 27, 2010, after CRTC approval for the sale was announced on October 22, forming the Shaw Media division.[21]
2012–present[edit]
In November 2012, Shaw underwent a corporate re-branding, introducing an updated logo and slogan, along with a new promotional campaign featuring animated robots (including two named mascot robots, Bit and Bud) that live in a representation of Shaw's infrastructure, depicting them as being responsible for how their services work. The campaign was designed by the Vancouver-based agency Rethink, who were also responsible for Bell Canada's beaver characters Frank and Gordon.[22][23]
In April 2013, Shaw Business Solutions took over Enmax's Envision subsidiary, which had built a fiber-optic network throughout Calgary. The acquisition was completed for $225 Million.[24]

In 2014, Shaw partnered with Rogers Communications to launch Shomi, a subscription video on demand service.[25]
In February 2015, Shaw Communications announced that they would close operations for service call centers in Edmonton, Calgary and Kelowna, and consolidate operations in Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal. 1,600 of Shaw's 14,000 employees were affected by the consolidation and cuts.[26] The company offered affected employees the option to relocate to its centralized offices, apply for a new job at their location, or leave the company with a severance package for former employees unable to relocate.[26][27]
In 2013, Shaw attempted to begin developing an IPTV-based platform for its television services. However, after experiencing issues developing the platform, Shaw took a $55 million write-down in June 2015, and announced that it was licensing Comcast's cloud-based X1 architecture.[28][29] In January 2016, Shaw launched its mobile television app FreeRange TV, based on X1 infrastructure, which allows Shaw subscribers to stream selected TV channels and on-demand content.[30][31]
Freedom Mobile, divestment of media assets[edit]
On December 16, 2015, Shaw announced its proposed acquisition of independent wireless provider Wind Mobile from its investors in a deal worth approximately $1.6 billion.[32] The transaction closed on March 1, 2016.[33] Under Shaw, the company was renamed Freedom Mobile in November 2016, coinciding with the launch of its 4G LTE network.[34] The acquisition of Wind was funded by a reorganization in April 2016, which saw the Shaw Media unit transferred to Corus Entertainment,[35] in exchange for $1.85 billion in cash and 71,364,853 class B non-voting shares of Corus.[36] The sale did not include Shaw's 50% stake in the Shomi streaming service and CJBN-TV Kenora; Shomi was shut down in November 2016 and CJBN-TV Kenora was shut down in January 2017..[35][37]
On January 11, 2017, Shaw announced the launch of BlueSky—a new IPTV-based television service based on Comcast's X1 platform. The service was initially made available in Calgary.[38]
Other activities[edit]
Shaw is the parent of Shaw Broadcast Services (previously Shaw Satellite Services, Canadian Satellite Communications, or Cancom) and, through Shaw Broadcast Services,[39] Shaw Direct, one of Canada's two national direct broadcast satellite providers. For many years it also owned a number of radio stations and specialty television services; these assets were later spun off into Corus Entertainment in an effort to satisfy a now-repealed CRTC policy discouraging cross-ownership of cablesystems and specialty services.
Controversy[edit]
Internet usage-based billing[edit]
In December 2010, Shaw filed complaints with the CRTC to have competing internet video services such as Netflix classified as broadcasters under Canadian law.[40] In the same month, Shaw introduced usage based billing on internet plans and lowered plan caps an average of 25% while introducing overage fees of $1 to $2 per gigabyte.[41] On February 8, 2011, Shaw agreed to put a hold on usage based billing for its services and to this date continues to not charge customers any overages for surpassing Internet Data caps.[42]
Complaints[edit]
Customer service complaints are frequent among Canadian cable, mobile and Internet users.

Canadian telecom behemoth Shaw Communications Inc. (SJR  -  Free Report)	 has decided to launch an innovative voice-controlled television product in a bid to regain market share in the western parts of Canada. Notably, this innovative TV product is powered by U.S. cable MSO and media giant Comcast Corp.'s (CMCSA  -  Free Report)	 X1 technology.Shaw Communications has been using Comcast’s technology since 2015. In Jun 2015, the company abandon its own IPTV platform development project (after writing-down CS$55 million) and instead licensed Comcast’s cloud-based X1 platform. Comcast’s web-capable X1 platform offers a hybrid IP/QAM video gateway with an advanced user interface and the ability to port third-party apps that tie into a cloud-based infrastructure. X1 is a cloud-based TV guide and includes recommended web videos as well as a new mobile application.Shaw Communications has been persistently losing cable TV share in its core western Canadian markets to rival TELUS Corp. (TU  -  Free Report)	. Using the powerful X1 platform, the company aims to provide its customers with an advanced seamless and connected TV experience, at home or outside. Further, the company is looking to gain from the huge scale that Comcast’s X1 platform will offer, which in turn aid it in regaining market share.From mid-Jul 2016, Shaw Communications has been aggressively offering high-speed Internet at a competitive rate. The company recently added wireless services to its product mix through the purchase of Wind Mobile, which has been renamed Freedom Mobile.Interestingly, Shaw Communications is the second major operator to have shown keen interest in commercially deploying X1, after Cox Communications Inc. Notably, in Dec 2016, Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI  -  Free Report)	, the largest Canadian integrated telecom operator, planned to dump its Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) platform and adopt Comcast’s X1 video platform. Rogers Communications operates mainly in the Eastern parts of Canada.Price Performance of Shaw Communications Shaw Communications has managed to surpass the Zacks categorized Cable TV industry’s performance marginally in the past one year. The stock has gained 29.34% while the industry registered growth of 28.99%. The company had a tough time during the 2013-2015 time period.The divestiture of Shaw Communications’ subsidiary Shaw Media to Corus Entertainment Inc. place it as a pure-play Canadian telecom company with a solid growth profile. Further, the company’s venture into the Canadian wireless market is likely to prove beneficial. The launch of the mobile TV platform – FreeRange TV – and its SmartWiFi and SmartSecurity Services should gain traction as well.Further, the company is launching high-speed Internet services like WideOpen Internet 150 and entering into tie-ups to boost its cloud suite. We believe these are reasons behind the stock currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shaw Communications Inc. launches Comcast's X1 TV platform to wrestle back market share from Telus
Shaw is hoping that the new TV product will help bring cord cutters, cord shavers and cord nevers back into the cable system

Shaw Communications Inc. has launched a long-awaited, majorly upgraded television product that it expects will take on Internet-protocol TV offerings from its main competitor.
Called Shaw BlueSky TV, the new product uses Comcast’s X1 platform and is now available to Calgary customers, the Western Canadian cable company announced Wednesday, the day before it reports results for the first quarter of 2017 and holds its annual general meeting.
Shaw is pitching the new service, which it plans to launch in other markets in the coming months, as a “best-in-class” premium TV product that comes with a voice-controlled remote and advanced search functions.
“We are proud to be the first in Canada to pioneer Comcast’s ground-breaking technology and to be their first international partner,” Shaw CEO Brad Shaw said in a statement.
But it won’t be the last television provider to turn to Comcast’s X1 platform after abandoning its internal attempts to create an IPTV in 2015 and taking a $55-million write-down in the process.
Rogers Communications Inc. announced in December it, too, inked a deal with Comcast X1, killing its own IPTV development in a move that will result in a $475-million to $525-million write-down. It will roll out the new technology in 2018.
The adoption of Comcast’s platform comes as cable companies lose subscribers to traditional telephone companies BCE Inc. in Eastern Canada and Telus Corp. in the west, stealing market share with their superior IPTV services, Fibe TV and Optic TV.
In the first nine months of 2016, Shaw and Rogers respectively lost 98,000 and 63,000 TV subscribers while Telus and Bell gained 38,000 and 7,000, respectively.
Comcast posted a net gain of 170,000 customers last year, the first time its done so in the approximately eight years since launching the platform, technology and product president Tony Werner said in a joint interview with Shaw president Jay Mehr on Wednesday.
“It’s IPTV, but it’s a lot more than that,” Werner said, adding it uses cloud-based software that allows Comcast to make changes to its offerings on the fly. The voice remote has been a “huge success” with usage expected to double in 2017, he said, and the platform can be used for Internet of Things applications such as turning up a thermostat.  
Mehr said the new TV product will help bring cord cutters, cord shavers and cord nevers back into the cable system.
“This for sure is a differentiated video product,” he said, noting the variety of applications available including Netflix.
He wouldn’t say exactly when he expects Shaw to quell subscriber losses, but said he expects it will gain traction more quickly than Comcast did.
“It won’t take us that long,” Mehr said.

Shaw Communications Banks on New Product, Acquisition


Zacks Equity Research
                December 03, 2014

SJR LBTYA SIRI 

Trades from
$1











 









Read MoreHide Full Article










Shaw Communications, Inc. (SJR  -  Free Report)	 is trying to increase its revenues by boosting its operations in the North America data center sector through the acquisition of ViaWest Inc.

	Near-term catalysts include high-speed Internet and telephony subscriber gain, expansion of Shaw Go Wi-Fi networks, and increased number of applications supporting the Shaw Global Go TV Everywhere service.

	The company reported mixed financial numbers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 with the top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line surpassing the same.

	Shaw Business – a division of Shaw Communications – plans to upgrade its Managed WiFi solution for clients operating in the hospitality industry. With the new Managed WiFi solution slated to be available from Jan 2015, hotels, inns, resorts, casinos and conference centers will be able to access Shaw Business’ unmatched WiFi capabilities.

	Shaw Communications has sealed its previously declared acquisition of ViaWest Inc. for $1.2 billion. The takeover of this Colorado-based data-center provider will help Shaw Communications expand its data services and cloud capabilities business. ViaWest has 27 data centers in eight western U.S. markets which include Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas and Minneapolis. The company has gained significant synergies from its initial set-up of only five data centers in two markets.

	For fiscal 2015, management expects both total revenue and operating income before amortization to grow 5–7% year over year. Free cash flow is projected at $650 million. In order to boost its overall productive efficiency, Shaw Communications plans to streamline its organization structure into three segments, namely, consumer, business and media.

	On the downside, Shaw Communications exited the fiscal fourth quarter with nearly $4.3 billion debt as compared with $3.5 billion in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, the maturity of nearly $1.3 billion debt over the next four years will further pressurize the company’s cash flow.

	Shaw Communications currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Other Stocks to Consider

	Some better-ranked stocks that warrant a look in the related sector are LIN Media LLC , Liberty Global plc (LBTYA  -  Free Report)	 and Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI  -  Free Report)	. LIN Media and Liberty Global sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Sirius XM carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
