Kahua Launches New Schedule App 





Submitted by cdp-inc on July 27, 2016 - 11:00am




Collaboration, workflow and integration with MS Project set a new standard for project scheduling
Atlanta—July 27, 2016 — Kahua, the premier cloud-based project management and collaboration platform, announces the launch of their highly anticipated Schedule App. Enabling users to easily create, update and effectively manage project schedules, it is a powerful addition to the File, Document and Cost Management Suites of the Kahua Platform. 
“One of the biggest challenges facing owners and contractors today is keeping track of project schedules and accurately measuring progress and status,” said Paul Riefenberg, President of CDP, a leading provider of technology solutions to the Construction Industry, “Kahua’s unique collaborative approach to scheduling is a powerful step up for our industry.”
“We are excited with this new addition to our game changing platform approach,” said Brian Moore, President of Kahua, “The Schedule App leverages the robust collaboration and workflow capabilities of the Kahua Platform to simplify and enhance the challenging process of schedule management, and supports our mission of delivering value to the real estate and construction industry.”
With the Kahua Schedule App, you can utilize a Microsoft Project schedule or manually create a milestone driven schedule. As tasks are assigned, any resource assigned a task can provide regular updates to the scheduler. The scheduler can validate the percent complete and keep a continuous thread of communication with all parties until tasks are completed. With the Kahua Schedule App you can:

Create, edit and share project schedules
Assign multiple resources to project tasks
Validate project task completion
Provide all team members access to a single schedule
Create quick access views and traditional Gantt view
Filter and sort tasks by attribute or status

The Kahua Platform will enable integration to additional project scheduling systems in future releases. The Schedule App is available in the Kahua kStore, the industry’s first App Store launched in 2011. To learn more about Kahua’s Schedule App, please join us for our upcoming web demonstration on August 8th at 1:00 PM EDT.

The Kahua Story









Derived from the Hawaiian word for “platform”…
Kahua was founded in 2009 by seven industry veterans who have been committed to improving productivity in the Construction industry for over 20 years.










Prior to founding Kahua, the founders started Constructware in 1997 which offered the construction industry’s first internet-based collaborative project management solution. By 2006 Constructware had been implemented by over 400 customers and was recognized as one of the earliest and most successful Cloud-based solutions on the market. Constructware was acquired by Autodesk that same year.
In 2009, seven members of the innovative Constructware team decided to form a new company, Kahua, whose purpose was to build and launch the next generation project management and collaboration solution for real estate, design, engineering, construction, and operations. This team has over 100 years combined experience in implementing cloud-based solutions and completed its first full production release in 2014. Today Kahua has over 2,500 customers ranging from the largest owners and general contractors to small subcontractors. Additionally, there are over 50 apps in Kahua’s public kStore and over 600 private applications that have been developed by customers or certified Kahua Partners.
Kahua is reinventing the way companies deliver and manage capital assets.








Kahua Is:





 

Solving the collaborative issue of one project stakeholder owning and controlling “the system.”







 

Enabling rapid creation of custom applications and workflows that enable business processes to work across companies.







 

A secure but open architecture for connecting the cloud to internal and external systems.







 

Enabling companies to maximize data access and response times through the use of mobile devices.

“Since rolling out Kahua, we have realized considerable productivity improvements through improved usability, better collaboration, seamless integration with our ERP system and other applications, and a platform to develop and launch apps quickly.”
Steve Stankiewicz, Application Development Manager, Clark Construction Group






  


“In Kahua, we saw key differentiators, most importantly, the ability to easily build custom applications that conform to our business processes rather than us tailoring our business processes to the system.”
Jeff Wilson, Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission
