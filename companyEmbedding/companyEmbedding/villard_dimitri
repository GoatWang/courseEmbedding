In 2000, he co-founded and became Chairman of Pivotal BioSciences, Inc., a biotechnology spin-out of the USC Keck School of Medicine that is developing a novel immunotherapy treatment for cancer.
From 2004 to 2008, he was Chairman of DAX Solutions, a leading supplier of digital production services, and from 2009 to 2013, he was CEO of ArtistDIRECT, a music Internet website, which he restructured into Peer Media Technologies, an anti-piracy and entertainment business intelligence company.
