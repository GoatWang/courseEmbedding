1The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the regular monthly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by FSIC II’s net asset value (NAV) per share as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSIC II’s shares of common stock is subject to the discretion of FSIC II’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of FSIC II’s distributions were funded through net investment income, on a tax basis. No portion of FSIC II’s distributions during the three months ended March 31, 2017, was funded through expense reimbursements from FSIC II’s sponsor. The determination of the tax attributes of FSIC II’s distributions is made annually at the end of FSIC II’s fiscal year, and a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSIC II’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders are reported to stockholders annually on Form 1099-DIV. FSIC II’s total expenses as a percentage of average net assets attributable to common stock was 8.96% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
        

2The distribution reinvestment price is subject to change. The price at which shares of FSIC II’s common stock are issued under its distribution reinvestment plan is determined by FSIC II’s board of directors, or a committee thereof, at a price per share that is (i) not less than the NAV per share immediately prior to the payment of the distribution and (ii) not more than 2.5% greater than the NAV per share as of such date.

1FSIC II’s Stockholder Returns (Without Sales Charge) are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. Except for the YTD, 1 Year and 3 Year periods, the calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSIC II’s public offering price, excluding selling commissions and dealer manager fees, at the beginning of the applicable period and reinvested all cash distributions pursuant to FSIC II’s distribution reinvestment plan (“DRP”). Since FSIC II closed its public offering in March 2014 and has since issued new shares only pursuant to its DRP, the calculation of FSIC II’s Stockholder Returns (Without Sales Charge) for the YTD, 1 Year and 3 Year periods assumes that the investor purchased shares at the beginning of the applicable period at a price based upon FSIC II’s DRP on such date. Valuation as of the end of each period is the redemption price pursuant to FSIC II’s share repurchase program on such date. Stockholder Returns (Without Sales Charge) do not include selling commissions and dealer manager fees, which could total up to 10% of FSIC II’s public offering price. Had such selling commissions and dealer manager fees been included, performance would be lower. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
FSIC II is closed to new investors. FSIC II’s total expenses as a percentage to average net assets attributable to common stock was 8.96% for the year ended December 31, 2016.


2Stockholder Return (With Sales Charge) is the total return an investor received since inception taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSIC II’s public offering price, including the maximum selling commissions and dealer manager fees, at inception and reinvested all distributions pursuant to FSIC II’s DRP. Valuation as of the end of the period is the redemption price pursuant to FSIC II’s share repurchase program on such date. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
              

3Cumulative cash distributions per share reflect the total regular cash distributions paid since inception on a per share basis as of June 30, 2017. The payment of future distributions on FSIC II’s shares is subject to the sole discretion of FSIC II’s board of directors, and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.

      View risk factors disclosure




An investment in the common stock of FSIC II involves a high degree of risk and may be considered speculative. The following are some of the risks an investment in FSIC II’s common stock involves; however, you should carefully consider all of the information found in FSIC II’s annual report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports filed with the SEC before deciding to invest in shares of FSIC II’s common stock.Because there is no public trading market for shares of FSIC II’s common stock and FSIC II is not obligated to effectuate a liquidity event by a specified date, if at all, it is unlikely that you will be able to sell your shares. While FSIC II intends to conduct quarterly tender offers for its shares, only a limited number of shares will be eligible for repurchase and FSIC II may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time.FSIC II’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to FSIC II for investment. Any capital returned to stockholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses.An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies.Investing in middle market companies involves a number of significant risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on FSIC II’s operating results.A lack of liquidity in certain of FSIC II’s investments may adversely affect its business.FSIC II is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, which may have a substantial negative impact on FSIC II’s investments.FSIC II has borrowed funds to make investments, which increases the volatility of FSIC II’s investments and may increase the risks of investing in our securities.FSIC II is a long-term investment for persons of adequate financial means who have no need for liquidity in their investment.FSIC II’s previous distributions to stockholders were funded in significant part from the reimbursement of certain expenses, including through the waiver of certain investment advisory fees that were subject to repayment to its affiliate, FS Investments. Significant portions of these distributions were not based on FSIC II’s investment performance, and such waivers and reimbursements by FS Investments may not continue in the future. If FS Investments had not agreed to reimburse certain of FSIC II’s expenses, including through the waiver of certain of its advisory fees, significant portions of these distributions would have come from offering proceeds or borrowings. The repayment of amounts owed to FS Investments will reduce the future distributions to which you would otherwise be entitled.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

	FSIC Overview



FS Investment Corporation (NYSE: FSIC) is a publicly traded business development company (BDC) focused on providing customized credit solutions to private middle market U.S. companies.  Investment approach  We seek to invest primarily in the senior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, the subordinated debt of private middle market U.S. companies to achieve the best risk-adjusted returns for our investors. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive or purchase equity interests such as common and preferred stock, warrants or options.  FSIC is differentiated by our flexible investment strategy which allows us to invest across the corporate capital structure and provide diversified exposure across multiple industries. Our core investment strategy is focused on direct originations and opportunistic investments, such as event-driven investments and anchor orders, which we believe allow us to take advantage of market inefficiencies. In certain circumstances we may also opportunistically invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield bond markets. Managers  FSIC is advised by FB Income Advisor, LLC, an affiliate of FS Investments, a leading manager of debt-focused alternative investment funds, and sub-advised by GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC, an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners, the credit platform of Blackstone. With approximately $93 billion in assets under management as of March 31, 2017, GSO Capital Partners is one of the world’s largest credit-oriented alternative asset managers with approximately 345 employees in New York, London, Dublin and Houston. We seek to leverage our size and resources with GSO’s global brand, underwriting capabilities, network of relationships and origination platform to maximize returns and preserve capital.  Since FSIC’s inception in January 2009, it has grown to become one of the largest BDCs in the market. As of March 31, 2017, FSIC had approximately $4.3 billion in assets under management and investments in 108 portfolio companies across 16 industries.  FS Investments is the largest sponsor of BDC assets with approximately $18.3 billion in BDC assets under management as of March 31, 2017.
