Information on the subsequent performance pages relating to the GE S&S Program  
Mutual Fund and GE S&S Income Fund (each a "Fund" and collectively the "Funds") 
one year total return is audited, all other information, including the portfolio
manager Q&A pages, is unaudited.                                                

Total returns take into account changes in share price and assume reinvestment  
of all dividends and capital gains distributions, if any.                       

The performance data quoted represent past performance; past performance does   
not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will        
fluctuate so your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their   
original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance  
data quoted. Please call 800-242-0134 for the most recent month-end performance 
data.

The Standard & Poor's ("S&P") 500(R) Index of stocks (S&P 500 Index) and the    
Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index (LB Aggregate Bond Index) are unmanaged    
indices and do not reflect the actual cost of investing in the instruments that 
comprise each index. S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged, market                      
capitalization-weighted index of stocks of 500 large U.S. companies, which is   
widely used as a measure of large-cap stock market performance. LB Aggregate    
Bond Index is a market value-weighted index of taxable investment-grade debt    
issues, including government, corporate, asset-backed and mortgage-backed       
securities, with maturities of one year or more. This index is designed to      
represent the performance of the U.S. investment-grade first-rate bond market.  
The results shown for the foregoing indices assume the reinvestment of net      
dividends or interest and are unaudited.                                        

The peer universe of funds used in our peer ranking calculation is based on the 
blend of Lipper peer categories, as shown. This blend is the same as the        
category blend used by the Wall Street Journal. The actual number of funds and  
numerical rankings in the Lipper and Wall Street Journal universes could differ 
since the Wall Street Journal excludes certain funds, which do not meet their   
net asset or number of shareholder publication thresholds. Lipper is an         
independent mutual fund rating service. A Fund's performance may be compared to 
or ranked within a universe of mutual funds with investment objectives and      
policies similar but not necessarily identical to the Fund's. Such comparisons  
or rankings are made on the basis of several factors, including the Fund's      
objectives and policies, management style and strategy, and portfolio           
composition, and may change over time if any of those factors change.

                                                                             Q&A

Q.  HOW DID THE GE S&S PROGRAM MUTUAL FUND PERFORM COMPARED TO ITS BENCHMARK    
  AND LIPPER PEER GROUP FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007?

A.  For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2007, the GE S&S Program     
Mutual Fund returned 8.53%. The S&P 500 Index, the Fund's benchmark,    
   returned 5.50% and the Fund's Lipper peer group of 835 Large-Cap Core funds
returned an average of 5.73% for the same period.                       

Q.  WHAT MARKET CONDITIONS IMPACTED FUND PERFORMANCE?                           

A.  In the first half of the year, stocks rallied due to strong corporate       
   earnings, record M&A activity, cooling inflation worries and in the absence
 of Fed tightening. The market's climb was interrupted by global liquidity
    concerns in February, and again in late June and July of 2007, amid a credit
crunch brought about by rising sub-prime mortgage defaults. However,    
accommodative actions by the Fed in late summer/early fall propelled the
markets higher, and the S&P 500 reached a record high of 1,565 in early 
    October as Fed remarks allayed investor concerns that the economy was headed
    for recession. However, stocks pulled back sharply during the balance of the
    fourth quarter, reflecting investor concerns over the economic impact of the
housing- and credit-market turmoil and record-high oil prices. In this  
   environment, the growth style of investing outperformed the value style for
   the first time in seven years. Large caps also outperformed small, as these
    higher-quality companies are better able to sustain earnings growth during a
significant economic slowdown.                                          

    Eight out of ten S&P 500 sectors had positive returns, and each of these was
in the double-digits, led by sectors tilted toward global infrastructure
investment and booming commodity prices, including energy (+35%) and    
  materials (+23%). Utilities (+20%) were a good place to be, and technology
 (+16%) showed strength as the sector's high proportion of non-US revenues
 promised some insulation from a slowing domestic economy. The two sectors
    that lagged brought the index return down into the mid-single digits, as the
S&P 500 returned +5.5% for the year. Financials (-19%) lagged the most, 
facing credit cycle headwinds and broken balance sheets. Consumer       
 discretionary (-13%) also lagged the broad market as the recession debate
increased.                                                              

Q.  WHAT WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF FUND PERFORMANCE?                          

A.  The Fund's preference for large, high quality companies paid off in a year  
 where stock market volatility increased. Underweighting financials -- the
S&P 500's worst performing sector -- was the Fund's primary driver of   
outperformance. Underweighting commercial banks and consumer finance    
companies, as well as focusing on State Street (+22%) within the capital
  markets industry, provided key downside protection. Strong stock selection
in the materials, industrials and energy sectors also drove gains. While
    these sectors have been buoyed by robust investment in developing economies,
  the Fund has owned some the top performers, including Hess (+105%), global
oil services giants Transocean (+67%) and Schlumberger (+57%), aerospace
leader Textron (+54%) and agricultural                                  

                                                                               3

                                                                             Q&A

  bioengineering company Monsanto (+115%). Defensive consumer staples stocks
    also benefited the Fund against the backdrop of a slowing U.S. economy, with
large cap multinationals like Pepsi (+24%) and Procter & Gamble (+17%)  
boosting returns.                                                       

Partially offsetting the Fund's broad-based strength were negative      
contributions from healthcare and telecommunications. Most notable was a
   pullback in Amgen (-32%), which suffered amid safety concerns regarding its
  anemia drugs and increased FDA scrutiny. However, we continued to like the
strength in Amgen's pipeline of biotech products, and its long-term     
  prospects. Our continued underweight in telecommunications was another key
detractor. While we have been adding to our position in AT&T (+21%), our
  underweight versus the benchmark hampered returns, as did the lag in Latin
wireless provider, NII Holdings (-38%). We continued to believe that the
  cable companies would be more successful taking share from phone companies
    rather than vice versa, hence our larger relative weighting in media, taking
a long-term view. Unfortunately, disappointing results at cable giant,  
Comcast (-35%) detracted from relative performance this year.           

Q.  WERE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE FUND OVER THE PERIOD?             

A.  There were no significant changes to the Fund during the year, as we have   
remained committed to investing in high quality large-cap stocks with   
    predictable and steady earnings growth at compelling valuations. We continue
  to be relatively defensively positioned, although at year-end, our largest
  overweight was in technology -- an area that we believe could benefit from
multiple expansion in the months to come due to the large international 
    component of tech earnings, and its above average growth prospects. Overall,
   our tech holdings tend not to be the most economically sensitive, with high
  recurring revenues and ample free cash flow. We added to our overweight in
consumer staples and materials during the period. We also capitalized on
 strength in the energy and utilities sectors to take some profits, and we
 reduced our overweight in healthcare due to some increased uncertainty in
the risk landscape.                                                     

    The U.S. has experienced economic growth that we believe was below potential
in 2007, and earnings growth has slowed. We are constructive on our     
    positioning in this environment and the high quality of our holdings. We had
   expected the companies in the Fund's portfolio to demonstrate the financial
   flexibility and balance sheet strength to weather a mid-cycle slowdown, and
 to be bolstered by a flight to quality in skittish markets. Valuations of
larger, high-quality companies sold at little or no premium in the past 
year. We believe that many of our stock selections will benefit from    
improving valuations and superior relative earnings growth. In addition,
    many of our multinationals will likely benefit from strong growth outside of
North America. We remain focused on a long-term investment horizon and  
 continue to utilize a bottom-up, research-driven, fundamental approach to
stock selection.

                                              Understanding Your Fund's Expenses

As a shareholder of the Fund you incur ongoing expenses, which include portfolio
management fees, professional fees, administrative fees and other Fund expenses.
The following example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in 
dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing   
costs of investing in other mutual funds.                                       

To illustrate these ongoing costs, we have provided an example and calculated   
the expenses paid by investors in each share class of the Fund during the       
period. The information in the following table is based on an investment of     
$1,000, which is invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire
six-month period ended December 31, 2007.                                       

ACTUAL EXPENSES                                                                 

The first section of the table provides information about actual account values 
and actual expenses. You may use the information in this section, together with 
the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period.
To do so, simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600    
account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number  
given for your class under the heading "Expenses Paid During Period."
HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES                                    

The second section of the table provides information about hypothetical account 
values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and an
assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Fund's  
actual return. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of     
investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical   
example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholders       
reports of other funds.                                                         

Please note that the expenses shown in the table do not reflect any transaction 
costs, such as sales charges or redemption fees.

Q.  HOW DID THE GE S&S INCOME FUND PERFORM COMPARED TO ITS BENCHMARK AND LIPPER 
PEER GROUP FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007?         

A.  For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2007, the GE S&S Income Fund 
returned 6.03%. The Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, the Fund's    
benchmark, returned 6.97% and the Fund's Lipper peer group of 547       
 Intermediate Investment Grade Debt Funds returned an average of 4.71% for
the same period.                                                        

Q.  DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE U.S. ECONOMY DURING THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD   
ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2007.                                               

A.  The U.S. economy will most likely post a GDP growth of approximately 2% in  
2007, held back by recessionary conditions in the housing market. Rising
delinquencies and defaults in sub-prime mortgage loans resulted in large
pricing dislocations of securities backed by these loan types. In the   
fallout, Wall Street broker/dealers were forced in the third and fourth 
   quarters to take write-downs in the billions from owning such securities as
   well as structured vehicles backed by these security types. Investor's lack
of confidence in valuations of sub-prime mortgages spread to all risky  
 assets, significantly widening yield spreads in high grade and high yield
  credit and emerging market debt. A flight to the safety of U.S. treasuries
pushed interest rates down, which generated a 9% total return for the   
 treasury sector. By year-end, 2 and 10-year note yields had fallen by 176
  and 68 bps to finish at 3.05% and 4.02% respectively. All other U.S. fixed
  income sectors posted positive returns for the year, but less than that of
  treasuries. The Fed responded to the housing recession/sub-prime crisis by
reducing the fed funds target by 100 basis points to 4.25% starting in  
September, while also injecting reserves into the financial system to   
   provide liquidity to banks unwilling to lend to each other. At the December
   meeting, the FOMC stated "the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the
downside risks to growth". However, market pricing at year-end indicated
further rate cuts in 2008.                                              

Q.  WHAT WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF                                            
FUND PERFORMANCE?                                                       

A.  Duration and yield curve positioning biased toward lower rates and a steeper
   yield curve were positive contributors to Fund performance during the year.
The underweight to investment grade corporate securities also added to  
    relative performance. Although allocations to high yield and emerging market
   debt helped earlier in the year, exposure to these sectors hurt performance
    in the final quarter as yield spreads widened quite dramatically. The Fund's
exposure to sub-prime related securities through securities lending and 
mortgage-rolls negatively impacted total return for the year.           

                                                                              11

                                              Understanding Your Fund's Expenses

As a shareholder of the Fund you incur ongoing expenses, which include portfolio
management fees, professional fees, administrative fees and other Fund expenses.
The following example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in 
dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing   
costs of investing in other mutual funds.                                       

To illustrate these ongoing costs, we have provided an example and calculated   
the expenses paid by investors in each share class of the Fund during the       
period. The information in the following table is based on an investment of     
$1,000, which is invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire
six-month period ended December 31, 2007.                                       

ACTUAL EXPENSES                                                                 

The first section of the table provides information about actual account values 
and actual expenses. You may use the information in this section, together with 
the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period.
To do so, simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600    
account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number  
given for your class under the heading "Expenses Paid During Period."
HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES                                    

The second section of the table provides information about hypothetical account 
values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and an
assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Fund's  
actual return. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of     
investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical   
example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholders       
reports of other funds.                                                         

Please note that the expenses shown in the table do not reflect any transaction 
costs, such as sales charges or redemption fees.

* The financial statement figure presented above for Short-Term Investments     
includes collateral received from transactions such as loans of portfolio   
 securities and amounts held pending settlement of securities transactions. In
 evaluating the Fund's net cash level, portfolio management takes into account
certain of the Fund's liabilities in excess of other assets, such as        
liabilities associated with loans of portfolio securities and securities    
pending settlement, and equitized cash. The Fund's net cash level is not    
expected to exceed 5%.

1.   ORGANIZATION OF THE FUNDS                                                  

The GE S&S Program Mutual Fund and GE S&S Income Fund are registered under the  
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the "1940 Act") as open-end        
management investment companies. The Funds are two of the investment options    
offered under the GE Savings & Security Program (the "Program"). The Program,   
through a trust, owns 63% of the GE S&S Program Mutual Fund and 69% of the GE   
S&S Income Fund. The Funds operate as Employees' Securities Companies (as       
defined in the 1940 Act) and as such are exempt from certain provisions of the  
1940 Act.                                                                       

GE Asset Management Incorporated (GEAM) is the Funds' investment adviser and a  
wholly-owned subsidiary of General Electric Company.                            

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally       
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and        
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and      
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial    
statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets    
from operations during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from     
those estimates.                                                                

The following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the Funds:      

SECURITY VALUATION AND TRANSACTIONS                                             

A Fund's portfolio securities are valued generally on the basis of market       
quotations. Equity securities generally are valued at the last reported sales   
price on the primary market in which they are traded. Portfolio securities      
listed on NASDAQ are valued using the NASDAQ Official Closing Price, which may  
not necessarily represent the last sale price. If no sales occurred on the      
exchange or NASDAQ that day, the portfolio security generally is valued using   
the last reported bid price.                                                    

Debt securities (other than short-term securities described below) generally are
valued at an evaluated bid as reported by an independent pricing service. Values
obtained from pricing services are based on various factors such as market      
transactions, dealer supplied valuations, security characteristics and other    
market data. In the absence of a reliable price from such a pricing service,    
debt securities may be valued based on dealer supplied valuations or quotations.
Short-term investments with remaining maturities of sixty days or less at the   
time of purchase are valued on the basis of amortized costs.                    

All assets and liabilities of the Funds initially expressed in foreign currency 
values will be converted into U.S. dollars at the WM exchange rate computed at  
11:00 a.m., Eastern time.                                                       

If prices are not readily available for a portfolio security, or if it is       
believed that a price for a portfolio security does not represent its fair      
value, the security may be valued using procedures approved by the Funds' Board 
of Trustees that are designed to establish its "fair" value. Those procedures   
require that the fair value of a security be established by the fair valuation  
committee. The fair valuation committee follows different protocols for         
different types of investments and circumstances. The fair value procedures may 
be used to value any investment by any Fund in the appropriate circumstances.   
Examples of the types of securities that may be fair valued include: thinly     
traded or illiquid investments, high-yield securities or foreign securities.    

Foreign securities may be valued with the assistance of an independent fair     
value pricing service in circumstances where it is believed that                

                                                                              33

they have been or would be materially affected by events occurring after the    
close of the portfolio security's primary market and before the close of regular
trading on the NYSE. This independent fair value pricing service uses a         
computerized system to appraise affected securities and portfolios taking into  
consideration various factors and the fair value of such securities may be      
something other than the last available quotation or other market price.        

GEAM may also separately monitor portfolio securities and, consistent with the  
Funds' fair value procedures, apply a different value to a portfolio security   
than would be applied had it been priced using market quotations or by an       
independent fair value pricing service.                                         

Determining the fair value of securities involves the application of both       
subjective and objective considerations. Security values may differ depending on
the methodology used to determine their values, and may differ from the last    
quoted sale or closing price. No assurance can be given that use of these fair  
value procedures will always better represent the price at which a Fund could   
sell the affected portfolio security.                                           

Security transactions are accounted for as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments sold are recorded on the basis of identified cost for both
financial statement and federal tax purposes.                                   

In September 2006, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  
157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ("FAS 157"). FAS 157 establishes a single          
authoritative definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring   
fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157       
applies to fair value measurements already required or permitted by existing    
standards. The change to current generally accepted accounting principles from  
the application of FAS 157 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods  
used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value       
measurements. Management of the GE S&S Program Mutual Fund and the GE S&S Income
Fund does not believe the adoption of FAS 157 will materially impact the        
financial statement amounts, however, additional disclosures may be required    
about the inputs used to develop the measurements and the effect of certain of  
the measurements on changes in net assets for the period. FAS 157 is effective  
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years.                             

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS                                                           

Each of the Funds may engage in repurchase agreement transaction with respect to
instruments that are consistent with the Fund's investment objectives or        
policies. The Funds' custodian takes possession of the collateral pledged for   
investments in repurchase agreements on behalf of the Funds. The Funds value the
underlying collateral daily on a mark-to-market basis to determine that the     
value, including accrued interest, is at least equal to 102% of the repurchase  
price. In the event the seller defaults and the value of the security declines, 
or if the seller enters an insolvency proceeding, realization of the collateral 
by the Funds may be delayed or limited.                                         

SECURITY LENDING                                                                

Each of the Funds may loan securities to brokers, dealers, and financial        
institutions determined by GEAM to be creditworthy, subject to certain          
limitations. The Funds continue to receive the interest and dividends on the    
loaned securities during the term of the loan. The loans of securities are      
secured by collateral in the form of cash or other liquid assets, which are     
segregated and maintained with the custodian in an amount at least equal to 102%

34

of the current market value of the loaned securities. During the term of the    
loan, the Funds will record any gain or loss in the market value of its loaned  
securities and of securities in which cash collateral is invested. A Fund will  
also earn interest, net of any rebate, from securities in which cash collateral 
is invested. In the event the counterparty (borrower) does not meet its         
contracted obligation to return the securities, the Funds may be exposed to the 
risk of loss of reacquiring the loaned securities at prevailing market prices   
using the proceeds of the sale of the collateral.                               

SECURITY LENDING PROGRAM GEAM administers the security lending program for the  
GE S&S Income. The security lending fee is based on the number and duration of  
lending transactions. The participation by the GE S&S Program Mutual Fund in the
securities lending program administered by the State Street Bank and Trust      
Company was effectively terminated on September 21, 2007.                       

FOREIGN CURRENCY                                                                

Accounting records of the Funds are maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment      
securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency   
are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing rates of exchange on a daily 
basis (on days the New York Stock Exchange is open). Purchases and sales of     
securities, income receipts and expense payments denominated in foreign         
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate on  
the respective dates of such transactions.                                      

The Funds do not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting    
from changes in foreign exchange rates from the fluctuations arising from       
changes in market prices of securities during the year. Such fluctuations are   
included in net realized or unrealized gain or loss from investments. Net       
realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions represent net gains or
losses on sales and maturities of foreign currency contracts, disposition of    
foreign currencies, the difference between the amount of net investment income  
and withholding taxes accrued and the U.S. dollar amount actually received and  
paid, and gains or losses between the trade and settlement date on purchases and
sales of securities. Net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arising   
from changes in the value of other assets and liabilities as a result of changes
in foreign exchange rates are included as increases or decreases in unrealized  
appreciation/depreciation on foreign currency related transactions.             

FUTURES CONTRACTS 

The GE S&S Income Fund may invest in futures contracts subject to certain       
limitations. The Fund may invest in futures contracts to manage its exposure to 
the stock and bond markets and fluctuations in currency values. Buying futures  
tends to increase a Fund's exposure to the underlying instrument while selling  
futures tends to decrease a Fund's exposure to the underlying instrument, or    
hedge other Fund investments. The Fund will not enter into a transaction        
involving futures for speculative purposes. The Fund's risks in using these     
contracts include changes in the value of the underlying instruments,           
non-performance of the counterparties under the contracts' terms and changes in 
the liquidity of the secondary market for the contracts. Futures contracts are  
valued at the settlement price established each day by the board of trade or    
exchange on which they principally trade.                                       

Upon entering into a financial futures contract, the Fund is required to pledge 
to the broker an amount of cash and/or other assets equal to a certain          
percentage of the contract amount, known as initial margin deposit. Subsequent  
payments, known as variation margin, are made or received                       

                                                                              35

by the Fund each day, depending on the daily fluctuation in the fair value of   
the underlying security. The Fund records an unrealized gain or loss equal to   
the daily variation margin. Should market conditions move unexpectedly, the Fund
may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the futures contracts and may incur 
a loss. The Fund recognizes a realized gain or loss on the expiration or closing
of a futures contract.                                                          

OPTIONS                                                                         

The GE S&S Income Fund may purchase and write options, subject to certain       
limitations. The Fund may invest in options contracts to manage its exposure to 
the stock and bond markets and fluctuations in foreign currency values. Writing 
puts and buying calls tend to increase a Fund's exposure to the underlying      
instrument while buying puts and writing calls tend to decrease a Fund's        
exposure to the underlying instrument, or hedge other Fund investments. The Fund
will not enter into a transaction involving options for speculative purposes.   
The Fund's risks in using these contracts include changes in the value of the   
underlying instruments, non-performance of the counterparties under the         
contracts' terms and changes in the liquidity of the secondary market for the   
contracts. Options are valued at the last sale price, or if no sales occurred on
that day, at the last quoted bid price.                                         

When a Fund writes an option, the amount of the premium received is recorded as 
a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current fair value of the option
written. Premiums received from writing options that expire unexercised are     
treated by the Funds on the expiration date as realized gains from investments. 
The difference between the premium and the amount paid on effecting a closing   
purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is also treated as a     
realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid for the closing   
purchase, as a realized loss. When an option is exercised, the proceeds from the
sale of the underlying security or the cost basis of the securities purchased is
adjusted by the original premium received or paid.                              

SWAP CONTRACTS 

As part of its investment strategy, the GE S&S Income Fund may invest in swap   
agreements which are agreements to exchange the return generated by one         
instrument for the return generated by another instrument. Total return swap    
agreements involve commitments to pay interest in exchange for a market linked  
return based upon a notional principal amount. To the extent the total return of
the security or index underlying the agreement exceeds or falls short of the    
offsetting interest rate obligation, the Fund will receive a payment from or    
make a payment to the counterparty. Swaps are marked to market daily based upon 
the underlying security or index. Payments received or made are recorded as     
realized gain or loss in the Statement of Operations. Entering into swap        
agreements involves, to varying degrees, elements of credit and market risk in  
excess of the amounts recognized on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.    
Such risks involve the possibility that there will be no liquid market for these
agreements, that the counterparty to the agreements may default on its          
obligation to perform and that there may be unfavorable changes in the value of 
the index or securities underlying the agreement. Notional principal amounts are
used to express the extent of involvement in these transactions, but the amounts
potentially subject to credit risk are much smaller.                            

WHEN-ISSUED SECURITIES AND FORWARD COMMITMENTS                                  

Each of the Funds may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued or forward   
commitment basis. These transactions are arrangements in which the Funds        

36

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

purchase and sell securities with payment and delivery scheduled a month or more
after entering into the transactions. The price of the underlying securities and
the date when these securities will be delivered and paid for are fixed at the  
time the transaction is negotiated. Losses may arise due to changes in the      
market value of the underlying securities or if the counterparty does not       
perform under the contract. In connection with such purchases, the Funds        
maintain cash or liquid assets in an amount equal to purchase commitments for   
such underlying securities until settlement date and for sales commitments the  
Funds maintain equivalent deliverable securities as "cover" for the transaction.
Unsettled commitments are valued at the current market value of the underlying  
security. Daily fluctuations in the value of such contracts are recorded as     
unrealized gains or losses. The Funds will not enter into such commitments for  
the purpose of investment leverage.                                             

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS 

The GE S&S Income Fund may enter into forward foreign currency exchange         
contracts to facilitate transactions in foreign denominated securities and to   
manage the Fund's currency exposure. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts
are valued at the mean between the bid and the offered forward rates as last    
quoted by a recognized dealer. The aggregate principal amounts of the contracts 
are not recorded in the Fund's financial statements. Such amounts appear under  
the caption forward foreign currency contracts in the Schedule of Investments.  
Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of     
Assets and Liabilities as an asset (or liability) and in the Statement of       
Operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the contracts are    
closed, when they are recorded as realized gains or losses on foreign currency  
related transactions. The Fund's risks in using these contracts include changes 
in the value of foreign currency or the possibility that the counterparties do  
not perform under the contracts' terms. When a Fund enters into a forward       
foreign currency exchange contract, it is required to segregate cash or liquid  
securities with its custodian in an amount equal to the value of the Fund's     
total assets committed to the consummation of the forward contract. If the value
of the segregated securities declines, additional cash or securities is         
segregated so that the value of the account will equal the amount of the Fund's 
commitment with respect to the contract.                                        

INCOME TAXES

The Funds intend to comply with all sections of the Internal Revenue Code       
applicable to regulated investment companies including the distribution of      
substantially all of their taxable net investment income and net realized       
capital gains to their shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income 
tax has been made. Each Fund is treated as a separate taxpayer for federal      
income tax purposes.

As of December 31, 2007, the following Funds have capital loss carryovers as    
indicated below. The capital loss carryover is available to offset future       
realized capital gains to the extent provided in the Internal Revenue Code and  
regulations thereunder. To the extent that these carryover losses are used to   
offset future capital gains, it is probable that the gains so offset will not be
distributed to shareholders because they would be taxable as ordinary income.

During the year ended December 31, 2007 S&S Income Fund utilized capital loss   
carryovers in the amount of $6,665.                                             

Any net capital and currency losses incurred after October 31, within each      
Fund's tax year, are deemed to arise on the first day of the Fund's next tax    
year if the Fund so elects to defer such losses.                                

The Funds elected to defer losses incurred after October 31, 2007 as follows:

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS                                                   

GE S&S Income Fund declares investment income dividends daily and pays them     
monthly. The GE S&S Program Mutual Fund declares and pays dividends from        
investment income annually. The Funds declare and pay net realized capital gains
in excess of capital loss carryforwards distributions annually. The character of
income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax  
regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.     
These differences include (but are not limited to) treatment of realized gains  
and losses on foreign currency contracts, futures and losses deferred due to    
wash sale transactions. Reclassifications are made to the Funds' capital        
accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or available   
capital loss carryovers) under income tax regulations. These reclassifications  
have no impact on net investment income, realized gains or losses,

On June 29, 2007, the Fund adopted FIN48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income 
Taxes." FIN48 provides guidance for how certain uncertain tax positions should  
be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements.   
FIN48 requires evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the 
course of preparing the Fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax         
positions are "more likely than not" of being sustained by the applicable tax   
authority. The adoption of FIN48 did not have an impact on the Fund's net assets
and financial statements. The Funds' 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 calendar years   
tax returns are still open to examination by the Federal and applicable state   
tax authorities.

Corporate actions (including cash dividends) are recorded on the ex-dividend    
date, net of applicable withholding taxes, except for certain foreign corporate 
actions, which are recorded as soon after ex-dividend date as such information  
becomes available. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All        
discounts and premiums on bonds are accreted and amortized, respectively, to    
call or maturity date, whichever is shorter, using the effective yield method.  

EXPENSES                                                                        

Expenses of the Funds which are directly identifiable to a specific Fund are    
allocated to that Fund. Expenses which are not directly identifiable to a       
specific Fund are allocated in such a manner as deemed equitable, taking into   
consideration the nature and type of expense and the relative sizes of the      
Funds. All expenses of the Funds are paid by GEAM, and reimbursed by the Funds. 

3.   LINE OF CREDIT                                                             

The Funds share a revolving credit facility of up to $25 million with a number  
of its affiliates. The credit facility is with its custodian bank, State Street 
Bank and Trust Company. The revolving credit facility requires the payment of a 
commitment fee equal to 0.09% per annum on the daily unused portion of the      
credit facility, payable quarterly. The portion borne by the Funds generally is 
borne proportionally based upon net assets. In addition, the Trust has a $100   
million uncommitted, unsecured line of credit with State Street, which was      
established on November 7, 2007. Generally, borrowings under the credit         
facilities would accrue interest at the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points 
and would be borne by the borrowing Fund. The maximum amount allowed to be      
borrowed by any one Fund is the lesser of (i) its prospectus limitation or (ii) 
20% of its net assets. The credit facilities were not utilized by the Trust     
during the period ended December 31, 2007.

ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES                                            

During 2007, the Funds incurred expenses for the cost of services rendered by   
GEAM as investment adviser and for services GEAM rendered as shareholder        
servicing agent. These expenses are included as advisory and administration     
expenses

Public Accounting Firm
KPMG                                                                            
THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES                                          
GE S&S FUNDS                                                                    

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of the GE 
S&S Program Mutual Fund and GE S&S Income Fund, each a series of GE S&S Funds   
(collectively, the "Funds"), including the schedules of investments, as of      
December 31, 2007, and the related statements of operations for the year then   
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the years in the     
two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the years  
in the five-year period then ended. These financial statements and financial    
highlights are the responsibility of the Funds' management. Our responsibility  
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights 
based on our audits.                                                            

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company  
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2007 by correspondence with the custodian   
and brokers, or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from     
brokers were not received. An audit also includes assessing the accounting      
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as        
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our    
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                              

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the GE
S&S Program Mutual Fund and GE S&S Income Fund as of December 31, 2007, the     
results of their operations, changes in their net assets and financial          
highlights for the years described above, in conformity with U.S. generally     
accepted accounting principles.

Advisory Agreement Renewal, unaudited                                           
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Board of Trustees of each Fund considered and unanimously approved the      
continuance of the investment advisory agreements with GE Asset Management      
Incorporated ("GEAM") at a meeting held on December 19, 2007.                   

In considering whether to approve the Funds' investment advisory agreements, the
Board members considered and discussed a substantial amount of information and  
analysis provided, at the Board's request, by GEAM personnel.                   
The Board members also considered detailed information regarding performance and
expenses of other investment companies, including those with similar investment 
objectives and sizes, which was prepared by an independent third party provider,
Lipper Inc. ("Lipper"). The Board members reviewed the fees charged by GEAM for 
other mutual funds and investment products other than mutual funds that employ  
the same investment strategies as the Funds. The Board members also reviewed    
materials discussing the legal standards for the consideration of the proposed  
continuances.                                                                   

In connection with their approval of the Funds' investment advisory agreements, 
the Board members received and considered memoranda prepared by GEAM personnel  
that set forth detailed information, including substantial exhibits and other   
materials related to GEAM's business and the services it provides to each Fund. 
The Board members reviewed and discussed the proposed continuance of the        
agreements with GEAM personnel, including representatives from the legal,       
compliance and finance departments, senior members of each relevant investment  
group (e.g., equity, fixed income) and research personnel. The Board members    
also heard presentations by these representatives, and posed questions and      
engaged in substantive discussions with them concerning the Funds' operations   
and the investment process employed for each Fund. The Board members took into  
account that many of them possess multi-year experience as Board members and    
that all of them possess a great deal of knowledge about GEAM and the Funds in  
their capacities as senior officers of GEAM. They also took into account their  
consideration of these agreements in recent years, noting that the information  
they received was presented in a similar manner and format.                     

In reaching their determinations relating to continuance of the Funds'          
investment advisory agreements, the Board members considered all factors they   
believed relevant, including the factors discussed below. In their              
deliberations, the Board members did not identify any particular information    
that was all-important or controlling, and each Board member attributed         
different weights to the various factors. The Board members evaluated this      
information, and all other information available to them, for each Fund         
separately, and their determinations were made separately in respect of each    
Fund. In particular, the Board members focused on the following with respect to 
each Fund:                                                                      

THE NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES PROVIDED.                            

The Board members reviewed the services provided by GEAM and concurred that GEAM
provides high quality advisory and administrative services to the Funds. In     
connection with their consideration of GEAM's services, the Board members       
focused on the favorable attributes of GEAM, including (i) an investment        
philosophy oriented toward long-term performance; (ii) effective processes used 
for selecting investments, selecting brokers and with respect to Fund           
administration, controllership and compliance activities; (iii) highly skilled  
professionals, including analysts, research professionals and portfolio managers
with a depth of experience involving the types of Funds they oversee; (iv)      
access to significant technological resources from which the Funds may benefit; 
and (v) a favorable history and                                                 

                                                                              43

reputation. The Board members discussed the personnel changes made, and proposed
to be made, by GEAM. The Board members noted that each Fund represents only a   
small amount of the overall assets managed by GEAM, but benefits from a full    
array of services and resources provided by GEAM. In particular, the Board      
members discussed that the Funds benefit from a large staff of research analysts
employed by GEAM.                                                               

In light of the foregoing, the Board members concluded that the services        
provided by GEAM were of a high quality and had benefited the Funds.            

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE FUNDS.                                            

The Board members considered the investment performance of the Funds for various
periods. The Board members reviewed detailed comparisons of the performance of  
the Funds with the relevant securities indexes and peer groupings of mutual     
funds prepared by Lipper with respect to various periods. The Board members also
engaged in discussions regarding the investment process for each Fund, the      
portfolio management and supporting research personnel, the investment style and
approach employed for each Fund, the likely market cycles for the investment    
style, and, in some instances, relative underperformance in certain periods in  
light of GEAM's commitment to long-term satisfactory performance with respect to
each Fund's investment objective and investment approach. The Board members     
concluded that the Funds' performance was acceptable overall taking into        
consideration the factors discussed above.                                      

COST OF THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO THE FUNDS.                               

The Board members considered the cost of the services provided by GEAM. The     
Board members noted that, under each investment advisory agreement, GEAM is     
reimbursed for its reasonable costs incurred in providing the services          
contemplated by the agreement and for the reasonable costs incurred by its      
affiliate, GE Investment Distributors, Inc. ("GEID"), in providing services     
specified in its agreement with the Funds as unitholder servicing agent. The    
Board members considered that the charges resulting from this arrangement       
involve all of the expenses incurred by GEAM and GEID with respect to the       
management and unitholder operations of the Funds, including, without           
limitation, indirect allocable overhead costs and the direct and indirect costs 
of GEAM and GEID personnel providing investment management and other services to
the Funds. The Board members noted and discussed the additional services        
provided by GEAM to the Funds compared to other investment products managed by  
GEAM and the charges that result from those services. The Board members also    
noted that none of the charges resulting from the Funds' arrangements with GEAM 
and GEID may include any element of profit.                                     

The Board members reviewed the information they had requested from GEAM         
personnel concerning the underlying assumptions and methods of cost allocation  
used by GEAM in allocating its costs and those of the other Fund service        
providers, including GEID. The Board members also discussed with GEAM personnel 
the basis for their belief that the methods of allocation used were reasonable  
and consistent across GEAM's business.                                          

Based on their review, the Board members concluded that they were satisfied that
the assumptions and methods used in cost allocation and the level of expenses   
incurred by the Funds were not unreasonable or excessive.                       

THE EXTENT TO WHICH ECONOMIES OF SCALE WOULD BE REALIZED FOR THE BENEFIT OF FUND
SHAREHOLDERS AS THE FUNDS GROW.                                                 

The Board members considered the extent to which economies of scale would be    
realized for the benefit of Fund investors as the Funds grow. The Board         

44

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

members recognized the significant benefits to the Funds resulting from their   
arrangement with GEAM, which causes them to bear only the reasonable costs      
incurred by GEAM and GEID, without any element of profit, for the substantial   
services they provide to the Funds. The Board members also recognized the       
benefits to the Funds of being able to leverage a favorable cost structure      
achieved with respect to the Funds' other operating expenses as a result of     
GEAM's large overall base of assets under management and its vendor management  
practices. The Board members reviewed and concurred with information provided by
GEAM personnel, which showed how significant Fund asset growth can reduce a     
Fund's operating expenses.                                                      

COMPARISON OF SERVICES TO BE RENDERED AND COSTS TO BE INCURRED.                 

The Board members discussed the services provided to the Funds by GEAM, and the 
costs incurred by the Funds for those services. The Board members reviewed      
information concerning the Funds' expense ratios, and comparative information   
with respect to similar products.                                               
They discussed that, in all cases, the Funds enjoy expense levels within or     
below the group of lowest cost funds in each peer group comparison. In light of 
this information, the Board members determined that the level of expenses       
incurred was reasonable in relation to the services provided to the Funds.      

FALL-OUT BENEFITS.                                                              

The Board members considered other actual and potential financial benefits that 
GEAM may derive from its relationship with the Funds, including, where          
applicable, soft dollar commission benefits generated through Fund portfolio    
transactions. The Board members noted, however, that the Funds benefit from the 
vast array of resources available through GEAM, and that each Fund represents   
only a small amount of the overall assets managed by GEAM.                      

CONCLUSION.                                                                     

No single factor was determinative to the Board members' decision. Based on     
their discussion and such other matters as were deemed relevant, the Board      
members concluded that the proposed level of cost reimbursement to GEAM and     
projected total expense ratios for the Funds are reasonable in relation to the  
services provided. In view of these facts, the Board members concluded that the 
renewal of each advisory agreement was in the best interests of the Funds and   
their shareholders.                                                             

                                                                              45

(c)     TAX FEES.  There were no fees billed for professional services

(d)     ALL OTHER FEES.   There were no fees billed for products and services

(e)     (1)  AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.              

The Audit Committee of the S&S Funds (the "Funds") Board of                     
Trustees is responsible, among other things, for the appointment,               
compensation and oversight of the work of the Fund's independent                
accountants/auditors (the "Auditor").  As part of this responsibility and       
to ensure that the Auditor's independence is not impaired, the Audit Committee  
(1) pre-approves the audit and non-audit services provided to the Funds by      
the Auditor, and (2) all non-audit services provided to the Funds' investment   
adviser and covered affiliates (as defined in the Audit Committee Charter) that 
provide ongoing services to the Funds if the services directly impact the       
Funds' operations or financial reporting, in accordance with the Audit          
Committee Charter.  Following are excerpts from the Audit Committee Charter     
that sets forth the pre-approval policies and procedures:                       

1.      Selection and Pre-Approval of Auditor and Approval of Fees.             
(i)     The Audit Committee shall pre-approve the selection of the Auditor and  
shall recommend for ratification the selection, retention or termination of the 
Auditor by the full Board, including the independent Trustees/Directors, and,   
in connection therewith, shall evaluate the independence of the Auditor,        
including: (i) an evaluation of whether the Auditor provides any consulting     
services to the Fund's investment adviser and the extent to which the Auditor   
provides non-audit services to the Fund's investment adviser and certain other  
affiliated service providers as defined in Section 2(f) below, which services   
are not subject to the pre-approval requirements set forth in Section 4 below;  
(ii) an evaluation of the extent to which the Auditor has any relationships     
with the Fund or its affiliated persons that are brought to the attention of    
the Audit Committee by the Auditor in accordance with applicable standards of   
the Independence Standards Board ("ISB"), because, in the Auditor's             
professional judgment, such relationships may reasonably be thought to bear     
on the Auditor's independence with respect to the Fund; and (iii) monitoring    
the Auditor's compliance with respect to the rotation requirements for the      
lead and coordinating partners having primary responsibility for the Fund's     
audits and any partner responsible for the reviewing the Fund's audits.         
The Audit Committee shall review the Auditor's specific representations as      
to its independence.                                                            
(b)     The Audit Committee shall pre-approve and review the fees charged by    
the Auditor for audit and non-audit services to be provided to the Fund and     
certain affiliated service providers (as defined in Section 2(f) below) in      
accordance with the pre-approval requirements set forth in Section 4 below.     
The Fund shall provide for appropriate funding, as determined by the Audit      
Committee, to compensate the Auditor for any authorized service provided to     
the Fund.                                                                       
2.      Meetings with the Auditor.   The Audit Committee shall meet with the    
Auditor, including private meetings, prior to the commencement of substantial   
work on the audit and following the conclusion of the audit, as well as such    
other times as the Audit Committee shall deem necessary or appropriate.  The    
Auditor shall report directly to the Audit Committee.  The Auditor shall        
report at least annually, concerning the following and other pertinent matters: 
(a)     to review the arrangements for and scope of the annual audit and any    
special audits;                                                                 
(b)     to provide the Auditor the opportunity to report to the Audit           
Committee, on a timely basis, all critical accounting policies and practices    
to be used;                                                                     
(c)     to discuss any matters of concern relating to the Fund's financial      
statements, including: (i) any adjustments to such statements recommended by    
the Auditor, or other results of said audit(s), and (ii) any alternative        
treatments of financial information within GAAP that have been discussed with   
Fund management, the ramifications of the use of such alternative disclosures   
and treatments, and the treatment preferred by the Auditor;                     
(d)     to provide the Auditor the opportunity to report to the Audit           
Committee, on a timely basis, any material written communication between the    
Auditor and Fund management, such as any management letter or schedule of       
unadjusted differences;                                                         
(e)     to discuss the opinion the Auditor has rendered regarding the Fund's    
financial statements;                                                           
(f)     to report all non-audit services that do not require Audit Committee    
pre-approval and are provided to certain affiliated persons of the Fund,        
including:  (1) the Fund's investment adviser or sub-advisers (but excluding    
any investment sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and     
is overseen by the investment adviser), (2) the Fund's principal underwriter,   
and (3) any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with     
the investment adviser or principal underwriter, that provides "ongoing"        
services to the Funds in accordance with the pre-approval requirements of       
paragraph (c)(7)(i) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (each, a "Covered Affiliate" 
and collectively, "Covered Affiliates");                                        
(g)     to review, in accordance with current standards of ISB, all             
relationships between the Auditor and the Fund or its affiliated persons that,  
in the Auditor's professional judgment, may reasonably be thought to bear       
on its independence, and to confirm, in light of such information, whether      
the Auditor believes, in its professional judgment, that it may properly serve  
as independent accountants/auditors with respect to the Fund;                   
(h)     to consider the Auditor's comments with respect to the Fund's financial 
policies, procedures and internal accounting controls and responses thereto by  
the Fund's officers and Fund management, as well as other personnel;            
(i)     to investigate any improprieties or suspected improprieties in the      
operations of the Fund to the extent necessary or appropriate in light of any   
internal investigations by the Fund's officers and/or by officers or employees  
of the Fund management of such improprieties;                                   
(j)     to receive periodic reports concerning regulatory changes and new       
accounting pronouncements that significantly affect the value of the Fund's     
assets and their financial reporting;                                           
(k)     to report on the Fund's qualification under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code, amounts distributed and reported to shareholders for Federal tax  
purposes and the Fund's tax returns; and                                        
(l)     to provide the Auditor the opportunity to report on any other matter    
that the Auditor deems necessary or appropriate to discuss with the Audit       
Committee.                                                                      
 If the Auditor's report on the above-listed (and other pertinent)
matters is not made in person to the Audit Committee within 60 days following   
the end of the Fund's fiscal year, the Auditor shall deliver a written report   
to the Audit Committee concerning these matters within such 60 day period.      
3.      Change in Accounting Principles.  The Audit Committee shall consider    
the effect upon the Fund of any changes in accounting principles or practices   
proposed by the Auditor or the Fund's officers.                                 
4.      Pre-Approval of Audit Related Services and Permissible Non-Audit        
Services.  The Audit Committee shall pre-approve both audit (including audit,   
review, and attest) services and permissible non-audit services provided to     
the Fund and, if the nature of the engagement relates directly to the           
operations and financial reporting of the Fund, permissible non-audit services  
provided to any Covered Affiliate.                                              

The Audit Committee may determine to delegate the authority to grant            
pre-approvals to one or more Audit Committee members, each acting on behalf     
of the Audit Committee.  In this event, the member of the Audit Committee so    
delegated shall report each delegated pre-approval to the Audit Committee at    
its next regularly scheduled meeting.  The Audit Committee may also adopt and   
follow, in lieu of explicit pre-approval described above, written policies      
and procedures detailed as to the particular service, designed to safeguard     
the continued independence of the Auditor, consistent with the requirements     
of the Act and SEC regulations thereunder.                                      

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the pre-approval requirement concerning          
permissible non-audit services provided to the Fund or any Covered Affiliate    
is waived if:  (1) the aggregate amount of all such non-audit services provided 
constitutes no more than five percent (5%) of the total amount of revenues paid 
to the Auditor by the Fund and the Covered Affiliates during the fiscal year in 
which the services are provided that would have to be pre-approved by the Audit 
Committee, (2) the non-audit services were not recognized as non-audit services 
at the time of the engagement, and (3) such non-audit services are promptly     
brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved by the Audit       
Committee or one or more designated members of the Audit Committee prior to the 
completion of the audit.                                                        

5.      Prohibited Activities of the Auditor.  The Audit Committee shall confirm
with the Auditor that it is not performing contemporaneously (during the audit  
and professional engagement period) non-audit services for the Fund that the    
Audit Committee believes may taint the independence of the Auditor.             
The Auditor will be responsible for informing the Audit Committee of whether it 
believes that a particular non-audit service is permissible or prohibited       
pursuant to applicable regulations and standards.                               

(2)  PERCENTAGE OF SERVICES IN PARAGRAGHS (b) THROUGH (d) APPROVED BY AUDIT     
COMMITTEE.  No fees were charged during 2003 or 2004 for audit related, tax or  
other services as indicated in sections (b) through (d) of this Item.           

(f)     Not applicable.                                                         

(g)     NON-AUDIT FEES.  The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the Auditor     
for services rendered to the Registrant, and rendered to Service Affiliates,    
for the Reporting Periods were $0 in 2006 and $0 in 2007.                       

(h)     AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE. There were no non-audit services rendered to      
Service Affiliates that were not pre-approved.                                  

ITEM 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants

Each data point can be viewed by moving your mouse through the chart. The vertical bars below the chart represent Volume and are color-coded to indicate market activity for the day:  An up day (where the price is greater than the previous price) will show a green bar. A down day (where the price is less than the previous price) will show a red bar. When the price is unchanged compared to the previous price, Volume will show as a blue bar.  On futures charts, the horizontal purple line above the Volume bars represents Open Interest. Technical Charts have the option to create Spread Charts , with the ability to choose from a number of common spreads (such as Corn 1-2, Soybeans Crush, and Wheat Butterfly), or allowing you to enter your own custom spread calculation (supporting all futures, equities, index and forex symbols). Chart Settings A chart form resides below the chart. This is where you can change the symbol, style, time frame, and other chart settings. If you are logged in to your My Barchart account, you will also see a drop-down list for any Chart Templates you've previously saved. Simply select one from the list and the settings on the template will be applied to the current chart. Basic Chart  Bar Type - choose from OHLC Bars, Candlesticks, Hollow Candlesticks, Line or Area Volume On - displays or hides the volume for the symbol. Time Frame - determines the period (Frequency) and amount of data that will be displayed on the chart (Time Period and Start/End Dates).  For Frequency, choose from Intraday, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly. for Commodity Contracts, you may also select a chart for the Contract, Nearest Futures Contract, or a Continuation chart Nearest Futures and Continuation Charts Commodity charts have three additional frequencies for Daily, Weekly and Monthly data: Contract, Nearest, and Continuation.  Daily/Weekly/Monthly Contract will plot prices for that specific contract   Daily/Weekly/Monthly Nearest Futures will use whatever contract was the Nearest Futures contract on the date of the given bar. The Price Box at the top shows the contract that was used to build the corresponding bar Daily/Weekly/Monthly Continuation Chart will always use the same MONTH specified in the chart form to build the given bar. The Price Box at the top shows the contract that was used (in this case, December, or Z)  The information is back-dated to the start of the period, so on a 5-minute chart information in the period dated 12:45 includes all trades between 12:45 and 12:49 inclusive. A trade at 13:00 would be included within the next bar dated 13:00.     A default Time Period is set based on your Frequency setting. For example, an Intraday chart will use a Time Period of 3 Days, while a Daily chart uses a Time Period of 6 Months. You may change the Time Period to increase or decrease the density of the bars displayed on the chart. The longer the time frame, the closer together the individual bars. The shorter the time frame, the more distance between the bars. You may override or further define the Time Period, or generate a historical chart, by entering a Start and End Date for the data. For example, you can get a Daily chart with 6 months of data from one year ago by entering an End Date from one year back.     Display Settings - further define what the chart will look like.  Price Box - when checked, displays a "Data View" window as you mouse-over the chart, showing OHLC for the bar, and all indicator values for the given bar.  Price Scale - when on, scale on the right of the chart shows prices. % Change Scale - when on, scale on the right of the chart shows the percent change from the open. Linear Scale - when on, scaling will calculate the most intelligent scale using the high, the low and a series of acceptable divisors for possible scales. Logarithmic Scale - when on, uses logarithmic scaling instead of the linear scaling.    Spread Chart Spread Charts allow you to choose from a number of common commodity spread chart calculations. You may also create your own custom spread chart by selecting up to three commodity contracts and multipliers, or by entering your own custom spread expression. The calculated results are displayed as a line chart. Expression: shows the calculation used to create the chart. When you select a Common Spread from the drop-down list, or when you create a Futures Spread using the fields on the form, the Expression is built automatically for you.  If you want to create your own custom Expression, you can enter the calculation directly into the Expression field. Valid syntax for an Expression calculation includes the use of addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/) between each leg. Calculations are performed from left to right, unless you change the order of the calculation using parentheses. Examples:  IBM-DELL subtracts the last price of DELL from IBM. 2*IBM+DELL multiplies IBM by two, then adds the price of DELL. 2*DELL/3+IBM multiplies DELL by two, then divides by three, then adds IBM. (2*DELL)/(3+IBM) multiplies DELL by two, then divides the result by the sum of three plus IBM. $DXY-$SPX subtracts the S&P 500 Index from the Dollar Index. ^USDCAD+^CADAUD adds the Canadian Dollar/Australian Dollar to the US Dollar/Canadian Dollar.  Note for Futures Contracts: Barchart's charting application commonly uses the * symbol on futures contracts as a shortcut to specify the month. For example, ZC*1 will return the front month, ZC*2 returns the second month out, ZC*3 returns the third month out, etc. When creating a custom expression using futures contracts, you must use parentheses to group the order of the calculation in the expression:  (ZC*1+ZC*2+ZC*3)/3 will add the front, second and third months for Corn, then divide the result by three. (ZCZ0+ZCH11+ZCK11)/3 will add December 2010 Corn, March 2011 Corn and May 2011 Corn together, then divide the results by three. (ZC*1)*2+(ZC*3)*2 will multiply the front month for Corn by 2, then add the result to the (third month out for Corn multiplied by two). ZC*2*4 will take the second month out for Corn and multiply the price by 4.   Common Spreads: choose from a number of common commodity spreads. (the expression will be displayed once you've made a selection from the list.)  Create a Futures Spread: select up to three different commodities, including the month, year, multiplier and function (+ - / *) between the second and third leg. The expression will be built and displayed in the Expression field as you enter the different legs of the spread.   Comparison Chart  Select up to three symbols to compare against. This will generate a chart with the price data of the symbols overlayed. To produce a chart of percent changes between symbols, check the Percent Change box. The colors of the boxes (green, purple, red) indicate the color of the line that will be drawn on the chart for the symbol. You may also indicate whether to display that symbol's price scale on the left side of the chart (by default, prices will all display on the right side). Studies / Parameters Select the indicators you wish to add to the chart. To remove an indicator, click the red "delete" icon. To change an indicator's parameters, click on the indicator name.

Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."                                  Add Data Columns to this Table Learn about our Custom Views   Want to use this as  your default charts setting?
