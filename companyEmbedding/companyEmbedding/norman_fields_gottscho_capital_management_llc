Capital Management - Norman Fields, Gottscho | New York




































							We believe the key to investment performance is what a company will sell next year and going forward, and whether the business will earn money from those sales. 
							We build a close relationship with our clients and their families to understand their investment objectives.  Our goal is to manage clients� wealth so that it truly serves their lives for generations to come.
						






								There are two times in a man�s life when he should not speculate � when he can�t afford it, and when he can.|
								The best performance is produced by a person, not a committee.|
								The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting.|
								I skate to where the puck is going, not to where it has been.|
								There is nothing sinister in so arranging one�s affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible.|
								Rule No. 1 Never Lose Money.  Rule No. 2:  Never Forget Rule No. 1.|
								I never buy at the bottom, and I always sell too soon.|
								In my whole life, I have known no wise people � who didn�t read all the time � none, zero.|
								You don�t need to know a man�s weight to know that he�s fat.|
								I write in order to understand as much as to be understood.|
								Never invest in any idea you can�t illustrate with a crayon.|
								I can calculate the movement of stars, but not the madness of men.|
								Everyone has a plan �till they get punched in the face.|
								Nurture your flowers and cut your weeds.|
								Nothing is a waste of time if you use the experience wisely.|
								View a stock as an ownership of the business and judge the staying quality of the business in terms of its competitive advantage.|
								It is impossible to produce a superior performance unless you do something different from the majority.|
								Read 500 pages every day.  That�s how knowledge works.  It builds up, like compound interest.  All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will.|
								Few people think more than two or three times a year; I have made an international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week.|
								Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.|
								Common sense is not so common.|
								The greatest lesson in life is to know that even fools are right sometimes.|
								Through the vicissitudes of wars, panics and depressions, investment in America�s growth and development has never proven a mistake.|
								Out of clutter, find simplicity.  From discord, find harmony.  In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.|
								If you don't have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?|
								Every age has its peculiar folly: some scheme, project, or fantasy which it plunges, spurred on by the love of gain, the necessity of excitement, or the mere force of imitation.|
								Most of the time common stocks are subject to irrational and excessive price fluctuation in both directions as a consequence of the ingrained tendency of most people to speculate or gamble�to give way to hope, fear and greed.|
								Success is a lousy teacher.  It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.|
								If you have integrity, nothing else matters.  If you don�t have integrity, nothing else matters.

This flag by Thomas Moser in our office reminds us that there is innovation all over America, not just in Silicon Valley.  We think that the United States has a superior economic system and investing in American businesses has been an excellent strategy for over three hundred years and will continue to be a terrific approach for many decades to come.  As detailed in our Summer 2015 investment letter, we believe the future of American business is bright. In addition, while we cannot control how the market values the businesses we own at any given point in time, what we 
							can control is to always do our absolute best 
							to provide the finest client service.
