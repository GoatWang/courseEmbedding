Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Enterprises Inc carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Enterprises Inc currently holds license 253591, 446990, 496138 (General Building Contractor, Painting And Decorating, Contractor, General), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Enterprises Inc



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Enterprises Inc



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
Enterprises Inc has a $12,500 bond with Old Republic Surety Company. 











What else should I know before hiring Enterprises Inc



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

What is Medigap Insurance (a.k.a. Medicare Supplement)?
When an American citizen turns 65 years of age, they have the option to enroll in Medicare (they may also qualify before the age of 65 if they are eligible for disability benefits). Basic Medicare, which includes Parts A and B, cover most of your basic hospital and doctor expenses, respectively. Unfortunately, "most" does not mean "all". The expenses which Medicare does not cover - sometimes referred to as "gaps" in coverage - are what Medigap insurance protects you from. It is a private plan designed to cover the medical expenses where Traditional Medicare falls short of the mark.
Who is Eligible for Medigap Insurance?
If any of the following scenarios apply to you, then you are already guaranteed "eligible" to purchase Medicare supplemental insurance:

You are currently covered under Medicare Parts A & B
You are within 6 months of turning 65
You are within 6 months of receiving Part B coverage
If you are about to lose your group health insurance plan

Please note that you may still be required to answer some medical questions about your overall health and wellness. For further clarification, or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at (888)-565-8918. Give us a call today.


When Can I Sign Up for Medigap Insurance?
Based on the convoluted rules of Medicare enrollment, many seniors mistakenly believe that signing up for Medigap is similarly complicated. The good news is that you can sign up for Medigap insurance at any time. However, there are some "sweet spot" time frames which, if you apply during those opportunities, will make the process much easier:

The Initial Enrollment Period. During your first 6 months of Part B coverage, your acceptance is guaranteed, regardless of your current level of health
The "Guaranteed Issue" Period. If you are on the verge of losing coverage through an employer, you will have a "guaranteed issue" period lasting 63 days where you can purchase any Medigap policy with no health questions asked.

If you apply for Medicare supplement at any point outside of these time frames, you will likely have to go through the complicated process of medical underwriting and answering lots of invasive health questions. To learn more, and to get help going through the process, call us today at (888)-565-8918
Who Purchases Medigap Insurance?
It doesn't matter whether you're struggling to get by, on a fixed income, or enjoying incredible wealth in your golden years - all seniors from all walks of life can benefit from a Medicare supplement insurance policy. Medicare provides standard coverage to every beneficiary, regardless of income. What it does not provide, however, is 100% coverage of your medical costs. Therefore, the more vulnerable you are to the gaps in Medicare coverage, the more you can benefit from the protection of a Medigap policy.
Where Do I Purchase Medigap Insurance?
You, as a consumer, have a variety of options. While some prefer to look up nearby agents in their local Yellow Pages, the truth is that you'll get the best deal by doing your research and shopping around online. With the power of the internet, you can get more and better offers from several major companies who are all competing for your business.
You could contact each and every individual agency by yourself and spend hours filling out the same redundant online forms for quotes, or you can let us do all of the busy work for you. Compare multiple plans, prices, and agencies by filling out our one, simple online quote form today. We can help you get the best possible deal on virtually any available Medigap policy.
Important Fact: How to Save Money!
All 10 available Medicare Supplement Plans are standardized by Medicare - this means that each plan offers identical benefits, regardless of where you live or what company is handling your policy. Therefore, the only difference is in price. And the best way to get the best price is to compare plans online and save!

Our website is ranked in the top 5 out of thousands of Medicare insurance comparison websites. If you are ready to start your free quote today, we can help.
What is a Medicare Advantage Plan (a.k.a. Medicare Part C)?
Medicare Advantage is a private health insurance policy, underwritten by a private health insurance company, which replaces your Medicare coverage. With a Medicare Advantage plan, only the private company is responsible for paying your medical claims - the government is no longer responsible for those expenses. Legally, the private company has to provide you with "equal or better" coverage than what you would get under Original Medicare Parts A & B. Some plans go above and beyond Original Medicare by offering consumers additional benefits, such as vision, dental, and more. 
Who is Eligible for Medicare Advantage Plan?
If you are thinking about purchasing a Medicare Advantage plan, you can rest assured that you are highly likely to be accepted if:

You are currently covered under Medicare Parts A & B
You are within 6 months of turning 65
You are within 6 months of receiving Part B coverage
If you are about to lose your group health insurance plan

You may be able to apply during other times, but you will likely have to answer a lot of questions about your current health status. And even if you apply during any of the opportune time frames mentioned above, a company can still reject you for serious health conditions (such as kidney failure).

Who Purchases Medicare Advantage Plans?
Seniors from all walks of life can benefit from a Medicare Advantage policy. It really doesn't matter what level of income you have to work with. The reason for this is because Original Medicare only covers so much in the first place - there are still significant "gaps" in coverage which you will have to pay for out of pocket if you do not purchase additional insurance. And there are some Medicare Advantage plans that are available for zero premiums, which everyone can afford. 
Where Do I Purchase Medicare Advantage?
There are several different roads you can take, but we find that the best option is to shop around online for a Medicare Advantage policy. The internet is full of helpful information on potential companies, policies, and prices so that you can find the best possible option to suit your medical needs. Our company works with many of the top agencies in the market, and we can use those connections to help you get the Medicare Advantage policy that you require.

Important Fact: How to Save Money!


What is the Difference between Medicare Supplement Insurance and Medicare Advantage?
Although it can be easy to confuse the two, Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage insurance policies are two completely different plans. It is essential that seniors learn the difference between them. Here are some of the key differences to keep in mind:
Medigap

A private policy that works secondary to your government Medicare benefits
You keep the same doctors, networks, co-pays, and deductibles as Medicare
Low (or zero) out of pocket costs beyond the monthly premium

Medicare Advantage

A private policy that completely replaces your government Medicare benefits
Your doctors, networks, co-pays, and deductibles will likely be different from Medicare
Potentially high out of pocket costs, in addition to the monthly premium

What is Medigap Insurance (a.k.a. Medicare Supplement)?
When an American citizen turns 65 years of age, they have the option to enroll in Medicare (they may also qualify before the age of 65 if they are eligible for disability benefits). Basic Medicare, which includes Parts A and B, cover most of your basic hospital and doctor expenses, respectively. Unfortunately, "most" does not mean "all". The expenses which Medicare does not cover - sometimes referred to as "gaps" in coverage - are what Medigap insurance protects you from. It is a private plan designed to cover the medical expenses where Traditional Medicare falls short of the mark.
Who is Eligible for Medigap Insurance?
If any of the following scenarios apply to you, then you are already guaranteed "eligible" to purchase Medicare supplemental insurance:

You are currently covered under Medicare Parts A & B
You are within 6 months of turning 65
You are within 6 months of receiving Part B coverage
If you are about to lose your group health insurance plan

Please note that you may still be required to answer some medical questions about your overall health and wellness. For further clarification, or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at (888)-565-8918. Give us a call today.


When Can I Sign Up for Medigap Insurance?
Based on the convoluted rules of Medicare enrollment, many seniors mistakenly believe that signing up for Medigap is similarly complicated. The good news is that you can sign up for Medigap insurance at any time. However, there are some "sweet spot" time frames which, if you apply during those opportunities, will make the process much easier:

The Initial Enrollment Period. During your first 6 months of Part B coverage, your acceptance is guaranteed, regardless of your current level of health
The "Guaranteed Issue" Period. If you are on the verge of losing coverage through an employer, you will have a "guaranteed issue" period lasting 63 days where you can purchase any Medigap policy with no health questions asked.

If you apply for Medicare supplement at any point outside of these time frames, you will likely have to go through the complicated process of medical underwriting and answering lots of invasive health questions. To learn more, and to get help going through the process, call us today at (888)-565-8918
Who Purchases Medigap Insurance?
It doesn't matter whether you're struggling to get by, on a fixed income, or enjoying incredible wealth in your golden years - all seniors from all walks of life can benefit from a Medicare supplement insurance policy. Medicare provides standard coverage to every beneficiary, regardless of income. What it does not provide, however, is 100% coverage of your medical costs. Therefore, the more vulnerable you are to the gaps in Medicare coverage, the more you can benefit from the protection of a Medigap policy.
Where Do I Purchase Medigap Insurance?
You, as a consumer, have a variety of options. While some prefer to look up nearby agents in their local Yellow Pages, the truth is that you'll get the best deal by doing your research and shopping around online. With the power of the internet, you can get more and better offers from several major companies who are all competing for your business.
You could contact each and every individual agency by yourself and spend hours filling out the same redundant online forms for quotes, or you can let us do all of the busy work for you. Compare multiple plans, prices, and agencies by filling out our one, simple online quote form today. We can help you get the best possible deal on virtually any available Medigap policy.
Important Fact: How to Save Money!
All 10 available Medicare Supplement Plans are standardized by Medicare - this means that each plan offers identical benefits, regardless of where you live or what company is handling your policy. Therefore, the only difference is in price. And the best way to get the best price is to compare plans online and save!
