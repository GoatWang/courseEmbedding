George R Osborne
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Alaska:













Does George R Osborne carry a valid contracting license?



In Alaska, most contractors that perform residential home improvements must be licensed by the Division of Corporations, Business and Professional Licensing.
George R Osborne currently holds license RESR564, 564 (Residential Contractor Endorsement, Is A Holder Of This Residential Contractor Endorsement), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in Alaska?



Although Alaska does not require contractors to pass an exam, the state maintains strict insurance, bonding, and business registration.











Your liability risk when hiring George R Osborne



Contractors in Alaska are required to carry both general liability and workers' compensation insurance.











Financial recourse when hiring George R Osborne



Alaska requires all contractors to obtain a surety bond. In the event of faulty work, or a breach of contract, a homeowner may file a claim against the contractors bond.











What else should I know before hiring George R Osborne



Alaska does not run a criminal background check before licensing contractors so if this is a consideration, you can double-check their background on the Alaska Department of Public Safety Website. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development recommends that homeowners insist on a detailed written contract. A home improvement contract is a written agreement defining exactly what work will be performed, the materials used, the start and completion dates, the total cost of the project, and a payment schedule.
